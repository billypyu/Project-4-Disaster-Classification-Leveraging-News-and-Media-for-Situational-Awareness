JENNIFER FINNEY BOYLAN,"At first, our family embraced the spectacle with some excitement — school was closed, and the four of us realized we had to depend on ourselves to make it through the storm. We fired up our stoves, chopped wood, moved perishables from the dead refrigerator to the front porch. It was like camping, with furniture. In those days our young sons had a well-established routine for the final couple of hours of the day — after dinner and a bath, they’d watch “Rugrats” on television or a few other shows, including National Geographic’s “Geo Kids,” an educational program featuring a talking galago and a grumpy old chameleon named Uncle Balzac. Now, however, the television was dark, along with the rest of the freezing house. Instead, we read books by candlelight. We played cards. We wore union suits and woolen sweaters and squirrel-fur hats. At one point I invented something called “Human TV,” which involved me sitting in front of the screen as my sons pointed a flashlight at the television, illuminating me. I mounted a live-action version of their evening programs. I was no Uncle Balzac, but I have to admit that there were some moments in “Human TV” that were highly entertaining, not the least of which was my rendition of the chameleon’s song about its changing colors. My sons thought this was more entertaining than the Ringling Bros. circus. In short order they insisted on climbing off the sofa and joining me, leaving my spouse sitting on the couch shining a flashlight on the three of us with a look of fear and wonder. As our second week in the dark began, I saw a line of National Guard trucks rolling into town, and something about it filled me with such an overwhelming sense of our vulnerability, and the fragility of human life, that tears spilled over my eyelashes and ran down my face. On another day, I took Zach to a nearby golf course to go sledding. Just to get to the big hill at the course we had to walk through a frozen archway of trees, and as we did, limbs snapped and fell upon the ice all around us. My son looked at me and said, “Are you sure this is safe?” I didn’t know what to tell him. I wasn’t sure of anything. We climbed to the top of the hill, and we piled into the toboggan. Then we pushed off. I’ll never forget that ride, my arms around my child, the two of us rushing down the hill at a speed that, all these years later, I am willing to admit was probably way too fast. It seemed to last forever, the two of us just gliding. Blinding sunlight reflected off the ice. The frozen air rushed against our cheeks. Whenever I think of my son, now grown and several years out of college, I think of us on that sled. In the wake of the bomb cyclone this week, I fear there will be other families trapped, as we were, in the dark and the cold. I pray that we all make it to the other side of this new storm safe and sound. But I also hope that some people are able, fleetingly, to find what our family found 20 years ago, which was that being cut off from civilization — for a little while, anyway — brought us closer together. When our lights finally came back on, on Day 11, we looked around our house at the almost inconceivable mess it had become during our time in the dark. Dishes were piled high in the sink; the floor was littered with wood chips and dirt. But my son’s first reaction to the restoration of civilization was a look of disappointment. “What?” I said. “Aren’t you glad we have power again?” “Yeah,” Zach said. “But I’m going to miss ‘Human TV.’” That night, we turned off the lamps in the den again, and my sons and I imitated the voices of a galago and a chameleon. My spouse looked on in wonder, shining a light upon us in the dark.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"But let’s get you through the next few hours. Here’s what you need to know for your morning commute: • Subways and Long Island Rail Road are running with normal service. • Metro-North Railroad is running on a reduced schedule. The last Hudson Line train from the city will leave Grand Central at 7:59 p.m. • New Jersey Transit has implemented a limited weekday rail schedule and is cross-honoring tickets for rail, buses and private carriers, but not for PATH or NY Waterway ferries. Bus service in North and Central New Jersey may be suspended this afternoon. • Bridges and tunnels are open, and Seastreak and NYC Ferry are operating normally, but may experience delays. • A travel advisory is in effect for all areas east of Interstate 81, essentially, the entire eastern half of New York State. • Amtrak is operating on a modified schedule in the Northeast Corridor. • Check your flight at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark before you head to the airport. Around 500 flights have been canceled at the three airports so far. The storm should blanket the city unevenly, said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Northern Manhattan and the Bronx are expecting seven to 11 inches; Northern Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island should get seven to nine inches; and Southern Queens is looking at four to seven. “The other wrinkle is that there’s a slight chance of thunder this afternoon,” Mr. Maloit said. “If we get it, anyone who’s underneath the thunder snow could get a rate of two to four inches of snow an hour.” Generally, the snow is going to be heavy, wet and mixed with rain in some areas, Mr. Maloit added. (So pull on your winter boots and pack an extra pair of socks.) Wind gusts are expected to reach 45 miles an hour, well below the destructive gusts seen in Friday’s storm, when eight people were killed and more than two million were left without power. (More than 9,000 customers in the city and Westchester still don’t have power.) A costal flood advisory is in effect along Jamaica Bay. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a storm assistance hotline to update the public on shelters, warming shelters and power outages. New Yorkers can call (886) 697-2434 for help. Travel safely this morning.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice. The Arctic is no stranger to cyclones, but the latest no-name storm, which emerged in the Kara sea north of Siberia, has garnered attention both for its size and timing. The storm’s central pressure (a measure of its strength) bottomed out Thursday at about 966 millibars, placing it par with the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012, one of the most extreme summertime storms in recent memory. That storm reached a minimum central pressure 963-966 millibars, depending on which analysis you trust. The new storm’s occurrence in June is also noteworthy. Big cyclones like this don’t normally start hitting the Arctic until late summer. The Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 spun up in August as did a major storm in 2016. “Preliminarily, this storm could rank in the Top 10 for Arctic Cyclones in June as well as for the summer (June through August) in strength,” Steven Cavallo, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther via email. Xiangdong Zhang, a scientist at the International Arctic Research Center who specializes in Arctic cyclones, cited a few factors responsible for the storm’s formation, including low sea ice cover in the North Atlantic which has increased the amount of heat in the atmosphere, a strong temperature gradient between land and sea, and the stratospheric polar vortex, an area of low pressure just above the storm. “The downward intrusion of this polar vortex intensified [the] storm,” Zhang told Earther via email. The no-name storm reached peak photogenicity yesterday, with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration capturing a stunning high-resolution image. While your typical late-season Arctic cyclones are notorious for chewing up sea ice, what this early season beast will mean for ice remains to be seen. “This storm is very quick-moving and occurring earlier in the season,” University of California, Irvine Ph.D. candidate Zack Labe told Earther via Twitter direct message. “Its impacts to sea ice are likely not comparable to these other strong cyclones that have occurred later in the summer.” Labe noted that early summer storms can favor cooler, cloudier conditions, slowing down the loss of sea ice, which typically bottoms out in September. However, he added that a storm of this strength “may precondition the ice for easier melt later in the season.” Zhang said that due to the storm’s location, it can transport more sea ice out of the Arctic through the passage between Greenland and Svalbard known as the Fram Straight. “This will contribute to Arctic sea ice decrease, in particular thick ice,” he said. Storm or no, it’s been a weird, bad year for Arctic sea ice so far. After limping along all winter, Bering sea ice was basically gone by May, months ahead of schedule. Even before this storm, sea ice around Svalbard was looking more like it should in September. Overall, Arctic sea ice extent for May was at its second-lowest on record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s latest monthly sea ice report released on June 6. The role of rising temperatures in driving down sea ice is well established. But there’s also growing evidence that climate change could fuel more ice-shredding cyclones. Research going back to the early 2000s suggests Arctic cyclone activity is on the rise. And a study published in April concluded that these storms will become more frequent and intense in the future as the contrast between land and sea temperatures continues to rise.","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice.

George Dvorsky,"Evidence of an unusually strong solar storm that hit Earth in 660 BCE has been detected in Greenland ice coresa finding which shows we still have lots to learn about these disruptive events.
An extreme form of solar storm, known as a solar proton event (SPE), struck our planet 2,679 years ago, according to new research published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. If an event of such magnitude were to happen today, it would likely wreak havoc on our technological infrastructure, including communications and navigation. Lund University geologist Raimund Muscheler and his colleagues presented evidence in the form of elevated levels of beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 isotopes embedded within ancient Greenland ice cores.
Its now the third massive SPE known to scientists, the others occurring 1,245 and 1,025 years ago. This latest discovery means solar storms of this variety are likely happening more frequently than we thoughtperhaps once every 1,000 yearsbut more data is required to create more reliable estimates.
SPEs happen in the wake of a massive solar flare or coronal mass ejection on the Sun. These stellar events send streams of particles, including high-energy protons, toward Earth, where they interact with the Earths atmosphere, triggering reactions that increase the rate of radionuclide production, including carbon-14, beryllium-10, and chlorine-36 (radionuclides are unstable atoms with excess nuclear energy). Traditionally, SPEs have been detected as spikes of carbon-14 in tree rings, but they can also be spotted as spikes of beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 in ancient ice cores. The authors of the new study said scientists tend to overemphasize carbon-14 at the expense of searching for other markers, and that efforts to find [SPEs] based solely on [carbon-14] data likely lead to an underestimated number of such potentially devastating events for our society.
SPEs are capable of temporarily degrading the Earths ozone layer, which allows excessive amounts of ultraviolet radiation to reach the ground. This is (moderately) bad for lifeforms on the surface, but its not the kind of thing that could trigger a mass extinction. As a risk, SPEs are a much bigger problem in terms of how they would affect our technologies; a sufficiently strong SPE poses a threat to modern society in terms of communication and navigation systems, space technologies, and commercial aircraft operations, according to the new study. These extreme space weather events could also be catastrophic for astronauts working in the International Space Station, who arent shielded by Earths atmosphere. 
Importantly, SPEs are not to be confused with geomagnetic storms, which are a related, but distinct, phenomenon. 
SPEs have been detected before, including events in Quebec (1989) and Sweden (2003) but the the newly discovered storm appears to have been stronger than anything seen with our modern instruments over the past 70 years. Indeed, we now have the tools to detect these events as they happen. For the new study, Muscheler and his colleagues analyzed two Greenland ice cores, finding spikes of both beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 in ice dated at 2,679 years oldevidence consistent with an SPE.
We think that we could exclude other suggested hypotheses for such increases, such as supernova explosions or gamma ray bursts, Muscheler told Gizmodo. The team also found increased values of carbon-14 in trees rings that correspond to the 660 BCE event, which is to our knowledge only consistent with the effects of a solar proton event, he said. 
So thats three extreme PCEs in the past 2,700 years (that we know of)an observation consistent with an occurrence rate of one every 1,000 years. But while this inference is a tempting one to make, Muscheler said we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions owing to a dearth of data. 
I think the statistical bases for occurrence rate estimates is very weak, he said. We now have three of such events660 BCE, 775 AD and a slightly weaker one at 993 ADbut to say that these occur on average every 1,000 years would be very speculative. We will need more high-resolution carbon-14, beryllium-10, and chlorine-36 data to get this occurrence rate more robustly. To which he added: We have only a very short window into the Suns behavior by our observations and measurements over the last 70 years, but as the new research makes clear, the Sun can produce much more powerful eventsthis has to be included in todays risk analyses.
No doubt, more examples of similar events in Earths history would be helpful. To that end, Muscheler is in Bern, Switzerland right now trying to acquire new high-resolution samples for this very purpose. Until more is known, however, its best to prepare, creating technologies and systems capable of withstanding these extremeyet disturbingly frequentstellar events.

Patrick Allan,"A massive, super cold storm is set to slam into the East later this week thanks to a process known as “bombogenesis,” and it’s going to have a massive impact on air travel. If you’re flying later this week, you might want to think of a backup plan, or at least pack a nice long book. Next time you go to book a flight you might want to look at the early-morning options first.… Read more Read According to the NOAA, bombogenesis is term used by meteorologists to describe the process of a cyclone that rapidly intensifies as it drops in atmospheric pressure (also known as a “bomb cyclone). In this case, it’s because there’s cold air from the land colliding with warm air over the ocean water. Think of it as a winter hurricane. It sounds scary, but it’s actually pretty common, especially on the East Coast where this type of thing occurs almost every year, albeit usually on a smaller scale. Unfortunately, this particular storm is shaping up to be a pretty big one, and freezing temperatures, massive blizzards, tons of ice, and high-speed winds are going to make it really hard for planes to fly and for airports to keep things running smoothly. This probably isn’t going to go too well. If you have a flight in or out of any airports on the East Coast—from Florida’s Tallahassee International (TLH) all the way up to Maine’s Bangor International (BGR)—you should contact your airline immediately and see what’s going on. Many airlines are preparing for major delays and cancellations, but they’re also offering travel waivers to passengers in case you’d like to change your flights to a later date at no additional cost. These airlines include Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, United, and more. JT Genter at The Points Guy blog has a thorough list of what each airline is offering for this particular weather event. It’s important you take some initiative here and contact your airline so you know the specifics for your flight itinerary, but it’s also helpful if you can be flexible and delay your trip. Delays are all but guaranteed, and cancellations are definitely possible as well. Keep in mind that when you bought a ticket you agreed that the airline is not responsible for paying for your food or hotel stays in the event of weather-related delays or cancellations. Be prepared for the worst to happen and plan accordingly.

"Judson Jones and Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)A winter storm will unload a messy mix of heavy snow, strong winds and frigid temperatures across parts of the Midwest and Northeast over the weekend. 
About 115 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. Snow will start Saturday evening in Boston and New York, which will then turn into a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. 
The National Weather Service in New York is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of sleet and snow plus possible ice. New York may warm up enough for rain Sunday morning, but freezing is expected by the evening when temperatures plummet. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state will begin Saturday at 3 p.m. ET. Amtrak will operate a modified service Saturday and Sunday due to the weather, it said. 
Thousands of flights canceled
Travel through Sunday will be affected, with nearly 2,000 flights involving domestic airports canceled, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, closed for several hours after a Southwest Airlines flight went off a runway while taxiing. The airliner slid onto a runway overrun area, Southwest Airlines said. 
None of the 150 passengers and six crew members was injured, the airline said. 
The storm system is associated with the same upper-level energy as one on the West Coast that dumped rain in Los Angeles and elsewhere as well as caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Blowing and drifting snow
The second storm will exit the Rockies and likely will begin to drop snow across Kansas over the weekend. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of a storm last week-- will get less accumulation this time. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could face through the weekend. Both cities may get more than half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, snow to the north and ice and snow across the states' centers. 
Icing is possible in New England
This second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up at least 6 to 12 inches deep, with some icing for added misery.
The Interstate 95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will form, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning Saturday at noon. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
Deep chill across the United States 
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough for rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. It's expected to happen so fast it would instantly freeze any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"If the forecast holds, this could be the biggest spring snowstorm in our city’s history. New York City’s largest snowstorm after the vernal equinox was on April 3, 1915, when 10 inches fell. For those lamenting spring’s slow arrival, note that things could be worse. The latest in the season that New York had substantial snowfall was on April 25 (in 1875), when three inches fell on Central Park. And a trace fell on May 29, in 1995. This nor’easter is forecast to drop more snow on New York City than the previous storms this month, the last of which killed two people and left hundreds of thousands in the region without power. Power failures are possible throughout the day. Like earlier this month, we could see some thundersnow, and lots of sleet. What is sleet, exactly? “Sometimes what happens is that, in between a cloud that’s producing snowflakes and the ground, you get a layer of warm air,” Mr. Homenuk said. “The snowflake from the cloud melts into a raindrop in the warm layer, and then passes back into freezing air, and then it refreezes into like an ice pellet.” (Unlike freezing rain, which freezes after it hits the ground.) “When it’s sleeting, you will know,” he added. “Sleet stings. It pings you. It’s not as gentle as a snowflake.” Here’s what else is happening:","Wednesday: The latest on the storm heading toward New York City, and how it could affect your commute.",2018-03-21T09:43:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Spring Snowstorm,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/nyregion/new-york-snowstorm-spring.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/21/nyregion/21nytoday1/21nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,ice storm,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In the 18th-century English ballad The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a storm drives a sailors ship toward the South Pole, where he encounters all manner of fantastical sights, including floating icebergs as green as emerald. It may sound like author Samuel Coleridge was taking some poetic license, but emerald-colored icebergs are a real thingand more than 200 years after that ballad was inked, scientists might know what causes them.
A study published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans revisits the longstanding mystery of green icebergs, which sea captains have been reporting for nearly a century if not longer. While early work by the same authors suggested green icebergs got their coloration from carbon, new data made them revise their thinking. Now, they suspect that iron-oxide minerals are responsible for dyeing the bergs to look like theyre ready for a St. Patricks Day party.
If true, these iron-rich bergs could represent an important source of a crucial nutrient for the vast Southern Ocean encircling Antarctica.
Theres a lot of interest in where the iron [in the Southern Ocean] is coming from, lead study author Steve Warren, a geophysicist and emeritus professor at the University of Washington, told Earther. If it can get into marine ice, these bergs can travel hundreds of miles.
Warrens experience with green icebergs dates back to 1988, when he joined an Australian expedition to Antarctica as part of his first sabbatical. By lucky chance when the crew reached Mawson research station on the west side of East Antarcticas Amery Ice Shelf, they docked right near a rather striking iceberg that had become trapped in sea ice. 
The iceberg, Warren explained, was jade green and remarkably clear. Its clarity told the researchers they were dealing with marine ice, or ice that forms from seawater freezing at the bottom of a floating ice shelf. While the glacial ice that forms over land through the compaction of snow is opaque thanks to the presence of countless air pockets, marine ice does not contain light-reflecting air bubbles, making it see-through.
Typically, marine ice takes on a deep blue color, reflecting the distance photons of light have to travel before getting absorbed. Clearly, there was something else present in this jade-colored berg. Samples of the iceberg were collected, analyzed in the lab, and found to contain dissolved organic matter (DOM), which can produce green and yellow colors along coastlines as rivers dump tiny bits of organic material into the sea. And so the researchers hypothesized that DOM was responsible.
But in 1996, a new wrinkle to that story emerged, when Warren returned to a different part of the Amery Ice Shelf for his second sabbatical, and once again found himself confronted with a glacier of unusual hue. This one was a chimera of blue, green, and yellow-green marine ice glommed on to white glacial ice. When the berg was analyzed for DOM, both the green and blue ice were found to contain similar levels, suggesting something else was responsible for the color difference.
It was a nagging concern we didnt know what to do about, until two years ago, a paper came out of Tasmania showing large amounts of iron in marine ice collected from the bottom of a drill hole, Warren explained.
Warren and his colleagues now hypothesize that iron-oxide minerals are the culprit behind the green icebergs theyve encountered. If true, those iron-bearing minerals are likely the result of glacial flour, basically dust formed by the erosion of bedrock.
Scripps Institution of Oceanography glaciologist Helen Amanda Fricker, who studied the Amery Ice Shelfs marine ice layer as part of her PhD work and has encountered emerald bergs herself, said that the new paper offered a possible, plausible mechanism for their coloration. 
The ice shelf water [that forms marine ice] has come from the grounding line, Fricker said, referring the point where a glacier pops off the bedrock its tethered to and becomes a floating ice shelf. A lot of it probably still has sediment in it.
Still, more research is needed to be sure these giant ice popsicles are iron-flavored. Warren said he and his colleagues submitted a proposal to travel back to the Amery Ice Shelf in search of more jade bergs next spring. Hes hopeful their potential valueas a sort of dietary supplement supporting the Southern Oceans food chainhelps the group secure a grant.
After all, if that hunch is correct, a climate change-induced shift in the number of green icebergs out there could have far-reaching consequences.
The reason we might get funding [is], they might actually be important, Warren said.","In the 18th-century English ballad The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a storm drives a sailor’s ship toward the South Pole, where he encounters all manner of fantastical sights, including floating icebergs “as green as emerald.” It may sound like author Samuel …",2019-03-06T19:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Scientists Might Finally Know Why Some Icebergs Are Bright Green,https://earther.gizmodo.com/scientists-might-finally-know-why-some-icebergs-are-bri-1833075368,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dGG6KiTX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/its2qs0z6fs7toa6pnze.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,ice storm,1
KATE TAYLOR,"The Arctic air moving in behind the storm was expected to deliver freezing temperatures as far south as Tallahassee, Fla., and to snarl travel across most of the Northeast, even in areas where the storm dropped little or no snow.
Anything that remains liquid is going to freeze rather quickly, so there will be dangerous travel conditions, said Rich Otto, a meteorologist at the National Weather Services Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Md.
More than 10,000 people in Connecticut were without power on Sunday morning, according to Eversource and United Illuminating, two utility companies, in large part because so much of the storms precipitation in the state had come in the form of sleet or freezing rain. Mr. Otto said that the trouble could multiply as the frigid winds pick up during the day.
Those kind of winds blowing on those power lines and trees that are already stressed from the weight of the ice, I think, is going to be problematic, he said.

SETH FREED WESSLER,"One of the few Trump-era denaturalization cases that has received substantial press attention, that of Norma Borgoño, a 64-year-old secretary and grandmother who was naturalized in 2007, is also facing civil counts, with the same lower burden of proof. The case stems from an ICE investigation that is unrelated to Janus. Four years after becoming a citizen, she pleaded guilty to assisting her boss defraud a bank and cooperated in the investigation. In May 2018 she found herself facing denaturalization, following a probe by Homeland Security Investigations. The Office of Immigration Litigation claimed that Borgoño should have alerted U.S.C.I.S. to her role in the ongoing crime when she applied for citizenship even though its plausible she may not have been aware, at that point, that she was participating in a crime.
At this point youd be disrupting an American family, Leon Rodriguez, who served as the head of U.S.C.I.S. during the later part of the Obama administration, told me of cases like Borgoños and Durelands. What do we gain as a society from that? Sessions will talk about sound principles of asylum, but, truly, what do we gain from doing this?
Throughout Odette Durelands trial, her lawyer maintained her innocence. But she also argued that even if the jury believed Dureland had applied for asylum under a different name, it shouldnt matter. Odette had become a citizen through her husbands application, moving from asylee to green-card holder to citizen based on fully adjudicated claims. If Dureland became a citizen through a process that would be unproblematic were it not for this supposed Alindor application, why should that now affect her right to remain in the United States?
The jury was unconvinced. The government had shown evidence that Dureland has relatives named Alindor, and that various details on the Alindor application looked similar to those on the one she later filed. The jury found Dureland guilty of criminal naturalization fraud. The integrity of our nations legal immigration system is paramount, the acting director of U.S.C.I.S. in Tampa said in a press statement after the conviction. This conviction sends a clear message that attempting to fraudulently obtain United States citizenship will not be tolerated. Our nations citizens deserve nothing less. The judge sentenced Dureland to five months in prison. The conviction automatically led to Durelands losing her citizenship.
After serving her sentence, Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved her to a detention center in August, with plans to deport her. She spent a month there before Gilbert managed to scrape together $10,000 for bond. The couple has hired an immigration attorney, who says he will try to convince an immigration judge that she should be allowed, effectively, to start the immigration process again, to obtain a new green card as the wife of a citizen or the mother of a citizen in the military. But lawyers familiar with denaturalization cases say that because she has been convicted of a crime, its unlikely shell prevail. Without a judges approval, ICE will almost certainly deport her.
In September, I sat with Dureland and her family at their home. A bowl of star fruit, picked from the tree outside, sat on the table. Dureland held her head up with her hands, her elbows resting on the table. Her eyes were heavy. Less than two days before, she was released from federal immigration detention.I didnt know if I would come home again, Dureland told me, standing beside her 15-year-old son, Gethro. She placed her hand on the top of her sons head, which he rested on her shoulder. She liked to pretend, before she was locked up, that she and her youngest child were the same height, but he had grown in the six months that she was away; there was no more pretending. She laughed. But despite her easygoing demeanor with her son, Dureland was weary from her time in detention, and she told me she needed to nap. When I returned a few hours later, the house was filled with the smell of spices and cooked onions. It had been six months since Dureland had made a meal. I missed my kitchen, she said.
She sat back down at the table. Detention was a scary place, Dureland told me. When I got there, everybody was being deported. And I was thinking, I have nobody in Haiti. If I were deported to Haiti, I would be by myself.
Before she became a citizen, Dureland always knew that if something happened, if she were convicted of some crime, say, she could be deported. She lived a careful life. When she took the oath in 2012, that feeling that it could be taken away finally disappeared. I became an American, Dureland said. I am an American. But even as she said it, she knew it was no longer true.",The prosecution of naturalized United States citizens is a sign of a gathering storm.,2018-12-19T15:32:57Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Is Denaturalization the Next Front in the Trump Administration’s War on Immigration?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/magazine/naturalized-citizenship-immigration-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/23/magazine/23mag-Denaturalization-slide-RDD7/23mag-Denaturalization-slide-RDD7-facebookJumbo.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,ice storm,1
MITCH SMITH,"CHICAGO Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.
If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.
Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.
Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways. In Minnehaha County, S.D., which includes Sioux Falls, the sheriffs office posted a photo of a car washed off the road. In Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, near Sioux City, residents were asked to conserve their water use because all the draining water is inundating our sewer system.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Where it happens, dangerous travel conditions and power outages are possible. Winter storm watches and advisories already are in place for more than 12 million people in portions of states from New Mexico to North Carolina. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: Friday morning through Saturday evening Precipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Snow, ice and f looding rain Snowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Nearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots. Oklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most Arkansans won't feel precipitation until later Friday, with winter weather beginning in the overnight hours and moving east Saturday morning toward Tennessee. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix Significant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a ""once-in-a-generation event."" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow. While most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon. Snow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" or ""the wedge"" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a ""warm nose"" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the ""'wedge,"" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85.

Russians are marvelling at rare ice walls - in places 5m (16ft) high - towering on the shores of the Gulf of Finland near St Petersburg. 
They were created by storms lashing the region in recent days. 
Such phenomena are more characteristic of Russia's Arctic far east. 
The walls are formed when a storm exerts sideways pressure on thick ice covering a sea, river or lake. The ice is bad news for seals, though, as it can cut them off from the sea.
A conservation group - the Baltic Seal Foundation - is urging Russians to alert it to any stranded seals found in the region. Some have been spotted from helicopters.

 This baby weighs just 13.5kg (30 pounds) but needs to reach 40kg to survive independently
One baby grey seal, just a few days old, was rescued last week and is doing well now, the group reports, with a video on vKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook. 
The seal, swaddled in blankets, is fed five times a day with a pipette. It got stranded in Gakkovo, a coastal village near Estonia.

"Mike Damanskis on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","If we don’t pump the brakes on climate change, all of Greenland could eventually melt, adding about 24 feet to global sea levels. Add in the West Antarctic ice sheet, and we’re looking at a total of about 40 feet of potential sea level rise from these two ice sheets alone. The question is, when is this going to happen? In a few hundred years, or a few thousand? NASA’s on a mission to find out, and that includes an effort to study melting ice in Greenland that began in the summer of 2015. Appropriately, it’s called OMG—Oceans Melting Greenland. Over a 5 year period, OMG is gathering temperature data, mapping the seafloor, and modeling the ocean currents that accelerate the melt. OMG gathers much of its data from 240 probes dropped from a military plane around Greenland. The mission also uses ships to collect measurements of the depth and shape of the sea floor, and it’s even teaming up scientists at the University of Washington that use narwhals in their research. Turns out, narwhals like to hang out in the deep waters near glaciers, so they’ve been equipped with temperature and salinity monitors that send data back to NASA. According to Josh Willis, the lead scientist at OMG, ”Every time we make a big discovery in Greenland, we find out that the probability of a really fast collapse of the Greenland ice sheet is higher than we previously expected.” Not only is the ice melting from rising air temperatures, it’s also melting from below. Glaciers are basically rivers of ice—and like rivers, they flow downstream into the ocean. Near Greenland, they often flow into deep ocean water—sometimes as deep as 800 meters—giving the glaciers a nice warm Atlantic bath to accelerate their melt. Over the past 15 years, Greenland has lost about 4 trillion tons of ice, contributing about a centimeter to global sea level rise. Not much so far, but the truth is that Greenland is just getting started. And the ice sheet won’t have to melt completely before rising sea levels cause serious problems. As sea levels rise, storm surges from floods can reach further and further inland. With about 40 percent of the world’s population living near the coast, this could have dramatic consequences for humanity in just a few generations. So, how long until the ice sheet disappears? OMG is still collecting data to figure this out. The good news is we still have a chance to prevent warming from getting completely out of hand—and a total meltdown of the Greenland ice sheet is likely still a few centuries away.","If we don’t pump the brakes on climate change, all of Greenland could eventually melt, adding about 24 feet to global sea levels.

Andrew Freedman,"In what seems to be becoming an annual occurrence, temperatures at the North Pole are about to reach or possibly exceed the freezing point this week as the North Atlantic and the North Pacific Oceans inject unusually mild air into the Arctic. Not coincidentally, Arctic sea ice is at record low levels, with a freak disappearance of ice off the western coast of Alaska, between Alaska and Russia. This vanishing of sea ice in the Bering Sea is exposing coastal communities in Alaska to storm surge flooding from typically fierce winter storms, particularly Little Diomede Island. SEE ALSO: Gas-filled vessel barrels solo through pathetic Arctic sea ice during dead of winter Videos from the island, which straddles the border with Russia show high waves slamming into the coastline, when normally there would be a sheet of ice protecting the island from high waves during the winter. It's as if someone opened the planet's refrigerator door, causing the cold air to drain out of the normally frigid region, bringing cold to the Western U.S. and Eurasia but leaving the air within the fridge itself unusually warm. In Europe, winds known as ""The Beast from the East"" will transport frigid temperatures from Russia and Scandinavia to the west, into Germany, France, and the UK, along with potential snowfall. In part, this is because of a split in the polar vortex — that much hyped circulation of air at upper levels of the atmosphere that keeps the coldest air penned in across the Far North. One ""sister vortex"" has set up across Canada and the Western U.S., with another established in Eurasia. Many of these areas are colder than the Arctic is right now. Consider some of these startling statistics. Arctic sea ice is at its lowest observed level since the satellite era began in 1979. The magnitude and pace of the sea ice decline observed during the 21st century, along with the warming of the ocean surface throughout the region, has been shown to be unprecedented in the last 1,500 years. In the Bering Sea in particular, sea ice has been at record low levels for much of the fall and winter. As if spooked by a ghost, much of the ice that had been covering the region vanished during February, a time when it would normally be at its peak extent and thickness. Computer model projection showing a pulse of above average temperatures near the North Pole on Feb. 26, 2018. Image: weatherbell analytics. Temperatures in parts of the Arctic — including the North Pole — could rise to 45 degrees Fahrenheit above average this week. Already, the northernmost land-based weather station in Greenland, known as Cape Morris Jesup, rose above the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees Celsius, five times since Feb. 16. That weather station is just about 400 miles from the North Pole. Previously, temperatures had only exceeded the freezing point at this weather station for brief periods during February in 2011 and 2017. So far this February, temperatures exceeded 32 degrees Fahrenheit on Feb. 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21, a warm streak that is incredibly rare. The temperatures in the high Arctic, to the north of Greenland, could reach 45 degrees Fahrenheit above average early next week, at the same time as temperatures will plunge to about 35 degrees Fahrenheit below average across nearly all of Europe, from Moscow to London. Temperature anomaly projection for Europe on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2018, showing the widespread cold snap. Image: weatherbell analytics. Typically, there is a high amount of variability to Arctic weather, even in the winter when there is 24 hours of darkness, since storm systems can transport different air masses into the region that alter temperatures significantly. However, what has been happening this year is downright strange, although it's in keeping with what we'd expect to see as the Arctic warms at more than twice the rate of the rest of the world, in response to the rising amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In fact, a study published in Nature about a 2015 sudden polar warming event found that these events are growing more intense, meaning that the temperature extremes are getting more extreme, especially when compared to the overall rate of Arctic warming. Scientists studying the Arctic climate have sounded the loudest alarms about how quickly humans are altering the climate. This winter, coupled with some of the extreme warming events during the past few winter seasons, is driving that point home even further.","In what seems to be becoming an annual occurrence, temperatures at the North Pole are about to reach or possibly exceed the freezing point this week as the North Atlantic and the North Pacific Oceans inject unusually mild air into the Arctic.

For the Connecticut coast, the National Weather Service says an advisory is in effect from 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. Thursday for 1 to 3 inches of snow. ""Most of the accumulation will be on the grass, but roads should become slushy during the evening commute. Snow will change to rain in the evening,"" the NWS says. For inland sections of Fairfield, New Haven, Middlesex, and New London counties, the weather service says in its advisory that 2 to 4 inches of snow and ice is expected. ""Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions should impact the evening commute,"" the NWS says. For Hartford, Tolland and Windham counties, the weather service says, a Winter Storm Watch is in effect from Thursday afternoon through Friday morning. ""WHAT...Heavy mixed wintry precipitation possible. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches and ice accumulations of one tenth to three tenths of an inch possible. ""ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Power outages and tree damage are possible due to the ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening commute,"" the National Weather Service says. In Litchfield County, the NWS has issued a Hazardous Weather Outlook for wintry weather as the ""snow may mix with sleet, freezing rain, and plain rain Thursday night into Friday morning, especially from the Capital District south.

The evening commute home from work Thursday may be very slippery as snow is expected to be falling during this time. This is not expected to be a major storm but because it is the first time accumulating snow is expected it's going to get a lot of attention. And the fact that a period of icing is also expected it will also make this storm even more problematic. The National Weather Service has issued a Hazardous Weather Outlook for all of Connecticut. For the immediate Connecticut coastal towns, the weather service says, ""A coastal low will impact the area late Thursday afternoon into Friday evening. This will bring a wintry mix of snow and sleet late Thursday afternoon then changing to all rain Thursday night through Friday evening. Minor accumulations are expected. Although the duration of the wintry mix will be limited as the precipitation changes to all rain, some impacts appear likely at this time during the afternoon and evening commute."" For inland sections of Southern Connecticut, the weather service says, ""A coastal low will bring a wintry mix to the area late Thursday into early Friday. The Thursday evening commute will be impacted. Accumulating snow and sleet can be expected at the onset, before changing over to rain and freezing rain overnight. Hazardous travel is possible."" For Northern Connecticut, the weather service says, ""Low pressure will impact the region late Thursday into Friday with a mixture of rain, snow, sleet and ice.

Andrew Freedman,"Arctic scientists are poring over data coming in from the vast, normally frozen region, after the North Pole's version of a heat wave swept across the area for the past week. Not only was the region near the North Pole the warmest it has been during the month of February since at least the 1950s, but one of the northernmost land-based weather stations, known as Cape Morris Jesup, exceeded the freezing mark on an unprecedented nine separate days during the month. On Feb. 25, that weather station remained above freezing for about 24 hours, which is virtually unheard of during February, when there is no sunlight reaching the ground there. Arctic sea ice in the Bering Sea and to the north of Greenland actually declined during February, a time when sea ice usually expands toward its seasonal maximum in early to mid-March. SEE ALSO: 'Beast from the East' brings snow to UK, mainland Europe along with frigid temperatures Scientists interviewed for this story say that the Arctic warming event, technically known as a warm air intrusion, may be a common feature of the Arctic climate, as comparatively mild and moist air from the midlatitudes is transported north by storm systems. However, this event was not like the others, researchers said. In Greenland, monitoring stations registered unprecedented warmth at the top of the world's largest island. The recent persistence and widespread coverage of above average temperatures in the #Arctic is particularly noteworthy to me. Map shows the air temperature departure (anomaly) so far this winter (to-date). pic.twitter.com/RgaA6i22NS — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) February 26, 2018 ""I think it's fair to say that this event is unprecedented in our record — both in terms of the magnitude and (for Kap Morris Jesup at least) the duration,"" said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, in a Twitter message, using the Danish spelling for Cape Morris Jessup. ""The warm event at KMJ is not record breaking in terms of the highest ever recorded temperature in February, but that event in 2011 was very short-lived compared to what we have seen this year...,"" she said. ""A prolonged period like this has definitely not been seen before."" She said some of the warmth in northern Greenland was likely due to downsloping winds known as Foehn winds, which can increase air temperatures. But that doesn't explain the warmth in the Arctic overall, when compared to average February conditions. ""But when we look at the high Arctic overall, the temperature record since 1958 has never seen a warm spike of this magnitude in February,"" she said. ""Having said that, the last few winters have seen similar events of very warm air coming in to the Arctic, though not nearly as large in magnitude,"" Mottram said. Temperature departures from average on Feb. 26, 2018, showing the red splotch of warmth across the Arctic. Image: climate reanalyzer. ""I'm pretty surprised by quite how large the temperature anomaly is this year and how persistent."" Noting cold temperatures on the west side of Greenland, Mottram emphasized that this was a weather event that was superimposed on top of rising average temperatures in the Arctic. The rising baseline makes it easier to attain all-time record highs, like a rising basketball floor making it more likely that a player will be able to dunk the ball in the net. A study published in 2017 found that these types of warming events have been increasing in frequency and duration during winter as the Arctic continues to warm at more than twice the rate of the rest of the globe. The northerly warm airflow opened up the sea ice north of Greenland. This large open water area is very unusual. I haven't seen a similar event like this before in the almost 25 years I now work with satellite data. pic.twitter.com/RJcONASaO4 — Lars Kaleschke (@seaice_de) February 26, 2018 ""What’s exactly driving these changes is not clear, but having storm tracks move further north (i.e. the North Atlantic storm track) may be tied to the northward retreat of the ice edge,"" said Julienne Stroeve, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, in an email. ""Thus, while having temperatures exceed freezing during winter is not uncommon, but it may be becoming more common as the climate changes and the ice edge continues to retreat."" Stroeve said that it's not just summer and fall sea ice showing steep declines, but that this is occurring year round now. ""What it shows us too is that the winter sea ice is now also starting to respond as every winter now for the past 4 winters has been more extreme than the year before in terms of record low sea ice,"" she said. The Arctic heat wave — though most wouldn't consider temperatures in the mid 30s to low 40s Fahrenheit to be ""hot,"" this the Arctic in the dead of winter — has its roots in a weather system that pumped mild and unusually moist air into the Arctic from the Atlantic, while another storm system did the same from the Pacific side of the Arctic. Winds blew from the southeast off the east coast of Greenland for the past week, driving this mild and moist air northward, toward the North Pole, where temperatures were about 45 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average for this time of year. The warm air intrusion followed two other related and noteworthy weather events, a sudden warming of the stratosphere, known as a sudden stratospheric warming event, and a splitting of the polar vortex. These are both complex phenomena, but a sudden stratospheric warming event typically occurs when energy from the lower atmosphere travels upwards, and this can disrupt the area of low pressure and high westerly winds that comprise the polar vortex. One area of the vortex wound up in the Western U.S., while the other went to Eurasia, where it's helping to cause an Arctic outbreak in Europe known as the ""Beast from the East."" The net result of these events was that the ultra-cold air typically found in the Arctic during February drained out of the region, as if someone opened the Northern Hemisphere's freezer door and left it ajar. Daily 2 meter surface air temperature for the Arctic averaged above 80°N. Individual years from 1958-2017 are shown by the sequential blue/purple to yellow lines. 2018 is indicated by the red line. The white line shows the average temperature. Image: zack labe Zack Labe, a climate scientist at the University of California at Irvine, has a knack for creating compelling visuals of Arctic sea ice trends and air temperatures. His data corroborate this narrative, and this analogy, showing a sharp and persistent spike in air temperatures during February to the north of 80 degrees North Latitude. ""The duration of this warmth is remarkable and a common feature of the last several winters,"" Labe said in a Twitter message. He said that while warm air intrusions occur every winter, this one is unusual for occurring during February, lasting longer than a week, and for ""the extent/magnitude of the moisture transport into the Arctic."" ""I think the takeaway is that the dramatic wintertime warming of the Arctic continues in addition to a long-term trend in decreasing sea ice. These effects, along with others, have significant physical, environmental, social, and political consequences for the Arctic and beyond,"" he said.","Arctic scientists are poring over data coming in from the vast, normally frozen region, after the North Pole's version of a heat wave swept across the area for the past week.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, ALAN BLINDER and JOHN SCHWARTZ","With bread in hand, Mr. Perryman and Ms. Long, 32, were headed back to their home in Panama City, about a 30-minute drive south. They lived near a bayou, he said, which they feared would overflow with the storm surge. But they were still on the fence about leaving. The plan was to keep waiting and watching the news. If by Wednesday morning Michael still looked like it was going to slam straight into Panama City, then maybe they, too, would head to Dothan to bunk with relatives. As he waited to buy a 20-pound bag of ice, Mike Sanville, 64, puffed on a cigarette and said that he was also going to try to ride the storm out in Fountain, in the small house he shares with two other men. He was expecting the town to get punched hard. Its coming right at us, he said. Were dead center.

But would all three residents fit in an outhouse? Maybe, he said. No question it would be a tight fit.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN)A series of storms moving across the country will bring significant snow and ice to the north and heavy rains to the south Friday and into the weekend. 
Roughly 100 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
The storm is already affecting travel with nearly 450 flights canceled as of Friday morning, according to FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers traveling in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Major metro areas on the East Coast likely will face light snow Friday ahead of and during the morning commute. The storm should move so quickly that accumulations are expected to remain low in New York and Boston.
The second storm is associated with the same upper-level energy as the West Coast storm that has dumped inches of rain in cities such as Los Angeles and caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Snow is likely in places like Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago
The second storm exits the Rockies and will begin to drop snow late Friday across Kansas. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of last week's storm -- will see less accumulation with this system. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will help enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could see through the weekend. Both could see over half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, inches of snow to the north and ice and snow across the central portions of the states. 
Significant icing event is possible along I-95 corridor through New England
The second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. It's unclear on the timing of what type of precipitation is expected for metro areas in the Northeast.
This situation is reminiscent of an event earlier in the season when forecast models were showing warmer air leading to little or no snow totals. The models all came true, except in New York, where the colder air spilled in and inches of snow caught many New Yorkers by surprise. 
CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm in November was more difficult to forecast because it was early in the season when the models are just beginning to run winter equations, and the actual air profile doesn't act like winter yet. 
""Now that we are in the middle of winter the models should do better with this storm."" 
The latest model forecast indicates places such as Boston and New York will see snow starting Saturday evening, which will then turn into more of a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. New York is likely to warm up enough to see rain Sunday morning. But even if some precipitation doesn't freeze on contact Sunday, it will freeze by Sunday evening when the temperatures plummet. 
Similar to the November storm, there is a steep gradient between rain, ice and snow. Meaning close to the coast people could see rain, a few miles inland freezing rain mix, a few more miles inland snow mix and then a few more miles away the snow starts piling up quickly. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up 6 to 12 inches deep (likely more) with some icing for added misery.
The I-95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will set up, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
A flash freeze is likely behind the storm
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough to see rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. That could happen so fast it would instantly freeze any remaining moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
The National Weather Service in Boston said it's expecting ""a roller coaster of temperatures through this portion of the forecast"" and ""a prolonged period of well below normal temperatures early next week."" 
Keep the hand warmers handy, because temperatures won't just be below average Sunday and Monday.
""For the most part, this winter the jet stream has traveled horizontally across the US. Sure, there have been some ups and downs, but nothing like what is to come,"" CNN's Myers said. 
""By next week the jet stream will flow from Fairbanks (Alaska) to Texas. So, for example, the following Saturday Anchorage will be 32 and Chicago will be 13."" 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

Snow, ice and sleet are all possible and could make travel hazardous in a region unused to this type of weather. But things are really going to kick into gear on Wednesday evening. That tap of moisture coupled with a wave of energy traveling out of the Great Lakes will energize the storm system as it moves out over the Atlantic. In weather parlance, the storm will bomb out over the Atlantic on Wednesday night as it moves up the Eastern Seaboard. The term “bomb out” stems from bombogenesis, meteorologistspeak for when pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. “In terms of pressure, this is going to get down quite a bit,” Jason Furtado, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. “We’re talking pressure for this storm that will rival what you’ll see in Category 2 and Category 3 hurricanes. This is going to be a big storm in terms of records.” Having the same pressure as a Category 3 hurricane doesn’t mean the nor’easter will have the same wind speeds. But it does mean the storm will have a tremendous amount of energy to make life miserable in New England and the Canadian Maritime provinces. Early (read: likely to change) snow forecasts show coastal areas from Long Island to Maine will get the biggest totals, ranging from 4-8 inches. That may not sound like much, but winds nearing 60 mph could create whiteout conditions. The current cold blast has also caused ice to pile up in parts of Cape Cod, and moderate storm surge for the nor’easter could send a frozen slurry of seawater into coastal neighborhoods. “You don’t need 2 feet of snow to have a big impact winter storm,” Furtado said. Though the storm is still a few days out, the National Weather Service announced winter storm watches from Long Island to the Massachusetts coast. Watches will likely expand as the storm track becomes clearer and warnings are almost guaranteed to pop up as well. Here’s the bad news: this is the good news part of the forecast. The storm will reshape the jet stream so that a huge dip appears over the eastern U.S just in time for the weekend. That trough will allow cold air to come streaming in from the Arctic, ushering in the worst conditions of winter. Those conditions will make Hoth look balmy. The National Weather Service is forecasting wind chill values below zero for 62 straight hours in New York starting on Friday. Ditto for Boston. Ditto for Portland, which is forecast to hit minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit. Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit are also gonna be sub-zero with the wind chill. Freezing conditions will extend to the Southeast as well. It’s enough to want to cut a tauntaun open and curl up inside of it until Monday. “We thought it was cold, but this going to be a huge shot of cold air. We’re in rare extreme [territory],” Furtado said. The snow could act as an insulator for underground pipes and infrastructure, sparing them from the worst of the cold. But it could also deepen the chill aboveground by reflecting any incoming warmth from the sun back into space. Records will likely fall, and I will likely spend all of Saturday under a blanket watching Netflix with my cat (don’t judge). A slight thaw is on tap for Monday, and an even bigger reprieve could be on the way for the latter half of January. Models indicate the Madden Julien Oscillation, a roving band of thunderstorms in the tropics, could align the atmosphere into a pattern that helps make the jet stream straighter again. That would cut off the flow of brutal Arctic air and mark a return to plain old cold, which sounds like a beach vacation right about now.","The weather sucks on the East Coast right now, and there’s more godforsaken cold on the way.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Floridas Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen. While Florence drenched the Carolinas with record rainfall and other hurricanes attack with wind, Michaels main threat will be surge. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Michael could send up to 13 feet of storm surge roaring ashore. Thats a lot of water, and there are a handful of interwoven factors explaining why the surge could be so high. First, theres the storm itself. Michael is a pretty big. Hurricane-force winds extend 35 miles out from the now Category 3 storms core, but tropical storm-force winds extend a whopping 185 miles outward. As the storm rotates, its long, windy arms scoop up water and push it along. The underwater and shoreline topography of the Gulf Coast will lend a hand. The area Michael is headed has a shallow continental shelf that extends up to 90 miles offshore. That water is a lot easier to stir up than the deep ocean. Apalachee Bay very efficiently generates storm surge because of its concave shape and shallow bathymetry, or water depth, Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Apalachee Bay sits smack between Cedar Key and Indian Pass, right at the epicenter of the highest surge forecasts. Needham also warned of a terrifying-sounding shelf wave as Michael pushes north. Because the storms movement mirrors the Florida coastline, it basically traps a wave that travels along the coast in the same direction as the storm according to Needham. This happened during Hurricane Dennis, the last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle in 2005, and contributed to higher surge. The pile on doesnt stop there, though. Michaels arrival coincides with the king tides, an annual tradition of the highest tides of the year in Florida which occur when the moon is full or new and the Earth is closest to the Sun. The storm is expected to make landfall sometime in the late morning or early afternoon. Thankfully the high tide isnt until around 10 p.m., but Michael will still strike when the tide is rising. And complete the whole shit show scenario, theres sea level rise. Carbon pollution has contributed to melting land ice and warming and expanding the ocean. Floridas Gulf Coast has seen sea level rise 8-9 inches over the past century. Sea level rise has ushered in a sunny day flooding crisis across the U.S., and its giving storms like Michael a boost they dont really need. Update 5:07 p.m. ET: This post has been updated to reflect the 5 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, which upgraded Michael to Category 3 storm with 13 feet of surge potential.","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Florida’s Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle. National Hurricane Center scientists expect the storm to strike land on Wednesday as a major storm, with winds greater than 110 mph, making it at least a Category 3 hurricane. There's now almost nothing holding back the storm from further intensification as it approaches land, bringing not just destructive winds but perilous surges of ocean water into the Florida and Alabama coasts. ""Hurricane Michael is primed for additional strengthening prior to landfall because the key players in the atmosphere and ocean are all conducive for it,"" Brian McNoldy, a storm researcher at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said over email. One of these key players is wind shear, which are winds that hit hurricanes at their sides and weaken, or sometimes kill, the tempests. Without these winds, there's little threatening Michael's stable, cyclone-like form. ""That helps the storm remain intact, upright, and symmetric,"" said McNoldy. By fall, these hurricane-threatening winds often pick up in the Gulf, Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview. But not this year. ""This is unusual,"" noted Judt. SEE ALSO: An appreciation of the persistently grim tweets from the Norway Ice Service A second influential factor is the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes feed off of the bath-like temperatures of sea surface waters. Without these warm waters, they couldn't even form, nor sustain themselves. And in the Gulf right now, even as the waters begin to gradually cool as fall sets in, they're still plenty warm. ""It's always warm there,"" said Judt. Lastly, there are no masses of dry air in the lower or middle portions of the atmosphere where Hurricane Michael is headed, said McNoldy. A hurricane's thunderstorms need moisture to fuel their activity, but when storms suck up dry air, they threaten to ""wrap into the circulation and choke off the thunderstorm activity,"" said McNoldy. But Michael has mostly moist air ahead. Water levels will rise well in advance of the arrival of #Michael. It's essential that residents within the storm surge warning area finish preparations to protect life and property today. pic.twitter.com/0Xz3nNkAnr NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) October 9, 2018 The storm poses a particularly severe threat to the Florida coast places like Panama City and Apalachicola as well as inland Tallahassee, because the storm is not expected to weaken much as it approaches land. ""Usually they weaken before they hit land,"" said Judt. ""The models are predicting this will not weaken before landfall, which would be very unusual."" The question of why storms typically weaken as they approach land ""is still an open science question,"" noted Judt. Some scientists have proposed drier air from nearby land can temper the storms. But as of Tuesday, any such weakening isn't in the cards for Michael. If Michael follows its expected course, it will become just the fourth major hurricane to hit the Florida panhandle since 1950.","Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle.

Andrew Freedman,"Residents of Southern New England are used to snowstorms, including the classic blizzards that can stalk this region like a hunter tracks prey. Such storms, known as nor'easters for the direction that the wind comes from, can shut down areas from New York City to Portland, Maine, and bring damaging coastal flooding, feet of snow, and widespread power outages. However, even the hardiest of New Englanders are likely growing weary, as the third major nor'easter in a parade of powerful storms is projected to hit beginning Monday night. SEE ALSO: What is bombogenesis? This storm is not predicted to track close enough to the coast to spread heavy snow well inland, toward New York and New Jersey, like last week's storm did. But eastern Massachusetts can expect near blizzard to blizzard conditions by Tuesday morning, with snowfall totals potentially nearing 2 feet in some locations, according to the National Weather Service. Essentially, the atmosphere is acting like a rechargeable battery, with major storms every three to five days, followed by a period of unusually cool, calm weather. Computer model projection of the nor'easter on March 13, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The new storm will hit at a time when thousands of people are still without power in the region due to the tree and power line damage the last storm caused. Some areas in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey are still littered with downed branches and even entire trees split in half. This coming storm is not likely to cause nearly as much damage to trees and the electrical infrastructure, since it will bring fluffier snow, rather than the pasty, wet cement of the last nor'easter. There's still a chance the latest nor'easter will track further away from the coast or closer to it, which would significantly change predicted snowfall amounts, but computer models are honing in on a track off the coast of Cape Cod. The latest nor'easter will likely end a remarkably stormy run of weather for early March, making this winter bookended by a frigid outbreak around New Years and a snowstorm blitz just before spring, with well above average temperatures sandwiched in between. Computer model depiction of the Greenland block, outlined by the blue square. Image: tropicaltidbits.com To understand why there has been such a barrage of storms, one must look to the large-scale weather pattern in place across the Northern Hemisphere that led up to this stormy period. As reported in February, the polar vortex, which is a semi-permanent area of low pressure at high altitudes above the Arctic with strong winds swirling around it, split into two pieces. One lobe of the polar vortex established itself over Siberia and Europe, leading to the ""Beast from the East"" cold and snow outbreak there. Another slipped into the Western U.S. for a time. Meanwhile, weird things were happening in the Arctic, where it was record-warm for the month of February. The region may soon set a record for the least amount of sea ice cover present at the end of the winter — also known as the lowest sea ice maximum. This is in keeping with trends toward rapidly increasing air temperatures during winter, and thinner, younger sea ice that covers less area over time. At the same time, conditions across the Pacific Ocean, including the tropical Pacific, set off a chain of events that altered the shape of the jet stream — the highway of air at upper levels of the atmosphere, which steers storms and helps energize them. Then, a massive block formed over Greenland, as a pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation or NAO, plunged to record negative territory. When the NAO is in a negative phase, it ups the odds for snowstorms in the eastern U.S. and Europe, although it does not guarantee them. Earlier this month, the NAO index plunged to a record low, which is indicative of how primed the atmosphere is for major storms. Together, these events set the stage for a fusillade of storms to blast the East Coast, among other parts of the world. The Greenland block is absolutely key to this, since it prevents weather systems from simply slinking off out to sea, and allows different branches of the jet stream to come together, or ""phase,"" and form a rapidly intensifying storm. Here's how Jason Furtado, an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, explained what's going on, via email: The jet stream acts as the storm track. The southward displacement of the polar jet stream across the Eastern US (trough) during Greenland blocking/negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) episodes facilitates storm systems to track across the Midwest or Southeast and eventually off the Eastern Seaboard. Placing these potent systems over the warm Atlantic waters allows them to rapidly intensify and form Nor’easters. The blocking over the North Atlantic also helps to (a) increase winds from the storm system (pressure gradient) and (b) slow the storm system’s progress to the north and east, sometimes even forcing it out to the south. The offshore tracks for these systems with the block in place allows for cold air to take hold across the Northeast and thus make for rather big snowstorms. The low pressure area forecast to hit southern New England on Monday night and Tuesday will be the third straight storm to undergo bombogenesis, meaning its minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such bomb cyclones are typically accompanied by strong winds, as the air rushes in toward the center of the storm. Without the Greenland block, it's unlikely that all the ingredients would come together three times in a row for major East Coast storms. Think of it as a matchmaker: The Greenland block is facilitating a hook up between weather disturbances pinwheeling across North America, and raising the odds that they'll meet and get busy somewhere off the Mid-Atlantic coast. ""This is not unprecedented per se given the pattern in place (e.g., Feb 2010 'Snowmaggedon' in DC/Mid-Atlantic; Dec 2010-Jan 2011 for the Northeast),"" Furtado added. ""These Greenland block patterns (and post-sudden stratospheric warming episodes) tip the scale toward more frequent and/or intense nor’easters."" A string of storms like this one is not unheard of in New England, as the atmosphere can fall into a pattern that produces a storm every four or five days. That's why some months appear to be rainy every weekend while the workweek is sunny and gorgeous. Interestingly, this next nor'easter hitting tonight is likely to help change the current weather pattern, with the Greenland block breaking down somewhat in coming days. What about global warming? Studies show that there are connections between Arctic climate change and midlatitude weather patterns, particularly cold weather outbreaks in Europe, as well as more stubborn, blocking patterns such as the one we're in the grips of now. However, this is still a contested area of climate science, with some studies showing evidence of links between declining Arctic sea ice and the jet stream, and others failing to detect such connections. Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk company, has been studying the potential links between Arctic climate change and extreme weather in the Northeast and Europe, among other areas. His work shows that as the Arctic warms, the odds of heavy snows in the Northeast somewhat paradoxically goes up. ""So though a heavy snowfall in March is not unheard of or rare, it is the frequency of the heavy snowfalls that seems to be changing,"" he said in an email. ""Also maybe a little more rarer is to have three destructive/disruptive storms in quick succession. But I do think this is consistent with the pattern that follows a polar vortex split over time,"" he said. A recent study Cohen contributed to showed that polar vortex splits have become more frequent as Arctic sea ice has declined and Arctic warming has accelerated. In addition, it's clear, that the impact of nor'easters, including the recent ones, is getting worse due to global warming. This is particularly the case with coastal flooding, since sea level rise is providing storms with a higher launching pad for floods than was the case in previous years. For example, the first of the three storms gave Boston it's third-highest tide level on record, with flooding occurring during at east five high tide cycles up and down the coast from Maine to Connecticut. Also, global warming is causing seas to warm overall, and air temperatures to increase, which results in an uptick in the amount of available water vapor in the air to power major storms like nor'easters. Precipitation extremes, including heavy snow events during the winter, are becoming more common as the climate continues to change. Interestingly, global warming might be giving people the impression that heavy snows don't occur as much anymore, making these nor'easters more surprising. As University of Georgia researcher Marshall Shepherd said in an email: ""The string of nor'easters is having a significant impact, but it is somewhat amusing that cold and nor'easters have garnered so much attention, the changes in our climate have made having winter newsworthy.""","Residents of Southern New England are used to snowstorms, including the classic blizzards that can stalk this region like a hunter tracks prey.

SEE ALSO: Mars' ice age may have turned the red planet white 370,000 years ago On Friday, Mars will be directly across from the sun from Earth's perspective. Just days later, on July 31, the planet will make its closest approach to Earth — just about 35.8 million miles from our planet. That's the nearest Mars has been to Earth since 2003, according to NASA. Which means there's only one thing to do: Check out the red planet. On a clear night, the rusty world won't be hard to identify. “When you first spot Mars rising in the east after sunset, you’ll be startled by how bright it looks,” Diana Hannikainen, Sky &amp; Telescope ’s observing editor, said in a statement. “Its pale orange color is unmistakable.” You can even see it with your naked eye if you know where to look. Mars resembles an unblinking, red-tinged star in the night sky, and it should be one of the brightest objects around these days. ""By the end of July, Mars will be visible at sunset. But the best time to view it is several hours after sunset, when Mars will appear higher in the sky,"" NASA said in a skywatching video. ""Mars will still be visible after July and August, but each month it will shrink in apparent size as it travels farther from Earth in its orbit around the sun."" Your view of the planet will be even better through a backyard telescope or binoculars. A little magnification can allow even inexperienced skywatchers to check out surprising details, and this year, you might even be able to see the huge dust storm raging in the planet's atmosphere. That storm has put NASA's Opportunity rover into hibernation mode as it waits for the tempest to pass. And while that has researchers on Earth worried about the long-lived robot, studying the dust storm itself is fascinating from a scientific perspective.

 Steve Irwin on stage with a crocodile at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2002
Animal rights organisation Peta has caused a row by claiming Steve Irwin was killed while ""harassing"" a stingray. 
Wild animals should be ""left alone in their natural habitats"", the group wrote in response to a doodle by Google celebrating the TV conservationist's life. 
The Australian wildlife advocate was killed by a stingray in 2006.
There's a wildlife reserve in his name in Queensland. 
Steve Irwin, who would have turned 57 on Friday, was probably best-known for his Crocodile Hunter series. 
He described his ""mission"" on earth as being to ""save wildlife"". 
But Peta angered his many fans by describing his method of conservation as ""harassment"". 
In his shows, Steve Irwin would approach animals in the wild - often grappling with crocodiles or holding snakes up in front of the camera. 
He believed that teaching people about wildlife was the way to save the creatures, and that the passion he showed on screen helped ""push an educational message"".
And while Peta accuses Steve Irwin's shows of trying to excite audiences ""at the expense of animals"", wildlife conservationist Anneka Svenska says that what he did ""has inspired the next generation of conservationists"".
""Probably now it wouldn't be looked at as so good to touch the animals like he used to,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. 
""But at the time he was doing it, it inspired loads and loads of children to go on and work with animals.""
People reading Peta's criticism online felt similarly to Anneka. 
At the time of his death, the Guardian published an opinion piece by author Germaine Greer claiming the animal's had ""got their revenge"". 
""What Irwin never seemed to understand was that animals need space,"" she wrote. 
""There was no habitat, no matter how fragile or finely balanced, that Irwin hesitated to barge into.
""There was not an animal he was not prepared to manhandle. Every creature he brandished at the camera was in distress.""
Lots of the animals Steve Irwin was filmed with lived in Australia Zoo, which his family still owns today. 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Steve Irwin took live animals like this alligator on prime time TV shows
Anneka, who's a wildlife TV presenter, disagrees with keeping animals in captivity, but says what Steve Irwin did has to be put ""into balance"". 
Anneka says that she wouldn't choose to touch wild animals because ""they need to be left to be as they are"".
She's recorded programmes with lots of rescued wolves, but says approaching them in the wild would put them in danger. 
""If I was to go out into the wild and start feeding or interacting with wolves then you end up with a lot of dead animals because they become too tame,"" she says. 
""Touching animals in parks that are used to being touched"" is fine, Anneka says. ""I think the criticism comes when he's in the wild and chasing down animals in the wild.""
Steve Irwin was accused of breaking wildlife laws while filming in the Antarctic in 2004. 
Promotional material for his documentary Ice Breaker claimed he ""slides down hillsides with penguins, almost rubs noses with the notoriously dangerous leopard seals and spends the most inspiring time with two friendly humpback whales"".
He was cleared of breaching the rules after an investigation. 
But his biggest controversy came when he walked into a crocodile enclosure with a dead chicken in one hand, and his one-month-old son in the other. 
Headlines following the incident branded him as reckless and irresponsible, and led to an investigation about whether he'd breached workplace regulations. 
But Anneka says she's a big fan of Steve Irwin, like seemingly most people on the internet. 
He's remembered fondly as someone who helped teach people about animals that might otherwise have been seen as scary. 
""I still really like Steve Irwin, I was a fan of him, I think he did a lot of good,"" she says.
""The powerful influence he's had on children and how they love animals and how they engage with animals has been extremely valuable. 
""I think if you have to weigh up the good and the bad, he did more good than bad.""

Mark Kaufman,"Surging hurricane waters can throw around cars, boats, and houses like toys. Six years ago, Hurricane Sandy pushed storm surges into the streets of Staten Island, New York, wrecking entire neighborhoods along the small island off the coast of Manhattan. Homes are still being rebuilt, and some have simply been abandoned. Now, a more powerful tempest, Hurricane Florence, is set to hit the Carolinas late Thursday with winds reaching some 120 mph. SEE ALSO: Glowing snow is falling thousands of feet under the sea. Here's why. Regardless of exactly where it makes landfall, the storm's mass of winds will be destructive, forcing high surges of ocean water into coastlines, barrier islands, and neighborhoods. And the storm surge may be even worse due to the effects of human-caused climate change. The oceans off the southeastern coast of the U.S. have risen by about 9 inches in the last 100 years, boosted by some of the most visible manifestations of global warming, namely melting ice sheets and expanding oceans. NHC Advisory 46. Surge+tide levels ~ 10 ft above MSL near coast. Higher levels in converging estuaries that amplify the surge.

Flooding from rainfall will exacerbate conditions throughout the area. pic.twitter.com/kuugOzWU4c — Dr. Rick Luettich (@RLuettich) September 11, 2018 In light of this reality, how much worse might these Florence-caused storm surges be? ""The simplest effect is that any storm surge is amplified by sea level rise,"" Jaap Nienhuis, a researcher at Florida State University's Coastal Morphodynamics Lab, said in an interview. ""When a major event like this occurs, it's riding on top of sea level rise,"" added Rick Luettich, the Director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an interview. Sea level rise can certainly make the difference in whether or not hurricane waters surmount coastal dunes and comes flooding into communities, said Luettich, but it’s not yet as influential as normal tides in determining how a destructive a storm’s surge may, or may not, be. Off the North Carolina coast, tides rise and fall between 5 and 6 feet each day — substantially more than current contributions from sea level rise. It's important to remember that the Storm Surge Watch issued at 5 AM this morning covers the potential for life-threatening surge through 48 hours. Impacts beyond 48 hours will be covered by subsequent updates. pic.twitter.com/0RaE51d5Ws — NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 11, 2018 “The timing of the surge with the tide is enormously important,” said Luettich. “We might dodge the bullet if it [Florence} were to hit at a low tide.” Yet, a looming problem with Florence is that the expansive storm is expected to stall over the region — as more storms are want to do as the Arctic warms. This means strong winds could have more opportunities to hit the high tide cycle, bringing the worst of the surges. “If it’s a real lingerer, then it will undoubtedly end up going through a high-tide cycle,” said Luettich. The future of storm surges Any storm surge is dependent on a variety of factors — the shape of the land, winds, tide, etc. — and sea level is just one component. But sea level rise is now accelerating as ice sheet melt hastens and the warming ocean expands. Eventually, sea level rise will be a critical influence. “The effect today is not nearly what it’s going to be in 100 years,” said Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University. “Down the road — when the sea has risen a meter — then it’s going to be a factor.” Until then, however, sea level rise will still be a growing, relentless problem. Melting ice and expanding oceans “are going to persistent into the future,” Ben Hamlington, NASA’s Sea Level Change Team Lead, said in an interview. “You know they’re going to contribute going forward.” A NASA graph showing sea level rise since 1993. Image: nasa And as the surges grow, development along the coast has largely eliminated the natural barriers that once weakened storm surges — things like marshes and dunes. “There’s not a buffer zone anymore,” said Nienhuis. “It’s been developed immensely,” he said, specifically citing the Southeastern coastline. To counteract the disappearance of natural barriers, we’ve built impressive fortifications like seawalls to combat rising seas or surges, said Nienhuis. But these efforts are counter-intuitive, he said. Rigid walls reflect wave energy, rather than absorbing it, sending that energy to other portions of the coast, and bringing erosion and damage elsewhere.

The 0.1 inches of accumulation might seem like nothing to a northerner, but it was more than enough in Tallahassee to prompt a warning from local police. The nearby Gulf Coast of Louisiana has also gotten a rare taste of snow and freezing rain, thanks to the unusual Arctic air mass in place ahead of the storm.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"(Reuters) - A winter storm bearing down on North and South Carolina on Saturday was set to glaze roads with ice and trigger widespread power outages, with the National Weather Service warning of more than a foot of snow in the region’s mountainous west. The snow was due to strike the area on Saturday evening, with the heaviest falls expected early Sunday morning and lasting until early Monday. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who declared a state of emergency on Friday, told residents to finish stockpiling food and avoid unnecessary travel. “This weekend isn’t the time to head out to see the winter wonderland. Stay safe where you are,” Cooper said in a statement. “Getting out on dangerous roads could put your life at risk.” The effects of the storm, including power outages, could last for days in North Carolina, officials said. About 500,000 electricity customers could lose power in North Carolina and South Carolina, a Duke Energy spokeswoman said on Twitter. North Carolina’s Mount Mitchell could receive 12-18 inches (30-46 cm) of snow, said meteorologist Jim Hayes of the federal Weather Prediction Center. Other parts of the Carolina mountains are also expected to receive heavy snowfall. Charlotte, the most populous city in North Carolina, could be covered in 5 inches (13 cm) of snow. The storm may affect airports including Asheville and Raleigh-Durham International in North Carolina, Lynchburg and Roanoke in Virginia and Greenville-Spartanburg International, South Carolina. American Airlines said it would waive change fees for people booked through Charlotte Douglas International, a major regional hub in North Carolina. Some of North Carolina’s roads may disappear under ice up to a quarter of an inch (half a centimeter) thick, the National Weather Service said. Icy roads also were expected in the upstate region of South Carolina, with the mountains of northeast Georgia also at risk for slick roads, Hayes said. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division warned motorists to drive carefully on bridges, overpasses and remote roadways, which could freeze over quickly. The storm, which formed off the Texas coast and is moving east, has dumped more than 5 inches (13 cm) of precipitation in Lubbock, Texas, and lashed parts of Arkansas and Tennessee with icy rain, Hayes said.

 Colin O'Brady's Instagram page features a daily selfie of his chores, such as securing his tent each night
A 33-year-old American man has become the first person to cross Antarctica alone and unassisted.
Explorer Colin O'Brady finished in 53 days, ahead of British Army Captain Louis Rudd, 49, after an epic race across the ice.
Both men set out on 3 November to complete the journey, which killed a British ex-Army officer two years ago.
The 921-mile (1,482km) trek took them across the coldest continent on Earth in some of the most extreme conditions.
O'Brady, a pro-athlete who posts his milestones on social media, spoke to the BBC on one his harshest days.
""I'm tired, man. I'm exhausted, but I'm making steady progress every day,"" he said from his satellite phone on 20 December - Day 47 - as he camped amid a storm and massive ridges of ice and snow known as sastrugi. 
After a day which was like being ""in the inside of a ping-pong ball"" O'Brady said he was grateful to have negotiated the wavelike ridges of hard snow and ice in low visibility without having broken a leg.
""I've been dragging an almost 375lb (170kg) sled for 12-13 hours per day through the coldest harshest place in the world,"" he said, adding that he had lost so much weight that his wristwatch had been slipping off and he is ""scared"" to look at his unclothed body.

Day 47: THIS TOO SHALL PASS. After having my best day of the expedition yesterday, I nearly had my worst day today. I went to battle hard with my personal demons today. My anxiety started building last night after listening to a huge wind storm grow outside. The rattling of my tent kept me up and I began to get more and more nervous knowing I had to go out in it. I did my usual morning routine and then stepped into the madness. As expected, it was brutal. Blowing snow, sub zero temps and zero visibility. I packed off and headed out into the whiteout. I just entered a part of the route known as Sastrugui National Park aptly named for having the biggest sastrugui on the route. Pretty much the worse place to find yourself not being able to see where you are going. Due to the massive sastrugi, its also the one stretch where no plane can land so you are in dire straights if an emergency occurs. That really started playing on my mind after I fell hard 5 times in the first hour. What if I broke a bone or a ski? Maybe I should stop? I bargained with myself and finally decided I had to set my tent back up, less than two hours into the day. I told myself in my tent if I wanted to keep going that I could put on my long skins for better grip on the uneven surface and then continue. But I knew the effort it would take to put up the tent in a storm, its unlikely I was going any further. I fought to get the tent up, got inside with my skis, skins and stove, and put on my long skins. It was now decision time. Go back out? The voice in my head told me to stop, wait out the storm, rest. But the other voice told me I needed to keep moving forward or Ill run out of food. My mind was ripping me apart. I closed my eyes and decided to meditate for a couple minutes repeating my favorite mantra: This too shall pass. One way or another Id find my way out of this. Calmed and with renewed resolve I got back outside, fought to get my tent down and packed and continued onward. The storm outside never got any better, in fact it got progressively worse. However I managed to calm the storm in my mind and knock out 21.5 miles today. A great day all things considered.

Race over ice
The two men set off from the Ronne Ice Shelf after poor weather delayed their start for several days. 
Only days earlier they had met for the first time at a hotel bar in Chile and agreed to turn their separate attempts to cross solo and unaided into a formal competition.
Both men come from very different backgrounds. In 2008 O'Brady suffered severe burns to 25% of his body during a holiday in Thailand, leading doctors to tell him that he may never walk normally again.
He recovered and went on to race in triathlons before climbing each of the Seven Summits - the highest peaks on every continent. 
He has also skied to both the north and south pole and hiked to the highest point in every US state.

 Sastrugi are hard wave-like ridges in the ice that can be extremely difficult to navigate
Throughout it all, he has posted words of inspiration on Instagram, and used his satellite phone to take a question each night from one of the thousands of students who have followed his solo expedition.
Rudd, a father of three, was given leave from the military where he has spent his career, in order to train and attempt to make the crossing.
He was inspired to attempt the adventure after the death of his friend and colleague, Henry Worsely, along the same route.
Worsely died of an illness after he was rescued only 30 miles from the finish line - the Ross Ice Shelf.
Image copyrightBritish armyImage caption
 Capt Louis Rudd has served in the Army for 33 years
In his daily dispatch from the ice on Christmas Eve, Rudd described carrying Worsely's flag to the places that his friend had come so close to reaching.
""I'm carrying Henry's flag... that he carried on all his journeys, and it's really important to me that, this time, the flag goes all the way, and completes the journey right to the end,"" he said, before completing his posts as he always does.
""Onwards...""
High, dry and cold
Antarctica is well-known as the coldest continent on Earth, but it is also the highest and driest.
The cold freezes all moisture, technically making the landscape a desert.
Mile-thick sheets of ice covering the continent also make it the highest average-elevation landmass with a peak that the men reach of 9,613ft.
Sunlight, which shines 24 hours a day in the summer, O'Brady says, ""is weird and disorienting but I actually kinda like it,"" since it allows him to charge his solar panels.
The men must carry all the calories they will consume throughout the journey, a nearly impossible task considering their level of energy exertion, and boil ice and snow for all their drinking water.

 Capt Rudd sent voice despatches from the ice along his journey
Apart from occasionally spotting each other as specks on the horizon, they have seen very few forms of life.
At the South Pole, O'Brady says he saw some signs of life from the polar researchers stationed there, but was forbidden from accepting any help which would have prevented him from achieving his goal unaided.

Steve Dent,"If you think I'm exaggerating about how dramatic these storms can look, a quick Google image search of "" dirty storm "" will change your mind. All suggest that some kind of impending apocalypse/horsemen scenario is about to take place. Many of the best ones were taken by Negroni himself, but even he admits that the image above is special. ""The photograph with which I obtained second place in the Pano Awards was taken during the violent eruption of the Volcán Calbuco, located in the south of Chile,"" he told Engadget via email. ""The technique was simple: long exposure, tripod and a 80-200mm lens. Approximately 10 minutes to achieve that incredible image that, without a doubt, is my best photograph of an eruption and I think the best taken in the world."" How does this happen? In a regular thunderstorm cloud, lightning is created when rising air makes ice crystals and water droplets bump together, forming static electricity. Once the charges build up enough to surpass the atmosphere's natural insulating tendency, lightning discharges either from one cloud to another or to the ground. Volcanic lightning works on the same principle, but via different actions. Recently, researchers studying one of the world's most active volcanoes, Japan's Mount Sakurajima (above), learned more about how it forms. Using high-speed cameras, they discovered that charge created by churning magma builds up just above the rim, electrifying the ash just above it. That creates an electrostatic potential in the lower portion of the cloud that eventually causes lightning to discharge into the cloud or air, often in the opposite direction of regular lightning. As such, lightning formation is usually limited to the bottom part of the ash plume, and depends strongly on how the plume develops. Chile is located on the Pacific ""Rim of Fire,"" and has 90 active volcanoes, the second most in the world after Indonesia. Negroni has photographed volcanoes like Llaima in the Araucania region, the 2011 eruption of Puyehue-Cordon Caulle, and in 2015, the Villarrica Volcano and Calbuco pictured here. Volcanologists and seismologists have become extremely adept at detecting eruptions ahead of time, so endangered inhabitants were evacuated well ahead of time. Though volcano science has improved dramatically, getting near active ones that produce lightning isn't for the faint of heart. ""Photographing volcanoes is very dangerous and I do not recommend it to anyone,"" Negroni said. ""But if you have the opportunity to do it from a very safe place, it will be an incredible show that nature gives us.""","What do you get when you marry two of Earth's most dramatic natural events, lightning and volcanoes ?

Mark Kaufman,"Late Monday night, Hurricane Florence — the Category 4 storm barreling toward the East Coast of the U.S. — decided to replace its eyewall. And it's threatening to do so again. This dramatic-sounding event tends to make major hurricanes even stronger, and larger, explained Chris Slocum, a storm researcher specializing in the inner-core processes of hurricanes at Colorado State University. But how does such an atmospheric event unfold for any storm, let alone the ominous Hurricane Florence with extreme winds forecast to blow just off the coast of the Carolinas late Thursday? SEE ALSO: Will sea level rise make damage from Hurricane Florence worse? ""Eye replacement is something that major hurricanes naturally do,"" Jason Dunion, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, said in an interview. (A major storm has wind speeds of at least 111 mph, or a Category 3 storm). Such powerful storms typically have a prominent wall of clouds, made up of a band of thunderstorms, surrounding the tranquil eye. And for reasons still largely uncertain but are being actively researched, another eyewall will sometimes begin to form around the original, inner eyewall. ""Suddenly you have two of them,"" said Dunion. ""Eventually it just replaces the inner eyewall."" In the 1950s and 1960s, before the age of satellites, hurricane hunting pilots sometimes spotted this happening and called it ""an eye within an eye,"" said Dunion. Today, these replacements are of great significance to storm scientists and forecasters. Because once a new eyewall replaces the collapsed, original eyewall, the storm is prepped to intensify. Growing more powerful Hurricanes of all persuasions feed off warm bathtub-like water of at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They suck up evaporated seawater, adding to their girth, and when this water vapor is converted to both liquid and then ice particles (high up in the clouds), energy is released, which hurricanes convert into wind, explained Slocum. Given enough fuel, the process repeats and repeats, and the storms grow larger and more powerful. Bands of spiraling thunderstorms, which give hurricanes that ""buzzsaw"" type of appearance, form outside the eyewall and can eventually become their own ring, or second eyewall. Once this is accomplished, the thick ring of storms starve the inner wall of moisture-rich air, and eventually, the inner ring simply dissipates away, often leaving a larger, gaping eye, explained Slocum. Then, ""you have a temporary weakening of the storm,"" he said, as that original eyewall was home to the hurricane's strongest winds. But, no matter, for the grounds have been set for a reawakening of the hurricane. Now with a larger eye, the storm can contract in on itself. ""It's like an ice skater throwing their arms inwards,"" said Slocum. ""If it is able to contract more, you’ll see a spin up."" Hurricane #Florence is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, where a secondary, larger eyewall gradually supplants the old one. Typical of these, Florence is temporarily a little weaker, but will restrengthen afterwards. These cycles also tend to make the storm larger. pic.twitter.com/XpzWke1UFf — Levi Cowan (@TropicalTidbits) September 11, 2018 After Florence completed its eyewall replacement, the eye grew to about 40 miles in diameter, as of Tuesday afternoon. It's also possible that Florence could go through another eyewall replacement cycle before getting to the coast. ""It's just such a hard thing to forecast,"" said Dunion, Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday, meteorologists spotted the cycle happening again. Some hurricanes replace their eyewall every day, said Dunion. Others, every few days. We'll see if Florence completes this second replacement. But overall, the storm is running out of time. Florence is forecast to lose steam once it interacts with the coast. The drama, however, won't be over. The stalled storm is forecast to sit over land, dumping deluges of rain inland, similar to Hurricane Harvey. But if Florence were to undergo another replacement today, and experience a temporary weakening, the storm's overall effect likely wouldn't be lessened. The process of building another eyewall creates a bigger storm, as the new, outer ring of thunderstorms creates a larger eye and expands the storm's diameter. This means the storm can spread over more ocean, and push more water inland in the form of violent storm surges. ""So, while a hurricane may weaken during eyewall replacement, the impacts from the storm are not necessarily diminished,"" said Slocum. And this storm won't be a walk in the park for anyone in its path. More eyewall replacements or not, at this juncture Florence will impact the evacuating Southeastern coast with extreme effects including high winds, flooding, and torrential rain.","Late Monday night, Hurricane Florence — the Category 4 storm barreling toward the East Coast of the U.S. — decided to replace its eyewall.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A bitter winter storm gripped much of the South on Wednesday, prompting schools to close and causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations as snow, ice and record-breaking cold hit the region. The storm led to a least one death when a vehicle in Austin, Texas, plunged more than 30 feet off a frozen overpass late on Tuesday, killing a man in his 40s, Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Service said on its Twitter feed. Winter weather advisories were in effect from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic states and Southeast, as well as over the central Gulf Coast of Texas, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Winter storm warnings were also in effect for portions of the Carolinas, southern Virginia and the New England area. More than 360 outgoing flights at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport were canceled or delayed on Wednesday, according to Flightaware.com, and another 60-plus were canceled or delayed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The governors of Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana declared states of emergency due to severe winter weather conditions, which caused multiple car accidents during rush-hour traffic, officials said. NWS meteorologist Dan Petersen said snowfall in central and north Georgia had ended, and the arctic cold front would now bring snow, frigid temperatures and frozen roadways across central North Carolina on Wednesday.

Ryan Gaydos,"A ""bomb cyclone"" is set to dump snow and ice Wednesday across parts of the East Coast that rarely see winter weather, the latest bombardment of frigid weather that's brought freezing temperatures to vast portions of the United States. The National Weather Service said Wednesday a mix of snow and freezing rain was expected to move across along the East Coast from Florida to North Carolina before rapidly strengthening at sea. The weather service warned a so-called “bomb cyclone” will bring “blizzard conditions"" across portions of eastern New England late Thursday. ""This winter storm is forecast to bring the potential for a mix of freezing rain/sleet/snow from portions of northern Florida to North Carolina, and snowfall northward along portions of the Mid-Atlantic into northern New England,"" the NWS said in an advisory. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratio n, bombogenesis or bomb cyclone “occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure."" ""This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters. The formation of this rapidly strengthening weather system is a process called bombogenesis, which creates what is known as a bomb cyclone,” NOAA said. The NWS has issued a Winter Storm Warning for all of Southeast Georgia, Interstate 10 corridor in Northeast Florida, and portions of the North and South Carolina costs due to the possibility of ice and snow. The agency warned areas along coastal areas of New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic could see up to 6 inches of snow, while parts of New England may see over a foot. Winter Storm Warnings stretch from Florida to New England. (Fox News) Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janie Dean warned Wednesda y the storm is going to ""almost going to be like a hurricane off shore"" once it reaches the Northeast after bringing snow, sleet, and freezing rain across the Southeast.

At least 11 others were hospitalized. Plunging temperatures in Texas brought rare snow flurries as far south as Austin, and accidents racked up on icy roads across the state. The Abilene police chief said more than three dozen vehicle crashes were reported in 24 hours. Officials in Michigan said dozens of cars piled up in crashes on Sunday, according to the Detroit News. Officials said there were no deaths reported in the crashes, but there were at least seven hospitalized. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Ryan Gaydos is an editor for Fox News.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Something strange is happening to the northernmost city in the United States. Its the dead of winter, and temperatures in Utqiavik (formerly Barrow) should be well below zero. Late last week, they soared into the 20s and 30spractically beach weather for Arctic Alaska.
On February 7, temperatures in Utqiavik flirted with the freezing mark, possibly setting a new daily high record as the normally-solid wintertime sea ice offshore gave way to open water.
The heat wave wasnt isolatedthe entire North Slope of Alaska was running a fever 30 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Meanwhile, to the south, levels of ice in the Bering sea were plummeting. Since January 25, Bering sea ice has receded 35 percent, according to Rick Thoman,a climate scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
All of this, Thoman says, is related to a series of storms that moved from the North Pacific into the central and western Bering starting in late January. Some of those storms continued north into the Chukchi sea as well, and in doing so transported very warm air up to the North Slope, Thoman told Earther. The heat wave backed off this week, with temperatures dropping back into bone-rattlingly cold (aka normal) territory, although the respite from could be short-lived.
Either way, the sudden midwinter thaw falls in line with an pattern of heat and icy woes for northern Alaska, reminding us that the region continues to be ground zero for the impacts of climate change. Data Thoman shared with Earther shows Februarys in Utqiavik have warmed a staggering 11.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 50 yearsthe highest jump of any month, although autumns on the North Slope are also seeing very rapid warming,which helps explain why the sea ice that forms offshore as the sunlight wanes has been weak as hell lately.
That the sea ice was already in a weakened state this year almost certainly contributed to its disintegration near the shoreline last week as storms blew in, Thoman said. He noted that historically, easterly winds during the winter would cause breaks in the ice a mile or two offshore, but this years icy breakup was a different beast entirely.
This event was brought to you ultimately by warm sea surface temperatures that are keeping the ice thinner so it can fracture, he said.
In a climate sense, the rest of the state is also sweating. Februarys along the west coast, the southwest, and in the Alaskan interior are running about 9 degrees warmer than they used to, while late winter temperatures in the south and southeast have risen anywhere from a degree and a half to nearly six degrees. 
Four of the past five years have been the warmest on record for the Alaska, with 2018 coming in as the second warmest on record.
Thoman said that the next Bering sea storm is already on the map, so temperatures across western and northern Alaska could soon rise well above normal again. The only small salvo is that sea ice levels in the Bering are unlikely to drop as low as they did in 2018, which was a phenomenally bad year for ice and the communities that depend on it. (Alaskan Native villages along the coast use that ice as a platform for hunting, and depend on it to protect their shorelines.)
Were not gonna get that low, Thoman said. But certainly were on track for February of 2019 becoming the second lowest sea ice has been in the Bering on record, behind only the remarkable year last year. This year, we would be oohing and aahing the sea ice, except for last year.","Something strange is happening to the northernmost city in the United States.

Pelmorex Weather Networks Inc.,"U.S. WEATHER | Winter storm
Sunday, January 13, 2019, 10:33 AM -A snowstorm dumped up to 8 inches (20 cm) of snow across Missouri, Illinois and part of the U.S. Midwest Saturday (January 12), and is expected to bring rain and snow across a 1,800-mile (2,900 km) swath of the United States in the next few days.
The weather system, which started as rain from Mexico but has since turned into snow, is forecast to affect an 1,800-mile (2,900 km) swath of the United States from Colorado to the Mid-Atlantic.
The storm hit Kansas and Missouri on Friday and pummeled those states again on Saturday as it extended into parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said U.S. Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Andrew Orrison.
(Related: 'Congratulations on surviving your first plane crash')
In Kansas City, snow dusted the field at Arrowhead Stadium during Saturday's National Football League playoff game between the hometown Chiefs and Indianapolis Colts.
""There's snow time like Showtime,"" the Chiefs said on Twitter, sharing video of the team's quarterback Patrick Mahomes arriving at the stadium in the snow.
The storm is leaving its heaviest snowfall on areas west of St. Louis, where about a foot and a half of snow was recorded, with still more falling on Saturday, Orrison said.
At least five people died in weather-related crashes on roads in Missouri and Kansas, according to the highway patrolmen in both states.
""I think it's safe to say that every road is bad in Kansas right now!"" Trooper Tod Hileman, a spokesman for the Kansas Highway Patrol, said on Twitter on Saturday.
Dozens of flights were canceled at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, which described the onslaught of snow on Twitter as one of its biggest single-day winter storms in years.
Washington, where many federal government offices are closed due to the U.S. government shutdown, is expected to receive 6 to 8 inches (15 cm to 20 cm) of snow from this storm, according to the National Weather Service.
Central and northern Virginia will receive even more, with up to 10 inches of snow possible in some places. Baltimore and parts of Maryland are also bracing for a similar amount.
Philadelphia is expected to receive a few inches of snow, but areas north of there are expected to be spared, Orrison added.

CTVNews.ca Staff,"Deep in Greenland’s ancient ice sheet, scientists have uncovered evidence of an “enormous” solar storm that struck Earth more than 2,600 years ago, according to a new study. Our planet, the researchers add, would be ill-prepared in the likely event of another such cosmic bombardment.
The study, which was published Monday in the “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences” journal, was led by researchers from Sweden’s Lund University.
 “If that solar storm had occurred today, it could have had severe effects on our high-tech society,” study co-author and Lund University geology professor Raimund Muscheler said in a statement. “That’s why we must increase society’s protection against solar storms.”
 A solar storm occurs when explosions on the sun’s surface blast high-energy particles into the cosmos.
 In today’s world, such storms can pose risks to electrical grids, satellites, communications systems and air traffic. In modern times, large solar storms led to widespread power outages in Quebec in 1989 and Sweden in 2003 -- but those storm, scientists say, pale in comparison to the one that occurred more than 2,600 years ago.
 The radiation and magnetic shockwave unleashed from a solar storm “of such magnitude occurring in modern times could result in severe disruption of satellite-based technologies, high-frequency radio communication, and space-based navigation systems,” the study said.
 By drilling deep into 100,000-year-old ice in Greenland, researchers found radioactive evidence of an “extreme solar event” that occurred around the year 660 BC -- a period that coincides with the dissolution of the once-mighty Assyrian Empire, the construction of the Acropolis in Athens and the founding of Taoism in China.
 According to the researchers, it is the third known case of such a massive solar storm hitting Earth in historical times. The others, they say, took place in 775 and 994 AD. During those events, humans would have been treated to a dazzling display of aurora. And although these kinds of enormous solar storms remain incredibly rare, one could very likely strike our planet again, but with much more devastating effects this time around.
 “Such events represent a threat to modern society,” the study warned. “Therefore, better understanding the possible magnitudes and occurrence frequency of such events is of great importance for safeguarding space technologies and modern technological infrastructure.”
 “Our research suggests that the risks are currently underestimated,” Muscheler added. “We need to be better prepared.”

Andrew Freedman,"A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast. The blizzard is the result of three distinct disturbances in the atmosphere as well as the intense contrast between the Arctic air mass in place across the East and a subtropical plume of moisture moving up the coast near the Gulf Stream. Non-tropical storms feed off air mass differences, along with upper level disturbances, and these ingredients are quickly coming together for a historically intense storm to form. SEE ALSO: A meteorological ‘bomb’ is set to go off along the East Coast, and dangerous cold will soon follow In fact, snow, sleet, and freezing rain is already underway across the Southeast, where the heaviest snowstorm on record is possible on Wednesday in Savannah, Georgia, and the first measurable snowfall in 28 years is falling in Tallahassee, Florida. Snow will overspread the region tonight/Thursday morning &amp; last most of the day. Heavy snowfall is possible around 9am to 4 pm w/ snowfall rates near 2 inches an hour. Travel may become difficult due to poor vsbys &amp; snow covered roads. Blowing &amp; drifting snow is also possible. pic.twitter.com/BSF9XzJj6f — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) January 3, 2018 While there are still nagging questions about the storm's exact track and evolution, it's clear that it will intensify at an explosive rate, potentially doubling the intensification rate needed to qualify for undergoing a process known to meteorologists as ""bombogenesis,"" which refers to a storm whose minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm is projected to go from about 998 millibars on Wednesday morning to 950 millibars by midday Thursday, a plunge of 48 millibars in about 24 hours. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Storms of this intensity are extremely unusual in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin when compared to climate records during the past 30 years. Hurricane Sandy, which had tropical characteristics, ruling it out as a direct comparison, had a minimum central air pressure of 946 millibars when it made landfall in New Jersey in October 2012. Blizzard conditions to hammer Northeast, Carolinas Late Tuesday and into Wednesday, computer models have tended to move the storm track to the west, bringing the heaviest precipitation over the East Coast. So, what first appeared to be a glancing blow now promises to be a full-fledged blizzard in some locations. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for Boston on Thursday, where up to a foot of snow is expected to fall, accompanied by wind gusts to 70 miles per hour. Computer model projection of satellite imagery on Jan. 4, 2018, from the high resolution NAM model. Image: tropicaltidbits Blizzard warnings have also been hoisted for parts of the Carolinas, and more may be issued later Wednesday depending on the latest computer model data. Blizzard warnings for up to a foot of snow, along with howling winds and low visibility, include Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia, which is the largest naval base in the world. Blizzard warnings are extremely rare in this area. Near-blizzard conditions are also anticipated to affect coastal Rhode Island and Connecticut, along with Long Island, with perhaps the toughest snowfall forecast reserved for New York City and New Jersey. Some computer model projections show this region getting buried by a foot of snow, while others show a far less severe event, with just 4 to 7 inches of snow. It may take until late Wednesday for the forecast to be ironed out for the Big Apple, and even then the level of uncertainty may be unusually high. The local National Weather Service office in New York City said the following in a morning technical forecast discussion on Wednesday: As mentioned, this remains a fluid situation based on model spread, with potential for these numbers to go down, but still seems more so upwards based on model trends and mode of SREF/GEFS/ ECMWF ensemble members compared to operational runs. This higher trend is reflected in latest WFO /WPC snow probs, with high probs of greater than 6 inches of snow across E LI /SE CT and low to moderate probs to Hudson River. A significant jump in the reasonable worse case has also been noted, with 1 in 10 chance of seeing more than 12-16 inches of snow across much of LI /CT, 8 to 12 inches of snow across NYC/NJ metro to Hudson River, and 4 to 8 inches N &amp; W still in play. To try to reduce the forecast uncertainty, the National Weather Service is dispatching hurricane hunter research aircraft to fly a route around the Southeast U.S. today to drop instruments that will gather data on winds, humidity, pressure, and other parameters. This information will then be fed directly into the agency's computer models, potentially making their projections more reliable. In recent years, the Weather Service has flown such missions outside of hurricane season for high uncertainty, high impact events, and this one definitely qualifies. Ice chunks to exacerbate coastal flooding Because the storm will intensify so significantly, and so quickly, it will generate very strong winds. These winds — in some instances gusting to hurricane force of 75 miles per hour — will drive water toward the coast, particularly in southeastern New England, where moderate to major coastal flooding is expected during high tides on Thursday. Given the recent, unrelenting cold snap, one additional threat will come from the ice chunks that are clogging many harbors and portions of Cape Cod Bay. These chunks could cause damage to shoreline infrastructure, or worsen flooding in some cases. Farther out at sea, high winds will create towering waves, creating a major hazard to mariners caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why this low pressure area will become such a monster The storm will have every ingredient it needs to intensify into a blockbuster. First, it will have ample upper level support from three distinct disturbances in the fast-moving current of air known as the jet stream. Once these combine into one, powerful system, they will promote lifting of the air over the East Coast, which is essential to forming precipitation. Lift is also key to the formation of a surface area of low pressure, as well as its intensification. An animation from the North American Model, known as the NAM, shows the combination of the three disturbances and the formation of a deep trough, or dip, in the jet stream off the East Coast, with the low pressure area tucked into it. If the model projections prove correct, as they have been so far, this could be one of the strongest winter storms on record, at least for this part of the North Atlantic Ocean. Image: tropicaltidbits The storm, named winter storm Grayson by The Weather Channel, will also have the advantage of forming in an area off the Southeast coast where the temperature contrast between frigid, dry Arctic air, near-record-warm ocean waters, and comparatively moist subtropical air is at its maximum, allowing the low pressure area to feast off this contrast as if it were at an all-you-can-eat buffet. And as it moves northward up the coast, it will also sustain itself through the release of latent heat via the formation of thunderstorms and precipitation in the cold sector. Winter Storm #Grayson will act as a heat bomb in the atmosphere in response to all the deep convection associated with the cyclone. Watch how this coastal cyclone accelerates the upper-level irrotational wind field, building the downstream jetstreak. #Science is awesome. pic.twitter.com/6V45hgw3d8 — Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) January 3, 2018 The Gulf Stream will play a key role in allowing this storm to explosively intensify, experts say. ""Relationships between the ocean and atmosphere are complicated, especially as they relate to explosively developing extratropical cyclones (like the one currently in the forecast),"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, in a Twitter message. ""But the extreme thermal contrast between very cold atmospheric temperatures over land and an unusually warm nearby Gulf Stream certainly sets the stage for impressive storm-strengthening potential,"" he added. ""Ocean conditions are not the only factor at play (atmospheric conditions, like the position and strength of jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere, are also critical), but they’re definitely important."" Polar vortex to follow this beastly storm The winter storm will plow into the Canadian Maritimes on Thursday night, and behind it, the coldest air of the season will pour southward, into the East, from Greenland, Hudson Bay, and the Arctic. Map showing a piece of the polar vortex (in white) moving from Hudson Bay down into New England on Saturday, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell Technically speaking, the cold that will follow the blizzard is associated with part of the polar vortex, which is a circulation of air around the Arctic that plays a role in determining how cold winters are in North America, Europe, and Asia. Temperatures of 30 degrees Fahrenheit below average are expected on Friday and Saturday in the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic, which will put all-time temperature records in jeopardy. Anyone that loses power during the storm will have to seek out heat elsewhere, as temperatures plunge well below zero at night, and barely recover above the single digits during the day. Even in New York City, the high temperature on Saturday may not climb much above 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and winds gusting to 30 miles per hour will make it feel far colder. Fortunately, this weekend appears to be the end of this extraordinarily long cold snap, as more seasonable temperatures return next week.","A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast.

Tom McKay,"NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched the Joint Polar Satellite System-1, the first in a “series of four highly advanced polar-orbiting satellites,” NASA announced on Saturday, with the agencies touting they expect significant improvements to their weather-forecasting abilities when JPSS-1 comes online in three months. “Emergency managers increasingly rely on our forecasts to make critical decisions and take appropriate action before a storm hits,” NOAA National Weather Service director Louis W. Uccellini wrote in the statement. “Polar satellite observations not only help us monitor and collect information about current weather systems, but they provide data to feed into our weather forecast models.” JPSS-1 is 14.8 feet in diameter (4.5 meters) and weighs 5,060 pounds (roughly 2,300 kilograms), and was one of the last NASA satellites scheduled to be powered into orbit by the Delta II rocket system. It will circle the Earth approximately 14 times a day at an elevation of 512 miles (824 kilometers). Per the NASA release, JPSS-1 carries five instruments the agencies say will provide “meteorologists with observations of atmospheric temperature and moisture, clouds, sea-surface temperature, ocean color, sea ice cover, volcanic ash, and fire detection.” Program director Greg Mandt told Space.com the onboard suite consists of “instruments so precise that they can measure the temperature to better than a tenth of a degree from the surface of the Earth all the way to the edge of space.” Its similarly polar-orbiting predecessor, Suomi NPP, was intended as a test of the technology involved in JPSS-1's construction but has since become a valuable meteorological tool. Once it has completed its three-month testing and calibration phase and been put into active service, JPSS-1 will be rechristened NOAA-20. JPSS-1 is particularly important at a time when climate change is likely raising the likelihood of extreme weather events like the hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf coast and the Caribbean this year, as well as increasing the intensity of other phenomena like wildfires like California. Better instruments mean better forecasts, which can aid in scheduling evacuations and preparing for storm impacts, as well as better imaging capabilities after disasters, which aid rescue and recovery efforts.

,"A winter storm that blanketed the Midwest with snow and left seven dead hit Washington and its surrounding areas Sunday with more than 35 million people under winter weather alerts.
Up to a foot of snowfall is possible in Washington and Virginia on Sunday and into Monday morning, the National Weather Service said.
Baltimore is also in the path of these heavier bands of snowfall, with 4 to 6 inches of snow predicted for Sunday. Philadelphia is predicted to get 1 to 2 inches of snow, and there is a possibility of light accumulation in New York along the storm's northern edge.
""We have a strong snowstorm that's stretching 1,400 miles from Kansas to the East Coast,"" CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. ""St. Louis is seeing its worst snowstorm in five years. We're going to see a significant snow event for the mid-Atlantic to start the year for 2019.""
Over a foot of snow has fallen across areas of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado since Friday. The highest snowfall totals were in Montgomery City, Missouri, northwest of St. Louis, which was hit with 20 inches of snow.
More than 35 million people are under winter storm warnings or advisories across the Ohio River Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning effective through 6 p.m. ET Sunday for Washington, parts of central Maryland and northern and northwest Virginia. Sleet, snow and ice are making traveling conditions hazardous if not impossible.
Snowy and icy mess
The Appalachians will pick up ice and snow in the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, forecasters said. Half an inch of ice and 3 to 5 inches of snow are predicted. In anticipation of the storm, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency Saturday.
There is a small chance the southern Appalachians will get enough freezing rain and sleet to bring an ice event Saturday into Sunday.
More heavy rain also will fall on the saturated South. The Southeast has seen abundant precipitation in December and January, and the additional rain could put a strain on already-high rivers.
The storm eased up Saturday in St. Louis after dropping more than 10 inches of snow there.
At least four people have died and scores of motorists were injured and stranded, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.
In Kansas, three people died Friday in traffic accidents, authorities said Saturday: A 62-year-old man in a vehicle that struck a barrier wall on the Kansas Turnpike, a semi-truck driver whose vehicle collided with another truck and a driver whose vehicle struck an oncoming vehicle and ran into a ditch.
In a tweet Saturday night, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said it had responded to 57 injuries, 878 crashes, 1,790 stranded motorists and 3,918 calls for service.
St. Louis recorded 10.4 inches of snow by 1:30 p.m. ET, with higher accumulations in other parts of Missouri. In Columbia, 15.5 inches were reported and Harrisburg had 17 inches.
The Missouri Department of Transportation warned residents not to travel in the storm if it wasn't necessary. The department reported incidents and stalls on interstates overnight. But it cited progress Saturday as crews worked to clear routes and bring ""water and food to stranded motorists.""
The University of Missouri men's basketball game Saturday at the University of South Carolina was moved to Sunday because of weather-related travel problems, the team tweeted.","National After killing 7 in the Midwest, winter storm to hit DC and surrounding areas CNN WCPO Winter storm snarls Midwest roads, claims at least 7 lives CBS News Storm woes continue; stay home Saturday, MoDOT ask KPLR 11 St. Louis Storm dumps snow on Midwest…",2019-01-13T14:24:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wcpo.com'}","National After killing 7 in the Midwest, winter storm to hit DC and surrounding areas CNN - WCPO",https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/after-killing-7-in-the-midwest-winter-storm-to-hit-dc-and-surrounding-areas,https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee6e381/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Faf%2F71%2F0a71b4b34598ba025ced117dcabe%2Fgettyimages-1081542074.jpg,,Wcpo.com,ice storm,1
Press Trust of India,"In a first, the Hubble Space Telescope has beamed back images documenting the birth of a giant storm on Neptune, a finding that may reveal insights on the inner workings of the poorly-understood ice giant planets, NASA said.
Like Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Neptune's Great Dark Spots are storms that form from areas of high atmospheric pressure. In contrast, storms on Earth form around areas of low pressure.
Scientists have seen a total of six dark spots on Neptune over the years. Voyager 2 identified two storms in 1989. Since Hubble launched in 1990, it has viewed four more of these storms, NASA said in a statement.
Researchers analysed Hubble's photos of the ice giant taken over the past several years and chronicled the growth of a new Great Dark Spot that became visible in 2018.
By studying companion clouds that showed up two years before the new Great Dark Spot, the researchers conclude dark spots originate much deeper in Neptune's atmosphere than previously thought.
The Hubble images also helped the researchers pinpoint how often Neptune gets dark spots and how long they last.
The findings not only give scientists insights on the inner workings of the ice giant planets but also have implications for studying exoplanets of similar size and composition.
""If you study the exoplanets and you want to understand how they work, you really need to understand our planets first,"" said Amy Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in the US.
""We have so little information on Uranus and Neptune,"" said Simon, lead author of the study published in journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Scientists first saw a Great Dark Spot on Neptune in 1989, when NASA's Voyager 2 probe flew past the mysterious blue planet. As the spacecraft zoomed by, it snapped pictures of two giant storms brewing in Neptune's southern hemisphere.
Scientists dubbed the storms ""The Great Dark Spot"" and ""Dark Spot 2.""
Just five years later, the Hubble Space Telescope took sharp images of Neptune that revealed both the Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and the smaller Dark Spot 2 had vanished.
A new Great Dark Spot appeared on Neptune in 2018, nearly identical in size and shape to the one Voyager saw in 1989.
Researchers were analysing Hubble images of a smaller dark spot that appeared in 2015 when they discovered small, bright white clouds in the region where the 2018 Great Dark Spot would later appear.
""We were so busy tracking this smaller storm from 2015, that we weren't necessarily expecting to see another big one so soon,"" Simon said.
The high-altitude clouds are made up of methane ice crystals, which give them their characteristic bright white colour.
Scientists suspect these methane clouds accompany the storms that form dark spots, hovering above them the way lenticular clouds cap tall mountains on Earth.",Hubble captures birth of giant storm on Neptune: NASA Deccan Herald Birth of 'Great Dark Spot' Storm on Neptune Seen for 1st Time (Photo) Space.com Hubble captures birth of giant storm on Neptune Phys.org Hubble Witnesses The Birth Of A Colossal Storm On Nept…,2019-03-26T07:04:01Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Deccanherald.com'}",Hubble captures birth of giant storm on Neptune: NASA - Deccan Herald,https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/hubble-captures-birth-of-giant-storm-on-neptune-nasa-725231.html,https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/article_images/2019/03/26/hubble-voyager-large-2-1553584482.jpg,,Deccanherald.com,ice storm,1
TRIBUNE STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Wind-driven sleet, freezing rain and snow alternated to keep roads slick Saturday as the Coulee Region waited to see how much snow would ultimately accumulate during a mid-April storm that blasted much of the nation’s heartland. The National Weather Service predicted 6 to 12 inches of snow along and north of Interstate 90, 2 to 6 inches south of the I-90 corridor, and a winter weather warning was in effect till 7 p.m. Sunday. The weather system stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, forcing flight cancellations and creating treacherous road conditions. Three people were killed in weather-related incidents, including a sleeping 2-year-old Louisiana girl. In the Upper Midwest, the early spring storm brought snow to a region pining for sunshine and warmth. More than 200 flights were canceled Saturday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and blizzard conditions forced the airport in South Dakota’s biggest city, Sioux Falls, to remain closed for a second straight day. Some flights at the La Crosse Regional Airport were delayed or canceled. The Minnesota Twins home game against the Chicago White Sox at Target Field was also snowed out, marking the first back-to-back postponements of baseball games in the stadium’s nine seasons. Authorities closed several highways in southwestern Minnesota, where no travel was advised, and driving conditions were difficult across the entire southern half of the state, well into western Wisconsin. “It’s a cool experience for me, the best Minneapolis experience,” said Niko Heiligman of Aachen, Germany, who braved the snow to take a walk along the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis. “I’m only here for the weekend, so I guess that’s how it goes. There’s snow and it’s cold. So it’s good.” The storm is expected to persist through today in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan before moving into New York state and New England. A band of 6 to 18 inches of snow had fallen by Saturday morning across central and northeastern Wisconsin, with another round on the way. A blizzard warning was issued for the northern half of Wisconsin, which was expected to get another 14 inches by Sunday evening. Winds of up to 55 mph caused blowing and drifting snow, along with ice shoves in Green Bay. In Chicago, Lake Michigan waves were expected to reach as high as 18 feet, prompting a flood warning until today along the lakefront. Huron, an eastern South Dakota city of about 13,000 people, received 18 inches of snow. One of the three storm-related deaths occurred Friday on snow-covered Interstate 80 near Chappell in western Nebraska, where the State Patrol said an Idaho truck driver lost control of his semitrailer and slammed into a semi that had become stranded. Rollo Ward, 61, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, died at the scene. Another death happened early Saturday in northwestern Louisiana when a storm toppled a tree onto a mobile home in Haughton, killing a sleeping 2-year-old girl inside. A woman died in a spinout on a slippery highway in central Wisconsin on Saturday morning. The Columbia County Sheriff’s Office said the 30-year-old woman from Poynette, Wis., was driving a minivan that began to spin and crossed the centerline of Hwy. 16 in the town of Lewiston, where it was struck by an oncoming SUV. The road was slush-covered and light, freezing rain was falling. The storm made its mark in Texas, too, where hail stones the size of chicken eggs fell on areas south of Dallas and Fort Worth.","La Crosse Tribune Storm blasts central US with snow, ice and wind, killing 3 La Crosse Tribune Wind-driven sleet, freezing rain and snow alternated to keep roads slick Saturday as the Coulee Region waited to see how much snow would ultimately accumulate durin…",2018-04-14T23:17:50Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lacrossetribune.com'}","Storm blasts central US with snow, ice and wind, killing 3 - La Crosse Tribune",http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/storm-blasts-central-us-with-snow-ice-and-wind-killing/article_eca99f5d-1357-5eb7-b8ea-701112e05b43.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lacrossetribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/80/48039fbe-a94e-5dc5-9037-b5bdee3e045d/5ad28b414b211.image.jpg?crop=1644%2C925%2C0%2C168&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Lacrossetribune.com,ice storm,1
Mark Kaufman,"Confederate cannon balls plunged into the brick walls of Fort Sumter at the outset of the Civil War, forcing Union troops to surrender. A century and a half later, surging storm waters are now the modern threat to the South Carolina national monument. Storm-swollen seas can flood the coastal garrison, at times forcing the National Park Service to shut it down. More than 100 National Park Service sites are located either on or near the coast. With global sea levels rising at an accelerating pace, spurred on by human-caused climate change, it's more important than ever that the service understands how storm surges and rising seas will impact historical sites like Sumter. The conservation agency, however, lacked useful projections showing how these factors could inundate vulnerable lands, both in the near and distant future. So, when a visiting climate scientist, Maria Caffrey, proposed such a project, the Park Service accepted, and in 2013 the research began. SEE ALSO: Park Service to raise fees in 117 parks, but that still won't solve its looming problem Five years later, the Park Service published the 90-page study to the backpages of its website with no known promotion of the work. The Union of Concerned Scientists spotted the study's publication last Friday, noting that there was ""no easy way to find it unless you know where to look."" While a Park Service spokesperson explained via email that, once published, the report had been sent to park managers, it wasn't clear if the agency planned on publicizing the findings on a larger scale. It was also unclear if the study would be published at all, and if so, in what form. After Caffrey's initial report was handed in, government officials censored out phrases relating to human-induced climate change in revisions and pushed the publication of the study back repeatedly, she said. The Center for Investigative Reporting, which acquired some 2,000 pages of revision, exposed the censored language and published the revisions on the organization's Reveal website in April. While the Park Service finally published an uncensored version last week, the events illustrate how government interests can infringe upon the scientific integrity of new research, especially in the realm of climate change. As Caffrey notes, the removal of particular language in the study came from inside the government, not scientists outside the agency. ""The alterations came from people way beyond the coauthors,"" Caffrey, now a research associate at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in an interview. What the study says about climate change The study, ""Sea Level Rise and Storm Surge Projections for the National Park Service,"" projects sea level rise in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100 for 118 park sites, as well as storm surge projections for 97 of them. Simulated flooding caused by a hypothetical hurricane striking Theodore Roosevelt Island in Washington DC. Image: National Park Service The study found that there are coastal parks — like Wright Brothers National Memorial located on a strip of sandy island off of North Carolina — that may be relatively comfortable today but are likely to become vulnerable to future sea level rise and storm surge. ""Wright Brothers might not be in serious danger right now, but when you factor in sea level rise and storm surge, it becomes a much more serious issue,"" said Caffrey. During the revision process, a park official (or officials) crossed out different references to ""human activities"" and ""anthropogenic"" (meaning originating from human activity) from language discussing the influences of climate change, according to Reveal's reporting. But in the final published version, these words were back. ""We were pleased to see it underscore that park structures were at risk from anthropogenic climate change,"" Sarah Barmeyer, the senior director of Conservation Programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in an interview. The Park Service said that it backs the final version of the report published to the site, and that the agency often works through disagreements on recommended revisions to scientific reports. ""The National Park Service is confident in the quality and accuracy of the science behind the sea level rise and storm surge projections presented in the report,"" a park spokesperson said in a statement. After seeing the report, Barmeyer called it ""really significant,"" noting that the Park Service manages and protects 10 percent of U.S. coastlines. In 2017, three separate major hurricanes damaged and closed a variety of these coastal parks. ""National parks are on the direct front lines of sea level rise,"" she said. ""Sea level rise and storm surges will keep happening in these places — forts, lighthouses, and historic sites."" ""We’re going to be losing some of these iconic features."" Liberty Island National Monument was closed for 9 months after incurring damage from Hurricane Sandy. Image: National Park Service The Park Service maintains the exposed Reveal documents were released as the study's authors and agency were working towards a consensus about the report's language. Just over a week after the documents were made public, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Park Service, told a House Appropriations subcommittee in April that the Interior Department would not interfere with any scientific study. ""If it’s a scientific report, I’m not going to change a comma,"" Zinke said. A pretty conservative climate report While some government officials in either the Park Service or the Trump Administration — which is outwardly antagonistic to notions that humans have contributed to global warming — may have been displeased with aspects of Caffrey's report, Caffrey emphasized the flooding projections were actually pretty conservative. To simulate how much sea levels might rise in the near and distant futures, Caffrey and her team used projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations organization tasked with researching the societal effects of warming temperatures and rising seas. Their climate reports are subject to a lengthy scientific review process, though some researchers consider their climate change projections to be a bit moderate, perhaps not fully accounting for potentially momentous events like the accelerating melting of the massive West Antarctic ice sheets. According to the report, the IPCC estimates that without reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, global average sea levels will rise between around 1.3 feet to just over 2 feet (0.4 meters to.63 meter) by 2100. ""The numbers may be conservative, but that is the bare minimum,"" Caffrey said. ""The IPCC is an incredible source,"" she added. ""We wanted a source that has gone through rigorous peer review and has widespread acceptance."" NASA uses satellites to measure the average global sea level rise happening each year. Image: NASA Caffrey's team took the IPCC's sea level rise projections and plugged them into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's SLOSH model, which the agency uses to simulate storm surges and flooding into coastlines. Caffrey and her team then created maps and simulations to give these numbers some realistic context. ""Getting a report out there is very important right now,"" said Barmeyer, who proceeded to list a number of park sites that were closed by storm damage in 2017. This included Everglades National Park's Gulf Coast Visitor Center, which was destroyed by Hurricane Irma, and millions in damage to the moat walls of the Civil War-era Fort Jefferson. ""National parks really are living laboratories for studying the effects of sea level rise and storm surge,"" said Barmeyer. Caffrey's report may have been the first such study for the Park Service, but it's unclear whether she'll be involved in future storm projections for the conservation agency. ""The way things have gone with the reports, I don’t know how well that would be received from me,"" said Caffrey. ""I don't know what my future will be with this right now."" ""It's something I’m wrestling with.""","Confederate cannon balls plunged into the brick walls of Fort Sumter at the outset of the Civil War, forcing Union troops to surrender.

"Jennifer Gray, CNN","(CNN)While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over. 
The potential is there for a ""bomb cyclone"" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. 
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. 
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. 
Things begin to unravel Tuesday
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota.
Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes. 
Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions.
Thursday the bottom drops out
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours.
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis. 
Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous. 
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. 
On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms.
The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest
Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely. 
We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected. 
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding. 
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend. 
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay.

Nicole Gallucci,"Snow may be dominating headlines in the wake of Thursday's "" bomb cyclone,"" but coastal flooding has proven to be another serious danger in places along the East Coast. In addition to blizzard conditions, Massachusetts has been walloped with the combination of astronomical high tides and strong onshore winds up to 75 mph. The resulting coastal flooding reached record levels in Boston, with severe flooding reported all along the coast. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained Flood waters took over sidewalks and streets, trapped cars, and shut down subway stations. The severity of the floods, which exceeded the region's benchmark storm of the Blizzard of 1978, was caused by a combination of high astronomical tides from Monday's supermoon, the timing of the storm that brought the strongest winds onto the coast at high tide, and a rising sea level over the past few decades. Perfect storm of ingredients for a major coastal flood 1) Supermoon Monday (high astro tides) 2) Worst of the storm hitting *at* high tide 3) Ice hunks chucked ashore from recent arctic cold 4) Some sea level rise since 1978 also 'helps' — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) January 4, 2018 'The Blizzard of 1978' gets some competition In February of1978 a winter storm struck New England that set records and killed 54 people.

Down by the aquarium, the water is coming up onto part of the harbor walk. “I’ve never seen anything close to this,” Rene Miller, a resident in a nearby building, said. “There was water over my boots, in the road.” (Also: dog out with owner) pic.twitter.com/uryAseE4kO — Steven with a ph (@steveannear) January 4, 2018 In an afternoon tweet, Boston's National Weather Service forecast office noted that though water from the coastal flooding will take hours and perhaps days to drain, they believe the worst is behind them. But super cold temperatures coming in next will likely cause water that's washed ashore to freeze. Other parts of Massachusetts and the Northeast Boston isn't the only part of Massachusetts that experienced flooding.

https://www.facebook.com/markberman,"A brutal winter storm descended upon the East Coast on Wednesday, bringing snow to Florida and Georgia along with ominous forecasts of bone-chilling temperatures and pummeling snow expected to follow across the eastern United States. The powerful storm prompted dire warnings from meteorologists and government officials alike, as authorities shut down schools, grounded flights and closed roadways throughout the Southeast. Forecasts called for the storm to become a “ bomb cyclone ” because its pressure will drop so quickly, causing it to intensify at explosive rates. Snow and freezing rain coating parts of the Southeast on Wednesday are only expected to be the beginning. The storm is forecast to travel up the coast like a snowbird in the spring, bringing snow to the Mid-Atlantic and then potential blizzard conditions in New England on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. After that’s done, forecasters warn, a painful cold will follow. “Bitter cold and dangerous wind chills to persist into the weekend,” the National Weather Service said in a warning Wednesday morning. [ ‘Bomb cyclone’ to blast East Coast before polar vortex uncorks tremendous cold late this week ] The storm has already caused issues for travelers, halting scores of flights. Even before the forecast snow arrived in the Northeast, airlines had canceled more than 1,700 flights on Thursday, most of them through the three New York-area airports as well as Boston. Airlines bracing for the weather had begun issuing waivers for travelers heading through essentially the entire East Coast, allowing people to change their flights without any fees. As the storm began to grind across the East Coast, it brought wintry weather to unusual places. Snow fell Wednesday on Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, and stretched across the border into Georgia. The Raleigh, N.C., office of the National Weather Service reported that the temperature there dropped to 9 degrees on Wednesday morning, tying a record low set on the same date in 1887. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) declared a state of emergency for 28 counties, warning that the snowfall and freezing rain could melt and then refreeze, “producing additional ice related hazards.” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said that while it was hard to predict the snowfall totals, the impact could make it treacherous for people to drive. Authorities there also warned about the dangers the extreme cold could pose for the elderly and children, among others. “Cold temperatures can present a challenge for everyone across the state, especially our most vulnerable residents,” Dr. Betsey Tilson, North Carolina’s state health director, said Wednesday. Some braved the icy conditions for supplies. At a Harris Teeter supermarket James Island, S.C., just across the Intra-Coastal Waterway from downtown Charleston, mostly male shoppers stocked up Wednesday morning on water, hot dogs, bread and milk. “The women were too smart to go out,” one cashier said as icy rain turned the parking lot to slush shortly before noon. Further south, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) had ordered transportation crews to prepare state roads and bridges amid the winter storm warnings and advisories issued across the Sunshine State. “As this weather system moves through state, families and visitors across North Florida should prepare for potential hard freezes and below-freezing travel conditions,” Scott said in a statement. Roadways were already shut down by the storm across parts of the Southeast. Florida officials said they closed a stretch of Interstate 10 because of the weather, while a number of roadways were closed in Georgia. The storm essentially meant that many Floridians, more accustomed to seeing schools closed for hurricanes, had snow days this week. Leon County, which is home to Tallahassee, shut down schools Wednesday. About three hours away, Alachua County canceled classes on Wednesday and Thursday due to the warnings of freezing rain, dangerous roads and black ice. “Closing schools is not a decision we make lightly,” the Alachua school system said in a statement. “We recognize that it’s a real headache for families, but safety has to be the first consideration.” While southern states dealt with the snow and ice, many in the north began hearing warnings of what they could soon confront. The National Weather Service forecasts that Boston and nearby areas could see up to a foot of snow — and possibly more — saying that “near blizzard conditions are likely in this region.” Philadelphia could see up to three inches of snow, while New York City may see as much as six inches by Thursday. What path the storm takes could determine its impact. If the storm wobbles away from the coast, snow amounts and peak winds will decrease, but if it hews closer to land, snowfall and gusts could climb higher and extend farther inland. Doug Pardue in Charleston, S.C., and Jason Samenow in Washington contributed to this story, which will be updated throughout the day.

Kevin Bissett,"A massive winter storm that walloped Southern Ontario this week moved through Quebec and the Maritimes Wednesday, closing schools, restricting travel and shuttering many businesses and offices for the day.
Few areas were spared as activities across much of Eastern Canada were disrupted, from the Dennis Oland murder trial to outdoor events at Quebec Citys winter carnival.
Its been a long day, said Troy Arsenault, who fought a losing battle as he cleared snow from the steps in front of Frederictons Beaverbrook Art Gallery Wednesday.
Story continues below advertisement
Its our third time here the wind keeps blowing the snow right back to where weve cleared it.
Mr. Arsenault said the drifting and rapid accumulation made it one of the worst storms of the winter.
Jill Maepea, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said much of New Brunswick could expect close to 35 centimetres of snow from the storm by Wednesday night, with more on the way.
All of New Brunswick and P.E.I., and much of Nova Scotia and Southern Quebec were under similar winter-storm warnings.
Areas of western Nova Scotia also received heavy snow Wednesday morning, but weather in much of the province had changed over to freezing rain or rain by midday. Environment Canada said winds could also gust to 80 kilometres an hour and combine with freezing rain to make travel treacherous.
Schools and universities in almost all of the region were closed or delaying their openings, along with some government offices and businesses.
The courts in Saint John opened as scheduled Wednesday morning, but closed at noon due to the blizzard, adjourning Mr. Olands retrial in his fathers killing for the day.

Airports in Fredericton, Halifax and Charlottetown were reporting dozens of flight cancellations, a day after the scene played out in Toronto where there were mass flight disruptions and widespread closures of schools, tourist attractions and non-essential municipal services.
A no-travel advisory for New Brunswick highways was issued Wednesday.
Al Giberson, general manager of MRDC the company responsible for the stretch of Trans-Canada Highway between Fredericton and Moncton said snow was accumulating as fast as four to five centimetres an hour.
The real challenge though is the heavy snowfall, and the wind that has come with it, has made visibility very poor. Driving conditions are very treacherous, Mr. Giberson said.
Much of Southern Quebec also remained under a winter-storm warning after about 30 centimetres of snow fell in Montreal, forcing the closing of schools and travel disruptions on Tuesday.
In Quebec City, the weather was bad enough that even the winter carnival was forced to close its outdoor activity sites Wednesday. Organizers said the temporary shutdown was necessary to ensure the safety of everyone.

Between 20 and 40 centimetres of snow were expected to fall in Quebec depending on the region, with strong winds reducing visibility on some roads to almost zero. Several highways were closed Wednesday morning, including Highway 20 in both directions between Lévis and Montmagny.
Most of the provinces schools and universities were closed, with more than 50 of 72 school boards declaring a snow day.
All Montreal universities were also closed, as were Universite Laval in Quebec City, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres and Universite du Quebec en Outaouais.
Meanwhile at the other end of the country, Environment Canada lifted snowfall warnings for British Columbias south coast, but conditions were still treacherous in some areas and frigid temperatures persisted in parts of the province.
Snow continued to fall over parts of southern Vancouver Island and the Fraser Valley, prompting some school closings as well as the suspension of all BC Transit service between Abbotsford and Hope.
On Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast, residents were digging out after about 60 centimetres fell in some areas, while arctic winds kept wind chill values close to -20 C in the Sea-to-Sky region.

Kaitlyn Schwers,"As a strong winter storm approaches northeastern Kansas and northern Missouri, a winter weather advisory has been issued for the Kansas City metropolitan area, and is expected to be in effect from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The advisory includes Leavenworth, Wyandotte and Johnson counties in Kansas and Platte, Clay and Jackson counties in Missouri. Sundays forecast calls for about 1 to 4 inches of snow in the Kansas City area with winds around 40 to 45 mph, which will lead to near whiteout conditions and snow covered roads, the weather service said in a tweet Saturday afternoon. According to the forecast, the Kansas City area will see rain Sunday morning followed by snow falling after 10 a.m. The chance of precipitation is 100 percent, the weather service said. In areas north of Interstate 70, the weather service warned of blizzard conditions and blowing and drifting snow with accumulations of 4 to 9 inches and winds around 40 to 45 mph. A blizzard warning was issued for parts of northeastern Kansas and northern Missouri, and will be in effect from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday. The weather service said the combination of heavy snow and strong winds will lead to whiteout conditions and dangerous travel on area roads. Travel on Sunday during the storm is highly discouraged due to these potential impacts, the weather service said. Crews with the Kansas Department of Transportation in the Kansas City area have started making plans ahead of the storm. In a tweet, KDOT said crews are preparing to come in overnight and start plowing and treating the roads as rain turns to snow Sunday morning. It has also asked drivers to avoid traveling during this time. The Missouri Department of Transportation posted on Twitter that those who must travel on the roads Sunday should check the traveler maps ahead of time for road conditions. In a news release Saturday, a spokesman for Kansas City International and Charles B. Wheeler Downtown airports announced employees would begin coming in 5 a.m. Sunday to help keep runways, taxiways, roadways and parking lots clear of snow and ice. Travelers were also reminded to visit flykci.com to check the status of their flight in the event of inclement weather. More information about the snow and ice removal process at the airports is posted online.

A winter storm that contributed to at least five deaths in the Midwest pummelled the mid-Atlantic region for a second day Sunday, bringing with it an icy mix that knocked out power, cancelled flights and contributed to hundreds of car accidents.
Virginia State Police said the driver of a military surplus vehicle was killed late Saturday after he lost control on Interstate 81 because of slick road conditions.
Police said Ronald W. Harris, 73, of Gainesville, Georgia, died after his vehicle was struck by two tractor-trailers. The two tractor-trailer drivers were taken to a hospital for injuries that were not life-threatening. The state medical examiner determined Sunday that Harris death was storm-related, police said.

Virginia State Police said they responded to more than 300 traffic crashes and helped nearly 200 disabled vehicles in Virginia from midnight to late Sunday afternoon.
The storm knocked out power to nearly 200,000 people in Virginia and North Carolina at its height Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us.
In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Sunday to help utility crews restore electricity more quickly after power lines fell because of freezing rain, ice and toppled trees. The states western mountains and foothills were hardest-hit along with the western Piedmont region and nearly 1,000 state transportation workers were called out to clear ice and snow.
The National Weather Service reported nearly a half-inch of ice in some sections of western North Carolina, leading to fallen trees and power lines but other areas of the state got mostly a cold rain or freezing precipitation that caused few problems The wintry mix did, however, cause problems at airports in the region, including more than 250 flight cancellations Sunday at the three main airports serving the nations capital.
In Baltimore, a man was fatally shot as he shovelled snow early Sunday morning. Police said a 43-year-old man was outside shovelling at 4:40 a.m. when an unidentified suspect shot him in the head and shoulder. The victim died at a hospital.
By late Sunday afternoon, the Washington, D.C. metro area, northern Virginia and parts of Maryland had total snowfall accumulations ranging from five to eight inches (12-20 centimetres). Central Virginia, including Richmond, had much smaller accumulations as little as one inch (2.5 centimetres) but the snow was followed by hours of sleet and freezing rain.
Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said parts of the region could expect snow to continue falling into Sunday evening.

At this point, it is just going to head out to sea once it exits here this evening, Chenard said.
Most public school systems in northern Virginia and Prince Georges County schools in suburban Maryland said classes would be cancelled Monday.
Class cancellations also are planned Monday in areas of central Illinois hit by record snowfall.
Springfields State Journal-Register reports the state capital broke a 55-year record for daily snowfall on Saturday. It cited the National Weather Service as saying the 8.4 inches (21.3 centimetres) of snow that day in Springfield broke the previous record for a Jan. 12 in 1964 of 6.6 inches (16.7 centimetres). Some 11.5 inches (29 centimetres) of snow fell on Springfield over three days.
Among those killed in the Midwest during the storm was an Illinois state trooper struck by a car when he responded to a three-vehicle crash Saturday in suburban Chicago.
State Police Director Leo Schmitz told reporters that 34-year-old Christopher Lambert was headed home when he pulled over and got out of his squad car to respond to the accident. Schmitz said Lambert positioned his squad car to protect the other three cars and took on the danger himself.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history. But beyond the catastrophic losses of life and property, the storm also dealt a blow to the American weather modeling community. The American weather model whiffed on the initial forecast, but its European counterpart was dead on. Nearly six years later and the phrase “the Euro nailed Sandy” is still a running joke in the meteorological community, shorthand for both the continued superiority of the European model’s ability to predict major weather events like hurricanes while also mocking people who obsess over a model that has its own deficiencies and occasional high profile whiffs. Behind the scenes, though, the weather modeling arms race is heating up with the American model getting a major upgrade early next year. This competition about more than model supremacy: Lives and property are at stake. Witness last year, when weather disasters cost the U.S. a record-setting $306 billion. In Puerto Rico, the disastrous Hurricane Maria claimed an estimated 3,000 lives according to a government-commissioned survey published this week. An increase in extreme weather brought on by climate change only makes it more important for our weather models to get it right. Step outside and the weather is inherently obvious and easy to understand. The sun kisses your skin, the warm air causes the sweat to build behind your knees, maybe a slight breeze ruffles the grass. You pop your umbrella open as a thunderstorm pours and run to the basement as a tornado touches down. But these basic experiences are the result of a chaotic series of interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, sea ice, incoming sunlight, and a host of other planetary-scale features. Models are how we try to make sense of all this complexity, and meteorologists use them as guidance when they’re forecasting hurricanes, snowstorms, or the chance of an afternoon shower. There are a ton of weather models out there. National meteorological agencies make most of them but so do private companies (did you know Panasonic—yes, the electronics company— nailed Irma ?). For much of the world, however, two models are the backbone of forecasting: the Euro, and the American model known as the Global Forecast System (the GFS). These models are created and maintained by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), respectively. The two agencies were founded with divergent missions, which in part informs some of the differences in their weather models today. NOAA is focused on “climate, weather, oceans and coasts” while ECMMWF was established to “produce accurate climate data and medium-range forecasts,” or forecasts generally covering the range of 3-7 days. “The European Center has a very narrow mission compared to either the [UK] Met Office or the U.S. National Weather Service (which is part of NOAA),” Richard Rood, a weather and climate expert at the University of Michigan, told Earther. “That mission is medium range forecasting, that is what they do very very well. In the U.S., our resources—which are quite substantial—are diffused across a larger set of products.” The “Euro nailed Sandy” meme arose because ECMWF had Sandy’s weird track pegged more than a week out. The GFS eventually worked out the same track for the storm. Similarly, the Euro bested the GFS when it came to Hurricane Joaquin last year when it consistently and correctly predicted the storm would stay out to sea (the GFS had it coming ashore along the Mid-Atlantic for a while). John Morales, the chief meteorologist WTVJ in Miami who has seen no shortage of hurricane model runs, told Earther he relies heavily on both models for short-term forecasts. “However, for days 3-7, while still looking at the output from both models, I lean strongly towards the European global model,” he said. “It truly is difficult to beat, especially in the medium range.” So what’s the Euro’s special sauce? The scale of computing power each agency has at its disposal is measured in petaflops. To put that measure in perspective, it would take your measly human brain 31.7 million years to do the number of calculations that a one petaflop computing system can do in a second. NOAA has computers capable of reaching 8.4 petaflops, ECMWF tops out at around 8.5 petaflops. All that power allows each group to run its model fast enough to spit out results for the entire planet a few times a day at fairly high resolution. The Euro recreates conditions up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) into the atmosphere and has a resolution on the ground of roughly 5.6 miles (9 kilometers). The GFS runs simulates the atmosphere up to 33 miles (53 kilometers) above the surface with a resolution of eight miles (13 kilometers). That resolution difference is partly why the GFS isn’t as strong as its European counterpart when it comes to forecasting specific weather events. It’s essentially looking at the atmosphere with slightly blurry vision, while the Euro’s view is closer to 20/20 vision. But there’s another key difference, which is how the two groups use data to start their models running. The Euro uses continuous data compiled from satellites and weather stations over a 12 hour period to set up initial conditions. These essentially give the model a sense of what the planet’s weather has been up to lately. “This allows [the Euro] to make better use of observations and especially satellite observations which come in a nearly continuous stream,” Massimo Bonavita, a senior scientist working on at data assimilation at ECMWF, told Earther. In comparison, the GFS assimilates a few snapshots of data. Basically, by the time the GFS gets out of the starting gates, the Euro already has a running start. “[The question is] how do we do something disruptive to make the step to the next level, not how do we catch up?” But help is on the way on many fronts for the GFS. A new version of the model is coming in early 2019. It will run on a new dynamic core, something that Brian Gross, a senior advisor for the unified forecast system at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (which is part of NOAA), likened to the engine of a car. “Replacing the engine is much like you do if you replace engine in your car,” he said. “You will get a lot more miles out of this. That will future-proof us, [allowing us to run] higher resolution models with more advanced physics.” The new engine is already being tested alongside the current GFS and Gross said the early results are “pretty encouraging in terms of forecast track improvement intensity improvements” for hurricanes. The next generation of the GFS is hardly the end of the line for weather modeling. Neil Jacobs, a NOAA deputy administrator appointed by Trump, told Capital Weather Gang in April that improving weather modeling is a “top priority of the administration.” There are also efforts afoot to create something called an unified forecast system, which will basically take all the models under NOAA’s purview from the GFS to ice, ocean, land, and more and link them up into what will be a super model game of telephone. “You don’t exactly have one model that does everything,” Rood, who is part of task force working on that project, said. “What the unified system gives you is a more controlled environment for prediction problems.” Those problems can range from will it rain in Omaha in the next few hours to will Nebraska face drought conditions in the next four weeks. Rood added that the most important question about how to improve American weather forecasting is “how do we do something disruptive to make the step to the next level, not how do we catch up.” Social media has played no small role in stoking the feud between the Euro and the GFS. You can find people saying things like the GFS “ crapped it’s [sic] pants ” forecasting Hurricane Lane or that it whipped up a “ scare-icane ” earlier this summer, as well as the fact that it “ nailed the forecast for Harvey.” Will meteorologists and armchair weather forecasters ever stop fighting about these two weather models and their battle for supremacy? Probably not. But things are a little more subdued behind the scenes. Gross told me that I would be “disappointed” if I was searching for beef between NOAA and ECMWF. “A measure of friendly competition has always been present among major forecasting centres,” Bonavita said. “This is actually very positive because it stimulates development and provides diversity in the forecasting ecosystem.” Indeed, both centers collaborate, sending scientists across the Atlantic to learn from each other. And it’s not like the Euro never comes in second place. The model infamously whiffed on what ended up being a minor Mid-Atlantic snowstorm this year, calling for up to 20 inches of snow in Washington, D.C. And both the Euro and GFS see skill drop offs in the summer and have biases toward warmth or cold and wet or dry in certain locales. “There are a lot of statistical analysis that show the Euro being superior, but the Euro operational model can, at times, be wildly inconsistent with forecast solutions too,” Matt Lanza, a Houston-based meteorologist and managing editor of Space City Weather, told Earther. “We are taught that it’s called model ‘guidance’ for a reason. Guidance doesn’t mean an answer key; it’s meant to guide you through a complex process.” Indeed, that’s why anyone flashing a model run on social media without caveats is a huge red flag. Models aren’t forecasts, they’re one possible outcome in an inherently messy system. Ultimately, it requires people to interpret them. “I consider the human element in the forecast a strong suit,” Morales said. “My experience allows me to recognize patterns and understand biases. Generally our human-produced forecast is significantly more reliable than the machine forecast alone.” The same sentiment echoes among the folks behind the machines, too. “We’re a community that’s fascinated by the science and the ability to provide useful information to our customers,” Gross said. “We all have something to contribute.”","Hurricane Sandy was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Scientists in India observed the highest-voltage thunderstorm ever documented with the help of a subatomic particle you might not hear much about: the muon.
The researchers operate the GRAPES-3 telescope, which measures muons, particles that are similar to electrons but heavier. Specifically, the Gamma Ray Astronomy at PeV EnergieS Phase-3 (GRAPES-3) muon telescope measures high-energy particles from outer space called cosmic rays. It typically picks up 2.5 million muons each minute, mapped on a 13-by-13 grid across the sky. But during thunderstorms, it experiences quick changes to the amount of muons it receives. The GRAPES-3 researchers added electric field monitors to the experiment, and devised a way to turn these muon fluctuations into measurements of the voltage of passing storms.
A storm on December 1, 2014, led to a relatively enormous 2 percent decrease in the amount of muons that the experiment received. According to their methods, published in Physical Review Letters, this would be equivalent to a 1.3-billion-volt electric potential in the thunderhead. This doesnt refer to a single lightning bolt, but rather the strength of the electric field caused by positively charged water molecules carried by convection to the top of the cloud while negatively charged ice remains lower down. For comparison, most lightning bolts have 100 million volts of electric potential between their ends. Subway tracks carry less than 1,000 volts.
That voltage measurement is 10 times higher than the previous most powerful observed storm on Earth. Storms with these strengths may be behind some of the other high-energy phenomena weve covered, like terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.
Its important to point out that models arent always accurate, and require human assumptions. Michael Cherry, physics professor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, told the science publication Physics that it was a unique but indirect way to measure the electric fields in thunderstorms, and the assumptions used in the analysis might not apply to every storm. He suggested that balloons or drones could be used to make measurements that refine the model.
But this mega measurement could help explain an important mystery. Weve reported that satellites have measured terrestrial gamma ray flashes, or bolts of gamma rays. Its assumed that storms cause these TGFs, but there havent been thunderstorms on record strong enough to generate the gamma rays observed by experiments like the AGILE satellite. But 1.3 billion volts would certainly be strong enough.
Provided the model is accurate, this would be the largest voltage ever measured in a thundercloud. And if the cloud were to discharge that electricity near you, well, youd die in more ways than one.",Scientists in India observed the highest-voltage thunderstorm ever documented with the help of a subatomic particle you might not hear much about: the muon.

People wade through seawater on sunlit Miami streets ; the Florida Panhandle, which rarely sees hurricanes, was recently flattened by a megastorm; and every year bigger and more frequent wildfires burn through Australia and California. As our planet warms up, the climate-related changes across the U.S. are well underway. Even if you havent had to cope with climate related problems yet, it may not be long before you have to protect your home from extreme weather, fire, flooding, or even sea level rise. To find out how climate change may affect your area, check out climate risks by region using the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. A short video introduces the different parts of the website. You might want to go to the Steps to Resilience section that offers way to assess and reduce your risk. For example, your flood risk depends not just on your own home and where it sits, but also on things like how the city has channeled nearby creeks and what size culverts your local department of public works has installed beneath your street or road. When it rains harder than ever before, undersized culverts may be overwhelmed and creeks can back up and jump their banks, flooding homes and roads. In Santa Cruz, California, the citys climate action manager Tiffany Wise-West, PhD, has posted a detailed action plan, including a Practical Adaptation Actions for Residents. Were not covering every little thing, she says, but the Citys simple web page is a place for ordinary people to start. Santa Cruz County is one of the rare places that already has a detailed plan for the future. Ask your city and county government if they have a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan like this one. But even if your area doesnt, you can rough out a way to address the specific risks your home could face. In general, climate change experts talk about two ways of addressing climate change, preventing it and dealing with the consequences. Here we are focused on dealing with the consequences of climate change, sometimes called climate adaptation. Sea Level Rise Is your seaside condo at risk of looking like the castle in the bottom of a goldfish bowl? To find out, look up your area on Climate Centrals Surging Seas Risk Zone Map. Older climate models predict 1 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100. But depending on how quickly major ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica collapse, the sea could rise a dozen meters or more. For now, we dont know for sure when that might happen. For example, East Antarctics largest ice sheet is threatened by warm sea water slipping underneath it. That could set the front of it afloat and allow the massive landbound part to slide into the seaenough to raise global sea levels by nearly four meters (12 feet). Wise-West says the Santa Cruz plan is about the same whether the sea rises a meter in 80 years or sooner. Its just a matter of moving up the schedule, she says, looking serious. If you look at Port Arthur, Texas, on the Surging Seas website and set sea level to one meter (3 feet), you can glimpse the future. Here is Port Arthur today: Port Arthur is home to 50,000 people and the largest oil refinery in the United States. Heres what it could look like with one meter of sea level rise: That means that if you lived in Port Arthur, youd have to think about not only how sea level rise would affect your own backyard, but also how it would affect the oil refinery and how that would affect you. Thats a lesson to cast your net wide when thinking about how climate change might affect you through indirect effects. Go to your own address on the Surging Seas website and see what one meter of sea level rise looks like. Maybe your home is fine but the nearest fire station, the grocery store, and a power plant 30 miles down the coast will all be underwater. Think about the infrastructure you count on. Will it be okay? If the front steps of your condo are underwater, check your insurance policy to see, first, if you have purchased flood insurance and, second, if storm surges and sea level rise are covered. Have an emergency kit and an emergency plan for evacuating in case of a storm surge. But think longer term, too. You could put stilts under your house. FEMA provides tips on how individuals and communities can build or rebuild smarter, safer, and stronger and a Mitigation Best Practices Portfolio.

How can you deal with such Biblical flooding? In the short term, evacuate if local authorities say to. Longer term, have an escape plan. But bottom line? Dont live in a floodplain. Remember when you bought a new can opener because you thought you lost your old one? What do you Read more Read Flooding from rain and overflowing rivers might seem similar to flooding from sea level rise and in some ways a basement full of water is the same whether its freshwater or seawater. But there is a difference. Floods eventually recede. Even with climate change, it might be 10 or 50 years before another flood occurs in that location. Sea level rise not only doesnt recede, it will keep rising for the foreseeable future. If the sea is lapping at your driveway at high tide, it will be at your doorstep in time. If you are in doubt about whether your home could be affected by sea level rise, its not too soon to start thinking about moving inland, whether thats a just mile to higher ground or to another state. Boise, Idaho, is lovely and livable. Hotter Summers Government maps can help you estimate how much hotter itll get where you live. Phoenix, for example, is expected to go from about 92 days a year over 100 degrees F to 132 days a year by 2060. Until you move to (really lovely) Boise, here are a few things that will help protect your house from extreme heat: Paint your house white, and use the palest roofing you can find. Plant trees around your house to provide shade. Seal every crack in your attic. Insulate the attic and walls. Dont run an attic fanit may cool off the attic, but it will suck cool air right out of your house. Seal all gaps around electrical outlets or pipes coming through the wall. Weather strip your doors and replace leaky windows. Use fans to pull in cooler air in at night. Extreme Wind Hurricanes are becoming more powerful and more common. This is because warmer ocean water adds energy to tropical storms as they form. Meanwhile, tornados are occurring farther east than they used to and even showing up in unlikely places, such as California. Both kinds of extreme wind destroy buildings by ripping off roofs and hurling heavy objects through the air. Most building codes were written for relatively mild winds. You can build a house like this one that will withstand a category 5 hurricane. But if thats not in your budget, make your own house a bit sturdier with wind-resistant roofing, garage doors, and storm shutters. As always, be prepared to evacuate to a safer place when hurricanes are headed for your house.","Climate change used to seem like something that would confront our grandchildren—a distant concern.

Kirk Brown,"The latest forecast from the National Weather Service calls for Greenville to receive 5 inches of snow this weekend, with 4 inches expected in Clemson and 2 inches in Anderson. (Photo: Contributed photo) How much snow and ice should residents in Greenville, Anderson and other parts of the Upstate expect this weekend? It depends on which forecaster you trust and when you check the latest predictions. Meteorologists with the National Weather Service, WYFF-TV, other Upstate stations and national outlets such as The Weather Channel and AccuWeather are all predicting that a major winter storm will affect the area from Saturday night into Monday. Their descriptions of the storm are nothing short of dire. The National Weather Service warned that the storm could be a ""once-in-a-generation event."" A story posted on AccuWeather's website Thursday morning said it ""may hit like a sledgehammer."" The Weather Channel has dubbed the approaching system ""Winter Storm Diego."" More: Greenville snow forecast: What we know More: Anderson winter weather forecast: 'Particularly bad' Sunday But the details of forecasts for the storm vary in terms of snow and ice totals. Complicating matters further, the forecasts fluctuated throughout the day Thursday. The National Weather Service issued an outlook on Thursday morning calling for Greenville to receive around 5 inches of snow, with about 4 inches falling in Clemson and 2 inches in Anderson. The weather service also prediced 14-16 inches of snow in portions of the North Carolina mountains. But by Thursday afternoon, the weather service had revised those totals downward. The afternoon forecast predicted that Greenville will see only 2 inches of snow, with less than an inch in Clemson and no measurable snowfall in Anderson. The updated forecast still calls for parts of the North Carolina mountains to receive around a foot of snow. In a midday broadcast Thursday, WYFF meteorologist Dale Gilbert said 3 to 6 inches of snow may fall north of Interstate 85, with 6 to 12 inches or more in the Upstate mountains. ""A swath of North Carolina could exceed some of the record amounts in the past,"" Gilbert said. ""There's the potential for a foot to over 18 inches of snow."" WSPA meteorologist Christy Henderson said Thursday morning that the North Carolina mountains could receive ""huge totals"" of snow of up to 20 inches. Fox Carolina meteorologist Nicole Papay offered a more restrained prognosis on Thursday, saying the Upstate ""will see a wintry mix with some light snow accumulations."" Ice may pose the greatest threat from the storm in Anderson and other areas south of Interstate 85. ""The potential exists for a corridor of significant ice accumulation across the areas south of Interstate 85 Saturday night and Sunday morning,"" states a hazardous weather outlook issued by the National Weather Service. According to the weather service's afternoon update, Anderson may receive about.05 inches of ice. Henderson echoed the concern about ice, according to a video posted on WSPA's website.

Dangerous winter weather slams U.S.
A large, powerful and dangerous winter storm is taking aim at about one-third of the nation this weekend. It rapidly moved from the Central Plains to the Midwest and is moving toward the Northeast and New England. Some northern areas of New England could see up to 18 inches of snow.
The storm is expected to drop snow, sleet, freezing rain and ice in many places. After that, temperatures are expected to turn bitterly cold.
Follow along below for updates:
Slick road leads to 15-vehicle Missouri pileup
A 15-vehicle crash has blocked a section of Interstate 55 in southeastern Missouri as snow from a massive winter storm swept through the area and slicked roads.
The Missouri Department of Transportation issued the news of the pileup near Ste. Genevieve on its Twitter page around 4 p.m. Saturday. The department says the interstate was blocked because of the crash, which included a responding firetruck. Motorists were urged to find an alternate route. There was no immediate word on injuries.
Transportation officials said crews hoped to clear the interstate's lanes within a few hours, but said snowfall was slowing that work.
Officials say many roads in Missouri have been slicked over with ice from rain earlier in the day before conditions turned to snow and plummeting temperatures.
Plane skids from runway at Chicago airport
A United Airlines plane has skidded off a runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport amid snowy and icy weather. Chicago fire officials say the incident occurred Saturday morning. No injuries were reported. The flight came into the airport from Phoenix and 129 people were on the plane.
A massive winter storm has brought up to 10 inches of snow to some parts of the Midwest and is expected to hit the Northeast on Sunday.
The storm prompted the cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights at Chicago's airports on Saturday. The average delay at O'Hare International Airport was nearly an hour on Saturday afternoon.
Winter storm doesn't stop some Midwesterners
Many people across the Midwest woke up to see a coating of snow or ice on Saturday. Areas where the storm had already moved out by midday faced bitter cold and strong winds.
Some Midwesterns didn't let it keep the indoors. Celeste Tremmel was outside in Detroit on Saturday training for a marathon. The 56-year-old chugged slowly through the several-inch-deep snow.
""When you run a marathon, you run no matter the weather,"" she said.
Tremmel said running in snow is ""like running in sand, so you have to go a lot slower.""
Connecticut governor to hold news briefing
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont held a news briefing Saturday at 6:30 p.m. ET to update residents as the state prepares for the storm.
Lamont announced on Saturday that he will ""partially activate"" Connecticut's Emergency Operations Center starting at 6:00 p.m. to monitor storm conditions.
""Forecasts are showing a range of accumulating snow, sleet, and freezing rain,"" his office said in a news release Saturday.
1,600 plows being deployed across NYC
Salt spreaders are hitting the streets as the Tri-State area prepares for the winter weather headed its way, CBS New York reported.
About 700 spreaders and 1,600 plows will be deployed this weekend across New York City. Extra precautions are being taken to make sure the city is better prepared than it was just a few months ago, when thousands of drivers were stalled in traffic all night during a minor snowstorm.
This time, public works and utility crews were getting prepared on Friday.
Officials warn of flight disruptions
Officials have warned of flight disruptions at airports, as well as possible changes in train schedules.
By Saturday morning, 1,135 flights within, into or out of the U.S. were canceled for Saturday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport reported that airlines there canceled nearly 470 flights ""due to overnight snow and strong winds expected throughout the day."" It advised travelers to get updates from airlines.
Due to overnight snow and strong winds expected throughout the day, airlines at ORD have cancelled nearly 470 flights. For most up to date flight info, check directly with carrier.
— O'Hare Intl. Airport (@fly2ohare) January 19, 2019
Amtrak canceled some trains Saturday from Chicago to Washington and New York and between New York and Boston and Pennsylvania on Sunday.
Chicago is forecast to receive as much as 8 inches by Saturday and wind gusts in the Chicago area are expected to reach 35 mph.
N.J. and Pennsylvania declare states of emergency
On Friday, New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency.
""This storm has the potential to deliver every, every winter weather option that mother nature has,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolfe said at a news conference.
In New Jersey, the state of emergency will go into effect at noon Saturday. ""Our top priority is the safety of New Jerseyans, and we urge residents to stay off the roads and prepare for potential power outages,"" said Gov. Phil Murphy.
Winter storm warnings issued for the weekend
The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for the weekend from the Dakotas across the Great Lakes states and into New England. It warned that conditions in the Northeast ""could approach blizzard criteria.""
The National Weather Service in Albany, New York, said snow could fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches an hour, creating ""difficult to impossible travel conditions"" in areas. Ice was also a possibility in some areas in the path of the storm, which was forecast to dump up to 2 feet of snow.
In New York City, the worst of the storm is expected from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon, with snow accumulations of 3-6 inches followed by rain that could turn to ice as temperatures drop later Sunday. Single-digit temperatures could last into Monday.

,"At a Glance
Winter Storm Eboni will intensify in the Plains and Midwest midweek.
Parts of the Plains and Midwest will see strong winds and significant snow.
Some communities in the northern Plains may see near-blizzard conditions.
Snow may also affect northern New England late this week.
Winter Storm Eboni will track into the Plains midweek where it will intensify and lay down an expansive swath of wind-driven snow.
Eboni will then spread snow into parts of the upper Midwest and northern New England through Friday.
Eboni was named late on Mon., Dec. 24 with the expectation that area criteria winter storm warnings for 400,000 square kilometers or more would be met later in the week. Both area and population criteria was reached Tuesday afternoon. 
(MORE: The Science Behind Naming Winter Storms at The Weather Channel)
Happening Now
Snow continues to fall across parts of the central and southern Rockies and has spread into portions of the northern and central Plains. 
Eboni brought more than a foot of snow to the Sierra on Christmas Eve into early Christmas morning. 
Winter storm warnings have been issued by the National Weather Service from southern Colorado northeastward to Minnesota and far northwestern Wisconsin. Heavy snow and blowing snow are expected to make travel dangerous in these areas. 
Near-blizzard conditions  including low visibility and blowing snow are possible in parts of the Dakotas late Wednesday into Thursday.
Winter weather advisories are also in place for parts of the Rockies, northern Plains and upper Midwest where travel could be tricky through midweek. 
(From the National Weather Service.)
Day-By-Day Forecast
Winter Storm Eboni will emerge and strengthen in the central Plains midweek as an upper-level trough a southward dip in the jet stream ejects out of the West.
(MORE: Severe Storms, Heavy Rain Threaten the South Midweek)
Temperatures are expected to be cold enough on the northern side of this storm for significant amounts of snow to fall from the northern and central Plains into the upper Midwest and northern Great Lakes region.
Wednesday
Snow or a rain-and-snow mixture may affect a swath from the southern Rockies into northwestern Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
Many areas of eastern Colorado, western Kansas and western Nebraska will see the precipitation start as rain but then change to freezing rain and snow Wednesday night.
Snow will spread through much of Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan later Wednesday or Wednesday night.
Increasing winds are also expected in the Plains and upper Midwest and near-blizzard conditions are possible in parts of western Kansas Wednesday night.
Snow will linger from New Mexico and northeastern Arizona northward into Colorado, Wyoming and eastern Montana.
(The green shadings depict where rain is expected. Areas that are shaded blue are expected to see snow. Purple-shaded locations may see either rain or snow. Areas in pink are expected to see sleet or freezing rain (ice).)
Thursday
Snow or a rain-and-snow mixture will affect areas from western Kansas to Nebraska, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and northern Michigan.
Increasing winds are also likely through the Plains and upper Midwest, which will reduce visibility where snow is falling. 
Depending on the strength of the winds, we could see near-blizzard conditions develop in parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska, Kansas and northern Minnesota.
Some areas will see a change in precipitation type, including Minneapolis which will see snow change to rain.
Snow, sleet and freezing rain will spread into parts of New England and eastern New York Thursday night.
(The green shadings depict where rain is expected. Areas that are shaded blue are expected to see snow. Purple-shaded locations may see either rain or snow. Areas in pink are expected to see sleet or freezing rain (ice).)
Friday

Portions of northern New England and northeastern New York could see snow or a mix of rain, snow, sleet and freezing rain persist through Friday.
(The green shadings depict where rain is expected. Areas that are shaded blue are expected to see snow. Purple-shaded locations may see either rain or snow. Areas in pink are expected to see sleet or freezing rain (ice).)
How Much Snow?
At least 6 inches of snow is expected in a swath from parts of Colorado northeastward through the eastern Dakotas and into northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. More than a foot of snow is possible in eastern South Dakota, southeastern North Dakota and in parts of central and northern Minnesota.
Gusty winds will lead to blowing and drifting snow that may create snow drifts several feet high. 
The trickiest forecast for snowfall totals is for cities along the southern edge of the expected snowfall, which could see rain and snow. Minneapolis and Sioux Falls, South Dakota are two examples. 
Keep in mind, the area of heaviest snow could shift farther north or south in future forecast updates based on the track of the storm.
Farther east, more than 6 inches of snow is most likely in northern New Hampshire and northern Maine.
Light snowfall is possible in parts of southern New England but little to no snow accumulation is currently anticipated in Boston, Providence and Hartford. 
Winter Storm Recap
The low pressure system that became Winter Storm Eboni came ashore near the California/Oregon border on Christmas Eve with an area of snowfall and coastal rain. 
The system created a dip in the jet stream over the Southwest on Christmas where Eboni dropped snow across the Four Corners and the Tetons.

From staff reports,"A winter storm warning is in place for Southern Virginia including Halifax County as a developing winter storm aims to dump as much as a foot of snow in some areas. The warning is in effect from midnight Saturday through 11 a.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The exact track of the storm will determine accumulations, but the weather service pegs totals in the range of 4 to 12 inches. The evolving storm is an area of low pressure predicted to track Saturday from Texas across the Gulf Coast. Meanwhile, an area of cold high pressure is driving down to the South. With the cold air in place and plenty of moisture, a prolonged period of snow is expected. For Halifax County, snow may begin falling around 6 a.m. Sunday. While some sleet could mix in later Sunday and keep snow totals lower, the weather service expected the heaviest snow to fall across northwest North Carolina into Southern Virginia. Ahead of the possible crippling snowfall, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency Virginians should take all necessary precautions to ensure they are prepared for winter weather storm impacts, Northam said in a statement. I am declaring a state of emergency to ensure localities and communities have appropriate assistance and to coordinate state response to possible snow and ice accumulations, transportation issues, and potential power outages.

The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings or advisories for parts or all of at least eight states, and states of emergencies were declared in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Amtrak has canceled some trains along the northeast corridor, and more than 9,000 flights were delayed or canceled on Sunday according to FlightAware.com. 
Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, told NPR, ""The storm is currently located near the New Jersey and Long Island coasts, and it's going to track to the northeast across Cape Cod, and just off shore of Maine tonight, into early Monday morning.""
""We've seen reports of over a quarter to a half inch plus of freezing rain accretion, which I imagine is going to have a detrimental effect on power lines and tree limbs,"" Otto continued. ""You combine the ice and snow, with what is expected to come later this evening and tonight, which is a strong push of cold air, and strong winds, with gusts anywhere from 20 to 40 miles an hour, locally higher, along the coast, and that's going to likely generate a lot of power outages, beyond what already might be occurring across New England."" 
Meteorologists say the storm was created by a clash of an Arctic high pressure system with a low pressure system in the Ohio Valley. As ice accumulated on trees and power lines, Connecticut utilities reported more than 14,000 customers are without power. The storm brought up to 11 inches of snow to parts of upstate New York overnight. In New York City, snow was followed by rain, which is expected to turn into ice later on Sunday, while some areas in New England could see up to 2 feet of snow. 
The storm will leave frigid air in its wake, with arctic wind chill temperatures as low as 35 below zero expected in Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency has warned temperatures could fall as low as 30 below zero in the Berkshires this evening.

On Saturday the storm dumped 10 inches of snow on parts of the Midwest, left more than 13,000 power outages in the state of Ohio, and created havoc for many travelers throughout the region. In Kansas, a snowplow driver was killed when the plow drove onto the shoulder of a road, turned over and rolled on top of him. Slick roads led to a 15-vehicle pileup in Missouri, and a United Airlines plane skidded off the runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Saturday morning. 
Otto told NPR he expects cold winter weather to continue to envelop much of the eastern U.S. for the next few weeks. ""Looking at the Climate Prediction Center's outlook over the next one to two weeks, it's favoring high confidence for well below average temperatures over the eastern half of the nation,"" he said.","The storm barreled through New England after hitting the Midwest, creating havoc along some transportation routes.",2019-01-20T17:43:11Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Winter Storm Grounds Flights, Delays Trains And Knocks Out Power",https://www.npr.org/2019/01/20/687000735/winter-storm-grounds-flights-delays-trains-and-knocks-out-power,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/20/ap_19020512170209_wide-26e8ef94f76c972743ada8d4335c94a6c2384113.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,ice storm,1
"Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)Whether by car, train or airplane, Sunday travelers can expect significant delays and dangerous conditions because of a snowstorm moving east. 
Amtrak announced modified service for more than 20 trains on Sunday because of inclement weather, after canceling service for six trains on Saturday.
Snow and wind caused the cancellation of more than 650 flights at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Saturday and resulted in an average delay of 50 minutes, the airport said. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, crews were working to keep runways clear Saturday night, the airport said, as it encouraged travelers to confirm upcoming flights with airlines.
JetBlue announced that it has ""proactively cancelled approximately 770 flights through Monday.""
Delta Airlines has issued travel waivers so passengers scheduled on northeastern flights affected by the weather can reschedule.
Meanwhile, two people were killed and two injured in a car accident on a snow-covered, slippery road in Kohler, Wisconsin late Friday night, according to CNN affiliate WDJT.
The four had been traveling in a vehicle that struck a tree, according to WDJT. Police are still investigating the cause of the accident, WDJT reported.
Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories were in effect Sunday morning across a large portion of the country from the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians to the northern Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service.
The winter storm is expected to drop ""moderate to heavy snow"" Sunday morning across the upper Ohio Valley and into northwest Pennsylvania and the interior of New York and New England, the NWS said.
While snowfall is expected to taper off in the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians during the day, heavy snowfall -- as much as 1-2 inches in some places -- will continue in parts of New York and New England through Sunday night, the weather service said.
New York City can expect cold rain, and Boston will see a mix of heavy, wet snow, sleet and ice through the morning, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. 
The storm has brought harsh conditions across the Midwest and through to the East coast this weekend. 
Following a forecast of more than half an inch of freezing rain between northern New Jersey and southern New England, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning at noon Saturday. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state starting at 3 p.m. Saturday.
On Saturday, more than 100 million people were under some form of winter storm watch, warning or advisory from Missouri to Maine.
'Some of the coldest temperatures of the season'
The National Weather Service said Saturday the Midwest and East Coast can expect ""some of the coldest temperatures of the season by Monday morning.""
Temperatures are expected to drop so fast in some areas that any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects would likely freeze.
Highs on Sunday in the Kansas City, Missouri, area -- where the Chiefs will be host to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game -- will be in the 20s.
The extreme cold will follow the storm and move into the rest of the eastern United States on Monday.
Monday's expected high in Boston is 11 degrees, and New York City will top out at 14 degrees. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency is warning residents the wind chill could drop as low as 20 degrees below zero early Monday.
This arctic air is expected to spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

PATRICK McGEEHAN,"The proposed changes represent “a much stronger hand on the part of the airport in terms of setting operating standards,” Mr. Cotton said. He said the Port Authority would make “a stronger commitment to articulating performance standards and to enforcing them.” The new rule on flights bound for Kennedy when a winter storm is forecast is an unusual restriction, airline industry officials said. The managers at Kennedy may recommend the cancellation of flights scheduled to arrive when storm conditions are predicted to be severe. If an airline decides to launch a flight anyway, it will have to obtain an assurance from a terminal operator that a gate will be available when the plane touches down. That is a departure from standard practices, said Perry Flint, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines. In Europe, he said, airlines are required to have a landing slot, but not necessarily a gate, reserved at destination airports. Mr. Cotton said he was not aware of another airport requiring prior assurance that a gate would be available. That restriction is appropriate at Kennedy, he said, because so much of its traffic is long-haul flights from overseas. The need for it became apparent after Kennedy was overwhelmed in January with more planes arriving than some terminals could handle. In normal conditions, terminal operators and their airline tenants manage to get planes in and out of gates fast enough to keep up with the inbound traffic. But in the days after the snowstorm that swept up the East Coast on Jan. 4, frozen equipment and staffing shortages slowed operations and left some planes parked for hours without gate assignments. In some cases, the Port Authority had to send staircases and buses to rescue passengers from stranded planes. Mr. Flint said his transport association, which has a liaison stationed at the Federal Aviation Administration’s command center in Virginia, had agreed to help facilitate communication between international airlines and the Port Authority and terminal operators. “We look forward to working with the Port Authority and all stakeholders to collaboratively develop procedures based on industry best practices and expertise that will enhance the customer experience going forward,” Mr. Flint said in a statement. Inside two of the terminals at Kennedy in January, baggage-handling procedures broke down, leaving hundreds of pieces of luggage piled up in waiting areas. Some travelers did not get their bags back for days. To prevent a recurrence, Port Authority officials said they would require terminal operators to have a common baggage-service office for airlines that do not have their own. Mr. Cotton said the agency would impose this obligation “so a passenger who is looking for their bag has a clear place to go.” Huntley A. Lawrence, who oversees the airports for the Port Authority, said the agency also would take inventory of all of the equipment at the airport in case it needs to ask an airline to lend a spare piece, “so when you have a winter storm emergency, you’re not scrambling around.” The Port Authority’s primary responsibility in a winter storm is to clear snow and ice from the runways and taxiways. After the January storm, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would investigate how the Port Authority handled snow removal. Mr. Lawrence said he has not learned of the conclusion of that investigation, but the Port Authority has already decided to add snow-moving equipment. “We did see this winter a lot of heavy wet snow,” Mr. Lawrence said. “The heavy, wet snow is more difficult to move.” He said the agency would spend $3.5 million on four snow blowers and $1.4 million on four plows.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Motorists and pedestrians in Ukraine struggle with snow after heavy falls Severe weather continues to bring chaos to large parts of Europe, where at least 55 people have died amid sub-zero temperatures. Most transport and flights have been suspended in Ireland where strong winds brought by a storm left some 24,000 homes and businesses without power. Several other countries have faced disruptions caused by snow and ice. The death toll rose in Poland, and the public has been told to alert officials if they see people sleeping outside. The unusually cold spell brought by a Siberian weather system was being felt as far south as the balmy Mediterranean. Where are the problems? The system has been given various nicknames - in the UK it is ""the Beast from the East"" while the Dutch call it the ""Siberian bear"" and Swedes the ""snow cannon"". It met Storm Emma on Thursday, causing blizzards and strong winds in parts of England, Wales and Ireland. Media caption How to keep warm? Tips from cold countries Flights in and out of Dublin and Cork airports were suspended until Saturday at the earliest. All schools in the country were shut and people were urged not to drive.

Where have the deaths been? In Poland, at least 21 people have died, most of them rough-sleepers. The high death toll is partially attributed to a combination of the severe cold and alcohol consumption by homeless people, who drink hoping to warm up, the BBC's Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton reports.

Andrew Freedman,"If you're planning on celebrating Christmas in the Upper Midwest or the Dakotas this year, you're going to need to get a thicker coat. A true Arctic air mass — the coldest of the season so far — is projected to swirl down from the Far North, crossing the U.S. border with Canada as early as Wednesday, and potentially oozing its way all the way down to Texas, and east to New York City. Right now, however, it appears the East Coast may escape the worst of the cold, at least initially. SEE ALSO: Emmanuel Macron lures top U.S. climate scientists fleeing from Trump research cuts The precise details of this cold snap are still a bit fuzzy, specifically concerning whether a winter storm develops along the boundary separating the frigid air from more seasonable temperatures. It's conceivable that areas from Texas to New England could have a white or icy Christmas this year, though this won't become clear for another few days. In Denver, Christmas Eve could see temperatures as cold as 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit below average, according to computer model guidance. On Christmas Day itself, the core of the coldest air may be located over the big cities of the Midwest, including Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago. While low temperatures may plunge below zero Fahrenheit, this cold snap is not likely to break many records, in part because of the lack of widespread snow cover across the U.S. Intensity of Arctic blasts can be concisely described by the lowest 850-hPa pressure level temperature... -32°C over North Dakota on Christmas Eve morning beneath lobe of tropopause Polar Vortex. Not too bad. pic.twitter.com/wvrdOSzjAa — Ryan Maue | weather.us (@RyanMaue) December 18, 2017 As detailed in a post by the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang blog, computer model projections do not yet agree on whether the frigid weather will move far enough east to affect the heavily-populated corridor from Washington, D.C. to Boston. The cold blast will have the opposite affect in the Arctic, where unusually mild temperatures for this time of year (it will still be cold, just not as cold as usual) are forecast. Temperatures in Alaska could be 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit above average, while Arctic-wide temperatures also look to be far above average as well. The development of this warm Arctic, cold continents pattern is something researchers have been noticing that appears to be occurring more frequently during recent winters. The pattern is consistent with recent changes in the wintertime jet stream, which some scientists think is tied to the loss of Arctic sea ice. However, this is still an area of active research, with no clear consensus yet. Despite the 24-hour darkness in the Arctic, sea ice extent is still running well below average for this time of year. Computer model projection showing unusually mild air across Alaska and other parts of the Arctic Ocean on Dec. 23, 2017. Image: weatherbell On Monday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that the average Arctic sea ice extent during November was 11.6 percent below the 1981-2010 average. This was the third-smallest since records began in 1979. The average Arctic sea ice coverage in November was 11.6 percent below the 1981-2010 average, the third-smallest since records began in 1979. The Chukchi and Bering Seas off the northwest coast of Alaska were almost completely devoid of sea ice, which has been altering the weather across Alaska and adjacent parts of Russia as well. This is causing problems for animals as well as human populations that rely on the sea ice for hunting prey. The biggest issue remains the uncertainty associated with the upcoming anticyclonic wave break over the North Pacific-Alaska next week. The weaker upstream Pacific Blocking scenario pushes arctic cold across the East much quicker than the stronger block scenarios. — Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) December 18, 2017 One of the main reasons for the cold snap will be a major northward bulge, or ridge, in the jet stream across the West, which will exacerbate California's wildfire problem. The Thomas Fire near Ventura and Santa Barbara is likely to become the state's largest blaze on record since reliable data began in 1932. On the flip side of that ridge is a southward dip, or trough, in the upper level winds, which will help transport the frigid air into middle America.","If you're planning on celebrating Christmas in the Upper Midwest or the Dakotas this year, you're going to need to get a thicker coat.

KUT Staff,"The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for all of South Central Texas, calling for a mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow on Tuesday – with freezing temperatures extending into Wednesday. A cold front moved through early this morning and temperatures are below freezing across most areas. Up to a 10th of an inch of ice is expected, creating dangerous conditions on the roads. Icy roads were already being reported as of 6 a.m., and the Austin Police Department is advising drivers to stay off the roads unless it is an emergency. The 5700 block of SH45 is completely iced over. Ice is reported and there is one crash at 71 EB at the 130 Toll Road Stay off the roads! #atxwx #ATXTraffic — Austin Police Dept (@Austin_Police) January 16, 2018 The Texas Department of Transportation said crews were out Sunday putting a de-icing solution on bridges, overpasses and the main lanes of major highways. TxDOT spokesman Chris Bishop said the goal is to keep at least one lane open for emergency vehicles and that early treatment helps because it will be reactivated by any moisture that hits it. “It’s kind of a preemptive strike,"" he said, ""trying to get ahead of any ice that would form beforehand, so that once things start happening with freezing rain or sleet or whatever’s going to come down, it buys time for us to get crews out to start the continuous treatment on the roads.” Still a handful of flyovers or overpasses – including the Ben White flyover at I-35, the Highway 290 eastbound flyover at I-35 and a section of State Highway 45 near Escarpment Drive – are closed or iced over, according to APD. The National Weather Service advises drivers to avoid flyovers and overpasses, as ice, sleet and possible snow accumulations could top a quarter-inch. Yvette Benavides, a meteorologist at the local office of the National Weather Service, said the area will probably see Tuesday's high temperature early in the morning. “And once we drop below freezing, it will stay below freezing until about Wednesday afternoon,"" she said, ""so any ice that does accumulate on the roads or anywhere else is likely to stay until Wednesday morning.” Closures, Delays And Cancellations In anticipation of the ice, the following school districts are closed Tuesday: Austin Bastrop Del Valle Dripping Springs Eanes Elgin Georgetown Hays Hutto Jarrell Lago Vista Lake Travis Leander Lockhart Manor Pflugerville Round Rock San Marcos Wimberley UT-Austin, Austin Community College, St. Edwards, Huston-Tillotson, Concordia, Southwestern and Texas State University's Round Rock and San Marcos campuses are also closed. Here's Everything You Need To Prepare For The Frigid Front Heading Our Way Capital Metro said local bus routes will operate on a Sunday schedule Tuesday. There will be no MetroRail or MetroExpress service. Pickup services at Round Rock and Georgetown will not operate today. Meals on Wheels said it was forced to cancel deliveries Tuesday. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport says airlines had begun canceling arrivals after 8 p.m. Monday; that could affect departures. Travelers should check flight statuses on the ABIA website under ""Real Time Arrivals and Departures."" So far, 77 flights were canceled as of 8:30 Tuesday morning. Austin Resource Recovery says curbside pickup in Austin is suspended today, with pickup shifting to tomorrow. Service in Round Rock is also suspended. City offices in Austin, Round Rock, Taylor and Pflugerville are closed. Travis, Williamson, Bastrop and Hays counties are also closed today. Austin Energy is already handling outages across its service area, with roughly 45 customers experiencing outages. Austin Energy spokesperson Jennifer Herber told KUT residents can conserve energy for shortages and outages by opening shades to bring in heat during daylight hours, setting the thermostat to about 68 degrees if leaving the house for long periods of time, and washing clothes in cold water. Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative is reporting six customers without power Tuesday morning, and asks customers experiencing outages to call 800-949-4414. Pedernales Electric Cooperative says 65 of its customers are without power. To report outage call 888-883-3379 Brett Williams, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services' Austin/San Antonio office, says South Central Texas should see periods of freezing rain, sleet and snow throughout the rest of Tuesday morning, with precipitation dying down this afternoon. Still, he says, freezing temperatures are expected to continue until noon on Wednesday. ""We’re not going to get above freezing today so whatever ends up accumulating on the roadways will most likely remain there,"" he said. ""So icy conditions may persist throughout the afternoon, evening hours.” Yesterday, Gov.

"Joseph A. Gambardello, Anthony R. Wood","A surprisingly vigorous snowfall from a potent winter storm has blanketed the Philadelphia region with heavy snow, icing streets, snarling traffic, and triggering a rash of early closings. The National Weather Service now is calling for 3 to 5 inches in the immediate Philadelphia area. ""We're in the process of updating the forecast,"" said Al Cope, science and operation officer at the weather service office in Mount Holly. Earlier forecasts had called for up to an inch in the city, but at 1 p.m. 2.4 inches had been reported at the official measuring station at Philadelphia International Airport. The first flakes were reported at 10 a.m. at the airport, fortunately coming after the peak morning commute. Then came the surprise. The snow was supposed to mix with sleet and rain, but didn't. ""We thought it was going to be more mix,"" Cope said. However, the temperatures at the surface and in the upper atmosphere stayed colder than expected. It was clear by lunchtime that some places were going to get more snow than expected. A National Weather Service spotter in Radnor Township, Delaware County, reported on phillywx.com that an inch of snow was measured at 11:45 a.m. Not long afterward, another spotter in East Nantmeal, Chester County, reported close to 3 inches. At 1 p.m., ""heavy snow"" was falling, with visibilities of just a quarter mile. Drivers were reporting messy, potentially hazardous, conditions on highways and SEPTA is advising Regional Rail passengers to expect delays of up to 15 minutes due to slippery rails. SEPTA also said the Route 35 bus was suspended until further notice due to road conditions and that service on bus Routes 9, 27, and 65 would terminate at Wissahickon Transportation Center. A Winter Weather Advisory for the region has been extended until 6 p.m. and now includes Jersey Shore counties that had been excluded from the earlier advisory. The advancing storm prompted Central Bucks School District to close for the day, while a number of other school districts in the suburbs announced early dismissals. Chester County government shut down at 2 p.m. The forecast said the snow should change to combination of sleet and freezing rain later in the day in the immediate Philadelphia area before turning to rain after nightfall. The wintry precipitation, however, is likely to last longer north and west of the city, where the affected school districts are located, and the Poconos could get up to four inches of snow by Friday morning. The city of Philadelphia declared a code blue aimed at assisting people experiencing homelessness in cold weather. Further south in the Mid-Atlantic, the storm blanketed the Washington, D.C., area with snow. PennDOT in the meantime dispatched trucks to brine major roadways in advance of the moisture-rich storm's arrival and Philadelphia International Airport is advising anyone who plans to fly today to check with their airline before heading to the airport. The weather service says that after the precipitation turns to all rain, there will be an increased potential for flooding, mainly across southern and coastal New Jersey and the Delmarva peninsula.

MANNY FERNANDEZ and MITCHELL FERMAN,"For parents who have in many cases spent weeks in detention, struggling to learn the whereabouts of their children, their ordeal does not end once they are reunited. Lives remain in upheaval: They are led to other shelters, obtain donated clothes, line up for food and rely on others to arrange their bus and air travel as they head for the cities around the country where their relatives live. Top officials in the Valley have pitched in. The ice-cream delivery was coordinated in part by the mayor of McAllen, Jim Darling. A local Dairy Queen owner read about separated families, called Mr. Darling and offered to donate Dilly Bars. The mayor contacted Sister Norma Pimentel, the Catholic nun known for her work helping undocumented adults and children. Sister Pimentel — the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley — asked for 400 bars, and Dairy Queen made the delivery Tuesday at the church, a tourist attraction called the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of San Juan del Valle. “It’s unfortunate that we have had to deal with it for so long, but we’re proud to do it,” Mr. Darling said of the city’s yearslong assistance in helping the immigrants who are periodically released by federal authorities in McAllen. San Juan and McAllen have become hubs for the newly reunified families largely because of its location near the Port Isabel detention center, an ICE facility where many of the families in South Texas have been reunited. After children and parents are brought back together, the families are driven to the Basilica in San Juan. From there, volunteers and others take some of them to the airport in McAllen. Laura Torres, 47, a Desert Storm Army veteran who lives in McAllen, served as a volunteer airport driver for the families. Her neighbor asked her to help, and so on Tuesday, she picked up four mothers and their four children at the Basilica, drove them to the airport and helped make sure they got on their flights to various cities where they will join their relatives.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A major winter storm will start hitting the U.S Southeast up through New England on Wednesday with freezing rain, snow and strong winds, adding to record-shattering cold that is keeping its grip on much of the eastern United States. The winter mix along with low wind chills could cause widespread power outages and ice over roadways, making commuting treacherous for millions of Americans from northern Florida to southern Virginia, the National Weather Service said in a series of warnings. “Travel will be dangerous and nearly impossible, including during the morning commute on Wednesday,” the service said in an advisory for northeastern Florida. Eastern Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia will get as much as 6 inches (15 cm) of snow along with an accumulation of ice while parts of New England could see 12 to 15 inches (30-38 cm) of snow and wind gusts of 35 mph (55 kph) by the end of week, the service said. Late on Tuesday, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 28 counties after the National Weather Service issued the winter storm warning. Florida Governor Rick Scott on Tuesday urged residents in the northern part of his Sunshine State to prepare for the cold. His office said cold weather shelters have opened or are planning to open in 22 of the state’s 67 counties. As the storm bears down, an arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two thirds of the country through the end of the week. The record-low temperatures is to blame for at least eight deaths in Texas, Wisconsin, West Virginia, North Dakota and Michigan over the past several days. A large swath of the Midwest was under a wind chill warning early on Wednesday as places like Cleveland and Indianapolis had temperatures in the wind of 5 to 20 degrees below zero in Fahrenheit ( minus 20 to minus 29 degrees Celsius) while the deep South faced deep freeze temperatures that threatened crops and pipes, the National Weather Service warned.

Ryan Truchelut,"WeatherTiger's Ryan Truchelut gives you all the information you need to stay warm and dry. Mixed and/or Frozen Precipitation Chances (Photo: National Weather Service) North Florida, this is happening. It’s been four years since the last significant frozen precipitation in the Big Bend and nearly three decades since the last measurable snowfall in Tallahassee in December 1989. But I can say with confidence that a messy mix of ice, sleet and snow will likely be outside your door Wednesday morning. Some are even calling this winter storm the Snolepocalypse. You may now rush to Publix to purchase your emergency French toast supplies of bread, milk and eggs. Looking at the meteorological set-up, the key pieces needed to square the circle of Florida snow have fallen into place in the last few days. First, a powerful Arctic high pressure system over the mid-South has brought in rare sub-freezing temperatures at the surface. Next, a tropical air mass remains lurking over the southern Gulf and Bahamas to provide moisture. Finally, a pair of upper-level disturbances, the matches for low-pressure development, are diving south out of the Plains. Minus the presence of the Val ""Iceman"" Kilmer himself, the pattern could not be more favorable. WINTER STORM WARNING: As uncertainty regarding these ingredients has decreased, both global and mesoscale weather models have converged on a solution in which Tallahassee is on the western edge of a zone of frozen precipitation that will extend west to between Lake City and Jacksonville. In Tallahassee, a wintry mix is likely to start after 3 a.m. and end before 11 a.m., and is likely to be formidable enough for a time to make driving dangerous. For this reason, the National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for Leon County and east effective through noon Wednesday. There are two major uncertainties to discuss. The first is precipitation amount. Model ensembles have trended higher over the last few days and are now in good agreement that Tallahassee will receive more than just a trace of frozen precipitation. While the most likely liquid-equivalent amount total is around 0.1"" (50 percent chance), Tallahassee sits on a sharp gradient in expected totals between very little precipitation to our west and 0.5"" or more toward Lake City.

(Photo: Hali Tauxe/Democrat) It is plausible but not likely that a small shift east would bring these heavier amounts into Tallahassee, dramatically upping our impacts (20 percent chance). Also possible — though not expected — is the scenario in which accumulating wintry precipitation stays just to our south and east (30 percent chance), and Tallahassee sees just a few stray flakes or sleet pings. The second uncertainty is precipitation type, which is notoriously difficult to forecast until a winter storm is under way. That's because a powerful storm like this one turns the atmosphere into a complex layer cake of above and below freezing levels, into which snowflakes aloft fall, melt, and potentially refreeze. Freezing rain occurs when a relatively thinner layer at the surface is below a melting band, while ice pellets occur when the surface cold layer is thicker. Based on current trends and short-range ensembles, I believe the most likely outcome in Tallahassee is for sleet to be dominant in the first half of the storm, with a change-over to some light snow in the latter half. A good rule of thumb in these kind of marginal winter events is that 0.1 inch of rain is the equivalent of around 0.75 inches of snow, so as indicated by the NWS, there is potential for up to 1 inch of snow accumulations should it be the dominant precipitation type. More likely, however, is a thin coating on grassy surfaces. Further east towards Lake City, freezing rain is likely to be more prominent in the wintry mix. Glaze is very destructive to trees and power lines, especially our sprawling oaks, so any trend further west with the track of the low is Tallahassee’s worst-case scenario. This would mean not only heavier overall accumulations, but a higher chance of ice damage and power outages. Overall, while precipitation type is the least confident part of the forecast, I do not see a trend towards heavier icing afoot. A final risk to keep in mind is that whatever ice or snow we see during the day is going to melt in the afternoon, with highs topping out around 40. Any ponding on roads will refreeze overnight as temperatures are expected to be below 32 for at least 10 hours, which means a possibility of black ice and unsafe travel conditions continuing into Thursday morning as well. All in all, let’s stay off the roads as much as humanly possible and just enjoy a nice cup of hot cocoa until the Snolepocalypse is over. It should go great with that French toast you made.

Joshua Freeman,"The GTA and much of southern Ontario could be in for another bout of messy weather with a winter storm system expected to hit the region Tuesday.
According to a special weather statement issued by Environment Canada for Toronto and most of southern Ontario Sunday, significant snow, freezing rain, and strong winds could be on the horizon.
A low pressure system brewing over the Southern Plains States may intensify into a winter storm as it tracks over Southern Ontario Tuesday, the agency said in its statement. Snow is expected to arrive Tuesday morning. The snow may change to ice pellets and freezing rain for a few hours Tuesday before changing back to snow by Tuesday night as colder air arrives in the wake of the low pressure system.
The snow is expected to taper off to flurries on Wednesday.
Between five and 15 centimetres of snow and ice pellets are expected to accumulate in some areas, along with ice buildup from freezing rain.
The wind could make the messy weather even more hazardous.
Strong and gusty easterly winds may cause low visibility in blowing snow before the snow changes over to freezing precipitation, Environment Canada said.
The statement warned that the storm could have a significant impact on travel in the region.
The city will see a small taste of precipitation tonight, with two centimetres of snow expected overnight.
The expected storm Tuesday comes as the city sees a few days of relatively warmer weather.
A high of 4 C was expected in Toronto Sunday. The warmer weather was enough to prompt the city to end an extreme cold weather alert which had been in place.
Tuesday will see a high of -2 C, though the wind chill will make it feel closer to -12.
On Tuesday, the city is expected to see a high of -1 C.","More winter weather on the way: Snow, freezing rain expected in Toronto Tuesday CP24 Toronto's Breaking News Blistering wind chill overnight then up to 40 cm of snow Tuesday Ottawa Citizen Another winter storm brewing in the GTA, to arrive Tuesday 680 News Wi…",2019-02-10T18:43:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cp24.com'}","More winter weather on the way: Snow, freezing rain expected in Toronto Tuesday - CP24 Toronto's Breaking News",https://www.cp24.com/weather/more-winter-weather-on-the-way-snow-freezing-rain-expected-in-toronto-tuesday-1.4290520,https://www.cp24.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273340.1548770673!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Cp24.com,ice storm,1
https://facebook.com/WWLRadio/,"(WWL.com) Another blast of arctic air is hitting Louisiana again, bringing below normal temperatures and ice and snow. Six parishes bordering Arkansas are under a Winter Storm Warning while parts of Cenla are under a Winter Storm Advisory. National Weather Service meteorologist Matthew Duplantis says snow could fall late tonight in the state's northern most parishes. ""We're expecting average snowfall amounts of two to three inches with possibly local amounts of four inches."" Cenla will see some snow as well. Duplantis says sections will see measurable snow after some freezing precipitation falls starting around midnight. ""It could be a possibility for south Louisiana. It's going to be close. Most of the moisture will start to ring out of the atmosphere as the cold air pushes further and further south."" There is a slight chance of wintry precipitation in South Louisiana, but Duplantis says the storm system will weaken considerably by the time it reaches those areas. ""Further south you go, there's less and less moisture as the cold air reaches the Gulf."" Road conditions in north Louisiana could deteriorate quickly once this storm system begins producing ice then snow later. DOTD’s Rodney Mallet says they are already preparing for the storm and have a good idea where the trouble spots will be starting late tonight into tomorrow morning. ""We usually know what roads are going to be impacted and it's usually the same elevated highways. As the weather gets closer, we'll stage our equipment and out deicing agents and move forward."" Some bridges in the state were shut down during the last winter storm due to safety concerns when they glazed over with ice. Those closures included the Sunshine Bridge in on LA-70 in St. James Parish and a portion of I-110 in Baton Rouge. Mallett says they will be watching all overhead passes and bridges that could prove to be problematic. ""We will have scouts that are out that will monitor the roadways. One we see something that starts to freeze, then we will be able to salt and brine it. And then if it gets to the point that it's unsafe, we will close it."" Mallett says to check LA511.org before heading out to see if the route you are taking is open. ""We have the app and we also have the website and you can get notices sent to your phone or your computer from that site (la511.org). That way you will know what's closed. You don't want to drive all the way down to the Sunshine Bridge and find that it's closed.""","WWL First News Winter storm warnings and watches for north and central Louisiana WWL First News Another blast of arctic air is hitting Louisiana again, bringing below normal temperatures and ice and snow.

CBS/AP,"Residents across a huge swath of the U.S. were hunkered down as a massive winter storm packing snow, ice and high winds, followed by possible record-breaking cold, moved up the Eastern Seaboard. The worst conditions were expected from the Carolinas to Maine. The massive storm began two days ago in the Gulf of Mexico, first hitting the Florida Panhandle. It has prompted thousands of canceled flights, shuttered schools and businesses and sparked fears of coastal flooding and power outages. Wind gusts of 50 mph to 60 mph, strong enough to cause downed trees and power lines, are predicted in places where the National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings. They include the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes parts of Delaware, Virginia and Maryland; coastal New Jersey; eastern Long Island, New York; and coastal eastern New England. After the storm, a wave of bracing cold is forecast to hit much of the Northeast. The storm dumped snow in Tallahassee, Florida, Wednesday -- that city's first snow in nearly three decades -- before slogging up the Atlantic coast and smacking Southern cities such as Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, with a rare blast of snow and ice. Follow along with updates below as the storm works its way up the coast. All times Eastern unless otherwise indicated. 4:03 a.m. Brrrr: Baby, it's gonna get cold(er) outside Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli says the storm will go down as one of the strongest non tropical cyclones ever along the Eastern Seaboard. Barometric pressure is forecast to drop near or below that of Superstorm Sandy. While 12-18-plus inches of snow on Long Island and eastern New England will be impressive, the cold behind the system will be even more impressive. Friday and Saturday morning will see the mercury at or below zero from New York City north, with wind chills of minus-20 degrees near New York City and minus-50 in the mountains of northern New England. 3:45 a.m. Conditions worsening in Washington, D.C. area Winds have begun to pick up.

All three cars - a baggage car and two sleeper cars -- stayed fully upright. There were no reports of injuries. CBS Savannah affiliate WTOC-TV says frozen switches on the tracks forced the crew to stop the train and put it into reverse. News footage from the site showed police and other emergency vehicles - their lights flashing - crunching over snowy, ice-shrouded roads near tracks where the cars had derailed. Workers in neon safety vests, their frosty breath rising in the bitter cold air, converged at the scene. The train was expected to continue north, with some of the sleeping car passengers being transferred to a different train. 12:13 a.m.: Storm passing over southeastern Virginia, northern North Carolina Snow is tracking across Virginia's Hampton Roads area and northern North Carolina, reported CBS affiliate WTKR meterologist Madeline Evans. Portions of the Outer Banks were only spot still seeing a mix of cold rain and some snow, and it will continue to transition into only snow overnight. Most of the area will see 8 inches to 10 inches of snow accumulation, with some spots possibly reaching a foot of snow, according to Evans. Snowfall will increase northward into portions of the Mid-Atlantic and northern New England early Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Blizzard conditions are possible over eastern Long Island and portions of coastal New England, and also near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and Hampton Roads. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the shore areas, CBS Baltimore reports. 10 p.m.: Philadelphia officials announce snow emergency Philadelphia city officials announced that a snow emergency goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thu., Jan. 4. Managing Director Michael DiBerardinis says a snow emergency means all parked cars must be moved off snow emergency routes for plowing. Officials urge residents to park as far away from street corners as possible so that plows can easily turn. For more information, visit this website. Cars left on snow emergency routes will be moved to other parking spots to assist in snow plowing operations. If your car is moved, call 215-686-SNOW to find it. Do NOT call 911. 9:45 p.m.: Nearly 35,000 people without power in the South CBS News has confirmed that nearly 35,000 people in the South are without power as a winter storm crosses the region. A look at websites monitoring outages show that Georgia is hit hardest with at least 17,000 customers affected. However, many of the outages predate the storm. 8:37 p.m.: American Airlines cancels more than 600 flights Jan. 4 American Airlines announced that more than 300 flights were canceled for Wednesday and more than 640 flights have already been canceled for Thursday. All depatures are canceled from Boston and Providence's airports, American Airlines said. There are scattered cancellations from Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and New York's airports. 7:50 p.m.: New York City cancels school New York City is under a winter storm watch from late Wednesday through Thursday evening, CBS New York reports. A blizzard warning has been issued for Long Island's Suffolk County and some coastal New Jersey counties, but New York City is not affected. Finally, as reported earlier, @NYCSchools are closed tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/nQa9Jau6uJ — Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 4, 2018 How much snow the city gets depends on the track of the storm. CBS New York forecaster Lonnie Quinn reported the North American Model expects the storm to track closer to the west, bringing 8.8 inches of accumulation. But the European Model, which tracks the storm 54 miles farther east, anticipates only 2.9 inches of accumulation for New York City. Wind gusts of 35 mph to 45 mph are also possible. New York City's Department of Sanitation issued a snow alert starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday, meaning snow equipment will be ready to handle the winter weather. 7:05 p.m.: Deep freeze expected overnight in Florida There will be a hard freeze overnight for many locations away from the immediate coast, CBS affiliate WJAX reports. Even the beaches will see a light freeze overnight. Highs will be in the mid to upper 40s Thursday and another hard freeze is expected Friday morning.

Merrit Kennedy,"It was just a normal Monday afternoon at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs when suddenly, the sky started pelting down chucks of ice the size of baseballs. There were more than 3,000 people visiting the zoo at the time of the severe storm who had to seek shelter. At least 14 people were injured by the hail, according to the fire department – five who were treated at local hospitals and nine others who were treated at the scene. That number is still being assessed. In a press release, the zoo says ""many"" people were injured, including staff trying to help animals. The zoo says two animals died ""due to the trauma sustained during the hail storm,"" and it adds that it is ""heartbroken."" They were a 4-year-old Muscovy duck named Daisy and a 13-year-old Cape vulture named Motswari. Other animals are being assessed for injuries, the zoo says. ""All of the Zoo's animals have permanent shelter, but just as there were humans injured while trying to get to shelter, some animals were injured, as well."" Many were confused when the storm started, the zoo adds. A video taken in a bear enclosure gives some idea of the intensity of the storm.

""Buses are the only vehicles allowed to the #zoo,"" the department said in a tweet. As KRDO reported, the strong storm left many tourists without cars. ""I don't know where I'm going, what I'm doing, or how I'm going to get there,"" Robin Lane, a stranded guest, told the station. A group of campers at the zoo at the time was not injured, it said. The zoo is closed on Tuesday and says it has ""experienced significant damage to our infrastructure."" Major hail storms are not that unusual in Colorado, and there are a few reasons for that. The Denver Post explains : ""From a broad perspective here in Colorado, we're extra-prone to large hail for one simple reason: Our elevation. Denver's mile-high altitude places it 5,280 feet closer to the freezing level than a sea level location, giving us somewhat of a head start in getting those hail stones to the freezing level and making us one of the most susceptible locations in the world to large hail. ""Additionally, since we're closer to where hail actually forms, it also gives it less time to melt before it reaches the ground. It's like eating an ice cream cone right away as opposed to a minute or two minutes after you order it.""","Much of the damage from this storm occurred in the parking lot.

A hard freeze warning, winter weather advisory and wind chill advisory remained in effect for much of southeast Texas, including Harris County. At 6 a.m. it was just 20 degrees with a wind chill of 12. Ice leftover from Tuesday's freezing rain, sleet and light snow still covered most bridges, overpasses and stretches of freeways, leading authorities to close various high-traffic locations.

He could not give a more exact location, but Houston TranStar showed a closure from the Grand Parkway to West Airport. Allen said crews were working to treat the roadway to mitigate the ice — made more difficult by the fact that many cars are on it, he said. Allen also noted that multiple 18-wheelers had jack-knifed on U.S. 59 at Hillcroft, prompting closures there. TranStar also shows closures along U.S. 59 northbound at Spur 527 and State Highway 288, I-10 East from San Jacinto to I-45, and 610 North Loop eastbound from Yale to Main, among others. A total of 43 roads remain closed, a full list of which can be found here.

,"NASA released new images this week showing how the 42-year-long summer on Uranus packs quite a punch, while Neptune is also being lashed with a thousand mile wide storms.
Cloud System Over Uranus’ North Pole
Source: NASA, ESA, A. Simon (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center), and M.H. Wong and A. Hsu (University of California, Berkeley)
Thanks to the extreme tilt of Uranus—the planet spins almost completely on its side—the Sun shines nearly overhead relative to Uranus’s north pole in the summertime and doesn’t set for decades. As a result, scientists believe, the resulting atmospheric changes created a pole spanning cloud formation.
SEE ALSO: THE DISCOVERY OF URANUS AND WHY IS IT SUCH AN ODDITY
Near the edge of the cloud, NASA says, is a massive but narrow cloud of methane gas which can get bright enough that it can be photographed by amateur astronomers. The band circles the planet just north of the equator and it remains a mystery for scientists just how bands like these form on Uranus and Neptune since both planets have dominant jets of westward blowing wind that are generally very broad.
Neptune Also Showing Stormy Weather in Photos
Source: NASA, ESA, A. Simon (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center), and M.H. Wong and A. Hsu (University of California, Berkeley)
Neptune is likewise showing signs of stormy weather. Currently experiencing summer in its southern hemisphere, a dark, stormy spot can be seen in its northern hemisphere that NASA says is about 6,800 miles across—about 2.5 times the width of the continental United States. The storm is accompanied by white “companion clouds” that form when the ambient gas ahead of the storm is forced upward and over the vortex.
The methane gas then freezes to form ice crystals in the upper atmosphere, similar to the way clouds form as air is pushed over mountains here on Earth. 
Other similar storms have been seen on Neptune before. Voyager 2 took pictures of 2 earlier dark storms on Neptune when it flew by in 1989 and Hubble has captured three earlier storms going back to 1993. 
Hubble is the only telescope currently that has the blue light sensitivity to capture these storms in Neptune’s atmosphere, which appear and disappear very quickly, in astronomical terms. A study led by Andrew Hsu, an undergraduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, estimated that dark spots like these formed on Neptune roughly every 4-6 years and fade away after about 2 years.
The Big Red Spot, the gargantuan storm about twice the diameter of Earth that swirls through the atmospheric band of Jupiter 22 degrees south of its the equator, has been observed since the late 1800s. It may even have been spotted as early as the 1600s, which would make it centuries old.
Monitoring the Ice Giants
According to a NASA statement released with the new images, the planets “have no solid surface but rather mantles of hydrogen and helium surrounding a water-rich interior, itself perhaps wrapped around a rocky core. Atmospheric methane absorbs red light but allows blue-green light to be scattered back into space, giving each planet a cyan hue.”
In order to determine what weather is like on these most distant planets, NASA must take many images over an extended period of time to monitor changes in the planets' atmosphere over time, hopefully giving them a long term record to work with. As such, Hubble has been taking pictures of the planets regularly as part of a long-term monitoring mission.",Hubble Shows Just How Stormy Uranus Gets in The Summer Interesting Engineering Newly discovered mysterious dark storm on Neptune arouses curiosity THE WEEK Epic storms rage across Neptune and Uranus in new Hubble images Digital Trends See the Bizarre Storm Bl…,2019-02-10T05:15:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Interestingengineering.com'}",Hubble Shows Just How Stormy Uranus Gets in The Summer - Interesting Engineering,https://interestingengineering.com/hubble-shows-just-how-stormy-uranus-gets-in-the-summer,https://static.interestingengineering.com/images/FEBRUARY/sizes/Stormy-Uranus-Neptune_md.jpg,,Interestingengineering.com,ice storm,1
Devin Coldewey,"There’s a lot about snow we don’t know. Where does it come from? Where does it go? What does it taste like? Admittedly there are tentative answers to these questions. But there are yet more complex ones like how exactly, on a microscopic level, snow melts in mid-air. That’s the focus of one project at NASA, the results of which are both practical and beautiful. Snow is a critical part of the weather system (did you know there’s a whole “cryosphere””), and the ways in which it forms and melts can help meteorologists predict, for example, the likelihood or severity of a storm. But it’s not enough to catch a flake in your hand and look closely. Like anything else, you need a mathematical model of a phenomenon in order to understand it properly. Jussi Leinonen has been working on this problem for years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “I got interested in modeling melting snow because of the way it affects our observations with remote sensing instruments,” he said in a news release. As you can imagine, it’s rather important for a rocket science lab to be able to understand and predict weather patterns. Leinonen’s contribution has been an exact model of how and why snowflakes melt — which types of flakes, at what temperatures, in what ways, and so on. The basic version is this: water collects in concave regions of snowflakes where it can stay liquid. Those little lakes expand, eventually covering the whole ice crystal and encasing the core, which also eventually melts. Sounds straightforward, but Leinonen’s model shows how this happens at an extremely detailed level with arbitrarily shaped snowflakes and clumps thereof. The 3D visualization of this process is remarkably beautiful, and more importantly seems to be correct. With an accurate model meteorologists can profile different snow and rain types, see how they perform in various conditions, and produce relevant details like how those differences would affect a radar image. No word on when we can get a screensaver of snowflakes melting with high precision. Leinonen published his research in the journal Geophysical Research.","There's a lot about snow we don't know.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption In 1975, Xia Boyu handed his sleeping bag to a suffering teammate - and lost both feet to frostbite A Chinese climber who was crippled by frostbite on Everest more than 40 years ago has scaled the summit at the start of this year's climbing season. In 1975, Xia Boyu lost his feet after giving his sleeping bag to a sick teammate during a high-altitude storm. Now aged 69, he became the second double amputee to scale Everest - and the first ever from the Nepalese side. Australian Steve Plain, meanwhile, set the record for the fastest climb of the highest mountains on seven continents. Plain's achievement also features a story of overcoming physical challenge, coming four years after he broke his neck in a surfing accident. 'A challenge of fate' The storm that caused Xia's frostbite struck in the ""death zone"" above 8,000m (26,200ft) and stranded his team for three nights, not far from the summit. As a result, he needed to have his feet amputated. Then, in 1996, his legs were amputated above the knee as he battled lymphoma. Despite his injuries, he never abandoned the notion of reaching the summit. ""Climbing Mount Everest is my dream,"" he told AFP news agency in April. ""I have to realise it. It also represents a personal challenge, a challenge of fate."" After the disastrous 1975 climb, he made three more attempts, in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The 2016 attempt brought him close to the summit before a blizzard set in. However, a ban on climbers like Xia almost ended his attempts. Nepalese authorities moved last year to ban double amputees - along with blind and solo climbers - from attempting to reach the summit. The authorities said the new rules were a safety measure but they were struck down by the courts earlier this year as discriminatory. On Monday, supported by a team of Sherpa guides, Xia reached the summit in what the Himalayan Times says is the first successful double amputee climb from the Nepal side. It also makes him only the second double-amputee to ever reach the summit of the world's highest mountain. Mark Inglis, of New Zealand, became the first when he reached the summit in 2006. Inglis also lost his limbs to frostbite in a climbing accident, after spending two weeks in an ice cave sheltering from a mountain storm. 'Hangman's fracture' Steve Plain also took advantage of the first day possible to reach the summit, setting his four-month speed record for the seven continents. Both Plain and Xia's teams had already begun their climb when Sherpa guides affixed ropes to the summit, opening the final leg of the route for the climbing season. That meant that Plain could reach his seventh mountain peak on his seventh continent in just 117 days - shaving nine days off the previous record. The seven summits Mr Plain scaled are, in order of completion: Vinson, Antarctica (4,892m/16,066ft) Aconcagua, South America, (6,962m/22,840ft) Kilimanjaro, Africa (5895m/19,340ft) Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4884m/16,020ft) Elbrus, Europe (5642m/18,510 ft) Denali, North America (6,190m/20,310ft) Everest, Asia (8,848m/29,030ft) Plain was surfing in Western Australia in the summer of 2014 when a wave dumped him, head first, into the sand. He suffered a broken neck or ""hangman's fracture"" and said doctors had told him they were not sure if he would ever walk again. ""Three and a half years ago I was lying in hospital with a broken neck and at that time set myself the goal,"" he wrote on Facebook after reaching the summit.

Andrew Freedman,"The calendar may say it's the first day of spring, but it will seem more like the movie Groundhog Day along the East Coast on Tuesday. The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks will begin to take shape across the Mid-Atlantic, as the first of two waves of low pressure spreads a wintry mix of snow, sleet, and rain from West Virginia to Delaware. The main show, though, appears to be set for Tuesday night through Wednesday night, possibly into part of Thursday, from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston. Once again, an atmospheric disturbance diving out of Canada and across parts of the U.S. will spawn an intensifying area of low pressure just off the Mid-Atlantic coast. SEE ALSO: Third nor'easter in 2 weeks to slam New England: What's going on here? The same ingredients that have come together to produce blockbuster spring snowstorms three times already this month, including snow totals above 2 feet in some cases, will combine to yield a powerful coastal storm that will throw moisture from the North Atlantic inland, where it will fall as heavy, wet snow. Dip, or trough, in the jet stream projected for March 23, 2018. Image: weatherbell analytics. The previous storms have been high-impact affairs, with tens of thousands without power from each event, as the wet snow brings down trees and power lines, and strong winds take out branches along the shore. This time around, the storm won't be as strong, though power outages are once again possible anywhere the snow accumulates more than about 4 inches, which as of Monday evening appeared to be the most populated stretch of the country, including the cities of D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Hartford, Providence, and Boston. In urban areas, the high sun angle of mid-March may make it difficult for the snow to stick on roadways, but as long as it snows at a heavy rate of 1 to 3 inches per hour, snow should accumulate.

A couple of key factors have persisted this March that have sparked storms near the East Coast and caused them to get hung up there. A dip, or trough, in the jet stream exists across the east. Upstream, across northeastern Canada, parts of the North Atlantic, and southern Greenland, weather systems are configured in a way that effectively blocks storms from moving off the East Coast. Lower atmosphere temperatures in the Arctic from Oct. to Feb. 2018. Image: NCEp/ncar via zack labe. This allows them to intensify before moving out to sea, and be slow-moving enough to bring high snow totals, strong winds, and potentially damaging coastal flooding. The repetitive winter storms this March fit the climate change narrative that some researchers have been putting forward for several years now through peer-reviewed research. Specifically, as Arctic temperatures increase due to human-caused global warming, and sea ice is reduced, it is having ramifications throughout midlatitude weather patterns. The Arctic had one of its warmest winter seasons on record this year, with sea ice hovering near or at record lows. One study, published in Nature Communications on March 13, provides statistical evidence of links between ""an unusually warm Arctic and cold continents."" What's more, this study, which builds off other previously published work, showed that the influence of Arctic warming is most likely to be felt in the eastern U.S. during mid-to-late winter, rather than early on in the season. ""... We show that in the period of accelerated Arctic warming, heavy snowfalls in the Northeastern U.S. have become more frequent,"" said Judah Cohen, chief seasonal forecaster at AER, a Verisk company, via email. ""So though a heavy snowfall in March is not unheard of or rare it is the frequency of the heavy snowfalls that seems to be changing."" While statistical links have been put forward between Arctic warming and particular weather patterns in the midlatitudes, the precise physical mechanisms through which these effects are occurring have not yet been proven, and research is ongoing.","The calendar may say it's the first day of spring, but it will seem more like the movie Groundhog Day along the East Coast on Tuesday.

Andrew Freedman,"The stage is set for a dramatic change in the weather pattern across the Northern Hemisphere during the next seven to 10 days. That change will likely bring a brutal Arctic blast across the Midwest and eastern U.S., put Western Europe into the deep freeze, and maintain an area of extreme cold in eastern Asia. The new weather pattern could give rise to snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S., though it's too early to tell whether that will happen, forecasters say. What is clear is that winter is coming — ASAP. SEE ALSO: La Niña is officially here to shape U.S. winter weather, along with global climate Computer model projections show an Arctic air mass diving southeastward, into the U.S., by Dec. 10, and potentially setting up shop for one to two weeks. Daytime highs will be at least 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average for this time of year, with the heart of the cold projected to be centered somewhere near the Ohio Valley. The cold air blowing across the comparatively mild waters of the Great Lakes could yield prolific lake effect snows from Wisconsin to New York State. While the Arctic air won't be historically cold, it will cause a nasty outbreak of weather whiplash after the historically mild fall that much of the U.S. enjoyed. ""I think the locations that will see the most anomalous cold will be the Great Lakes down through the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,"" said Michael Ventrice, a meteorologist with WSI Corp, which is part of The Weather Company. Ventrice added that he thinks northern Minnesota could see sub-zero temperatures for nighttime low temperatures, while even Nashville and Atlanta could have low temperatures that dip into the 20s Fahrenheit. Computer model projection for Dec. 9 through Dec. 14, showing areas of unusual warmth (red), and unusual cold (blue). Image: wsi via michael ventrice. The weather pattern that is going to take shape features a wavy jet stream, with big swings to the north and the south, like a snake slithering along a path. The jet stream consists of a corridor of high winds blowing near the top of the troposphere, or about 35,000 feet up, that separates air masses and both steers and helps fuel storm systems. A wavy jet stream can cause weather features to get stuck in place, with large ridges of high pressure acting as atmospheric traffic lights, preventing oncoming weather systems from passing by. In mid-December, strong areas of high pressure are forecast to develop and hold in position in high latitudes, forming what's known as a blocking pattern. Such blocks, particularly a high pressure area over Greenland, tend to be associated with cold air outbreaks and snowstorms in the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. The high latitude blocking will bring unusually mild air for this time of year to the Arctic, likely resulting in a sharp slowdown in the growth of winter sea ice across the region. ""The most unusual warmth is going to be across Alaska [on] through the Arctic Circle,"" Ventrice said. We are seeing temperature anomalies in excess of 30 degrees [Fahrenheit compared to average] in some locations around the North Pole, which will likely delay or reduce Arctic sea ice growth/extent,"" he added. As of late November, Arctic sea ice extent was at its second-lowest level on record in the satellite era, with virtually no ice cover in the Chuckchi Sea near Alaska.

Decent coverage and intensity of cold for early December. pic.twitter.com/dqHwuUWkDb — Ryan Maue | weather.us (@RyanMaue) November 29, 2017 Emerging research suggests that slow growth of Arctic sea ice during the fall and early winter can alter weather patterns in the northern midlatitudes, including by increasing fall snowfall in parts of Siberia. Such developments may help, through a series of complex interactions between the lower and upper atmosphere, disrupt the polar vortex encircling the Arctic region, and bring more frigid air into North America and Europe. The main polar vortex consists of a circulation of air enveloping a near-permanent area of low pressure that exists in the upper atmosphere, a layer known as the stratosphere, over the Arctic. When these winds weaken, which is forecast to occur by Dec. 11 to 15, pieces of the vortex can break off, and drift south into the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia. Arctic sea ice extent, with 2017 in orange. Image: jaxa/nsidc/zack labe Such a polar vortex disruption is forecast to be part of the reason why the weather pattern will change so drastically across such a broad area during the next few weeks. A weakening of the polar vortex could even help keep the high latitude blocking in place longer than it otherwise would. ""I think the cold pattern does in fact have some legs to it,"" Ventrice said. ""We are seeing big blocking setup across the higher-latitudes, which can linger for a number of weeks."" ""The big question mark of winter 2017-2018 is whether we see more frequent Greenland Blocking episodes,"" he said. ""Last winter, we did not.

Chris Jones,"On August 24 at 8:20 pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting meteorologist named Eric Berger was nearly finished writing a post for his Houston-centric blog, Space City Weather, titled “ Harvey Late Night: Some Final Thursday Thoughts.” He was in his home office. He had just poured himself a glass of cabernet. He had been looking at the online forecasts from the National Hurricane Center and agreed with their essential conclusions: Harvey was a well-­organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the Texas Gulf Coast somewhere between Corpus Christi and Port O’Connor. Berger also backed the center’s belief that the winds would be strong in Houston that weekend, perhaps more than 40 miles per hour. But he was far more worried about the rain. The unanswered question is what happens to Harvey once it reaches the coast, Berger wrote. Where will it go, and will it go fast enough? Houston’s rainfall totals over the next five days depend on this, and we just don’t know. The considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm. Most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer models, and the models, which take different variables (temperature, moisture, mass) and consider them in different ways, are not always in agreement. The National Hurricane Center takes input from several models to make its predictions, averaging out their differences, in part because it faces the tallest order in hurricane forecasting: It must say that the hurricane will go here. So must television meteorologists, one of the center’s principal conduits to a concerned public. TV, too, demands a singular answer. Berger doesn’t have to draw a line. He is a certified meteorologist, but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his; his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for Ars Technica (a site owned by WIRED Media Group), and he blogs about the weather in his free time. That gives him two luxuries that most front-line meteorologists don’t have: He can value certain models and their ensembles much more heavily than others, untangling as many as 50 different versions of each forecast, and he can also admit doubt. He can explore the subtlety of the weather, marveling at its mysteries, the way he has for his small but loyal community of readers for years, but especially since he established his site in October 2015. Berger does not generate his forecasts from scratch, pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking readings from the Galileo thermometer on his windowsill. He really does have a Galileo thermometer on his windowsill, but he works out of a home office that he hasn’t otherwise bothered to decorate, with a basic PC and a single monitor on which he toggles between tabs, from forecast to conflicting forecast. In Houston that evening, the US government forecast called for about 15 inches of rain. By then Berger had already begun to wonder. There is one model he has come to trust and rely on more than any other: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System, more popularly known in the US as the European model. Funded by 22 EU members and 12 cooperating states, the European model is sometimes shockingly accurate, in part because it’s so well financed and its computing power is stronger than most. With Harvey, it suggested that the storm would stall over Houston, dumping 25 inches of rain or more before eventually moving on. That synced with Berger’s own analysis of the weather patterns in the atmosphere. He detected a troublesome absence of steering currents, the forces that push hurricanes to wherever they’re headed next, and without those currents, the European model’s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense. Given the sum of the evidence before him, Berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction, and he wrote as much: Big-time floods are coming to Texas. It was, at its essence, an informed gut call, and Berger thought carefully about what he would write next. He had made his reputation, such as it was for a leisure-­time meteorologist with a city-specific weather blog, by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzies that competent weather observers dismiss as “storm porn.” He is by nature a fairly skeptical person. His twin passions, space and the weather, share long histories of broken promises and unmet expectations. His site’s motto is “Hype-free forecasts for greater Houston,” mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuations prompted by Hurricane Rita in 2005. I am not going to sugar-coat this, my friends, he had written in advance of that storm. As a Houston resident and property owner, I am truly mortified right now. Rita and Berger had both missed. But underplaying weather of dire consequences could lead to a different kind of calamity for his readers. James Spann, Alabama’s longtime weather forecaster of choice, had infamously botched that state’s ice storms of January 2014. Spann had predicted a “dusting” of snow, and unworried commuters headed out on the roads; when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice, Spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousands of people who ended up stranded in their cars, schools, and workplaces overnight. Berger despises alarmism in all its forms. He also didn’t want to bear responsibility for children drowning in their attics. Berger’s wife, Amanda, was getting their own two daughters ready for bed in their League City apartment, temporary accommodations while the family builds their dream home in nearby Clear Creek. His dog, Bonnie, a Maltese-­poodle cross who dislikes all men but him, kept her usual vigilant watch. Berger can be painfully shy. Now he felt possessed by an unusual authority, exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word. He took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard. Certainly the Corpus Christi area and points immediately north and west of there will get too much rain, he wrote. Flooding will spread to other parts of Texas too, quite possibly Houston. But right now we can’t say that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s either going to be pretty bad, or really really bad here. He posted his piece. His site normally averaged somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 views a day. That particular entry received 207,334 over the next 24 hours. A shocked Berger surmised that his core readers were recommending him to their suddenly weather-concerned friends. He had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm. In the comments, one reader asked what Berger thought the rainfall totals might be in San Antonio, 200 miles to the west. Someone else asked about Colorado County, and another about the neighborhoods near Ellington Field. Another reader wondered whether her husband’s flight out of Hobby Airport on Saturday morning might be delayed. A man named Petey James pointed out that Saturday night was the night of the big fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home. A woman named Deb Walters asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near Dacus on Saturday afternoon. I’d press ahead at this point, Berger wrote to her. Obviously if things turn ugly Saturday morning, you’ll have to cancel. The following morning, Friday, August 25, it started to rain, a few drops at first, and then a fairly steady shower. Harvey’s leading edge had come to town, and the models, constantly updated, began to align: Harvey was nearly laser-precise in its construction and massive, and it was also a slow mover. The rain was going to be measured in feet, not inches. Berger sat down at his desk, no wine this time, and wrote another post. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming, ” he wrote. He wrote it two more times for emphasis. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming. A very serious flooding situation is coming. ” It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb Walters had canceled her party. Millions turned to Berger’s Space City Weather blog during the storm. Since 1980, there have been more than 200 weather and climate events in the United States that have each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Three principal national bodies are charged with predicting their arrivals and effects. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, keeps watch for tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, monitors heavy rains. And the National Hurricane Center in Miami minds hurricanes. They have been busy. In the case of Harvey, all three were involved, funneling their best information to the Houston branch of the National Weather Service, one of its 122 field offices across the country. Each helps turn national forecasts into finely tuned local ones. The Houston office is the only one that shares space with its home county’s Office of Emergency Management—Galveston County in its case—better to coordinate their shared response. It is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their offices are on the upper floor. Over the past few decades, greater Houston has grown exponentially from a mosquito-­plagued oil port into the fifth-largest metro area in the United States, home to nearly 7 million people. That population explosion, combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight, has seen former swamps turned into sprawling, unregulated developments. Houston has been built to flood. Dan Reilly, 52, is the local Warning Coordination Meteorologist, part of the National Weather Service’s round-the-clock professional staff. In a catastrophe-prone city like his, the job is twofold. The first is the forecast. “When something bad is coming, that’s really when we need to be at the top of our game,” he says. Of the three most damaging effects of hurricanes—wind, storm surge, and rain—rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance. The heaviest rain typically falls in small pockets, and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to 12 hours ahead of its arrival. Houston’s physical size also makes rain forecasts challenging: Each side of the I-10, for instance—one of several highways that serve as boundaries in an otherwise endless city—might receive a substantially different amount. A good meteorologist is almost always, by definition, skilled at pattern recognition. Weather, like the law, is built on a foundation of similar cases. Veteran meteorologists—Reilly has been in the job for 24 years—mine their memories for analogues. In the early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s team began upping the National Weather Service’s rain forecast to amounts that no one had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, and eventually 50, over a widespread swath of Houston. Reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest: A killing flood was on its way. Somehow the warnings sounded different coming from him. The next part of the job, and perhaps the more important one, is getting the word out. At a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever, and trust in government is low, convincing people to heed your warnings, especially the most severe of them, might now be the weather forecaster’s harder task. The most serious warning when it comes to rain is called a Flash Flood Emergency, and before Harvey, the Houston office had issued that warning on only three occasions. It would soon be used for a fourth. Berger, sitting behind his Spartan desk that afternoon, anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat, was first among those who might listen—and to whom others might listen about the coming storm. He wasn’t the government; he was a human being, and somehow the warnings sounded different to their ears coming from him, the kind of measured voice that shines through in a crisis. After he had written his ominous flood forecast three times, he looked out his office window at one of the two garages he keeps. One of them was bursting with new things for his new house, and he began ferrying boxes upstairs to his office, filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixtures, a microwave, and a tub. In between trips, he heard Amanda making arrangements to take shelter, with their daughters, at her sister’s house, built on pilings and tucked away from the wind. Berger would stay. He would hunker down behind his wall of boxes with his PC and his readers, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, for the duration of the storm. He knew that his city was in serious trouble, and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbors that it was time for them to share his fears. The weather started making an impression on Berger in 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison came to town. Berger is from Michigan but had gone to the University of Texas to earn his astronomy degree. He moved to Houston for a girl, first working weekends at the Houston Chronicle before becoming the paper’s designated “SciGuy,” writing mostly about physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He also wrote a little about the weather. He had just bought his first house near White Oak Bayou. On June 8, a Friday night—what was it about storms and Friday nights?—he went out with some friends to see a Bob Schneider concert. Allison had passed through Houston once already, but now it returned to take a second run at the city. Berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out Schneider, as though there was too much percussion in the mix. After the concert, he and his friends left to wander around midtown, gawking at the water rising on the empty streets. Berger wrote about the storm. One of his stories, about the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of research animals in the basement of the Texas Medical Center, drew massive national readership. He began having visions—he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online. His discussions could be more timely and interactive than the forecasts printed in the paper itself. And unlike TV meteorologists, he needn’t worry about ratings or being available to viewers only at certain designated times. In June 2005, he started his own blog on the Chronicle ’s site. He didn’t yet have any meteorological training; he was just someone who liked talking about the weather. (His colleagues called him “Weather Boy.” It was not a compliment.) Three months later came Katrina. Then came Rita. And three years later, Hurricane Ike. Berger’s life could seem governed by storms; even his first meeting with Amanda, whom he married in 2002, came only a few weeks after Allison’s transformative rains. He convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at Mississippi State to earn his certification as a professional meteorologist. Modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting, and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hands. Berger wanted to make sure his hands were the right ones. When he left the Chronicle to join Ars Technica in October of 2015, he started Space City Weather. The day after he opened up shop, the remnants of Hurricane Patricia began clouding the skies of Houston. He was supposed to go out for dinner with Amanda. He worried his readers would feel he’d abandoned them in a time of need, and he couldn’t help writing a post. His first forecast on Space City Weather was for a flood. Now in August 2017, the rains on Harvey’s opening night shocked even him. They were biblical. Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour would force most drivers to pull over. Harvey would sometimes drop 5. It didn’t look like water; it looked like milk. Worse, Berger studied the models and the satellite imagery, and if he knew anything in that moment, listening to the rain against his window, he knew that there was so much more to come. On Saturday, August 26, an hour after sunset, the evening’s first band of precipitation, which on radar resembled the longest tentacles of an angry squid, opened up over Houston, slowly crossing the city from west to east. As predicted by the European model, it stalled. Additional bands trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first. This created what meteorologists properly call a seething nexus of hate, Berger later wrote. The now-combined band extended more than 400 miles over Galveston and deep into the too-warm waters of the Gulf, creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to Houston. By very early Sunday morning, Harvey’s enormous size began to tell, and another band prepared to make its assault on the already flooded southern suburbs. The Houston branch of the NWS had issued its special emergency bulletin, and in the adjacent Office of Emergency Management, the walls were being papered with calls for water rescues. People were drowning in the rain. A sleepless Berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post. Amanda and their daughters had been at her sister’s house for several hours, and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it. He inserted the scene into his piece, which went up at 2:10 am on Sunday morning. I wanted nothing more than to fall in her arms and tell her yes, this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go to bed and forget this ever happened. It had to be it, surely. It would not be it. Harvey would make true Berger’s most pessimistic projections and refuse to leave. He would tell his readers that the rain would continue, especially at night. He would later hear that administrators at the Houston Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine were among those looking to him for guidance. He would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post that he titled: “Houston, We Will Get Through This.” With the prospect of more rain, you may feel hopeless or helpless, or both. From a mental health standpoint, the uncertainty this brings adds a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation. I wish we could tell you when the rains will end, but we can’t. Here’s one thing we are sure of, however. The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. More than a million people would visit Space City Weather on Sunday alone. Hurricane Harvey already had a name. Now it had its face. Harvey’s unrelenting rain left so much underwater—like these orchards in Pecan Grove. On Tuesday evening, more than four days after the rain first started to fall, Berger would finally write: It’s over. He had been nearly perfect in his forecast. It hadn’t been all that windy, so there weren’t many roofs blown off or trees toppled, except in those few cursed places that were also visited by tornadoes. And there wasn’t much local storm surge. The water didn’t come rushing through Houston. It didn’t arrive in walls the way it did in New Orleans with Katrina, one of the reasons Harvey directly killed 68 people, many in their cars, instead of an estimated 1,833 people, many in their beds. Harvey was a cataclysmic rain event, just as Berger had feared. He could have been wrong and his readers would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort. But he had been right, and thousands of his readers didn’t have a downstairs anymore. A month after the storm, Berger dropped into his Hyundai hybrid and went for a drive. He wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecasts, as though he could use the reminder that Harvey really did do what it did, to Houston and to him. By then the last part of weather analysis, the accounting of the aftermath, was nearly complete. It had rained so hard for so long that Houston’s swamps and reservoirs and drainage canals filled up, which meant that the city’s kitchens and living rooms and dens filled up next. Then the water drained away. In the time in between it made an estimated $75 billion in property irreparably wet. He headed south toward Dickinson, one of the worst-hit areas. On some streets, every house had an enormous pile of debris out front—everything that had been inside the house was now outside of it, rotting in the sun. Other streets had been picked clean, and they looked almost normal, except that through their windows, Berger could see that the otherwise pristine-­seeming houses had been stripped down to the studs. There was a photograph that had made the rounds during the storm. It was of the flood-soaked residents of a nursing home, sitting on their loungers and walkers, water up to their chests. It seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art. On his tour, Berger decided to visit that nursing home, La Vita Bella. Nearly everything that wasn’t human in that photograph was now sitting out in the yard. The lamps, the chairs, and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the piles of sodden sheetrock and carpet, relics of a viral infamy. They were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant losses: a stuffed animal, a deck of playing cards, a broken mirror, a lipstick and a rouge, a large-print copy of Marley &amp; Me. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post titled: ""Houston, We Will Get Through This."" Berger had also lost a book in the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, lightning had lit up the sky, and he could see that water had reached his garages. He had mostly emptied one but not the other—not the one that contained his old things, his diplomas and his Appetite for Destruction poster and his boxes of books. He raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and its bottom fell out. A book titled From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun dropped into the water and disappeared. Berger had treasured that book, a massive 500-year history of Western civilization. Its French-born author had died in Texas in 2012. Barzun was 104 years old, and the book had been his life’s work. Something about losing that particular book hit Berger harder than it might have. It was a metaphor for how easily even our monuments can be erased. He had written about the loss of that book and other things in a post that went up on Ars Technica early in the morning on August 30, the Wednesday after the storm. The post was titled “This Is Probably the Worst US Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never Be the Same.” The cardboard box had failed, he wrote, and the book had dropped into the murk. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. Berger started receiving emails and notes from his grateful readers. They had saved some of their own treasures because of his warnings, and they felt they had a debt to settle. A copy of From Dawn to Decadence was eventually put into his hands by a stranger, a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerves to give after the storm. That book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office, a tiny reminder of the things that Harvey had taken, but also a reminder of the things it had delivered. The National Weather Service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy. It is staffed by thousands of people—by good and competent forecasters who care deeply about the weather and its effects on their communities. The NWS can offer its best daily guess, informed by their forecasters’ computer models and professional experiences. It can give warnings and sound alarms. But the NWS can’t talk about the weather the way human beings talk about the weather. It can’t explore each of its uncertainties, almost reveling in the sweeping possibilities of hurricanes and their animal behaviors. It can’t riff. More important, when the weather is at its worst: The National Weather Service can’t comfort. Even though Dan Reilly and his colleagues live and work in greater Houston, even though they were plenty concerned during Harvey for their own families and homes, they can’t issue a bulletin that says, We’re sick and tired of the rain, just like everyone else. They can’t write: The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. Only someone like Eric Berger can do that, providing a weather forecast that includes words like hope or sorry or maybe. Only someone like Eric Berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feels intimate and human-scale, applying the wisdom of satellites to Deb Walters and her doomed party. Only someone like Eric Berger, looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he knows that it won’t be stopping anytime soon, can speak to a family watching the water on its torturous rise to their door, the winds threatening the entirety of their lives, and make them feel a little less alone in the storm. Update: After this article went to press, we heard from Deb Walters, one of the many people who sought Berger’s advice just before Hurricane Harvey. Thanks to Berger’s forecasts, Walters decided to cancel a house party she hosts every year for some members of Alcoholics Anonymous and ex-cons. It turned out to be a good call. Although Walters’ house was spared, the surrounding streets flooded, which would have stranded the guests there for three days. “These folks are hysterical,” she said (as in funny and lovable), “but the type of people you invite to a party aren’t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three days with.” She finally hosted the shindig three weeks later, for a smaller crowd. —The Editors Chris Jones is a longtime magazine writer.

Shannon Stirone,"Space, youre such a mysterious mess. Science has barely begun to explore a universe brimming with befuddling objects, planets, and galaxies. Youve got imploding stars that blow away everything around them, and others that balloon out in a relatively quiet death. For this weeks space journey, were examining some new and strange placesplus one weve been looking at our entire lives.
Humans last stepped foot on the moon in 1972, as part of the Apollo 17 mission. That mission included Harrison Schmitt, the first geologist to ever walk on the lunar surface. Schmitt and the crew brought home 800 grams of lunar rocks, but not all of these samples were available for research. NASA saved them until new technology could be developed that would yield more advanced scientific results. Just this week, NASA announced it would crack open some of the last sample containers for scientists. We might run out of rocks before weve answered all the questions we have about the moon, but at least we know where to go if we need more.
Over on Mars, were not sure what to make of a bizarre feature called brain terrain, similar in appearance to the gray matter in our heads. Ice underground may be skipping the liquid stage and sublimating straight to its gas phase, but if that were happening, wed be seeing changes in the landscape, and scientists cant detect any. What a brainteaser!
Were not done with the red planet yet: We now can see the final image the beloved Opportunity rover took before powering down for good. The rovers mission came to an end last summer after a massive dust storm darkened the Martian skies, robbing Opportunity of sunlight. This panorama shows Perseverance Valley, the rovers final resting place.
Speaking of going out with a bang, we visit two galaxies that have spent the past several million years colliding with each other. Once their stars realign, they will become one single galaxy for future telescopes to gaze atorder out of seeming chaos.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Great Lakes region is sending the year out with a bang. Wave after wave of lake effect snow has pummeled the region, making for a record-setting white Christmas and a shoveling project that could take until New Year’s Eve to complete. Erie, PA, is under a snow emergency after 53 inches of snow fell in 30 hours—the state record for the snowiest two-day period. It’s also more than Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and a slew of other seemingly snow cities get over an average winter. The crazy snow totals don’t stop there. In Redfield, NY, more than 32 inches fell in 24 hours between Christmas Day and early Tuesday. The region is expecting up to an additional 36 inches of snow by tomorrow, making shoveling a futile task. If Erie picks up four inches, it will officially set the record for the snowiest December ever recorded in Pennsylvania. “Travel will be very difficult to impossible,” the National Weather Service wrote in its lake-effect snow warning, a polite way of saying “we hope you’re not sick of your family yet.” The region from Cleveland to far upstate New York is no stranger to massive snow totals. Its geography sets it up perfectly for these types of large snowstorms. And in a seemingly strange twist of fate, climate change could actually provide them with a boost. Lake effect snow requires a few things to fall into place. The first, as with all snowstorms, is cold. It’s gotta be below 32°F to snow. For the Great Lakes region, cold air dropping out of Canada provides that key ingredient. But what allows lake effect snowstorms to produce such huge amounts of snow is, well, the lakes. Specifically, it’s the difference between the air temperature and the water temperature of the Great Lakes. As cold air rushes over lakes, it sweeps up some of the heat (relatively speaking) and moisture from the lakes’ surface. The length of the Great Lakes allow these burgeoning storms to pick up a huge head of steam as they barrel toward land. By the time they reach the Great Lakes’ shores, the air has become so moist and unstable that it unleashes a massive amount of snow with rates that can approach three inches an hour. These storms tend to come in narrow bands that result in tight snowfall gradients and even sunny skies a few miles from to most intense parts of the storm. Angela Fritz at Capital Weather Gang explains this curious quirk : “When a band of lake effect snow really gets going, an interesting thing happens. Air rises in the snowy regions and then sinks on either side, which means the area right next to these snow bands can be completely clear, with blue sky and sun. It also means just a few miles can separate 53 inches from zero.” The shape of the lakes and direction winds usually travel means that within the region, there are lake effect snow hot spots. The areas around Buffalo and Syracuse can get particularly snowy because winds are able to travel over long expanses of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, respectively. Parts of Michigan are also prone to heavy lake effect snow, particularly areas along the south shore of Lake Superior. The snowiest ski resort in the Midwest, for example, is on the Keweenaw Peninsula, which juts out into the lake from the Upper Peninsula and acts as a lake effect snow magnet. Lake effect snow is most common in November and December when there’s a lot of open water on the Great Lakes. As winter wears on and the lakes freeze over, moisture for these storms disappear. Ice only covers 3 percent of the Great Lakes as of Saturday but a coming Arctic blast could cause them to rapidly freeze up in the coming weeks, shutting down lake effect snow season. That’s where climate change comes in, though. Peak Great Lakes ice cover has been declining since satellite measurements began in the 1970s. Less ice means more chances for lake effect snow. And turns out that that’s exactly what scientists have observed. A 2003 study looking back to the 1930s showed an increase in lake effect snow across the entire lake effect snow region. A 2009 study using slightly stricter quality controls found that areas downwind of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan have seen significant increases with slightly less significant increases near Lakes Ontario and Erie. But snow could become less bountiful if climate change continues to wreak havoc. Warmer weather means less ice on the lakes, but it also means fewer days with freezing weather. Without early season cold, early season lake effect snowstorms could become less common according to a 2015 study. Ditto for late season ones after the ice starts to break up. That’s bad news for snow lovers, but a small silver lining of climate change for future 20somethings stuck at home for the holidays (lol kidding, their lives will probably be hell ).","The Great Lakes region is sending the year out with a bang.

Andrew Freedman,"The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is pummeling the East Coast, bringing heavy snow and sleet to the most populated part of the U.S., from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston on Wednesday. The storm formed overnight on Tuesday as a strong low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere approached the East Coast and helped spark a surface area of low pressure off the coast of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. The low pressure area is intensifying as it moves slowly northeastward, spreading areas of heavy snow inland. SEE ALSO: Does ordering delivery during a snowstorm make me a trash human? This is likely to be the biggest snowstorm for so late in the season on record in Washington, D.C., and it could be the biggest March snowstorm in Philadelphia, where about a foot of snow is expected. More than a foot of snow could pile up in New York City if conditions come together just right, potentially making it one of the top storms for so late in the season. Further north in Boston it will probably just rank as a moderate to heavy spring snowstorm, but not a historic event. The 4th nor'easter of the month as seen from space on March 21, 2018. Image: noaa. The storm is snarling travel across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, with most flights in and out of New York's airports and Philadelphia canceled on Wednesday, and significant disruptions at Washington area airports as well. One feature of the storm forecast has been a dichotomy between the National Weather Service's (NWS) snowfall predictions and those of private sector forecasters. The NWS has both Philadelphia and New York City in a zone of 12-to-18-inch accumulations, whereas reliable media outlets have been predicting less, on the order of 6-to-12 inches, based in part on the high March sun angle and likelihood of a mix between snow and sleet at times. In addition, the precise location of the most intense bands of snow, known as ""mesoscale bands"" because of their small dimensions, is difficult to forecast beyond an hour or two in advance. It's the areas that experience these bands for the longest period of time that will wrack up the highest snow totals, while areas just a few miles away could see half as much snow. Thundersnow also typically occurs in these bands as well. The forecast has been particularly challenging this time because of disagreements between leading computer models, as well. The European model — statistically the most accurate global weather model for the medium time range — suggested far lower snowfall amounts on Tuesday afternoon, which raised forecasters' blood pressure considerably. But other models held steady, predicting serious snow accumulation in big cities. The Weather Service has been warning that this will be a high-impact storm, particularly for the Philadelphia area and New York City, where power outages and ""impossible"" travel conditions are expected by the evening commute, as narrow bands of very heavy snow pivot across this region on the northwest side of the low pressure area. While it's unusual to see four nor'easters in a row, this is not unheard of. The Weather Prediction Center tweeted an example of such an occurrence in December and January of 1987. However, there is statistical evidence showing that slow-to-breakdown weather patterns that can lead to extreme outcomes, such as heat waves and heavy precipitation events, are becoming more common as the climate warms in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. One study, published in the journal Nature Communications on March 13, tied warming Arctic winters and sea ice loss to an increase in intense winter storms along the East Coast of the U.S. However, the precise physical mechanisms that cause Arctic warming to alter weather patterns well outside the Far North have not yet been well-established in the scientific literature, and this is an area of active research and debate in the weather and climate communities. A general explanation of what's been going on so far this March, however, is that the jet stream — the highway of air moving from west-to-east at around 35,000 feet, which steers weather systems and helps energize them — has been repeatedly taking big dips across the East Coast. Right now, the jet stream has a sharp bend to it, carving out a low pressure area in the middle of the curve, or trough. What a dip, or trough, in the jet stream looks like on a weather map. Image: weatherbell analytics Other factors have influenced the fusillade of nor'easters, including a pattern of air pressure over the North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as a strong blocking pattern of high pressure near Greenland that is holding up weather systems like a stop light at an intersection. A Greenland block, which typically consists of a persistent area of high pressure, is considered a prerequisite to causing some of the biggest East Coast snowstorms on record, since it forces the jet stream to dive southward across the eastern U.S., and allows storms time to intensify. A blocking pattern can also force storms to move close to the coast, and sometimes even forces them to move backwards, from east-to-west, prolonging heavy snow, strong winds, and coastal flooding. The storm on Wednesday will move fast enough to avoid causing severe coastal flooding, but if the NWS is right, and a foot-and-a-half of snow falls in some parts of the Washington to Boston corridor, this event will still go down in history as one of the biggest snowstorms for so late in the season.","The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is pummeling the East Coast, bringing heavy snow and sleet to the most populated part of the U.S., from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston on Wednesday.

,"At a Glance Winter Storm Benji dumped inches of snow on parts of the South, making travel more difficult. Schools were canceled Friday and residents were urged to stay home. Nearly 300,000 homes and businesses lost power in the path of the winter storm. Residents from South Texas eastward across the Deep South enjoyed the presence of rare December snow on Friday, while officials were hopeful that warm road temperatures would counter the snowfall and minimize the impacts of Winter Storm Benji. Early Friday morning, thundersnow was reported in some parts of southern Texas and even in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as the system brought bursts of snow that were heavy at times. Farther east, heavy snow fell in cities like Jackson, Mississippi, Birmingham, Alabama, and the northern suburbs of Atlanta. (MORE: The Latest Forecast for Winter Storm Benji ) The snow also had an impact on power – nearly 300,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia combined Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. Texas Accumulating snow was reported as far south as Brownsville Friday morning as southeastern Texas enjoyed a rare snowfall from Benji. In the Houston area, several school districts delayed opening because of road conditions, according to the Houston Chronicle. ""We're experiencing delays with bus transportation due to weather, traffic, and staffing,"" Houston ISD said in a release sent Friday morning. ""School leaders most impacted have been contacted, but this will be a district-wide problem. We also urge parents whose student rides the bus to make sure they're bundled up and to be patient as we work to get every bus rider to school safely. The safety of our students is our top priority, especially in unusual conditions such as those around the city today."" (MORE: Once-in-a-Decade Snow Falls in South Texas ) Nearly 50,000 customers were without power in the Lone Star State Friday morning. Louisiana Multiple school districts in southeastern Louisiana canceled classes Friday, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, as Benji's snow became problematic for travelers across the region. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Friday morning, with most of those outages grouped in the south-central part of the state. A stretch of U.S. 90 was closed in both directions from Amelia to Gray late Friday morning because of ice on the roadway, the Times-Picayune also said. The closure impacted a stretch of the highway about 20 miles long in southern Louisiana. Snow flurries fell in New Orleans during the afternoon hours, providing a rare wintry scene for the Big Easy. On the 24-mile causeway bridge that spans Lake Pontchartrain, police aided drivers via slow-moving convoys on the slick roadway, according to the Associated Press. ""Hopefully, the only people on the roads are the ones who have to be out today,"" Dexter Accardo of the St. Tammany Parish government told the Times-Picayune. ""We're advising everyone to stay off the roads if they can."" Mississippi Roads became troublesome in areas and more than 80,000 homes and businesses lost power in southern parts of the state as Benji dumped several inches of snow Friday morning. Parts of southern Mississippi received up to a half-foot of snow, making Benji one of the biggest snowstorms to hit the area since records began, according to the National Weather Service.

Despite the headaches, many Mississippians were grateful that it wasn't a different kind of wintry precipitation for once. ""My whole life it was always ice storms, rarely snow,"" Jackson resident Jason Tuten told the AP. ""I guess the conditions were perfect."" Alabama Residents were urged to stay home in northern Alabama as Benji turned roads dangerous. AL.com reported numerous crashes on Interstate 65 Friday morning, and meteorologists said street conditions were worsening as the morning went on. Reports from the NWS mid-morning Friday said all city roads were closed in Talladega, and some streets in Anniston were becoming impassable, with multiple wrecks reported. Georgia More than 650 flights were canceled into and out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport – making up virtually all of the domestic cancellations – as Benji made travel treacherous in North Georgia on Friday. Although many roads in the Atlanta area were pretreated with a brine solution, the slushy roads were packed midday with drivers looking to get home and beat the rush. Schools in the metro Atlanta area dismissed students early and thousands of residents hit the streets at the same time, creating another gridlock situation. ""We're surprised that this little snowfall would cause this much disruption to the entire city,"" Lucas Rachow told the AP while trying to get a ride to the airport. North Carolina With some of the South's biggest snow totals expected to fall in western and northern North Carolina, officials were taking no chances with travel – not even the state's leader. Gov. Roy Cooper postponed two events because of Benji, one in Waynesville and one in Asheville, where he was scheduled to appear, according to the AP. Those events will be rescheduled after the storm wraps up, the report added. More than 10,000 homes and businesses were without power statewide Friday afternoon because of the winter storm.

A state of emergency has been declared in North Carolina, with some areas reporting as much as 0.5m (18.5ins) of snow over the weekend. One man died after a tree fell on his car. A search is under way for a driver whose vehicle was found in a river. Thousands of flights were also cancelled across the region. More than 300,000 people were affected by electricity outages in the Carolinas, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia on Sunday, while storm warnings remained in place in the south-east ""especially North Carolina and Virginia"", the National Weather Service (NWS) said in a tweet. The storm was expected to move off the coast on Monday, although the NWS's lead forecaster Michael Schichtel warned it would continue to be ""a dangerous system"". ""It's slow to move off the Carolinas but a saving grace is that it won't hit New England,"" he told Reuters news agency. In some areas, so much snow fell the weight brought power lines crashing down. But the main danger appeared to be on the roads. Almost 60 crashes were reported in Virginia, state police told local media, with the number rising to 500 in North Carolina between midnight and 11:00 local time on Sunday.

Faced with continuing frigid temperatures through at least midday Wednesday, dozens of school districts, colleges and agencies announced another round of closures as officials called for Houstonians to give the weather - and the roads - one more day to warm up. ""It makes no sense to put your employees in harm's way unless its absolutely necessary that they be at work,"" Harris County Judge Ed Emmett said late Tuesday. Mayor Sylvester Turner urged residents to stay off the roads until the ice begins to thaw.

The winter storm sent an icy mix across much of South, Central and East Texas, closing schools from Galveston to Austin, San Antonio, Waco and Tyler along with most of the state's major universities. AT HOME: With schools and day care centers closed, parents find other options for their kids The storm moved through the Houston region during the day Tuesday, sending temperatures into the 20s as sleet, snow and freezing rain blanketed the area with a thin but dangerous layer of ice. Temperatures early Wednesday were expected to plummet again into the 20s - levels not seen in January since 1996. The record low for Houston on Jan. 17 came in 1930, when temperatures dropped to 15 degrees. Across the region, nearly 100,000 CenterPoint customers lost power, but almost all had been restored by Tuesday evening. But sunshine is in the forecast. The National Weather Service in Houston predicted Wednesday would be sunny with a high near 40, and warming temperatures the rest of the week could push Sunday to near 70, albeit with rain. Warming centers open Dozens of schools districts - including Houston, Cypress-Fairbanks, Katy, Humble and Pasadena - closed for a second day on Wednesday, adding to the missed days this school year caused by severe weather. Local universities - including the University of Houston and Texas Southern University - also remained closed Wednesday. The Houston Fire Department remained busy, responding to more than 450 calls in 17 hours, Chief Samuel Pena said. Officials warned residents to take extra care with space heaters and to avoid using extension cords. The brutal cold sent at least two people to the hospital with hypothermia, and one man, who was believed to have been homeless, was found dead on the city's south side near in the 6700 block of Telephone Road near Bellfort.

About 400 people arrived at two warming centers set up by the American Red Cross at South Main Baptist Church and Pleasant Missionary Grove Baptist Church. The Houston Police Department also spent part of Tuesday offering to give free rides to Houstonians living in encampments near Minute Maid Park - an effort that Chief Art Acevedo said ended with many ""having a change of heart and agreeing to be transported."" Still, officials said many remained in harm's way Tuesday night. ""We still have a number of people who are on our streets, and we want to get them off the streets and into a warmer environment,"" Turner said. Stay home today Nearly 400 vehicle accidents were reported on Harris County roadways, including more than two dozen major accidents, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. Houston alone had more than 300 accidents throughout the day, prompting Acevedo to join other Texas officials in pleading for drivers to stay off of the roads. ""Driving conditions are extremely treacherous around the entire region right now,"" he wrote on Twitter about 2 p.m., citing a 1,000-foot stretch of where the chief said he saw a half-dozen accidents. HEADING OUT: Tips for driving on icy roads from people who know Texas Department of Transportation officials said they had dozens of crews working around the clock in the Houston area to de-ice roadways, working first to reopen freeways closed by the icy conditions. At least 100 roadways were impacted by icy conditions, with 20 of them impassable, TxDOT officials said. Thoroughfares like Texas 225 and the Fred Hartman Bridge over the Houston Ship Channel were particularly icy, TxDOT officials said. In Fort Bend County, authorities closed portions of major highways Tuesday, including the Grand Parkway, Southwest Freeway and Westpark Tollway. ""All things considered, things have been going rather well in Fort Bend County,"" Fort Bend County Judge Bob Hebert said. ""We responded to it right - by we, I mean everybody."" Fort Bend County offices and courts will be closed again on Wednesday, and all non-essential employees were told to remain home. Hospitals in the Texas Medical Center remained operational, though some also sent home non-essential employees. Some elective procedures and clinic appoints were canceled. Is winter over? Good news appears to be ahead. Nearly five months after Hurricane Harvey and one month after the Bayou City residents awoke to their first snowfall in years, this week's chilly temperatures are expected to the last bit of winter in Houston this season, said Eric Berger, a Houston meteorologist who writes for the popular Space City Weather blog. ""The second half of this month does appear likely to be noticeably warmer than our cold start to 2018,"" Berger wrote recently. ""While there are always caveats about long-range forecasts, it seems that the pattern will change, with more of the colder air getting shunted off to the east before diving south all of the way to the Gulf Coast.""

JEFF MARTIN / AP,"(ATLANTA) — Five years after cars, trucks and school buses became marooned on Atlanta freeways in what became known as “snow jam ,” another winter storm is threatening the city — just as thousands of fans begin pouring into town for Super Bowl 53.
A winter storm watch goes into effect at 4 a.m. Tuesday for Atlanta, a city known for grinding to a halt even in relatively light snowfalls.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Monday said state offices in more than 30 counties in the northern part of the state would be closed Tuesday, including those in the Atlanta area.
The National Weather Service projects that up to an inch (2.5 centimeters) of snow is possible Tuesday in Atlanta, with up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) in far northern suburbs. Forecasters warn of the possibility of ice-glazed roads and highways.
The potential for black ice is “the overriding concern,” said Homer Bryson, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.
“Temperatures are going to plummet,” the governor said at a Monday news conference.
“It’s very similar to what we saw in 2014 where the roadways will not have time to dry off before the moisture or precipitation on them refreezes,” Kemp said. “And that’s when you have black ice, and that’s what causes wrecks, which causes gridlock and public safety issues, injuries.”
Sunday’s Super Bowl will be played in downtown Atlanta in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which has a roof. The roof will be open if weather permits, officials have said.
There’s a 40 percent chance of showers Sunday, but highs will be near 58 degrees (14 Celsius). That’s slightly warmer than average for Feb. 3 in Atlanta, climate records show.
But forecasters say the more immediate threat is Tuesday, when roads could be treacherous.
“It is often easy to pass judgment on how we in Georgia deal with snow and ice, but for those from the north what you do know is that an ice event is very different than a snow event,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Monday. “And because we don’t want a repeat of 2014, we have already begun to pretreat our streets and are paying particularly attention to our sidewalks because we do know that we will have many visitors in our tourist areas.”
Forecasters were uncertain how widespread the snowfall will be.
“Some uncertainty continues regarding amounts of snow accumulations and how far south and east the threat may extend,” the weather service said in a Monday update on the approaching storm.

Michael Hardy,"Elizabeth Root Blackmer documents the natural world one square inch at a time. For decades, the Maine-based photographer has used macro lenses to capture breathtaking images of water droplets on spiderwebs, dew-soaked flower petals, thin skeins of ice, and other phenomena too small to normally attract our notice.
""I like things that are abstract and ambiguous, says Blackmer, who studied fine arts at Harvard under renowned experimental photographer Len Gittleman. ""It draws you in if there's a bit of mystery in it. Sometimes you recognize the image, sometimes you don't.""
For her latest series, Blackmer has been shooting macro images of the frost crystals that form inside the storm windows of her Maine farmhouse. The conditions must be just right for the crystals to formthe window surface can be neither too warm nor too cold, and the air must contain enough moisture. Sometimes the frost freezes too quickly and the windows develop a coat of white frost without any patterns in it.
But when everything turns out right, the results are extraordinary: delicate, gossamer-thin frost crystals that look carved out of glass. Blackmer photographs most of them at dawn, illuminated by the sun's pale golden light, before they begin to thaw and disappear. Later, in Photoshop, she enhances the colors to bring out the deep blues and yellows. (""It's the natural colors, but they aren't naturally that intense."")
Although the objects she photographs are small, Blackmer bestows an almost mystical significance on them. ""There are these patterns that exist throughout nature, on all different scales,"" she says. ""You don't necessarily know what scale you're looking atit could be taken from an airplane, or it could be an inch across.""
Like the water droplets she photographs, Blackmer's frost crystals are defined by their ephemerality. She sees her photography as a way of fixing these transient objects in time: ""Sometimes they're gone within seconds, if they're dewdrops sticking to spiderwebs. And some of them would never be seen by another person if I didn't take a picture of them.""

Associated Press,"SAVANNAH, Ga. – A brutal winter storm smacked the coastal Southeast with a rare blast of snow and ice Wednesday, hitting parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina with their heaviest snowfall in nearly three decades. Forecasters warned that the same system could soon strengthen into a ""bomb cyclone"" as it rolls up the East Coast, bringing hurricane-force winds, coastal flooding and up to a foot of snow. At least 17 deaths were blamed on dangerously cold temperatures that for days have gripped wide swaths of the U.S. from Texas to New England. A winter storm warning extended from the Gulf Coast of Florida's ""Big Bend"" region all the way up the Atlantic coast. Forecasters said hurricane-force winds blowing offshore on Thursday could generate 24-foot (7-meter) seas. Schools in the Southeast called off classes just months after being shut down because of hurricane threats, and police urged drivers to stay off the roads in a region little accustomed to the kind of winter woes common to the Northeast. In Savannah, snow blanketed the city's lush downtown squares and collected on branches of burly oaks for the first time in nearly eight years. William Shaw, a Savannah native, used baby steps to shuffle along a frozen road from his home to the post office. ""It almost seems the town is deserted just like in the last hurricane,"" said Shaw, 65. ""There's no one on the street. It's got a little eerie feeling."" Dump trucks spread sand on major streets in Savannah ahead of the storm and police closed several bridges, overpasses and a major causeway because of ice. By the time the morning's dreary sleet and rain turned to fluffy snow, Savannah came out to play. Families with children flocked to Forsyth Park near the downtown historic district for snowball fights. The National Weather Service recorded 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) of snow — Savannah's first measurable snowfall since February 2010 and the first that exceeded an inch (2.5 centimeters) in 28 years. Across the Georgia-South Carolina line in Charleston, the weather service reported 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) as the snow was winding down at 5 p.m. That's the most snowfall in Charleston since December 1989, and plenty for Chris Monoc's sons, ages 4 and 2, to go sledding outside their home near the city's iconic Ravenel Bridge. ""They probably will be teenagers the next time something like this happens, and that's kind of sad,"" Monoc said. ""But we'll enjoy it while it is here."" Airports shut down in Savannah, Charleston and elsewhere as airlines cancelled 500 flights Wednesday, and at least 1,700 more were cancelled Thursday. Interstate 95 was nearly an icy parking lot for almost all of its 200 miles (322 kilometers) in South Carolina. Troopers couldn't keep up with the number of reported wrecks which numbered in the hundreds. In Tallahassee, Florida, Michigan transplant Laura Donaven built a snowman 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall. The city tweeted that snow fell there for the first time in 28 years. ""I made a snowball and threw it at my dad,"" said Donaven, a 41-year-old hair salon owner. The weather service said the winter storm will probably intensify into a ""bomb cyclone"" that could dump more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow on the Boston area on Thursday and at least half a foot (15 centimeters) of snow in the New York City region. Meteorologists have been using the term ""bomb"" for storms for decades, but the phrase went viral on social media on Wednesday. A storm is a bomb — or bombogensis happens — when it drops 24 millibars of pressure in 24 hours. This storm looks like it will intensify twice that rate, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Mississippi's largest city said record cold is breaking water mains, leaving some customers with little or no water flow. Jackson city spokeswoman Kai Williams said Wednesday evening that the city knew of 37 separate water main breaks that it attributed to cold. The city has declared an emergency and is hiring outside contractors to help repair water main breaks. Blizzard warnings were issued from Rhode Island to Maine. Oravec said he expects they could be extended as far south as parts of New York. ""It's sort of akin to a hurricane traveling up the coast,"" says Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at the private firm Weather.US. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency through Friday for 28 counties. School systems on the Alabama coast waived uniform requirements so students could bundle up. Florida's largest theme parks announced that water attractions such as Disney's Typhoon Lagoon, Universal Orlando's Volcano Bay and SeaWorld's Aquatica were closed. Temperatures were running well below normal for this time of year, and the lows are expected to hover right around freezing. In Prairieville, Louisiana, Valerie Anne Broussard struggled overnight to keep warm in a house that is being rebuilt after the 2016 floods that hit the small community southeast of Baton Rouge. Her home has exterior walls and floors but no insulation, no central heating and only a few working electrical outlets. Eggs that she left on the kitchen counter froze and broke open. ""It's like a camping trip that I didn't sign up for,"" said Broussard, who's been huddling with her 8-year-old daughter, newborn baby and boyfriend in a bedroom warmed by space heaters. Making the most of the South's bitter cold snap, the North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro offered discounted tickets for those willing to brave the cold to see polar bears frolic in their kind of weather, along with Arctic foxes and elk. African elephants, lions and gorillas were sheltered out of public view.

,"At a Glance Snow and ice from Winter Storm Bruce has snarled traffic. Nationwide, more than 2,000 flights have been canceled. Drivers stranded on impassable roads were rescued overnight in Illinois. Hundreds of flights were canceled as heavy snow and high winds from Winter Storm Bruce made travel treacherous for those trying to get home after Thanksgiving. Motorists were asked to stay off the highways as Bruce brought blizzard conditions to five states. Nationwide, more than 2,000 flights were canceled Sunday and Monday, according to FlightAware. Over 1,500 of the cancellations occurred at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Chicago's Midway International and Kansas City International saw the greater portion of their cancelations Sunday, but had lingering issues into Monday morning. As of Monday morning, over 250,000 customers were without power in the Midwest, the vast majority being reported in Illinois, according to PowerOutage.us. (MORE: Where Is Winter Storm Bruce Headed Next? ) Here's a state-by-state breakdown of Winter Storm Bruce's impact on the Midwest. Illinois In Illinois, overnight snowmobile rescues were reported after drivers became stranded in their cars on Route 6 near Princeton due to high snowdrifts, according to the Illinois State Police. The Ogle County Sheriff warned drivers that many state roads were still too hazardous to drive on Monday morning, and while IDOT crews were working to clear them, they had no time frame as to when road conditions were expected to improve. Schools in the area were closed for the day. At their highest, outages in Illinois reached upwards of 300,000 customers without power statewide Sunday evening, said ComEd Spokesman Tom Dominguez. Michigan Dozens of crashes were reported in the Lansing area Monday morning as Bruce coated roads with snow and ice. The Ionia County Sheriff called the roads ""treacherous"" in a statement, encouraging drivers to stay off them unless travel was essential. Schools in the Flint area were closed Monday with poor road conditions. Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer declared a state of disaster emergency in response to the winter storm moving across his state. The declaration authorizes the use of state resources and personnel to assist with response and recovery operations in affected counties. The Kansas Department of Transportation issued a blunt warning on social media early Sunday: ""Do not try to travel west if you are in NE Kansas and trying to go west, STOP NOW."" Over 200 miles of Interstate 70, from Topeka to the Colorado border, were shut down for most of the day Sunday, reopening around 9 p.m. Sunday night. A multiple car accident shut down U.S. 400 east of Beaumont, the National Weather Service reported. Several other highways east of Dodge City were also closed. Many school districts in Kansas canceled Monday classes. The University of Kansas canceled classes at the campus in Lawrence and the Edwards Campus in Overland Park because traveling was so difficult on Sunday. Iowa Near Creston, motorists were stuck for more than an hour on Interstate 35. At one point, a bus slid off the road, but it has been moved by state troopers, WOI-TV reported. Missouri Interstate 29 was closed from St. Joseph to the Iowa border because of whiteout conditions, the Missouri Highway Patrol tweeted. The roadway was later reopened despite being still blanketed in snow, said MSHP. Nebraska Nearly every roadway in Nebraska, southwest Iowa, and northwest Missouri was either partially covered or fully covered by snow and blowing snow, News Channel Nebraska reported Sunday. Even Monday, crews from the Nebraska Transportation Department reported that several highways were still closed due to snow and ice in the southern part of the state. KLKN-TV in Lincoln reported that near-blizzard conditions were keeping first responders from reaching stranded motorists in Saline and Jefferson counties. The Nebraska State Patrol closed westbound I-80 for several hours Sunday morning between Lincoln and Omaha because of crashes, which included semitrailer trucks jackknifed across the highway. At least one person was injured. Snow emergencies were declared in several Nebraska communities, KWBE reported, including Fairbury, Beatrice, Nebraska City. Colorado On Saturday, the Colorado Highway Patrol said a 20-vehicle pileup, including a jackknifed semitrailer, closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 70 near Frisco for several hours Saturday. Minor injuries were reported. About 15 vehicles spun out about 6 miles east of Silverthorne, which caused the eastbound lanes of I-70 to be temporarily closed there. Eastbound lanes near Vail Pass also were closed because of hazardous road conditions. Emergency shelters were opened for stranded drivers. Information from the Associated Press was included in this article.","The Weather Channel Winter Storm Bruce: Stranded Drivers Rescued in Illinois, Over 2000 Flights Canceled The Weather Channel Hundreds of flights were canceled as heavy snow and high winds from Winter Storm Bruce made travel treacherous for those trying to get…",2018-11-26T17:15:36Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Winter Storm Bruce: Stranded Drivers Rescued in Illinois, Over 2000 Flights Canceled - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2018-11-25-winter-storm-bruce-impacts-travel/,https://s.w-x.co/bruce_0.jpg,,Weather.com,ice storm,1

Maddie Stone,"UTQIAĠVIK, ALASKA —On a crumbling heap of thousand-year-old garbage overlooking a leaden sea, Anne Jensen shakes her head disapprovingly. A gust of Arctic air whips her hair around her face as she scrutinizes the beige house perched sixty feet above us, atop an Iñupiat archaeological site that’s fast eroding into the ocean. “We have buried in ground a library of Alexandria. And the library is burning.” “No wonder they wanted me to come out here,” Jensen mutters under her breath. She starts scrambling up the jumbled heap of thawed permafrost and ancient wares to get a better view of the development above. “They’ve gotta move that house,” she says. “This can’t keep going.” We’re standing on the bank of Ukkuqsi, a site that Jensen, Utqiaġvik’s resident archaeologist, has been monitoring since 1994, ever since the frozen body of a girl who died eight hundred years ago emerged from the bluffs. Iñupiat people have lived in and around Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) for more than a thousand years. Their history has accumulated in the ground beneath their feet, preserved in the same permafrost soils that underlie most of Alaska’s North Slope. But today, climate change is causing that history to vanish. Temperatures across the Arctic are rising at twice the global average rate, causing sea ice to retreat rapidly. With less ice around to dampen their energy, waves are getting more powerful and battering coastlines for longer. Coastal archaeological sites like Ukkuqsi are getting chewed up. On top of the erosion, a warmer atmosphere is causing Alaska’s permafrost to thaw. As that happens, exquisitely preserved remains—clothing, sod houses, scraps of food, human bodies—are starting to rot. “Just like taking something out of the freezer,” Jensen explains. It’s a story that’s playing out across the entire world, from mountaintop glaciers to Caribbean islands. Over the last several decades, archaeologists have watched in alarm as history and heritage are erased by rising seas, melting ice, and worsening storms. Researchers liken the vanishing remains to books containing priceless knowledge about past cultures, past ecosystems, and past climates. “We have buried in ground a library of Alexandria,” Thomas McGovern, an archaeologist at Hunter College who has been involved in excavations across the North Atlantic, tells me. “And the library is burning.” As we walk along the bluff, Jensen pulls rubbish out of the blackened soil. Bits of bone and baleen, scraps of leather, shards of what are perhaps old stone tools. “It was a big, big village,” she says, turning over a fragment of a whale skull. These were often used as a first step into a tunnel that led to a subterranean winter house. “A really happening place.” She adds, a bit regretfully, that all of the thawing, slumping, and erosion has caused the exposed materials to lose their archaeological context—their relationship to other objects, in both space and time, that allows researchers to learn something from them. “You can find some cool stuff, but there’s not a lot you can do with it,” she says. After a few more minutes contemplating the ill-fated house atop the mound, we make our way downslope to the beach, past hefty black sandbags put in place by the local government to keep the erosion at bay. It’s hard to tell if they are having an effect. The bluff has retreated about twenty feet in the past ten years; several hundred feet in the lifetimes of some of Utqiaġvik’s elders. Every time there’s a fall storm, it retreats even further, sandbags or no. HEALY, ALASKA—Bitter winters still dominate life in the Alaskan interior, but a practiced eye can… Read more Read Back in her lab, at the Barrow Arctic Science Observatory a few miles north of town, Jensen shows me artifacts from Walakpa, a major coastal archaeological site about fifteen miles southwest of Utqiaġvik that’s likely been occupied on and off for over 3,000 years. The site, which contains an extensive record of Birnik and Thule Eskimo cultures, started to erode about five years back. The oldest, deepest layers, which sit right along the coastline, are going fast. “You can see entire houses getting ready to be eroded,” Anna Prentiss, an archaeologist at the University of Montana, tells me. “Houses on top of houses. This amazing record is due to be washed away.” With funds from the Ukpeavik Iñupiat Corporation and the National Science Foundation, Jensen led major rescue digs at Walakpa in the summers of 2016 and 2017. The excavation, which involved over three dozen volunteers in the lab and field, turned up tent platforms, storage pits, and exquisitely-stratified middens, trash piles that act as frozen tissue archives. Jensen is hoping for at least one more summer of field work, so that she can finish excavating the bottom of a house that sits right on the erosion face. A corner of that house has already eroded, and the ground at the back is cracking away. “You can see entire houses getting ready to be eroded. Houses on top of houses. This amazing record is due to be washed away.” “It’s very obvious that the site has been broken in half,” Zac Petersen, who volunteered at Walakpa this past summer, tells me. He’s worried the excavation area is just one bad storm away from vanishing. The weather he experienced while camped out on the coast over the summer was alarming. “We had this huge storm and had to dig a massive trench around our tents,” he says. “Waves were crashing up against the cliff, and pieces of dirt were coming down. A storm like that in the summer—that’s definitely not something anyone in town remembers happening.” Charlotta Hillerdal, an archaeologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, is in a similar race against time to excavate Nunalleq, a 15th-17th century pre-contact Yu’pik village site located on the edge of the Bering sea in southwest Alaska. Like Jensen’s sites, Nunalleq is threatened by erosion—an average of nearly twenty feet since 2009—and by thawing permafrost. Hillerdal estimates that the entire site has about a decade left. But the areas she is actively excavating, which are close to the erosion edge, “can disappear this winter,” she says. There’s a lot to lose. “The preservation is extraordinary,” Hillerdal tells me. “We have grass ropes, basketry, pretty much an amazing sample of Yu’pik pre contact life from this time period. The number of museum quality pieces is in the thousands.” The preservation at Nunalleq is so good that researchers are using the archaeological material for high-resolution molecular analyses, Hillerdal says. “We can do isotopic analysis of human hair to find out more about about past diets. We’re doing DNA studies. From a scientific standpoint, it’s unmeasured.” The frustration Hillerdal faces is one many archaeologists I spoke with identified: Just as technology is allowing them to answer new questions from the archaeological record, the record is slipping away. McGovern has colleagues working in western Iceland who recently reconstructed the population dynamics of Atlantic cod from the 16th to the 20th century, using DNA isolated from bones found in abandoned fishing villages. Another pilot project used ancient DNA to successfully identify a half dozen marine mammals from archaeological remains in Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroes. These projects suggest ancient remains, paired with nascent molecular tools, can offer insight into animal populations long before industrial society. Such information could help inform conservation strategies today. Insights from the archaeological record could even help us tackle human-caused climate change. After all, as George Edwardson, president of the Iñupiat Community of the North Slope reminded me, the people of the Arctic have been adapting to climatic changes for thousands of years, ever since their ancestors first migrated into Alaska across the Bering Land Bridge. “There’s a lot we can learn from the past about environmental resilience,” Jensen says. “It’s a tragic irony that just as we are cranking up our game, and contributing to global change research, our data sets are being destroyed,” McGovern adds. It’s not just in the Arctic, either: A study published recently in PLOS One identified over 13,000 archaeological heritage sites in the Southeastern United States that’ll be inundated by three feet of sea level rise, an amount that could occur by the end of the century. Co-author David Anderson from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville emphasized that the estimated number of at-risk sites is probably conservative. “The recorded archaeological sites are only a fraction of what’s out there,” he says, adding that a “vast number” aren’t yet on the National Register. “This is probably the biggest challenge archaeology as a profession has faced.” According to McGovern, the profession needs a call to action. Archaeology needs people out in the field, surveying, documenting, and excavating as much as they can as soon as they can. He envisions a movement similar to the climate science community’s ice core collection effort, which ramped up in the late ‘90s and early 2000s in response to the realization that Earth’s mountain glaciers were vanishing. Those ice cores are now stored at universities, laboratories, and museums around the world, where scientists will continue using them to study past climates for decades to come. The urgency of the threat is just now becoming widely recognized. Last year, the Society for American Archaeology launched a Committee on Climate Change Strategies and Archaeological Resources to “[survey] what is happening to archaeological resources due to climate change” and come up with a strategic response. McGovern, who chairs the committee, recently joined European archaeologists at a major conference in the Netherlands to discuss the threats facing cultural heritage sites. “It was pretty much a clean sweep,” he says. “Everyone was expressing severe concern about climate change.” But it remains to be seen who would fund a global effort to survey and excavate vanishing sites—or even a fraction of them. In the U.S., the National Park Service has taken on a leadership role, both in terms of planning for climate change impacts on cultural heritage sites, and funding researchers who want to study threatened sites that reside within parks. But NPS funds are limited. “I would say we’ve got fifteen years worth of proposals at current funding rates,” Dan Odess, Assistant Associate Director of the NPS Park Cultural Resources Programs, tells me. “And they keep coming in.” “Under this administration, of course it won’t happen in the states,” George Hambrecht, an archaeologist at the University of Maryland, says when asked about the possibility of a large-scale effort to excavate threatened sites. “But there is evidence that the Europeans and Chinese [funding agencies] are going to pick up some of the research slack.” Several other archaeologists echoed this sentiment. Still, Hambrecht adds, “there’s absolutely no way we’ll be able to save everything.” Odess agrees. His own archaeological research is focused in the Eastern Canadian Arctic, a vast expanse of sparsely-populated forest and tundra with only a handful of excavation projects taking place during field season. He thinks archaeologists need to involve local and indigenous communities in order to decide which sites are worth saving. After all, many sites, like those around Utqiaġvik, are deeply significant to the people living there today. “There’s absolutely no way we’ll be able to save everything.” “There are people’s relatives out there,” Jensen says, noting that every time a storm exposes new human remains at one of her sites, she gets a call about it. If possible, an excavation is arranged, and the remains are given to the city for repatriation and reburial in a modern cemetery. “The Elders’ feelings are obviously not to let these people fall into the ocean.” “As people become more aware of their heritage, they’re more likely to want to preserve it,” says Tom Dawson, an archaeologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Dawson would know. For nearly twenty years, he’s headed up SCAPE (Scottish Coastal Archaeology and the Problem of Erosion), an effort to record, preserve, and monitor eroding archaeological sites along the Scottish coastline, by bringing together academics, government agencies, and local communities. It’s one of the longest-running and most successful efforts to salvage archaeological sites threatened by environmental change. And the program is deeply dependent on local support. UTQIAĠVIK, ALASKA—Arnold Brower Jr., a 70-year-old Iñupiat whaling captain, can recall his first… Read more Read “We take action at sites communities nominate,” Dawson says, noting that SCAPE just completed a four-year field survey that updated older records on threatened coastal sites around Scotland. The survey was community-led, with locals using their mobile phones or maps to navigate to sites and assess their current condition. SCAPE is now drawing up a priority action list of sites based on the results of that survey. SCAPE has helped Scotland unearth, document, preserve many renowned and historically-significant places, including the Wemyss Caves, which feature the largest concentration of in situ Pictish carvings in the world, the Eyemouth Fort, built in the time of Queen Mary of Scots by the English, and later rebuilt by the French, and a rare Neolithic site beneath the burnt mound at Meur, in Orkney. It has also become a model for community-based archaeology elsewhere in the world, including in England, Ireland, and Wales. Dawson recently visited a community-based archaeological monitoring program in Florida, and met with researchers in Maine who are hoping to launch a similar effort. “I think a lot of countries are starting to, if not get to the actual excavation, they are starting to work out what’s at risk,” he says. But ultimately, lists of vulnerable sites and plans to survey them need to give way to action—and sooner rather than later. Jensen worries about what will happen if she can’t get back out to Walakpa next summer. Years racing to excavate Utqiagvik’s archaeological heritage before it slides into the sea has taught her that once an ancient settlement starts to go, it can go fast. “It’s not gradual,” she says. “Some years there’s no erosion, others you lose a whole chunk all at once.” This article was made with funding from Participant Media, the creator of “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.”","UTQIAĠVIK, ALASKA —On a crumbling heap of thousand-year-old garbage overlooking a leaden sea, Anne Jensen shakes her head disapprovingly.

Beth Skwarecki,"Forget the milk and eggs: If your power goes out, the last thing you want is a fridge full of perishables. Instead, here’s what to stock up on and how to plan ahead for a loss of power. Buy Stuff You Actually Like Don’t stock up on tuna if you hate tuna (unless it’s literally the only thing left at the store). For protein, you can try canned salmon, chicken, or beans instead. “I’ll eat this by candlelight when I’m hungry and desperate” is only a romantic idea when it’s not happening. And shop with meals in mind. Will you eat that canned chicken in a wrap? Better pick up some tortillas. If the grocery store shelves are bare, don’t be afraid to get creative. You can make PB&amp;J sandwiches on hot dog buns—and don’t let anybody tell you it’s a bad idea. Your Master List of Less Perishable Items Water. If there’s any chance you might lose water, fill every available container now. Bread, crackers, tortillas, buns Canned beans, chickpeas, lentils Canned fruit and vegetables Peanut butter and its kin Soy milk, almond milk, or any other milk-like substance that’s sold on shelves and not in the cooler section. You’ll want to chill these after opening, but they can sit in your pantry until then. Cereal (including oatmeal if you’ll have a way to prepare it) Anything that comes in a pouch and only calls for a minute or two of microwaving or boiling. If it says “pre-cooked” or “ready to eat,” you can just eat them cold. Snack bars, protein bars, Clif bars... anything in bar form. Anything that’s sold on a shelf when you buy it. Just check whether the package says you need to refrigerate after opening. Things in Your Fridge That Will Be Fine We keep a lot of things in our refrigerators that don’t really need to be there. Jam, for example, keeps longer in the fridge, but it won’t kill you at room temperature. Some things you can rescue from the fridge even if the power has been out a while: Hard cheeses Jams, jellies, syrups Peanut butter Bread and baked goods Many condiments, including soy sauce and vinaigrettes (check Still Tasty for shelf life guidelines) Fresh fruits and vegetables Butter The USDA has a list here of which refrigerated foods are still good after the power has been out. Freeze Everything Before the storm comes, pack some strategic things in your freezer: Water bottles, which can then act as ice packs to keep the rest of the food cold Perishable foods, like meats or leftovers. After a few days, if they still feel partially frozen, you can cook and eat them as if they were refrigerated the whole time. Frozen foods that you plan to eat when they are partially thawed. Plan Ahead for When Your Appliances Won’t Work If the power is out, you’ll be missing most of your appliances too: no way to turn on the microwave or an electric stove. If you have a gas-powered stove that will still work when the power is out, you may be able to light the burners with a long-reach lighter—so grab that lighter now. Is your can opener electric? Get a manual one. Will you perish without hot coffee? Get a thermos, and make yourself a pot of joe as soon as you start worrying about the power going out. If you have a balcony or a yard, consider the old-fashioned way of cooking food—with actual fire. Get some propane or charcoal and grill all your meals, or dig out the camp stove that you use when you’re backpacking. Even if you can only boil pots of water, a hot cup of tea or bowl of ramen will be a luxury when everything else is lukewarm.","Forget the milk and eggs: If your power goes out, the last thing you want is a fridge full of perishables.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"SkyWarn 13 Meteorologists: Monica Ott, Drew Williams and Darren Maier","A major winter storm will arrive in Western Wisconsin by Monday morning, with a combination of rain, ice and snow likely but a quick change to all snow in the Chippewa Valley and surrounding areas will lead to several inches of accumulation throughout the day, causing a severe disruption to everyday travel. Though Monday will look far different, there is still plenty of time to get out and run those errands before the snow starts to fly. The weather will just remain cloudy and mild today, with temperatures again well into the 30's. Conditions won't change much for tonight, though there may be some drizzle that starts to develop. In places that see temperatures drop down near freezing, this could lead to some light icing, while further north it may just be some very light snow. Conditions will then rapidly deteriorate on Monday. For those heading out early in the morning, precipitation in the form of rain, sleet and snow will begin to fill in and expand across the area from the south. This is when temperatures will be near 32 but a change to just heavy, wet snow is then expected by mid-morning. Plan on it being a slower morning commute than normal, but the worst conditions will hold off until later, with the height of this winter storm pushing through during the late morning, through the early evening hours. This means the evening commute will likely be far worse with several inches of snow already on the ground, combined with blowing which will lead to very low visibility at times. Winds will be increasing to 15-25 mph for the afternoon with some higher gusts, bringing near blizzard conditions at times. Bottom line is travel will be very difficult for several hours that will include the entire afternoon. Snow accumulations will be significant, with a swath of 6-10"" currently forecast through the Chippewa Valley, stretching southwest down towards the Rochester, MN area. Either side of this heaviest band of accumulation, amounts will drop off rather quickly and places further south around the La Crosse area will see mostly a rain/snow mix, with perhaps just an inch or two of accumulation. The storm will be winding down Monday night, but travel impacts will likely continue to be felt right into early Tuesday morning.

David Lumb,"The most obvious change will be the card shift. The sets from 2016 -- Whispers of the Old Gods, One Night in Karazhan and Mean Streets of Gadgetzan -- will all pass out of Standard format to make way for the new expansion. This is has traditionally been the best time of year for new players to jump in the game, since it has the least amount of cards in play, but the switchover also refreshes the meta of competitive decks and strategies. While this year's three sets are still shrouded in mystery, they will all have free single-player adventure content -- hopefully they'll be as inventive and enjoyable as the Arena-like Dungeon Run that came with the most recent expansion Kobolds &amp; Catacombs. But 2016's cards won't be the only ones joining the Wild format. Three old favorites will be added to the Hall of Fame, the honorific category Hearthstone' s team created last year to retire cards from the previously-immune Classic set that launched with the game. 2017's entries included fan-favorites like Ragnaros the Firelord, Sylvanas Windrunner and Azure Drake, which Blizzard put out to pasture for being auto-includes in most decks that were also becoming too difficult to design around. This year's Hall of Fame slate is much the same: Ice Block and Coldlight Oracle are both being retired for defining decks for years. Curiously, Molten Giant is also getting Hall of Fame'd with his 5-mana nerf reverted to its original cost; The Hearthstone team might be doing this as a gift for veteran fans to resurrect old decks in Wild. If you own any of these cards, you'll get a full dust reward as if you'd disenchanted them -- which can result in some free dust if you manage to craft them beforehand and dismantle them after, as this guide explains. The new year and next set will probably bring back casual and absent players curious about the next smattering of cards, but those who have been away for awhile will have to play catch-up on expansions and strategies they missed out on. To get over that 'homework hump,' Hearthstone is handing out a new Druid hero portrait for free (much like they did for 2017's first new set ). Players will earn Lunara, the gleeful dryad that Heroes of the Storm fans will recognize, after winning 10 games in the Standard format. The most exciting change won't be new cards or content, but the ability for any player to create their own tournament within the game client. Just set up the rules and hit 'launch' -- Hearthstone will matchmake and check decks to make sure they fit your bonkers theme (Lorewalker Cho + Faceless Manipulator + Mirage Caller, let's go). The beta will come later this year at an undetermined time, so in all likelihood, don't expect it alongside the first expansion. Finally, the new year will bring more international stops for the 2018 Hearthstone Championship Tour, which the Hearthstone team announced beforehand. Check up their blog post to see the new schedule. That's all we know about the Year of the Raven thus far, but fans should keep an eye out for news of 2018's first expansion that's likely to drop in the coming weeks.","Blizzard has solidified Hearthstone' s annual flow of retiring old cards and welcoming new ones: For the third year in a row, a new expansion will come in April that signals a sea change in the digital card game.

Daniel Manzo,"A developing storm in the Southwest brought another round of snow to the Four Corners on New Years Day, including almost 3 feet of snow in the mountains north of Albuquerque.
Interested in Weather?
Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
The storm will interact with a low in the Gulf Of Mexico and bring snow, freezing rain, sleet and flooding in the southern U.S. through Friday. Winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories, flash flood watches and winter storm watches are in effect for parts of the southern U.S. from Arizona to Mississippi.
Storm alerts cover most of the southern U.S. on Wednesday due to two storms moving through the region.
Temperatures are at or just below freezing in central Texas, which could make for slick spots Wednesday morning if rains freezes on contact with the ground. Travel between Abilene and Fort Worth could be treacherous in spots on Wednesday morning.
An icy mix is possible from San Angelo to Fort Worth during the day Wednesday, while snow moves from Tucson to El Paso. On the warmer side of the systems, heavy rain will move along a stationary front from Corpus Christi to Birmingham, Alabama. Locally heavy downpours are possible in central and southern Louisiana, as well as southeast Texas. Flash flooding is also possible in this region.
Rain is falling in eastern Texas while a rain and snow mix is likely farther west.
By Thursday morning, as the systems merge, another round of heavy rain is possible across southeast Texas and much of Louisiana. Another round of snow and ice will move across central and western Texas. There is a possibility some of this precipitation will make its way into parts of Oklahoma on Thursday, including the greater Oklahoma City metro area.
Heavy rain will move into the entire Gulf Coast region by Thursday.
The storm finally organizes by Friday morning and starts sliding off to the east. Unfortunately, the storm will still bring another round of very heavy rain for parts of the Gulf Coast.
Through Friday, 3 to 6 inches of rain are possible locally in parts of southeast Texas and much of Louisiana. Nearly 1 to 3 inches of rain are possible for the rest of the Gulf Coast from Texas to Georgia. Flash flooding will be a concern in this region for the next several days.
A few inches of snow are possible in western Texas and New Mexico, while 3 to 6 inches is possible across parts of the Gulf Coast through Friday night.
The worst ice should stay west of Fort Worth and Austin, but some slick roads are possible in parts of I-35 metro areas where temperatures dip down to freezing overnight.
As for snow, 3 to 6 inches are possible in parts of southern New Mexico to western Texas. It is unclear how much ice and snow will make its way into Oklahoma on Thursday. Accumulations of ice and snow in Oklahoma will ultimately depend on its ability to maintain colder temperatures as the storm tries to pull mild air northward.
Clipper heads toward Northeast
A quick-moving storm will slide down from Canada later Wednesday and quickly race across the Great Lakes and move into the Northeast by Wednesday evening.
This type of winter storm, called a clipper, generally brings a quick burst of light snow. Some light snow will move into parts of the Northeast by Wednesday evening and last into the early hours of Thursday.
A clipper system could deliver a few inches of snow to parts of the interior Northeast on Thursday.
This clipper narrowly misses an opportunity to combine with a developing disturbance in the Southeast and dump serious accumulation.
However, there could be 1 to 2 of snow in parts of the Northeast through Thursday morning, with all likely accumulations north and west of the i-95 corridor from New York to Boston.",The storm moving across the South will deliver a difficult commute.,2019-01-02T11:27:51Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Snow, ice and rain bring headaches across southern US",https://abcnews.go.com/US/snow-ice-rain-bring-headaches-southern-us/story?id=60114716,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/mendon-wind-ho-mo-20190101_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,ice storm,1
"feedback@businessinsider.com (Hilary Brueck), Hilary Brueck","Waves crash over houses on Turner Rd. as a large coastal storm affects the area on March 2, 2018 in Scituate, Massachusetts. Scott Eisen/Getty Images Snow is in the forecast for the Northeast this week. Areas from Pennsylvania to Boston could get hit with several inches of wet, heavy snow on Wednesday. In New York, forecasters are predicting as much as a foot of snow in some spots. Another big winter storm is coming to the Northeast, on the heels of last week's bomb cyclone. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service say snow is in the forecast along the East Coast from Philadelphia up to Boston. They predict it'll start falling in some spots as early as Tuesday night. Conditions are expected to get worse on Wednesday: that's when as much as 12 inches of powder could fall around New York City and Boston. The storm is set to hit eastern Pennsylvania and northern and central New Jersey with four to eight inches of snow, too. Those predicted snow totals could still change between now and Wednesday, but meteorologists are pretty confident that the region will get hit with some mix of snow and rain in the middle of this week. They're warning that the evening commute on Wednesday could be especially rough, with a mix of snow, sleet, and ice on the roads. Strong winds — with gusts of up to 40 miles per hour — are also in the forecast Wednesday night from Pennsylvania into New Jersey, as well as in Maryland and Delaware. Here's what the storm is set to look like on Wednesday at 6pm, according to Windy.com's projection: In Boston, the National Weather Service is predicting the snow will be slushy, heavy, and wet. That's unwelcome news after last week's bomb cyclone, which drenched the city in waves of water, drowned entire houses, and left millions of homes without power. Cars flooded as water rushed into the streets, and in hard-hit areas outside of Boston, some coastal towns saw waves 20 feet high with tides rising to near 15 feet. For now, it looks like areas south of Pennsylvania will be spared the wintry mix of snow and ice, but it could still be a drizzly few days, even in Washington DC. It's a chilly, damp reminder that winter is still here.","Scott Eisen/Getty Images Snow is in the forecast for the Northeast this week.

"Elizabeth LaFleur, Haley Walters","Snowfall forecast for winter storm headed to Upstate this weekend as of 4 p.m. Dec. 5. (Photo: Submitted photo/National Weather Service) A potentially historic winter storm is rolling into the Upstate this weekend, with forecasters now predicting as much as a foot of snow in northern Greenville County and parts of North Carolina. Greenville's weekend forecast depends on what a storm 3,000 miles away does over the next few days but it could mean freezing rain, sleet or even snow. On Wednesday evening, forecasts showed more snow and less ice than previously expected. Winter weather is expected to begin early Saturday evening and possibly linger into Monday. ""This storm could be historic for some areas, but we're not sure what areas yet. Any time you're talking about a portion of our area outside the mountains seeing a foot of snow, that's a once in a generation event,"" said Trisha Palmer, meterologist with the National Weather Service at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. She said precipitation totals and locations of snow will change as the low pressure system progresses. The National Weather Service issued a hazardous weather outlook for Upstate South Carolina, Western North Carolina, Northeast Georgia and Piedmont North Carolina. ""Confidence is high we'll see a significant storm with significant weather for the mountains and foothills of mainly N.C. and close to the border,"" said Robbie Munroe, meteorologist with the National Weather Service at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport earlier Wednesday. ""As you head down our direction, we're kind of on the borderline between snow and rain."" Related: Greenville County, Upstate may get snow, sleet, rain this weekend Forecasts for Greenville show a back and forth between rain and freezing rain or sleet throughout the weekend. As of Wednesday morning, the low pressure system was still out near California and changes in the strength or track of that system could make a big difference in how it affects Greenville, Munroe said. ""Since this will be a powerful coastal storm, one thing we are confident in is we'll likely see fairly significant precipitation across the region,"" Munroe said. Rain is expected most of the day Saturday and could turn to freezing rain and sleet overnight Saturday into Sunday. Rain or freezing rain is again expected Sunday with it turning to all rain by 2 p.m. before returning overnight Sunday, according to the current forecasts. Saturday: Rain likely after 4 p.m. 60 percent chance of precipitation. High near 40. Saturday night: Rain,likely before 8 p.m. then rain and sleet likely between 8 p.m. and midnight, then sleet after midnight. Low around 32. 80 percent chance of precipitation. Sunday: Rain and snow before noon, then rain or freezing rain between noon and 1 p.m, then rain after 1 p.m. High near 35. 90 percent chance of precipitation. Sunday night: Rain likely before midnight, then a chance of snow between midnight and 2 a.m, then a chance of rain after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 32. 60 percent chance of precipitation. Monday : 50 percent chance of rain. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 41.

The storm, which has dumped up to a foot of snow across parts of Illinois, is expected to ease off on Monday, with a winter storm warning in effect for Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Will, Kankakee, Livingston counties until 9 a.m. local time. But the Illinois Department of Transportation expects treacherous travel conditions to last throughout the morning, with many roads from the east and south into Chicago covered in ice or snow. IDOT is advising travelers to use extreme caution on the roads and allow extra time for getting to work. Those who can work remotely from home are advised to do so. The National Weather Service describes the snow as “very wet and heavy” and some residents have reported slush conditions.

"By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press","NEW YORK (AP) — About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place. Jaw-clenching temperatures to start the weekend throughout the Northeast hit Burlington, Vermont, at minus 1 and a wind chill of minus 30. Both Philadelphia and New York were shivering at 8 degrees. And in Hartford, Connecticut, a brutal cold of 10 degrees yielded a wind chill of minus 20. On Saturday, winds of more than 90 mph swirled Mount Washington, the Northeast's highest peak, at a temperature of minus 37 degrees and a wind chill of minus 93. It tied for second place with Armstrong, Ontario, as the coldest spot in the world. Boston, at a relatively balmy 11 degrees, was wrangling with a different kind of challenge: a shortage of plumbers as the weather wreaked havoc on pipes that froze and cracked, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh reported. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-10', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 10', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-15', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 15', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-20', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 20', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-25', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 25', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-30', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 30', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-35', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 35', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-40', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 40', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-45', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 45', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-50', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 50', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-55', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 55', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-60', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 60', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-64', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 64', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); George, who is homeless, pauses in a church alcove, on the streets of Boston as snow falls from a massive winter storm on January 4, 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Residents of Boston and its suburbs were cleaning up Saturday after the tide that came in Thursday, flooding streets and forcing some residents to be evacuate as the water started to freeze. In New Jersey, many people stayed home instead of dealing with single-digit temperatures. Others were cleaning up from the storm that dropped more than a foot of snow in some spots earlier in the week. ""My car felt like an icebox this morning, even though I had the heat on full blast,"" Julie Williams said as she sipped coffee inside a Jackson Township convenience store. She was headed to work at a local supermarket, and was expecting it to be packed. ""People think it's nuts before a storm happens, with everyone getting milk, bread, etc."" she said, adding with a laugh, ""but it's even worse in the days afterward, because they do the same thing but they're a little crazy from cabin fever."" The operators of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were struggling to recoup from Thursday's storm. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said it was working with airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to limit flights into Kennedy on Saturday ""until there are adequate gates available to handle the backlog of flights due to recovery of flight schedules in the wake of Thursday's storm."" In Rhode Island, hospitals were treating dozens of storm-related injuries as the region grits through a deep freeze that followed a powerful blizzard. In Providence and Newport, at least 40 people were treated for various weather-related conditions, from heart attacks, snowblower or shoveling injuries, frostbite and more, according to The Providence Journal. The storm dropped more than 14 inches of snow on Providence. Monday is expected to be the first day above freezing since last month. In New York City, temperatures should reach 40 degrees next week. Even more southern locations didn't escape the cold; the mercury dipped into the single digits in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., during the weekend, about 20 degrees below normal for this time of year. The high winds and frigid temperatures prompted several ski resorts to close some of their lifts. Bolton Valley in Vermont said there was a general ""lack of demand and enthusiasm from skiers and riders."" With a temperature of minus 14 at the summit and minus 11 at the base, the resort cancelled evening skiing due to a frostbite warning. In Vermont's capital city of Montpelier, with the temperature at minus 5 Saturday, business was slow at La Brioche Bakery but soups were a big seller, said bakery clerk Caroline Cunningham. ""Nobody wants to be outside,"" she said. The key strategy for most East Coast residents was to wear layered clothing. Brooklyn resident Zelani Miah, who was walking home from running errands Saturday morning, said he wore lots of them. ""Right now, the only thing I put on was just some gloves, a couple sweaters of course, like five or six of them, and two pants basically and boots,"" Miah said. ""Keep warm, make sure you wear hats.""","NEW YORK (AP) - About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place.

https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1526386,"Two days after temperatures leaped into the 70s, they will crash into the 30s on Saturday, setting the stage for a wintry mess of precipitation. Snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain are likely in the region Saturday afternoon and night. Snow accumulation is possible, especially north and northwest of downtown Washington. From downtown and to the south and east, a little snow and sleet are possible, mainly on grassy areas, before precipitation probably changes to rain. The heaviest snow totals are likely to occur in northern Maryland, where two to four inches are possible, with locally higher amounts not out of the question. In Washington’s more immediate northern and western suburbs, one to three inches of snow and sleet are most likely, before precipitation changes to freezing rain or rain, and concludes. This event will come through quickly, with precipitation lasting six hours or so in most locations. The heaviest precipitation is expected between about 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Saturday, so keep that in mind for any evening plans. Even though the ground will be warm ahead of the storm, snow and sleet may fall heavily enough to create slushy and slick roads, especially in our colder areas. The snow accumulation forecast is uncertain and subject to error, because the rain-snow line will be meandering close to the District during the height of the event. It’s also very hard to project what areas will have what type(s) of precipitation at any particular moment. Within a one-county radius of the District, it’s likely you’ll see a mix. Monitor your conditions and, if temperatures are near freezing and frozen precipitation is coming down hard, play it safe and stay in. The impact of the event will be limited because it is occurring during a relatively light travel time on a holiday weekend. Also, while slick areas on untreated roads and sidewalks are possible into Sunday morning, temperatures will rise above freezing during the day, allowing for a quick recovery. Storm timeline 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday: Snow and sleet, or rain and sleet (especially south and southeast), move in from southwest to northeast. Temperatures: 34-39, coldest northwest. 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday: Snow and sleet, mixing with and changing to sleet, freezing rain and rain at times inside the Beltway and south and east. Precipitation may be heavy at times. Temperatures: 30-35, coldest northwest. 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday: Precipitation tapers off to drizzle (south and east) and freezing drizzle (north and west), and ends. Temperatures: 31-35, coldest northwest. 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday: Drying out. Low temperatures: 29-34, coldest northwest. Impacts In the areas where we expect an inch or less — from downtown Washington and to the south and east, this event does not rank on our winter storm impact scale. Snow and sleet should mostly be conversational, with limited if any impact on travel. There is, however, an outside chance of some slick areas if snow comes down heavily in a boom scenario. To the north, where one to four inches of snow are possible, this ranks as a level-one “nuisance event,” signifying slick travel is possible — especially when precipitation falls heavily Saturday evening. It does not rank higher, because it is occurring during a light travel period on a holiday weekend when schools are mostly out of session. Furthermore, during the day Sunday, conditions should improve across the area, so the duration of any disruption will be limited. Forecast discussion This forecast, especially snow amounts and the timing of transitions between precipitation types, is extremely difficult because the rain-snow line will fall right over the region and change during the event. “How much snow we get will depend on whether the storm produces a thump of heavy snow before the atmosphere warms up enough for the precipitation to change over to sleet or rain,” said Wes Junker, Capital Weather Gang’s winter weather expert. “A burst of snow with temperatures near freezing could produce an inch or so on grassy surfaces in and around the city and 1 to 3 over our northern and western suburbs, and 2 to 4 up toward the Mason-Dixon Line.” The snow amount forecast is highly dependent on the heavy precipitation actually materializing. “If no period of heavy precipitation develops, the city is unlikely to see any snow accumulation,” Junker said. “Even in our colder areas, amounts will depend on whether and where the heavier band of precipitation sets up.” If and where the heavy precipitation fails to show up, the snowfall potential will drop considerably. “This has always been a pattern requiring a perfect storm evolution and track to produce meaningful snow,” Junker said. “The models still disagree on how the storm is likely to play out, and this is one of those storms where the details about the storm track and evolution will play a critical role in determining the precipitation intensity and exact temperatures. Being near the freezing line at the surface and rain-snow line aloft, in particular, complicates the forecast. Unfortunately, the models continue to conflict on the all-important details making this forecast a bust waiting to happen.”","Washington Post Snow, ice and rain likely Saturday afternoon and night, with some accumulation possible Washington Post Two days after temperatures leaped into the 70s, they will crash into the 30s on Saturday, setting the stage for a wintry mess of precipita…",2018-02-16T17:34:45Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}","Snow, ice and rain likely Saturday afternoon and night, with some accumulation possible - Washington Post",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/02/16/snow-ice-and-rain-likely-saturday-afternoon-and-night-with-some-accumulation-possible/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/files/2018/02/snow-forecast-map-feb17-v1.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,ice storm,1
Adam Rosenberg,"No one boarding the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship in New York on Dec. 29, 2017 expected to start the new year coping with seasickness and mortal terror. But in the end, that's what happened. It's not clear what led Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) to stick to the ship's planned itinerary as forecasts made as early as Dec. 31 pointed to a winter storm of historic proportions forming along the East Coast. But the decision left Ellen Leffak, her family, and many of the fellow passengers they commiserated with sick from the rough voyage and furious at what they see as negligence on the part of NCL's decision-makers. The passengers aboard the ship endured a horrific journey home despite the fact that the storm was accurately forecast days in advance by the U.S. government and private sector meteorologists. ""I know that sometimes we are just subject to forces of nature that we can't help,"" Leffak said during a post-cruise phone interview. ""But I think what went bad here was that the ship's decisions and responses to those forces of nature were totally inappropriate.""

The cruise line owns this private island and uses it as a sort of rest and play stop during the long journey up and down the East Coast to Key West, Florida, a place where passengers can disembark for beachside fun. By Jan. 2, weather forecasters from the U.S. government and private sector were unanimous in predicting that a storm of potentially historic proportions would form off the Southeast coast, near Florida, and spin up the East Coast toward Nova Scotia by Jan. 5. Computer models differed slightly in the storm track forecast, particularly on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, but they all agreed that the system would be incredibly intense — possibly breaking a record for the rate of intensification in such a short period of time. This aspect of the storm is crucial, because such a rapid pressure drop would lead to hurricane force winds of 75 miles per hour or greater as well as building seas. ""It was horrible to watch."" The waters off the coast of Great Stirrup Cay are shallow, which meant the Breakaway had to drop anchor in deeper waters and ferry passengers aboard smaller tender boats. Leffak and her husband opted to stay aboard the big boat that morning for breakfast before heading out on a later tender. Unfortunately, high winds and waves caused the crew to quickly recall all the tenders and set sail for New York instead. ""They were starting to bring people back to the ship because of the forecast of high winds up to 60 miles an hour and the water swells of 15 feet,"" Leffak said. No one mentioned anything about a storm, let alone a historic storm that would affect every coastal state from Florida to Maine. Never again on the #NorwegianBreakaway. That was the scariest cruise ever. All we knew was tenders couldn't make it to NCL private island. Then we just left, no information, no updates, 3+ days of rough waves, and entire family sick, locked inside a tilted ship. Disgraceful..... pic.twitter.com/5ecdPtTrlc — Los_Angeles (@LA4Life32) January 6, 2018 ""They were bouncing and bouncing,"" Leffak said of the small shuttle boats. ""If I was on one of those things I would have been as sick as a dog. It was horrible to watch."" After that, the long, tumultuous journey back to New York began, spanning the days between Jan. 2 and Jan. 5. The worst moments of 2018's historic winter storm hammered the East Coast on Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, which is when conditions aboard the ship deteriorated dramatically. As waves rocked the cruise ship and guests and staff became seasick, the ship's captain repeated the same message: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are in rough seas and we are optimizing our speed and course to minimize the movement of the ship."" He would then hand the mic over to the cruise director, who ran through ongoing activities and events aboard the ship. Leffak recited that message from memory with the cadence of someone who heard it too many times. ""The announcements were totally canned, totally repetitive,"" she said. ""The same words over and over and over and over again."" Leffak and her fellow passengers were unsettled by a lack of communication from the bridge — roughly a full day went by between Tuesday and Wednesday night without any updates — and the storm was in full swing, with the ship swaying in high winds and waves. ""[Wednesday] was the night that people were actually being thrown out of their beds,"" Leffak said. ""This ship was moving so much people were actually rolling out of their beds."" Image: ellen leffak The cabin experience got to be so uncomfortable that many guests sought rest in the ship's public spaces. Or they just gave up on sleep all together. On top of all that, the cruise's concierge service had no answers; ""We just take our orders from the bridge,"" Leffak recalls being told. They dispensed dramamine to sick passengers, but getting just a single dose came with a 20-minute wait. There's a big problem here that isn't evident in Leffak's telling of events: This storm and its intensity should not have been a surprise to the ship’s captain or crew. In fact, it's clear that the cruise line made a decision to proceed despite the storm, rather than being surprised by it. In an email from National Weather Service spokeswoman Lauren Gaches, the organization’s Ocean Prediction Center, which forecasts maritime conditions, ""... Was forecasting the potential for hurricane force winds associated with the storm as early as Sunday, December 31."" The storm was predicted to peak on Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 3 and 4. ""Warnings for storm and hurricane force winds were gradually expanded, and by Tuesday, January 2, storm and hurricane-force wind warnings were in effect. On Tuesday, in OPC forecast discussions, forecasters stated that ""marine interests should be rushing any avoidance plans to completion.""” This means that by the time the Norwegian Breakaway's crew decided to head through the storm and on to New York, the forecast was clearly calling for a dangerous event with high winds, building waves, and other hazards. They may have thought that cruising along the western side of the storm would minimize the waves, since the highest waves built ahead of the low pressure area, but computer models were consistent in showing an area of hurricane force winds on the backside of the storm as well. In a statement defending its crew’s actions, Norwegian Cruise Lines has said the ship encountered worse conditions than anticipated. But the Weather Service's Gaches said forecasts were progressively more certain starting on Sunday the 31st. ""Confidence was high on Sunday and only grew through Wednesday. Ocean Prediction Center forecast discussions indicated that confidence was high and growing,"" she said. Presumably that information was available to the ship’s crew, since it was available to the public on OPC’s website. The 12Z OPC surface analysis indicates that low pressure currently near Miami will rapidly intensify while moving NE in the W Atlantic over the next 24 hours. OPC's gridded forecast indicates 80 kt winds will develop by 1200 UTC (8 AM EST) 01/04/18. pic.twitter.com/AMqrBxCXgF — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 3, 2018 In the end, the storm’s minimum central pressure plunged by a whopping 59 millibars in 24 hours, making it one of the fastest-intensifying storms ever observed off the East Coast. Such a rapid drop in pressure caused air to rush inward toward the center, as if filling a growing void in the atmosphere. This resulted in powerful winds measured at 80 miles per hour over land. Waves as high as 51 feet were observed in Nova Scotia, though the waves that affected the Norwegian Breakaway were likely far lower in height, closer to 15 to 30 feet. The Norwegian Breakaway is just the latest cruise ship to wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. 24-hour OPC surface &amp; wind/wave forecasts from today indicate intense low pressure to develop in the W Atlantic by 1200 UTC (7AM EST) 01/04/18 with winds up to 80 kt and seas to 33 ft. pic.twitter.com/P4aGol8tbN — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 3, 2018 Royal Caribbean’s “Anthem of the Seas” ran straight into post-tropical storm Hermine in 2016, just one year after suffering damage when it encountered a storm off the coast of North Carolina. In response, the cruise line hired a meteorologist to advise on its ships' routing decisions. Ryan Maue, the chief operating officer of weather company weather.us, urged caution before judging the crew of the NCL Breakaway as reckless in the face of the storm. ""I think we should all be careful expressing an expert 'forensic meteorology' opinion on the decision-making in this specific case since we do not have the inside knowledge about the weather forecasts provided to the Captain, routes or how the company determines what is tolerable ocean-going risk,"" he said in an email. ""All that being said, once the ship's Captain decides YES we are going to go through the storm, then the task at hand is to find the safest and most efficient route — probably balancing those two factors,” he said. ""It's likely that the course chosen by NCL was indeed suboptimal."" Maue said the storm developed quickly and had an unusually large wind field for a weather system of its type. He said from a passenger perspective, it's clear that the route chosen was not one that maximized their comfort. ""... Even with our best global models and coupled-ocean wave tools, it's likely that the course chosen by NCL was indeed suboptimal in terms of waves, wind and the passengers comfort because the ship is moving too slowly to adapt or course change. It's like a bobbing cork in a very angry stream."" Maue did, however, criticize Norwegian’s statements for calling weather forecasts into question. ""Blaming the weather forecasts for 'more dangerous' sailing conditions than expected is disingenuous since you have already decided on purpose to sail into the storm, not avoid it,"" he said. The full text of the statement received from NCL's spokesperson reads as follows: During the early morning hours of January 4, Norwegian Breakaway encountered stronger than forecasted weather conditions due to winter storm Grayson. The safety of our guest and crew is always our top priority and the ship's Captain adjusted the ship's speed and itinerary accordingly to maintain the safest possible route, delaying the ship's arrival. ‎Norwegian Breakaway returned safely to port approximately eight hours later than scheduled. Due to the late hour and the weather conditions, the ship remained alongside overnight, departing one day late for the next scheduled cruise. We sincerely apologize to our guests for the stronger than expected weather conditions and any resulting discomfort or inconvenience they may have experienced. The spokesperson added that when inclement weather strikes, the company, as a rule, charts ""a route that has the least impact to our guests and crew."" The ship finally came into port in New York on the afternoon of Jan. 5, hours after it was supposed to have arrived. Ice build-up on the walkways slowed the disembarkation process, leaving Leffak and her family waiting with everyone else in a long line. It's here that the cruise staff's priorities became clear. Leffak suspects the decision to make the hellish trip through the storm was made in order to get the ship ready for the next trip. ""I went over to this bar and I asked the woman [if I could have] some glasses of water,"" Leffak said. ""I don't have any glasses,"" the woman replied. Leffak didn't understand. ""You have a whole bar here,"" she said. ""How could you not have any glasses?"" The bartender replied: ""I'm getting ready for the next group of people coming on, I don't have glasses."" Image: Mark Lennihan/AP/REX/Shutterstock The Breakaway was set to leave on a 14-day journey the next day, Jan. 6. It was originally supposed to leave on Jan. 5, but the ship's late arrival in New York prompted a delay for the next trip. It's unclear if the ship rushed back to New York — perhaps along a needlessly risky or uncomfortable course — with the next trip in mind, but even after the brutal journey, the crew's minds were on the next trip before departing passengers had fully disembarked. When Leffak's line finally did start to move, she remembers an anxious crewmember shouting ""C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!"" (She turned toward the woman doing the shouting and told her to ""shut the fuck up."") Now that the journey is over, Leffak is busy thinking about next steps. Days later, she said, she's still suffering from vertigo that her doctor recommended waiting out with continued sedation. But she's angry about what she and her family went through aboard the Breakaway, and she's in the process of bringing a class action lawsuit to bear against NCL. ""I am a lawyer. I don't know about this kind of law, but I know that there are people who do,"" Leffak said. ""My philosophy was always advising my clients, always, that if you screwed up, the best thing you can do is say, 'We screwed up. We know it's going to cost us some money, but we also know it's worth some good will and we know it will protect us better in the future.'"" ""You say, 'I screwed up. I have to make this right.'""","No one boarding the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship in New York on Dec. 29, 2017 expected to start the new year coping with seasickness and mortal terror.

"By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press","NEW YORK (AP) — About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place. Jaw-clenching temperatures to start the weekend throughout the Northeast hit Burlington, Vermont, at minus 1 and a wind chill of minus 30. Both Philadelphia and New York were shivering at 8 degrees. And in Hartford, Connecticut, a brutal cold of 10 degrees yielded a wind chill of minus 20. On Saturday, winds of more than 90 mph swirled Mount Washington, the Northeast's highest peak, at a temperature of minus 37 degrees and a wind chill of minus 93. It tied for second place with Armstrong, Ontario, as the coldest spot in the world. Boston, at a relatively balmy 11 degrees, was wrangling with a different kind of challenge: a shortage of plumbers as the weather wreaked havoc on pipes that froze and cracked, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh reported. A 3-foot tidal surge brought on by the nor'easter along the Massachusetts coast was the highest recorded in nearly a century. Residents of Boston and its suburbs were cleaning up Saturday after the tide that came in Thursday, flooding streets and forcing some residents to be evacuate as the water started to freeze. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-10', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 10', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-15', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 15', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-20', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 20', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-25', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 25', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-30', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 30', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-35', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 35', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-40', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 40', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-45', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 45', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-50', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 50', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-55', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 55', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-60', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 60', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-64', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 64', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); George, who is homeless, pauses in a church alcove, on the streets of Boston as snow falls from a massive winter storm on January 4, 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Others were cleaning up from the storm that dropped more than a foot of snow in some spots earlier in the week. ""My car felt like an icebox this morning, even though I had the heat on full blast,"" Julie Williams said as she sipped coffee inside a Jackson Township convenience store. She was headed to work at a local supermarket, and was expecting it to be packed. ""People think it's nuts before a storm happens, with everyone getting milk, bread, etc."" she said, adding with a laugh, ""but it's even worse in the days afterward, because they do the same thing but they're a little crazy from cabin fever."" The operators of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were struggling to recoup from Thursday's storm. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said it was working with airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to limit flights into Kennedy on Saturday ""until there are adequate gates available to handle the backlog of flights due to recovery of flight schedules in the wake of Thursday's storm."" In Rhode Island, hospitals were treating dozens of storm-related injuries as the region grits through a deep freeze that followed a powerful blizzard. In Providence and Newport, at least 40 people were treated for various weather-related conditions, from heart attacks, snowblower or shoveling injuries, frostbite and more, according to The Providence Journal. The storm dropped more than 14 inches of snow on Providence. Monday is expected to be the first day above freezing since last month. In New York City, temperatures should reach 40 degrees next week. Even more southern locations didn't escape the cold; the mercury dipped into the single digits in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., during the weekend, about 20 degrees below normal for this time of year. The high winds and frigid temperatures prompted several ski resorts to close some of their lifts. Bolton Valley in Vermont said there was a general ""lack of demand and enthusiasm from skiers and riders."" With a temperature of minus 14 at the summit and minus 11 at the base, the resort cancelled evening skiing due to a frostbite warning. In Vermont's capital city of Montpelier, with the temperature at minus 5 Saturday, business was slow at La Brioche Bakery but soups were a big seller, said bakery clerk Caroline Cunningham. ""Nobody wants to be outside,"" she said. The key strategy for most East Coast residents was to wear layered clothing. Brooklyn resident Zelani Miah, who was walking home from running errands Saturday morning, said he wore lots of them. ""Right now, the only thing I put on was just some gloves, a couple sweaters of course, like five or six of them, and two pants basically and boots,"" Miah said. ""Keep warm, make sure you wear hats.""","NEW YORK (AP) - About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place.

Len Melisurgo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com,"Shafer said the amount of moisture associated with the coastal storm is not expected to change, but now more of the precipitation will likely end up as snow and sleet and less will end up as rain. As a result, the weather service has upgraded its winter weather advisories to a winter storm warning in Bergen, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and parts of Essex, Union and Warren counties. The warning will remain in effect through late Thursday night in some locations and early Friday morning in others. ""A winter storm warning means significant amounts of snow, sleet and ice will make travel very hazardous or impossible,"" the weather service said in its warning. In some parts of northern New Jersey, including most of Sussex and Bergen counties, forecasters are now calling for as much as 5 to 7 inches of snow accumulations, along with up to one tenth of an inch of ice. Even some coastal areas of the state, where all rain was originally anticipated from this storm, a light coating of snow could make some roads slick, forecasters said.","NJ.com NJ weather update: Forecast worsens, up to 8 inches of snow now possible NJ.com Snowfall totals in many parts of New Jersey are now expected to be a bit higher than expected.

JULIA SCOTT,"One of my best teenage memories starts with a natural disaster. In January 1998, my parents and I returned to our home in Montreal to find that a giant tree limb had ruptured our living room. What would soon be known as the Great Quebec Ice Storm had struck. It was the most catastrophic in modern Canadian history. Accumulations of freezing rain had cracked our maple tree nearly in half. It shattered our front window, glass fringing the tree limb like a body outline in a murder scene. Outside, downed power lines sparked like electric snakes. More than a million Quebecers were left without power. Cars were crushed and impaled by fallen limbs. Because the ice could inflict violence at any moment, everyone retreated indoors, making for an oddly quiet state of emergency. Except for the distant beeps of electrical-crew trucks, all you could hear was the crack of trees buckling under the weight of the ice, day and night. Long after the sidewalks were cleared, we tiptoed past the eaves of tall buildings and kept our voices low, steering clear of icicles thick as baseball bats and sharp as spikes, primed to fall at any moment. For seven days and seven nights, until the power returned, we lived by candlelight. We learned to be mindful of candles: how to stand them up, walk with them, nurture their light. At first it was maddening to cook dinner — to carefully carry a plate of candles to the cupboard, poke around for ingredients, then go off again in search of a knife, taking care not to drip wax into the cutlery drawer. I learned how to brush my teeth and bathe by candlelight; the light bounced off the mirrors, making the bathroom for once the brightest room in the house. In our bedrooms, we piled under blankets and read ourselves to sleep by the flickering flames. Outside, our neighborhood descended into darkness at twilight, but if I stared hard enough at windows blurred with ice, I could just make out little dancing lights. Decades later, no one in my family remembers what we talked about, or ate, or how we spent our afternoons that week. But we all remember the candles. I’ve since settled in California, and last January events in the world left me with a hunger for silence. I adopted a strict information diet: no television news or social media. One evening, I didn’t even bother to flick on the lights in my apartment. I walked quietly to the window and watched the last of the day, the darkness swallowing the trees along my street. Instinctively, I went looking for a book of matches in the back of the kitchen junk drawer. Opening a closet, I felt around until I discovered the remnant of a housewarming gift: a milk-white candle. I struck a match and lit the dusty wick. I commandeered a plate from the cupboard and set it on my coffee table. I nestled in a blanket, listening to the wind in the courtyard. Eventually, for the first time in too many days, I found myself surrendering to sleep. That was the start of a practice I’ve taken to calling Candle Hour. An hour before I go to bed, I turn off all my devices for the night. I hit the lights. I light a candle or two or three — enough to read a book by, or to just sit and stare at the flame, which, by drawing oxygen, reminds me I need to breathe, too. I surround myself with scents and objects I like — some fresh rosemary plucked from a neighbor’s bush, a jar of redwood seed pods. I have a journal ready, but I don’t pressure myself to write in it. Candle Hour doesn’t even need to last a full hour, though; sometimes it lasts far longer. I sit until I feel an uncoupling from the chaos, or until the candle burns all the way down, or sometimes both.

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
Salt Lake City and Denver got hit hard Wednesday with this storm -- roads were a mess with lots of spin out and accidents. Denver area got 3 to 6 inches of snow, while Salt Lake City saw 5 to 10 inches of snow.
Ahead of the same storm, warm air turned snow into freezing rain from Kansas City to Wisconsin, making roads treacherous. Farther south, water rescues were necessary as up to 4 inches of rain fell in Nashville, marking a daily record.
There are alerts in place across much of the U.S. on Thursday for snow, ice or rain.
There are 32 states from the Rockies to the Northeast under, snow, ice and flood alerts on Thursday, including a blizzard warning and ice storm warning for the Plains.
The storm is now in the Mid-Mississippi Valley and producing severe storms with damaging wind and hail.
The storm will move into the Ohio Valley and stretch south through Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi on Thursday night.
As the storm moves east later on Thursday morning and into the afternoon, heavy snow will break out in the western Great Lakes with freezing rain to the south.
Severe storms are expected Thursday for the Ohio Valley with damaging winds, a few tornadoes and some hail and flash flooding also possible.
There will be rain and some ice in New England on Friday morning.
The storm system will move into Canada, but the trailing cold front will move into the Northeast with some heavy rain at times. Some icy weather is possible in northern New England.
In the next 12 to 24 hours, Wisconsin and Michigan could see up to a foot of snow, while the Ohio Valley and parts of the Midwest could see an additional 3 inches of rain.
There could be four-tenths of an inch of ice in Kansas and Missouri.
Rainfall totals will be highest in the Midwest with some snow in northern Wisconsin.","There will be rain, snow and ice moving into the eastern U.S. on Thursday.",2019-02-07T12:22:14Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Icy storm moves east, bringing threat for dangerous road conditions",https://abcnews.go.com/US/icy-storm-moves-east-bringing-threat-dangerous-road/story?id=60906017,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/scraping-ice-ap-mo-20190207_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,ice storm,1

You also can search for more than one per match, so as long as you stop into named locations on the way to the final storm circles in each game, it shouldn't take you too many games to knock this challenge out.
How to search Chilly Gnomes
It appears some of our little gnome friends have been frozen in blocks of ice throughout the snowy part of the map and your job is to find seven of them. You could scour the map to find the chilly gnomes yourself, or you can save a bunch of time by using this map:
There's even one on the tiny island south of the main island if you're looking for a little adventure.

How to eliminate opponents in Lucky Landings or Tilted Towers
You Tilted Towers lovers will have no trouble with this challenge at all and will probably complete it without even thinking about it. For the rest of us it might be a bigger challenge. It's really up to you which location to choose, but if it's Lucky Landings, you'll want to go earlier in the week to make sure plenty of people are there for the challenge.

This staged challenge has three stages, starting with Polar Peak and Tilted Towers. Stage 2 has you visiting Lucky Landings and Retail Row in a single match, which is a greater distance, and stage 3 sends you to Lazy Links and Shifty Shafts for the longest distance. You're going to have to hope the battle bus path works in your favor or try a large group match to get the later stages, but here's a map to make them easier to spot:

How to slide an ice puck over 150m in a single throw
This challenge requires that you've already unlocked the Ice Puck at tier 28 of your Battle Pass. If you haven't unlocked it yet, don't worry, because you have until the end of season 7 to complete this challenge. If you have it unlocked, you only need to go to the snowy area of the map, choose the puck from your emote wheels, then slide it down any of the bigger hills. The game will notify you in the upper left part of the screen if you've gotten the required 150 meters. Just keep trying until you get it.
How to do stage 1: Deal damage with SMGs to opponents
For this challenge note that it doesn't say eliminations, so you only need to get a few shots off to get credit. It might take a couple of matches, but it shouldn't be too hard if you focus on using SMGs. Stage 2 has you using assault rifles, which shouldn't be too bad, but stage 3 requires you to use grenades, clingers or stink bombs. For this final stage, I would suggest doing one of the large group matches and then start hurling grenades at groups of enemies once the storm closes on the final circles.
How to deal damage with different weapons in a single match 
This challenge is listed as hard and I think it will be. As the title says, you have to deal damage with five different weapons in a single match. That means you'll really have to focus on switching weapons and hope you live through firefights to keep going. It may take several tries, but if you stick with it, you'll get it before long.","If you're hoping to get that tier-100 Ice King, you'll have to keep plugging away at these challenges.

Jen Karner,"Winter is here, bring nasty storms to just about everybody. When a nasty storm hits during the summer it can be miserable, but when a winter storm descends onto your house you may have to deal with being stuck indoors behind a wall of ice and snow. Whether this is your first Nor'easter, or you've been making snow angels since you were a kid, we've got some tips for getting through a blizzard using the tech you have (or should have) on-hand. Track the storm Weathering out a storm during the winter has its own set of challenges that can start well before the storm even fully reaches you. From icy rain to road closures to knowing how much snow to expect — and for how long — there are many different factors to consider. Your best bet is to keep an eye on the local weather. While you may get automated alerts if a winter storm or blizzard warning is sent out by the state, but having a dedicated app can give you a much better idea of what to expect. While there are plenty of different apps that can help you out, Weather Underground is one of the best for monitoring precipitation (that's rain, snow and anything else you could expect) in real-time. More: Best Weather apps for Android Keep charged Winter storms can easily knock out your power, and if the roads are iced over you may not get it back for hours — or days — at a time. If you know that there is a storm rolling in, you're going to want to make sure that all of your devices have the best charge possible. Since many people live on their phones now, chances are you no longer pay for a landline. This means that if something goes wrong, it's absolutely imperative that you have a phone so that you can contact friends or emergency personnel. This also means that if possible, you're going to want to lay off of playing around on Facebook if you're suspicious that the power is going to cut out. This goes for your portable battery packs, too. It's no good having a spare battery if you forget to charge it up. So make sure that everything is charged up, and things will be easier to deal with. Stock up While there is always a run on milk and toilet paper when a blizzard threatens, you may not be considering the tech accessories that can make it easier to weather out a storm. Your battery is what powers all of your devices, and they are going to be the only thing working if you lose power. With that in mind picking up a portable charger, and taking a few precautions can make it much, much easier to ride out the storm with ease. If you're hoping to download Netflix programs for offline viewing, or watching movies from your tablet, then you'll need as much power as you can get. What we suggest is this 20,000mAh battery pack from Anker with both USB-C and USB-A ports it can easily power all of your devices so you aren't stuck in the dark. Of course, if you live in an area that is notorious for losing power every winter, then you may just want to pony up for something a bit bigger. This Anker Powerhouse generator has a 120,000mAh capacity which will easily keep you running for a few days while you wait for the plows to rescue you through mountains of snow. If you plan on using a larger portable battery to allow you to watch your digital movies or shows while you're snowed in then we have another precaution for you. In the case that you get hit with a record-breaking storm — aka Snowpocalypse — then it's very possible that your data may be affected. To avoid that, and stick to your data limit, try to use programs such as Netflix, Spotify, and even Google Maps, that support offline storage, so you don't need a data connection to access critical information and content. Non-tech necessities While having the right tech accessories handy can help you get through the storm, there are some regular items that can help you get through things unscathed. Depending on where you live a winter storm preparedness kit is going to look different, but a few stock items are pretty clear across the board. Extra blankets, flashlights, batteries, and candles are all solid go-tos. You'll also want a portable camping stove to cook some hot meals using just a few replaceable gas canisters. You'll probably need an AM/FM radio, too, just in case. Are you prepared? Winter storms and blizzards have already coated the Continental U.S. sending massive amounts of snow dropping from Florida all the way up to Maine. These weather conditions are normal for everyone, so having an easy checklist to make sure you're prepped and ready is a good call. Is there a tip or trick that you think ought to have made our list? Let us know about it in the comments below!","Winter is here, bring nasty storms to just about everybody.

In Florida, authorities on Wednesday shut down a stretch of Interstate 10 east of Tallahassee because of icy conditions. In Savannah, Mayor Eddie DeLoach urged residents to keep off the roads. City officials, bracing for a rare bout of ice and up to three inches of snow, filled dump trucks with sand to spread on major streets. Icicles form on the tritons in the Forsyth Park Fountain, Jan. 2, 2018, in Savannah, Ga. (Photo: Steve Bisson, AP) “The streets will be slick,” DeLoach said as the storm closed in. “We could have some serious issues for folks who aren’t used to driving in this kind of weather.” Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency through Friday for 28 counties because of the frigid weather. In northern Florida, at least five districts canceled school. In Tallahassee, students were supposed to return from winter break, but got another day thanks to the weather. In central Florida, the state’s largest theme parks announced that water attractions such as Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon, Universal Orlando’s Volcano Bay and SeaWorld’s Aquatica were closed Wednesday because of the cold snap. The North Carolina Zoo offered half-priced admission, giving visitors a rare chance to see polar bears frolic in their kind of weather. The brutal weather, fed by the punishing cold air sweeping in from Canada, put much of the country in a deep freeze, across the northern tier and into the Deep South. Wind chill advisories and freeze warnings were in effect from South Texas to Canada and from Montana through New England. Indianapolis on Tuesday tied a record low of -12 degrees for Jan. 2 set in 1887, leading Indianapolis Public Schools to cancel classes. A commuter makes her way to work in sub-zero temperatures on Jan. 2, 2018 in Chicago. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images) In the Chicago-area, wind chills were expected between -35 and -20 degrees, as forecasters warned of frostbite and hypothermia risks and urged residents to take precautions. Along the East Coast, the ""bomb cyclone,"" known as ""bombogenesis,"" was expected to form off New England Thursday, and could generate blizzards from Connecticut to Maine, and winds on Cape Code from 50 to 60 mph or more. Accuweather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski notes that as the pressure inside the storm system plunges rapidly, forming the ""bombogenesis,"" the surrounding air rushes in at high speed, and can bring property damage, falling trees and power outages. ""Storms that undergo bombogenesis are among the most violent weather systems that affect a broad area,"" Sosnowski says. Aside from bone-chilling temperatures, the system was expected to leave major cities largely unscathed, with little or no snow expected in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and less than four inches in New York City.

RICK ROJAS,"“The minute we got into the law school, we knew there was a very minimal amount of jobs we could acquire as lawyers working in a firm there already,” said Lourdes Carreras-Ortiz, a University of Puerto Rico law student. But before the storm, Ms. Alers-Ortiz said, many Puerto Ricans were able to maintain at least the facade of a middle-class life: They had cellphones, went to the movies, shopped for clothes at Plaza Las Américas, a sprawling mall in San Juan. The storm washed that away. “Our first-world mask has been ripped off,” she said. “Now, we’re third world.” “The feeling is life stopped,” she added. Members of the diaspora, even recent arrivals, argue that they can contribute to Puerto Rico’s recovery from afar. They point to a surge of money and supplies, and they said they can push elected officials to direct more aid to the island. A report published by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College projected that upward of 200,000 people could leave the island in the year after the hurricane, and that by 2019, that figure could approach a half-million people, or about 14 percent of the island’s population. Researchers anticipate the demographic shifts created by migration will spread beyond Florida and the New York metropolitan area, places that already have longstanding ties to the island, to communities across the country. Aja Nelson had been displaced twice: She fled St. Thomas, one of the United States Virgin Islands, for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, only to be pushed out again by Maria. Now, Ms. Nelson is staying with relatives in Atlanta. “I am just shell shocked,” she said. Jose Manuel Ureña, 24, had been a cook for the last two years at a restaurant in Condado, an upscale area of San Juan that had been popular with tourists, and also helped his brother take care of their mother. He said he had lost his job and a friend promised to help him find work in a kitchen in Newark, where he was heading. “My plan is to get to New Jersey and work until I can’t anymore,” he said. “I can’t wait to have a home again.” Many who left Puerto Rico described an existence that had been stripped down to its basics, their days spent collecting food, water and fuel. When Mr. Franceschini arrived in New York, he began to notice the trivial things he had once taken for granted, like when he had a cool drink. “You’re really excited over ice,” he said. Touro Law Center is one of many schools across the country that have welcomed displaced students. A small group had come just for the semester and expected to return to their school next year, but now they realize their time away is likely not enough to restore living conditions to what they were before the storm. “The Puerto Rican way of life is gone as we know it,” Mr. Camacho-Vazquez said. “This is a fact.” The grim situation on the island has forced the students, who are mostly in their third year of law school, to reassess their plans after they graduate and whatever obligation they have to Puerto Rico. “I don’t owe the government anything, but I do owe my island something,” Ms. Carreras-Ortiz said as she sat with her classmates on campus one recent afternoon. “I lived there. I grew up there. The place — not only physically the island but the people, the life there — it gave me so much, and I’m the person I am because I lived on the island.” “I do want to go back for Puerto Rico,” she added. “If everybody who can do something just leaves, the island is gone. There’s no progress.” “That’s the thing,” another student, Cesar Rivera, interjected. “That is very admirable, but those who leave, I cannot blame.” Sandra E. Garcia contributed reporting from New York.

Camila Domonoske,"Notes An NOAA GOES satellite image shows the massive winter storm currently affecting New England. Credit: NOAA A massive winter storm continues to travel up the East Coast, with heavy snow falling from New Jersey to Maine as road crews in Georgia are stilling cleaning up patches of ice. The ""bomb cyclone"" that's bludgeoning New England is a powerful storm, bringing bitter cold and the chance of heavy snow. The National Weather Service warns of possible blizzard conditions, with the risk of damaging, hurricane-force winds. The rate at which the storm has intensified is unusual — the Capital Weather Gang at the Washington Post called it ""astonishing."" A storm can be classified as a ""bomb cyclone,"" or a particularly fast-forming storm, if the pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm has more than doubled that pace. ""This storm's pressure tanked 53 millibars in 21 hours (and 59 millibars in 24 hours ), which puts it into the upper echelon of the most explosive East Coast storms ever observed — and perhaps even at the top,"" the Post writes. The winter storm off the East coast has deepened ~24 millibars in a mere 7 hours. It is very rare for a storm to intensify so fast (usually 24 millibars in 24 hours is the standard for a rapidly intensifying storm). For all our friends out east...stay safe! pic.twitter.com/hgT7jmcA20 — NWS Marquette (@NWSMarquette) January 4, 2018 The NWS in Boston calls this storm ""impressive, explosive"" and ""high-impact."" Thousands of flights have been canceled. Across the Northeast, schools are shuttered, salt has been spread, and local officials are pleading with residents to stay off the streets if they can. There is near-zero visibility in some of the snow bands passing over the states from New Jersey to Maine, the weather service says. As NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports, it's not just the ice and cold that authorities are worried about: ""Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy says drivers should be prepared for strong winds: 'I would ask folks who don't need to be on the highway, and this includes trucks particularly in a high-wind situation, that if you can delay that delivery or delay that travel that you do that.' ""Winds with gusts as high as 75 miles per hour are forecast for some areas. That brings the risk of power outages from downed power lines. Malloy says wind conditions may make it difficult for utility workers to quickly restore power."" Lori Mack, of member station WNPR in Connecticut, tells our newscast unit there are whiteout conditions in parts of the state. Member station WNYC reports that officials are urging New York City residents to remain indoors: ""The city's Department of Education is shuttering schools all day Thursday as the powerful nor'easter moves through the New York/New Jersey region. Many area schools are closed for the day. ""At the same time, Mayor de Blasio is urging people not to drive and to minimize their time outside. "" 'Bottom line is to take this storm very seriously. Very cold temperatures — definitely a major amount of snow — could get to be a lot more. Wind gusts up to 40 miles-per-hour — this is serious stuff. Asking all New Yorkers to take precautions. Lookout for your neighbors as well,' de Blasio said.""","As the ""bomb cyclone"" intensifies, visibility has dropped to nearly zero in some sections of the snow band.

Josh Ocampo,"Winter is in full effect, and with it, the problem of salt lining our every sidewalk and street, unless of course, you live in a state where seasonal differences are virtually absent (Im jealous).
While salt helps us avoid pile-ups by melting snow, salt regularly contaminates our water sources, damages our environment, and affects our own health. How does simple salt on a sidewalk manage to make its way into our bodies?
Since the recent snow bomb hit the East Coast, Ive been forced to outfit my tiny terrier with both

First, theres a difference between the salt youd typically see on roads and the ones you see on sidewalks and street corners, though they can be used interchangeably. On roads, rock salt is generally used. Its cheap and the same composition as table salt, like the kind you use on your dinner. It helps provide traction on roadways but is considered more harmful to plant and animal life (including dogs!). 
Ice melt, however, is the common pellet-like salt you see on sidewalks. Its considered friendlier to pets (still harmful, though) and works in temperatures below 5 degrees, unlike rock salt, so it can better withstand the winters worst. Its also considered less corrosive than rock salt, so its more frequently used near and around homes. 
Recycling can be a little complicated as it isits never as easy as throwing plastic in a plastics

But theyre all forms of salt, and when they seep into pavements or streets or are carried away by runoff, they make their way into our groundwater or rivers, where a number of U.S. communities obtain their drinking water. A recent study found that 37% of U.S. drainage areas, or areas where rain and snowmelt meet streams and rivers, are becoming saltier. And in Northeast regions, road salt is mostly to blame. 
Whats the worst that could happen? Well, when you drink saltier water, it has the potential to spike your blood pressure. And for the millions of Americans that already suffer from high blood pressure issues, it presents a hell of a problem. 
A 2008 study found that 48% wells tested in Duchess County, New York exceeded the EPAs limit on sodium in water, and 20% of wells had enough salt to compromise the health of residents there with high blood pressure. 
Salt also threatens aquatic life and entire bodies of water, which become depleted of oxygen with too much salt. Worse, the salt doesnt exactly go away, and instead, accumulates in bodies of water. There isnt a cost-effective method of removing it, either (it dissolves into water so its no longer visible, adding to the problem).
So what can you do to help?
For one, if youre going to use any salt at all, dont go overboard with it. Spread it across a surface evenly, instead of in mounds, so youll need less (its also more effective that way). Shoveling more often will also help curb your need for salt. And sweep up any spare salt after a storm so that it wont make its way into your drinking water again.

In turn, if someone needed a lantern, she handed over one of hers. Mothers cared for each other’s children and took turns waiting in lines at banks and gas stations. Teachers clambered into the bed of pickup trucks and traveled as far as they could along muddy, washed-out roads to check on their students. Ms. Torres had been saved by two neighbors as floodwaters filled her home. She was dazed and could not get out, so the men had lifted her through a window. Around the island, doctors have teamed to make forays into hard-to-reach towns in the interior, jumping in cars and sport utility vehicles with whatever supplies they could muster. In Humacao, a municipality on the eastern shore where Hurricane Maria snapped sturdy trees in half like pretzel rods and flooded entire neighborhoods, teachers showed up at school the next day, unbidden. Fallen trees covered the courtyard. Mud caked the hallways and classrooms. They put on gloves and started to haul away branches. Eventually, cafeteria workers served up thousands of meals for the homebound and others in Humacao. In the distance, several weeks after Maria, mountains that had looked brown and stripped of life after the hurricane now glowed green. “We will put fruit trees over there, and plants there,” said Carmen Gisela Rodriguez, a teacher in Humacao, envisioning a tableau of shade and plenty in the school courtyard. Her eyes welled up. “Amid all this grew a culture of sharing.” Photo Pirulo, a salsa musician who stayed on the island during the storm, handed out supplies in Bubao. “It’s my country,” he said. “If I leave, who stays to work — and there is a lot of work to be done.” Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Ms. Velez said optimism had sometimes slipped away from her amid so many unsolvable questions: Where to find food. How to cook the food. Where to wash clothes. How to fix the gate, remove the mold, rebuild her back rooms. Suicidal thoughts came and went, she said. But she smiled and clasped her cheeks in astonishment when Tito El Bambino and a well-known salsa musician, Pirulo, his dreadlocks bouncing off his back, walked along the street and right up to her. Her son whipped out his iPhone, and she basked in their attention. “This helps us so much — so much,” Ms. Velez said. “To feel we are not abandoned.” Tito, who helped popularize reggaeton, which combines rap with Latin rhythms, and Pirulo made deliberate decisions to stay in Puerto Rico during and after the hurricane, knowing their visibility would draw attention and donations to some of the most desperate pockets of the island. Not long after the storm cleared the island, Pirulo left his apartment in Old San Juan and joined a brigade of doctors going house to house. He helped evacuate elderly residents. Then he started bringing food and water to other marginalized neighborhoods, something he did for weeks. “It’s my country,” he said. “If I leave, who stays to work — and there is a lot of work to be done.” Tito became the public face of the distribution caravans. He joined forces with Alberto E. de la Cruz, the chief executive of Coca-Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers who organized caravans of his company’s trucks to ferry food and water to some the island’s most neglected towns. Volunteers distributed the goods door-to-door as music boomed and people danced. Mr. de la Cruz helped persuade the Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Guard to join the line of trucks. Residents felt like Christmas had come when the caravans rumbled into their town. Tito and Pirulo posed for countless selfies. They hugged and cried and listened. Pirulo grabbed bags of food and headed up a hill to knock on doors. Tito handed money for milk to a young mother with a baby perched on her hip. The residents of Bubao said they had gotten little help from the government; the municipal mayor had yet to show up weeks after the hurricane, they said. As Pirulo and Tito walked by, one man held up a sign that said, “No Te Vayas. Puerto Rico Te Necesita,” meaning, “Don’t Leave. Puerto Rico Needs You.” “A hug is sometimes worth more than a can of sausages,” Pirulo said. “People go through a disaster like this and it’s the people — el pueblo — who end up helping each other. That’s how we get by.” Continue reading the main story","Since Hurricane Maria steamrollered Puerto Rico, the day-to-day job of digging out, sometimes block by block, has fallen largely to island residents.",2017-12-17T12:00:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Utuado Journal: Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Small Gesture at a Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-tito-el-bambino.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/us/16prjournal1/16prjournal1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,ice storm,1

Emily Rosko,"Emily Rosko's most recent poetry collection is ""Weather Inventions"" (University of Akron Press, 2018). She is associate professor at the College of Charleston and director of the master of fine arts program in creative writing. The views expressed here are solely the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies. As the storm nears and intensifies, so too does the stress of preparing and planning. Tuesday morning, my blood began prickling underneath my skin; I felt a nervous-energy in my gut, as though I were perched on the starting blocks before a race. We are not in the clear, and the current information cannot tell us how Florence will behave once it approaches the coast. Projected track lines across the Carolinas look as though a toddler has scribbled all over the map. Charleston sits on the edge of the cone of uncertainty. The schools, the college campus where I work, all the city offices are all closed. My family is leaving our house on the Charleston peninsula to go inland -- the third time in three consecutive falls. Florence threatens, and yet it's beautiful here right now. After the 5 inches of unprecedented snow and ice that glazed the camellias and gave us an actual winter, after a long summer of rains, after an eye-blink of a spring, our front yard garden is ripening. The sages and salvias, the bee balm and zinnias are drawing in a cast of bees and butterflies. The promise of less humid days is visible in the resurrection ferns browning on the live oaks, in the sky's dynamic mixture of high and low altitude clouds. With the school year in full swing, we were just feeling settled into our weekly routines. Last year, Irma interrupted this exact same week of the school year, and the year before Matthew arrived not far after. I ask myself -- did I plant our winter vegetable garden before or after Irma, before or after Matthew? September and October have new meanings for me now. Time moves strangely when a hurricane eyes you from the ocean. You reside in a surreal pre-storm space. The closest comparison I have to this altered time-space is caring for a newborn in the first weeks. You try to concentrate on other things. There's a constant pressure behind your eyes; you do not sleep well. You go hour-by-hour reassessing with every forecast update. You never feel you are making the best choices. You exist in a mixed state of hyper-vigilance and fret; you go back-and-forth discussing the storm's probabilities and what gambles you're willing to take. You might put up plywood; you might not. You might evacuate, if you can. You might not. Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait -- that's the pre-storm mantra. Then the storm arrives, and you wait. As I wait, I talk to my neighbors, colleagues and students about their thoughts: Will you stay? What's your plan? In Charleston, you can often tell a South Carolina native from a transplant, like me, based on how they react to these storm threats. Charleston natives, long seasoned by storms and near misses, will joke about how they plan to go to the bars downtown, now that there's plenty of parking with all the tourists gone. They will remind you about Hurricane Hugo -- the measuring stick of what disaster means here. Many will say that if it's a Category 4 or higher, then they will go, but only then. I do not feel seasoned by these storms yet. But I know what will likely happen here: The peninsula's outermost roads will be inundated with saltwater; the downtown Market will flood. Some of the majestic old trees, heavy with rot, will crack and fall. Every intersection notorious even for sunny-day flooding will fill up all the faster; the crosstown will become a stream. The bridges that link the peninsula and the sea islands will close. Trucks delivering food will be delayed. Once in the clear, people will venture outside; others will arrive back to their houses to clean up what puddles or debris they find. Threads on our neighborhood Facebook feed will ask what restaurants are open and serving -- gosh darn it, they say, they need to get out of the house, they're stir crazy. At the College of Charleston, we'll have to re-create our syllabi and fit in make-up classes. My summer garden will be toppled, flattened in spirals. It'll be a nuisance -- at least that's what I'm most hopeful for -- a repeat of what has happened twice before. I'm lucky that I can entertain the thought of Hurricane Florence as a nuisance, but even this is overshadowed by certain catastrophe to the north where the impacts won't be merely bothersome but biblical. Rain there is measured in feet and not inches; the color scale indicating rain accumulations grows a deeper gray as all the more alarming colors were spent further down the scale. As I sit here pitched on the edges of the cone of uncertainty, I'm reminded how much of our lives -- if we are fortunate -- unfold at the edge of a catastrophe that is always striking somewhere and striking hard, sometimes on a scale distant and unimaginable.","Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies.

https://www.facebook.com/markberman,"BOSTON — It began with a gentle dusting, a flutter of flakes falling on this city already enduring a bitterly cold winter. “This isn’t bad,” said Richie Bianchino, 30, after he parked his car Thursday at a covered mass transit garage. He was wearing a hoodie and no gloves. “We’ve just had a bunch of days near zero. This feels good.” The peaceful start didn’t last. As the day wore on, the mammoth winter storm churning up the East Coast had pummeled Boston with driving snow and painful sleet as it continued marching north, sweeping across population center after population center. As much as 14 inches fell in Greater Boston on Thursday, leaving more than 24,000 without power by late afternoon as the storm caused what officials called a “historic high tide” to flood coastal towns. The storm dumped more than a foot of snow in areas from Virginia to New Hampshire, swamping millions with a one-two-three punch of heavy snowfall, gusting winds and coastal flooding. All across the Northeast, routines of daily life were brought to a standstill Thursday as schools and offices shut down, roadways were left impassable and nearly 5,000 flights were grounded. Hundreds of flights scheduled for Friday were called off as well. [ Historic ‘bomb cyclone’ unleashes blizzard conditions from coastal Virginia to New England. Frigid air to follow. ] In New England, officials worried not only about the snow, but also the wind gusts — topping 40 mph at Boston’s airport and reaching as high as 76 mph on Nantucket — that brought down power lines, leaving people without heat or power before the temperatures are forecast to plummet on Friday and into the weekend. A region already weary of the cold — the high temperature has not been above freezing since Christmas — will now face at least a couple days below zero. “After the storm’s over, the commonwealth will immediately see a return to the bitter cold temperatures of the past few days, which will cause freezing conditions on top of the storm,” Gov. Charlie Baker (R) said at a briefing Thursday. “We’re all hardy New Englanders, but it’s pretty important for everybody to pay attention and be prepared.” The storm strengthened Thursday into a “ bomb cyclone,” the dramatic name for what happens when a storm’s pressure plummets as it explosively intensifies. Though forecasters said this storm was among the most powerful ever observed on the East Coast, much of the cyclone actually remained in the Atlantic Ocean as it lashed the coastal states. After the snow has moved out of New England by Friday, arctic air will descend upon the Eastern Seaboard, plunging temperatures into the single digits and teens in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and New England. When the flakes fell in the Northeast on Thursday — a day after Southern states got an unusual coating of snow — some welcomed the sight. In New York, while flights were suspended at both LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports, the Times Square area was clogged with snow as wind whipped the flakes across the bright electronic billboards looming overhead. Tourists still showed up, taking selfies and throwing snowballs despite the harsh conditions. Casey and Austin Sergent, a brother and sister from Columbus, Ga., braved the elements to line up at the TKTS booth so they could purchase tickets for a Thursday matinee of “The Phantom of the Opera.” “It’s beautiful,” said Casey, 20, who was visiting New York for the first time. “I’m amazed that everything functions here, unlike Columbus, where everything shuts down when it snows.” [ The winter storm brought ice and snow to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas first ] Not everything functioned, of course. School systems from Florida to Massachusetts were closed, canceling classes in major school districts including the District and its suburbs, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Government offices closed down or let employees come in late as they trudged through snow, slush and salt. In New York City, at Tom’s Restaurant — the diner with an exterior made famous by the show “Seinfeld” — cabdriver Brooks Sissay gave himself the day off. He hunkered down at the diner’s counter with a cup of coffee and a pile of newspapers. “I’m 68 years old and I can’t do it any more,” Sissay said. “I might have driven in the snow when I was younger, but not now.” Brian Robinson, escorting a group of high school students from West Texas on a class trip to Boston, wanted them to soak up the frigid climate while they were there. “We want as much snow as we can get and as cold as it can get,” Robinson said. “It’s the experience.” The students shared that enthusiasm. “I’ve never seen snow before!” exclaimed Erynne Turner, 18, a student. “We made a snow angel this morning,” said Hannah Glass, also 18. Authorities pleaded with people to stay off of roads due to the icy conditions. At least three deaths have been attributed to the storm. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said Thursday that three men died, all of them in trucks that overturned. State troopers have responded to more than 1,000 calls since the storm began, more than 700 of them involving car collisions, Cooper said. “With the freezing temperatures, the black ice will be an ongoing concern through the weekend,” Cooper said at a news briefing. “You can make the job of our first responders and our road crews a lot easier by staying off the roads unless it is absolutely necessary.” First responders found difficult conditions when they tried heading out Thursday. About 35 miles south of Boston, fire officials in Duxbury, Mass., said a firefighter was taken to a hospital after crashing while responding to a report of a building fire. Fire officials there also were making “several water rescues,” the department said. The storm pushed historically high tides to flood over coastlines in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, authorities said. Streets along the Boston coastline were awash by midday, flooding that came as the tide swelled so high that some vessels were brought up to street level alongside the city’s Seaport area, according to the Massachusetts State Police. Water flowed down the streets in Scituate, Marshfield, Plum Island, Dorchester and other Massachusetts communities, and police and fire personnel carried people get out of water-stranded cars and low-lying apartments. “We were in the office when all of a sudden the water started coming in,” said Gina Cameron, 36, who works at the Boston Harbor Cruise company at Boston Harbor. “We had to scramble to get the computers up high.” [ How climate change could counterintuitively feed some winter storms ] Officials in New England attacked the snow cleanup with urgency, eyeing the sharp drop in temperatures that would quickly turn slushy snow coating the roads into ice. Most people around Boston huddled in their homes, but those who live on the streets looked for safety. In the St. Francis shelter in downtown Boston, Bo Revera, the shelter manager, was a man in motion. “We just saved a guy’s life with Narcan, we recovered a stolen cellphone, and we’re serving lunch,” he said, referring to the use of an opioid overdose antidote drug, as men and women streamed through the metal detector seeking a hot meal. “It’s just too bad out there,” said Troy Savage, a 21-year-old who said he has been on the streets for two years. In Cambridge, Mass., normally busy sidewalks were largely empty. Dry cleaners and beauty shops were closed, while Inman Square Hardware was busy Thursday morning with people buying rock salt and shovels. At the nearby 1369 Coffee House, lifelong Cambridge resident Terry Carter came in for his hot caramel apple cider before he expected to shovel snow for others later in the day. “I’m used to this weather,” Carter said. “This is like the perfect day.” Despite the cold and ice, it was business as usual for some stores in Hartford, Conn., where bright “OPEN” signs were the only things visible amid blinding snow. Pauline Taylor, a CVS employee, had been working at the store since 7 a.m. Thursday and was shrugging off the snowstorm as just another winter day in New England. “I got my boots, big coat and long johns. It’s fine,” Taylor said. “We never close unless the electricity goes.” Jesse Macauley, a 37-year-old student from New York City, sat at the bar Thursday at the Burlington Airport, about to catch one of the few flights out of Vermont. He had been in New England visiting family and was headed to Lake Tahoe, where he grew up. He felt as though he was escaping another arctic blast — which is expected to drop temperatures 40 degrees below normal by the weekend — but much of the past week or so has been frigid in Vermont. It was a relatively balmy 18 degrees outside the airport on Thursday. “I do feel like I’m escaping,” he said. “This is the coldest weather I’ve ever experienced in my life. I never thought 23 above zero would be a pleasant temperature.” Berman reported from Washington. Jason Samenow, Dana Hedgpeth and Lori Aratani in Washington; Katie Zezima in Burlington, Vt.; Danielle Douglas-Gabriel in Hartford, Conn.; Vera Haller in New York; and Karen Weintraub in Cambridge, Mass., contributed to this report.

Ellen Cranley,"A massive storm is pelting southern states with freezing rain, snow, and ice, causing over 300,000 power outages across the Carolinas and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.US.

Max Golembo,"Most of the eastern U.S. is in the grip of wintry weather with cold temperatures and snowfall. Anywhere from 3 to 7.5 inches of snow fell Wednesday from the Carolinas to New Jersey and western New York -- producing numerous accidents and spinouts. Now, a new storm is moving from west to east over the next several days and bringing heavy snow, ice and heavy rain. The western storm brought more than 2 inches of rain to Southern California and wind gusts to near 70 mph. Also several inches of snow fell in the Southern California mountains Wednesday. The storm will continue to move through the Southwest on Thursday from California into Arizona and New Mexico with rain and mountain snow. Some minor flash flooding is possible. Heavy rain is falling in Southern California on Thursday. By Friday afternoon, the storm system will redevelop in southern Texas and bring with it heavy rain. Heavy snow and ice will break out to the north on Friday night into Saturday morning from the Texas Panhandle to central Oklahoma. The heavy rain, snow and ice will move into parts of Texas, Oklahoma and the Deep South on Saturday morning. The storm system will move into the Southeast by Sunday, bringing heavy snow and ice to the southern Appalachian Mountains and heavy rain for the eastern Gulf Coast states. Major ice and snow is forecast for the Carolinas and into Virginia and parts of northern Georgia. The mixed precipitation moves onto the East Coast on Sunday. Heavy snow is forecast from the Texas Panhandle to southern Virginia, where locally 6 to 12 inches of snow is possible. Some areas in the southern Appalachian Mountains could see more than a foot of snow. Snowfall totals will be highest in the Carolinas, especially in the Appalachian Mountains. Some areas from Oklahoma to the Carolinas could see up to half an inch of ice accumulate on cold surfaces -- a major deal since this far south they dont deal well with wintry precipitation.",The storm will move through Texas on Thursday.,2018-12-06T12:13:19Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Winter storm moving east heading into weekend,https://abcnews.go.com/US/winter-storm-moving-east-heading-weekend/story?id=59646698,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/carolina-snow-wsoc-mo-20181206_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,ice storm,1
Robert A. Cronkleton,"Don’t expect much of a thaw, Kansas City, before the next round of wintery weather, including freezing rain, hits in the area. Sleet, snow and freezing rain or drizzle are likely to fall in the Kansas City area late Wednesday and early Thursday, according to the National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill, Mo. Between a trace to an inch of snow and sleet with up to two-tenths of an inch of freezing rain is possible in some parts of the Kansas City area. Drivers should expect roads to be slick for the morning commute. With ice already on trees and power lines from Tuesday’s storm, the freezing rain also could cause problems early Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday got off to a cold start with wind chills falling below zero in some areas. Several school districts in the Kansas City area canceled classes Wednesday because of the inclement weather. Kansas City could see about one-tenth of an inch of new icing early Thursday while areas farther south could see up to two-tenths of an inch of ice, according to the National Weather Service. The storm is expected to move into the Kansas City area between 10 p.m. and midnight. Snow and sleet are expected first, which will switch over to light freezing rain early Thursday. Temperatures weren’t expected to warm above the low 30s Wednesday afternoon, so much of the ice that fell Tuesday was not expected to melt. The next round of snow and ice was expected to begin falling in eastern and southeastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri about 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. The heaviest snowfall and sleet is expected near the Iowa border, with an inch of snow or sleet possible. Areas to the south, including the Kansas City metro area, are not expected to get much snow or sleet. Temperatures are expected to warm above freezing Thursday afternoon.","Kansas City Star Another round of freezing rain likely to fall in Kansas City early Thursday Kansas City Star Don't expect much of a thaw, Kansas City, before the next round of wintery weather, including freezing rain, hits in the area.

Mark Kaufman,"The Environmental Minister of the Marshall Islands, David Paul, left the low-lying tropical islands last week and flew to London. He journeyed all that way to stand in front of a packed room at the United Nations International Marine Organization (IMO) and emphasize that Marshallese children may have to one day desert their ancestral islands and ""set sail across the oceans to an uncertain future."" The reason, Paul noted, is the ""scientific fact"" that rising sea levels stoked by human-caused global warming could put the Marshall Islands underwater sometime later this century. SEE ALSO: Locals call it 'The Tomb': What's in the Marshall Islands' concrete dome? Many of the inhabited Marshall Islands don't even reach 6 feet above the ocean. The airport sits 6 feet above sea level; the highest point in the capital is 10 feet above the water. After a week of negotiations, the IMO decided Friday on a plan to significantly slash the amount of carbon dioxide — a potent greenhouse gas — emitted from the world's shipping sector. Most large ships burn a notoriously thick, dirty fuel, known as ""heavy fuel oil."" In fact, if the shipping sector was its own country, it would be the sixth largest carbon emitter in the world — contributing around the same amount of emissions into the atmosphere as industrial Germany. The broad plan is to slash carbon emissions from ships to at least 50 percent of 2008 levels by the year 2050. The carbon-reduction strategy will be truly finalized by the IMO in 2023. Of the plans on the table, this was considered one of the more ambitious options, though Minister Paul had been pushing for even more aggressive cuts. Satellite imagery of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands, taken in 2016. Image: DigitalGlobe/Getty Images ""We must leave here in no doubt. History has been made in the IMO,"" Paul said in a statement Friday. Though, he noted that the ""job is far from over,"" as nothing has yet to actually be implemented. “IMO took a big step this week by agreeing to a mid-century emissions cap,” Dan Rutherford, the International Council on Clean Transportation's (ICCT) program director for marine and aviation, said via email. How will dirty shipping emissions be cleaned up? The IMO's lofty emissions targets might be three decades away, but achieving these ambitious cuts requires prompt action. “Next up is to start decarbonizing shipping by tightening energy efficiency requirements for ships this fall,"" said Rutherford. There are a few ways to begin slashing the carbon emitted from massive shipping vessels. A quick solution that doesn't require new technology is requiring all ships to slow down as they voyage across the oceans. ""Speed factor has a strong influence on how much fuel burns and how much carbon ships emit,"" said Rutherford. A concrete dome, called 'The Tomb' by locals, caps radioactive waste from 1940s nuclear testing on low-lying Renit Island in the Marshall Islands. Image: GIFF JOHNSON/AFP/Getty Images Other solutions, which could be implemented on ships by around 2025, involve adding innovative technologies to newly built vessels. This includes ""wind assists"" aboard ships, which essentially act as modern sails. Another option is ""air lubrication,"" which involves blowing air bubbles below ships to reduce friction, lessening the amount of dirty fuel needed for cross-world voyages. Longer-term efficiency changes mean completely decarbonizing ships, so they're not running on oil at all, but fuels of the future, like hydrogen. Previously, 196 nations met in Paris in 2015 and agreed to a global effort to combat climate change, agreeing to cap future warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures. But global leaders did not include the marine, or shipping, sector in these climate plans. ""Marine is the last group that doesn’t have a climate framework,"" said Rutherford, before the IMO's Friday agreement. How big of a threat is sea-level rise to the Marshall Islands? Right now, sea levels are rising by between three and 3.5 centimeters (over an inch) per decade, Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in an interview. ""We also know that this rate is accelerating,"" said Willis. Depending on how emissions are limited and how the world's massive ice sheets melt, this could mean 2 or 3 feet by century's end, said Willis. Or it could mean a devastating 6 feet. The Thwaites Glacier, a rapidly melting portion of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Image: nasa ""That’s a difference between existing as a nation and evacuating to go live somewhere else,"" said Willis. He noted that the science here is indisputable. ""We know it's caused by global warming and human emissions of these greenhouse gases. The basic physics of the warming planet have been known for over a century,"" said Willis. But precisely estimating how much the world's ice sheets will melt into the ocean — specifically those on Greenland and Antarctica — is difficult to precisely predict. ""We’re watching them melt for the first time in scientific history,"" said Willis. ""We’ve never watched something like this happen before. NASA is already seeing a rapid melting of Antarctic ice at its precarious edges. Here, ocean water beneath glaciers, like the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers, can amplify melting. ""They're melting like gangbusters,"" said Willis. ""These are massive rivers of ice that are dumping just huge amounts of ice into the oceans."" Big ships mean big emissions. Image: AFP/Getty Images Low-lying Pacific Island nations are especially vulnerable to this added water. The Marshall Islands are relatively thin rings of coral reef that once surrounded volcanic mounts — mounts that have long since eroded away. It's not hard to see why Paul pushed for such ambitious emission targets. ""Climate change is an existential threat for them, and they have been pressing the case strongly,"" said Rutherford. Sea level rise itself isn't yet drowning the islands in water — though this may very well be the case on many islands by the century's end. However, the rising seas cause damaging floods during recurrent storms and high tides. ""The storms are getting more intensive, we’re getting more cyclones,"" Jimmy Nuake, the Under Secretary Technical of the Solomon Islands' Ministry of Infrastructure Development, said in a statement at the IMO. ""We’re going to lose more islands,"" he said, citing the fact that almost five Solomon Islands have been lost since 1980. If global emissions aren't controlled, Willis said low-lying Pacific Islands will no longer be safe from storms that once weren't a threat. The impact to the islands won't be gradual, he said. It will come suddenly, when the right merging of sea level rise and storm whop the islands. ""Eventually, they’re going to get you,"" said Willis.","The Environmental Minister of the Marshall Islands, David Paul, left the low-lying tropical islands last week and flew to London.

Reem Nadeem,"WASHINGTON — The bone-chilling weather that has locked onto the D.C. region and wreaked havoc on pipes, cars and local school systems for the past few days just won’t let up. A winter weather advisory has been issued until 9 p.m. Monday and may complicate the evening commute. This cold snap will let up somewhat on Monday but the ground will still be freezing, so if any precipitation falls, icy roadways are a risk. “A storm approaching from the Ohio Valley will bring moisture back into the region and there’s a chance that the moisture could get here before the Arctic air has been completely scoured out. The result could be a brief period of freezing rain in the morning before temperatures get above freezing Monday afternoon,” Storm Team 4 meteorologist Chuck Bell said. While temperatures on Sunday broke some records, the wind chill made it feel a little less brutal. A southerly flow along with calmer winds took the sting out of the cold in comparison to the past few days, but highs will only reach the mid- to upper 20s. Check out WTOP’s weather page for updates. Here’s a look at the current forecast: Sunday: Increasing clouds in the afternoon. A little warmer. Highs in the mid to upper 20s Monday: Cloudy with a chance of light rain, possibly mixed with freezing rain or sleet. Highs in the mid 30s to lower 40s Although this cold weather is anything but pleasant, it has broken a few records and bottomed out at some wild temperatures. The records for lowest temperature were broken at BWI Marshall Airport and Dulles International Airport on Saturday morning. At Dulles, the temperature fell to a painful minus 1 at about 7 a.m., breaking a previous record of 1 degree recorded in 2014. At BWI, the temperature fell to 1 degree at 6:30 a.m. Saturday, breaking the 2014 record of 3 degrees. The record for the coldest high was also broken on Friday at Dulles International Airport, reaching only 19 degrees. According to the National Weather Service, the previous highest cold temperature was 21 degrees in 1986. The National Weather Service created a list of wind chill temperatures recorded locally on Friday. Here are some of the most impressive ones: In D.C., wind chill temperatures reached minus 13 degrees at American University. In Montgomery County, Maryland, wind chills were recorded at minus 17 degrees in Gaithersburg. In Prince George’s County, Upper Marlboro saw wind chills of minus 13 degrees. In Virginia, a wind chill of minus 11 degrees was record at Dulles International Airport. The City of Manassas saw a comparatively toasty 7 below. Check out the full list from NWS. Experts recommend taking precautions until the brutal cold is over. Dress in several layers, and make sure to cover exposed skin with gloves or mittens, a hat and a scarf or knit mask over your mouth. See tips on how to treat cold-related illness. The temperature registered minus 37 Saturday at the Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire, one of the coldest places on the planet. The wind chill was minus 93. It tied for second place with Armstrong, Ontario, as the coldest spot in the world. Meteorologist Mike Carmon said people at the observatory were “layering up as a much as we can.” WTOP’s William Vitka and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Chacour Koop,"A winter storm is predicted to dump up to a foot of snow on the suburbs the next two days. National Weather Service meteorologists first issued a winter storm warning from Thursday night through 9 p.m. Friday, with heavy snow making travel ""very difficult to impossible."" Late Thursday night the warning was shortened so that it now lasts only until noon. More than 200 flights were canceled ""proactively"" at O'Hare International Airport, the Chicago Department of Aviation reported, and more than 70 at Midway. Metra's BNSF Line will run 84 instead of 94 trains Friday in an effort to reduce switching operations. Heavy ice and snow can cause switching problems and subsequent delays. To learn more, go to metrarail.com. Pace bus service is warning riders to take transit only for essential trips from Thursday night through Sunday and postpone nonessential travel. ""Significant delays due to heavy snow and hazardous driving conditions,"" are expected, officials said. Suburban school districts began announcing closings for Friday, including all schools in Elgin Area School District U-46, Hawthorn District 73, Wheaton Warrenville Unit District 200, Naperville Unit District 203, Palatine-Schaumburg High School District 211, Northwest Suburban High School District 214, Barrington Area Unit District 220 and Community Unit District 300. Plus day care centers, senior centers and other businesses are not opening Friday morning, the Emergency Closing Center is reporting. Go to emergencyclosingcenter.com for a complete roundup of closings. Various suburbs are reminding residents that cars should not be parked on streets so snow plows can sweep through. Many suburban governments have announced village or city halls will not be open on Friday. The Circuit Court of Cook County also said it will close Friday. ""There will be no court in session in any Cook County courthouse and that the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court will be closed,"" except for Central Bond Court at the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago, Chief Judge Timothy Evans said in a statement. All cases set for Friday will be rescheduled. The storm warning includes all of northern Illinois and northwest Indiana. Six to 12 inches of accumulation is possible. The weather service is warning of significant reductions in visibility at times. ""If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency,"" the weather service said in a statement. The snow will add on to the three inches that have fallen over the past three days. The Illinois Tollway announced it is deploying its fleet of nearly 200 snowplows to combat the expected snowfall, and the Illinois Department of Transportation warned travelers to avoid driving through Friday night. Officials said snowy and icy roads are expected to cause low visibility and significant delay. For those who have no choice but to brave the snow, officials recommended driving with extreme caution and preparing for the worst by keeping a full tank of gas and cold weather essentials such as blankets, food and water and an ice scraper in the car. • Daily Herald correspondent Christopher Hacker contributed to this report.","Chicago Daily Herald Canceled flights, various closings announced as snowstorm begins Chicago Daily Herald A winter storm is predicted to dump up to a foot of snow on the suburbs the next two days.

A massive storm marching across the nation Tuesday was promising heavy snow, crippling ice and torrential rain to more than 200 million Americans over the next few days.
""Parts of 39 of the 48 contiguous United States will be touched by the massive storm, including every state east of the Mississippi River,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Faith Eherts said. 
Wintry temperatures will translate to snow and ice across from Minnesota as far south to North Texas. The storm will roll east all the way to Maine. On Monday, the storm aimed its fury on the southern Rockies. As much as a foot of snow fell in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.
On Tuesday, the storm will spread heavy snow and strong winds into the central U.S., the National Weather Service said. Late Tuesday and into Wednesday, the threat for heavy snow, ice and dangerous travel will expand across the Midwest, Ohio Valley, Mid Atlantic and the Northeast.

The Weather Channel warned that the Washington D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia metro areas will see accumulating snow to start before it changes to a mix of sleet, freezing rain and then rain. That could make the Wednesday morning commute in those cities hazardous.
Freezing rain and ice will be especially dangerous in the mountains of West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina, weather.com said, causing tree damage and scattered power outages. Lighter amounts of ice are forecast for portions of Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
In the South, several rounds of heavy, flooding rainfall and even some severe thunderstorms are expected Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Up to a half foot of rain could swamp much of northern Mississippi, northern Alabama and Tennessee, where flood watches and warnings have been posted. 
Summer will continue to pay an early visit to Florida on Tuesday as temperatures soar into the 80s. Several Florida cities set record highs Monday, including Vero Beach, which tied an all-time February record high of 89 degrees. 
The unusual warmth is expected to continue in the Sunshine State for most of the week.

"USA TODAY, Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY","Last Slide Next Slide A developing winter storm threatened to make a mess for air travelers as it moved across the country into the weekend. The storm was still gathering strength in the Southwest, but it was forecast to spread heavy rain, snow and icy weather as it tracked east across Texas, Oklahoma and the Southeast. By Sunday, heavy snow was expected to develop across parts of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic, with up to a foot possible for parts of North Carolina and Virginia. The weekend forecast is still coming into focus, but so far it appeared that most major hubs were expected to see only rain. The big exception was Charlotte, where several inches of snow were possible on Sunday. That could likely create significant problems at the airport, a hub for American Airlines. Weekend travelers also should keep an eye on Atlanta. Current forecasts showed the rain-snow line remaining north of the city, but rainy and blustery weather could still affect operations there. Beyond that, heavy snow was forecast mostly for smaller or mid-sized airports like Asheville, North Carolina, and Roanoke, Virginia. But the impact at those types of airports could be severe, if current forecasts hold. Wintry weather was also possible at airports like Raleigh/Durham and Greensboro in North Carolina and Greenville/Spartanburg in South Carolina. So far, Southwest was the only carrier to begin waiving rebooking fees for the storm. Its waivers focus on areas in the Southwest, Texas and Oklahoma, where ice and snow were possible by Friday morning. It was almost certain that Southwest and other airlines would begin rolling out waivers for airports in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic as forecasts begin to firm up. For now, Southwests waiver covered Thursday and Friday travelers scheduled to fly through five airports in the region: Albuquerque; Amarillo and Lubbock in Texas; and Oklahoma City and Tulsa in Oklahoma. Southwest does not charge change fees, but its waiver allowed flyers at those airports to make one change to their itineraries without paying a recalculated fare. Elsewhere in Texas, it appeared likely that major hubs in Dallas and Houston were not going to see wintry weather. Travelers may want to keep an eye on Houston, however. Thunderstorms and heavy rain of up to 10 inches were forecast through Saturday, which could create problems at airports there if flooding restricts access to the airports. This map from the National Weather Service on Dec. 6, 2018, shows a wide range of weather warnings popping up ahead of a developing winter storm.

Russ Bynum / AP,"(SAVANNAH, Ga.) — A brutal winter storm smacked the coastal Southeast with a rare blast of snow and ice Wednesday, hitting parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina with their heaviest snowfall in nearly three decades. Forecasters warned that the same system could soon strengthen into a “bomb cyclone” as it rolls up the East Coast, bringing hurricane-force winds, coastal flooding and up to a foot of snow. At least 17 deaths were blamed on dangerously cold temperatures that for days have gripped wide swaths of the U.S. from Texas to New England. A winter storm warning extended from the Gulf Coast of Florida’s “Big Bend” region all the way up the Atlantic coast. Forecasters said hurricane-force winds blowing offshore on Thursday could generate 24-foot (7-meter) seas. Schools in the Southeast called off classes just months after being shut down because of hurricane threats, and police urged drivers to stay off the roads in a region little accustomed to the kind of winter woes common to the Northeast. In Savannah, snow blanketed the city’s lush downtown squares and collected on branches of burly oaks for the first time in nearly eight years. William Shaw, a Savannah native, used baby steps to shuffle along a frozen road from his home to the post office. “It almost seems the town is deserted just like in the last hurricane,” said Shaw, 65. “There’s no one on the street. It’s got a little eerie feeling.” Dump trucks spread sand on major streets in Savannah ahead of the storm and police closed several bridges, overpasses and a major causeway because of ice. By the time the morning’s dreary sleet and rain turned to fluffy snow, Savannah came out to play. Families with children flocked to Forsyth Park near the downtown historic district for snowball fights. The National Weather Service recorded 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) of snow — Savannah’s first measurable snowfall since February 2010 and the first that exceeded an inch (2.5 centimeters) in 28 years. Across the Georgia-South Carolina line in Charleston, the weather service reported 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) as the snow was winding down at 5 p.m. That’s the most snowfall in Charleston since December 1989, and plenty for Chris Monoc’s sons, ages 4 and 2, to go sledding outside their home near the city’s iconic Ravenel Bridge. “They probably will be teenagers the next time something like this happens, and that’s kind of sad,” Monoc said. “But we’ll enjoy it while it is here.” Airports shut down in Savannah, Charleston and elsewhere as airlines cancelled 500 flights Wednesday, and at least 1,700 more were cancelled Thursday. Interstate 95 was nearly an icy parking lot for almost all of its 200 miles (322 kilometers) in South Carolina. Troopers couldn’t keep up with the number of reported wrecks which numbered in the hundreds. In Tallahassee, Florida, Michigan transplant Laura Donaven built a snowman 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall. The city tweeted that snow fell there for the first time in 28 years. “I made a snowball and threw it at my dad,” said Donaven, a 41-year-old hair salon owner. The weather service said the winter storm will probably intensify into a “bomb cyclone” that could dump more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow on the Boston area on Thursday and at least half a foot (15 centimeters) of snow in the New York City region. Meteorologists have been using the term “bomb” for storms for decades, but the phrase went viral on social media on Wednesday. A storm is a bomb — or bombogensis happens — when it drops 24 millibars of pressure in 24 hours. This storm looks like it will intensify twice that rate, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. Mississippi’s largest city said record cold is breaking water mains, leaving some customers with little or no water flow. Jackson city spokeswoman Kai Williams said Wednesday evening that the city knew of 37 separate water main breaks that it attributed to cold. The city has declared an emergency and is hiring outside contractors to help repair water main breaks. Blizzard warnings were issued from Rhode Island to Maine. Oravec said he expects they could be extended as far south as parts of New York. “It’s sort of akin to a hurricane traveling up the coast,” says Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at the private firm Weather.US. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency through Friday for 28 counties. School systems on the Alabama coast waived uniform requirements so students could bundle up. Florida’s largest theme parks announced that water attractions such as Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon, Universal Orlando’s Volcano Bay and SeaWorld’s Aquatica were closed. Temperatures were running well below normal for this time of year, and the lows are expected to hover right around freezing. In Prairieville, Louisiana, Valerie Anne Broussard struggled overnight to keep warm in a house that is being rebuilt after the 2016 floods that hit the small community southeast of Baton Rouge. Her home has exterior walls and floors but no insulation, no central heating and only a few working electrical outlets. Eggs that she left on the kitchen counter froze and broke open. “It’s like a camping trip that I didn’t sign up for,” said Broussard, who’s been huddling with her 8-year-old daughter, newborn baby and boyfriend in a bedroom warmed by space heaters. Making the most of the South’s bitter cold snap, the North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro offered discounted tickets for those willing to brave the cold to see polar bears frolic in their kind of weather, along with Arctic foxes and elk. African elephants, lions and gorillas were sheltered out of public view. As the cold pushed farther northward, Jerry Gorans found himself stunned by the frigid temperatures as he walked along the waterfront City Dock of Annapolis, Maryland, where birds stood still on icy water. “This is the coldest I’ve been in probably 50 years,” said Gorans, who lives in Fresno, California, and was visiting his wife’s family in Maryland. “I mean, this is freezing cold. My feet hurt, my ears hurt.”",The rare winter storm comes just months after powerful hurricanes,2018-01-04T07:17:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","A Rare Snow Storm Has Blasted Southeastern States, Dropping the Most Snow and Ice in 30 Years",http://time.com/5087276/winter-snow-storm-southeast-bomb-cyclone/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-901045204.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,ice storm,1

Meanwhile, further south, heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected. USA TODAY A car drives slowly down Old NC 98 in Wake Forest, N.C., on Sunday, Dec. 9, 2018. (Photo: Allen G. Breed, AP) A winter storm bringing havoc to airline and highway traffic across much of the nation crawled east Sunday, pummeling the Southeast with snow and sleet. Almost 300,000 homes and businesses were without power in North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama early Sunday. Thousands of flights were cancelled or delayed from Texas to the Carolinas. In North Carolina, more than 1,000 flights were cancelled in and out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport alone. Parts of North Carolina could see snow measured in feet rather than inches before the storm finally rolls out to sea, a forecast that compelled Gov. Roy Cooper to declare a state of emergency. In the western part of the state, the city of Boone already had 10 inches of snow early Sunday. This is a snow storm, not a snowfall its serious, Gov. Cooper said. In the Piedmont to western parts of our state, were preparing for days of impact, not hours. Cooper warned that utility companies projected widespread power outages affecting over half a million homes and businesses. In some areas, power could be out for days, he said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam also declared a state of emergency, urging state residents to ""take all necessary precautions to ensure they are prepared"" for the storm. The storm dumped heavy rains on Los Angeles more than a week ago before slamming across the southern Plains into the Southeast, leaving a swath of power outages, delayed and canceled flights and dangerous road conditions in its wake. The Southeast was next in line before the storm was expected to move northeastward over the Atlantic Ocean, the National Weather Service said. Asheville, N.C., is expected to bear a large brunt of the storm, with up to two feet falling around much of the region this weekend, followed by treacherous and icy conditions early next week. Emergency officials were bringing in extra staff and cautiously monitoring whether ice accumulates under all the snow, making travel increasingly dangerous. ""If we do, thats going to make it treacherous to get around,"" said Jerry VeHaun, director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, which covers Asheville. ""But we're just watching the weather and making sure were ready to react whichever way we need to.

Hundreds of miles to the southeast, the storm brought heavy rains and flooding to Houston. In scenes eerily reminiscent of the deadly floods following Hurricane Harvey last year, motorists across the city abandoned cars that had been submerged by high-rising floodwaters Saturday. Six Houston-area bayous had overflowed their banks and parts of Houston and Harris County got more than 6 inches of rain over the past two days. College Station, Texas, also reported 4 inches of rain, shattering a record set in 1931, according to the National Weather Service. Much of the wet stuff moved out of Texas by Saturday night as the storm continued moving east. High school championship and playoff football games were postponed in Arkansas, and and Christmas parades in Oklahoma and South Carolina faced a similar fate. Appalachian Power, headquartered in Charleston, W. Va., began moving crews from Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan to areas expected to be affected by the storm. Additional crews will be ready on Monday to assist if needed. ""We continue to monitor the weather closely and will adjust plans as forecasts warrant,"" Appalachian Power said in a statement. Duke Energy, an electric power company headquartered in Charlotte, estimated that half a million customers will lose service across the Carolinas. Duke Energy is bringing crews in from Florida, Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia to respond to power outages. Contributing: Jessica Guynn, Dalvin Brown and Doyle Rice.

http://kdvr.com/fox31-kdvr-channel-2-kwgn-on-facebook/,"Denver and the Front Range will see the biggest accumulations so far this season with a storm that moves in tonight. This storm system will bring big snowfall totals and impacts to travel. Snow is already falling in Western Colorado and in the northeast mountains and will make its way to Denver and the I-25 corridor between 10pm and 1am tonight. It will most likely start in Denver, the Front Range, and plains as freezing drizzle and then change over to snow early Sunday morning. Freezing drizzle will create a layer of ice underneath snow on the roadways making roads slick through the day on Sunday. Snow showers will stick around for most of the day in the mountains, plains, and on the I-25 corridor and will be heavy at times. Winds will be gusty (especially on the plains) causing reduced visibility and making travel difficult at times. It is best to stay home if you can. Snow will taper off from west to east Sunday night ending on the I-25 corridor and mountains by 11pm and clearing out of the plains by 6am Monday morning. Totals will reach 4-8 inches for the Front Range including Castle Rock, Denver, and Fort Collins. The central mountains will see 6-14 inches of snow with the northern mountains expecting 5-12 inches. The northeast plains will see 5-10 inches of snow with Southern Colorado and the southeast plains picking up 1-4 inches. The last time Denver saw over 4 inches of snow was back on December 16, 2016. A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for the Denver metro area and northeast plains until 5 p.m. Sunday. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for the mountains until 2 p.m. Sunday. High temperatures will only reach the 20s in most spots on Sunday. It is possible we will still see slick roadways for the Monday morning commute with morning lows in the teens. Denver will dry out for the rest of the week with highs in the 30s and 40s each day. There is a slight chance for some flurries on Friday. Check interactive radar and zoom in to where you are.

Jonathan Drew & Tom Foreman Jr. / AP,"(DURHAM, N.C.) — The deep freeze that killed at least 15 people and shut down much of the South began to relent Thursday as crews worked to clear roads blanketed by a slow-moving storm that left ice and snow in places that usually enjoy mild winters. The snow stopped by early morning after the storm blew off shore, but North Carolina officials urged drivers to stay home while crews took their first crack at roads coated just hours earlier by the storm. Other parts of the South continued to struggle, including Louisiana, where interstate highways remained closed in the capital city Baton Rouge. “This is an extraordinary event to have this much snow all across the state. We aren’t used to that. We’re working as hard as we can,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. Even low hills in unplowed residential neighborhoods proved too much for drivers in northern Durham County, where the storm dumped up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) of snow on Wednesday. A dark-colored sedan sat abandoned in the middle of the road in one neighborhood. A few people shoveled driveways but most stayed bundled inside. Mark Foley, 24, wore a hat and jacket as he worked to start his pickup truck covered in a half-foot (15 centimeters) of snow in a Durham driveway. After a few minutes in the 15-degree (9 Celsius) air, he was able to go pick up an in-home health aide for his disabled father. “My lock was frozen, so I couldn’t even unlock the door. So I had to use some warm water,” he said holding an empty pitcher. “It’s more snow than we thought we were going to get.” Two-thousand state trucks were out plowing and salting in North Carolina a day after the storm dumped as much as an inch per hour from the mountains to the coast. Some stretches of interstate highway were still covered in icy spots or only partially plowed. Cooper said North Carolina has the second-most state-maintained roads behind Texas, and asked the public to help by staying home. “I know we all get stir crazy and cabin fever. But staying off the roads right now is important for us,” the governor said. Cooper also reported the state’s first weather fatality, after a minivan slid off an icy road and overturned in a canal in Washington County early Thursday. State troopers responded to more than 2,300 crashes, while local police reported hundreds more. From Charlotte to Raleigh, North Carolina’s five most populous cities all saw significant snow from a system that followed an atypical west-to-east path across the state — and moved more slowly than forecasters had predicted. In Atlanta, temperatures remained below freezing until midday. Metro Atlanta’s commuter rail system was operating on a limited schedule as the city continued to recover from the approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of snow and ice that brought the area to a standstill. Officials at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world’s busiest, were hoping to reduce lines to get through security that stretched through the airport on Wednesday. Flight delays were exacerbated because some screeners couldn’t make it to work, leaving the Transportation Security Administration with a single checkpoint in the domestic terminal. Some TSA employees slept at the airport overnight to avoid a repeat. On Thursday, airlines canceled another 200 flights at the Atlanta airport, and dozens of other flights at Charlotte Douglas International. Much of Alabama remained in weather-related limbo. State offices were resuming operations at noon Thursday, and some school systems returned to class with delayed openings. Forecasters say high temperatures Thursday should range from the upper 30s to the low 40s, helping melt the remaining ice. Louisiana was also struggling to dig out. Every interstate in Baton Rouge remained closed Thursday morning, including Interstates 10 and 12, which were blocked to motorists across the southeastern stretch of the state. The transportation department hopes sunshine and above-freezing temperatures will help thaw the icy thoroughfares. Most of the usually warm Florida peninsula also saw freezing temperatures Wednesday, prompting citrus growers to spray their crops to prevent damage by coating oranges in sheens of ice. At least four people died in Louisiana, including a man knocked off an elevated portion of Interstate 10 in New Orleans when a pickup spun out on ice, and an 8-month-old baby, identified Thursday as Kollage Le-Silva, who was pulled unconscious with his mother from their car after it slid off an icy overpass and landed in a canal in suburban New Orleans. The baby’s mother was in critical condition. Two others died along an icy stretch of I-75 southeast of Atlanta. One was inside their car and another standing beside it on the shoulder when another driver lost control and hit them, killing both, authorities said. A young college student died on icy I-64, hitting a tractor-trailer in West Virginia. Most of the deaths were in traffic accidents, but others died quietly, after authorities said they likely succumbed to exposure to temperatures as low as 10 degrees (minus 12 Celsius). The body of one woman was found in the snow near City Hall in Memphis, Tennessee. In Texas, two women in their 80s were found dead after apparently wandering from their homes. One homeless man’s body was found in the snow behind a Dumpster in Houston, another on a sidewalk in Dallas. Another woman was found dead at a bus stop in Dallas, her wheelchair nearby.

Andrew Freedman,"A bone-chilling, frigid air mass will soon stretch from Ireland to Siberia, as a record-shattering weather pattern establishes itself across the North Atlantic Ocean. The cold will cause temperatures to plunge well below freezing in London, where snow is likely to fall during the next 1 to 2 weeks. The U.K. Met Office is calling the cold snap ""exceptional,"" saying it will be the coldest air to affect the country since at least 2013. The cold winds from Siberia, which are pushing the frigid air westward into Central Europe and the UK, are popularly known as ""The Beast from the East."" ""The cold easterly wind will persist bringing a significant wind chill which will make it feel several degrees colder than thermometers indicate,"" the Met Office warned in a press release. SEE ALSO: It will be warmer at the North Pole next week than much of Europe, as sea ice melts The weather agency released a Twitter animation showing a menacing dark blue area of cold air enveloping all of Europe in the coming days like a giant ink stain. Paul Gundersen, a Met Office chief forecaster, said: “Parts of southern England and Wales are likely to see their coldest spell of weather since 2013."" Gundersen said several chances for dry, powdery snowfall exist next week across the UK. Even colder conditions are expected in the European mainland, with heavy snowfall possible in the mountains of northern Spain, the Italian and French Alps, mountains of Croatia, and vast areas of southeastern Europe. Across Europe as a whole, this will be one of the coldest outbreaks of the last decade, potentially setting records for the coldest air seen so late in the season. By the end of this long-lasting cold snap, much of Europe will be blanketed in a deep snow cover just as spring begins to set in. The coldest air is projected to affect eastern Europe and Scandinavia, where temperature departures from average could reach nearly 40 degrees Fahrenheit below average for this time of year. The cold snap won't just be noteworthy for its severity, however, but also for its duration — lasting at least 10 days and possibly even longer. Latest updates on the Arctic outbreak arriving this weekend. A large pool of very cold airmass over W Russia and Scandinavia will start progressing W-SW tomorow and spread across central Europe early Sunday, advancing into W Europe and Mediterranean by Monday. Map: @meteociel pic.twitter.com/YGyMp00ds3 — severe-weather.EU (@severeweatherEU) February 23, 2018 The frigid weather will make headlines for bringing stinging cold to popular tourist destinations such as Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Frankfurt, and Berlin. Those with ski vacations may find it difficult to impossible to reach their destinations due to the sheer amount of snow, with skiing made more challenging due to frigid air temperatures and strong winds. Extreme weather from an extreme pattern The weather pattern behind the cold snap is a remarkable one that is causing meteorologists to take notice. First, it's related to a recent sudden stratospheric warming event and subsequent split in the polar vortex. The split sent one part of the vortex, which is associated with some of the coldest air in all of the Northern Hemisphere, spinning its way above Eurasia. Next, a pattern of air pressure known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, or NAO, is shifting into an extreme configuration that meteorologists have never before witnessed during December, January, or February, which are the months considered to be meteorological winter. The NAO will shift into a record negative phase, with an unusually intense area of high pressure located over southwest Greenland, and low pressure across the North Atlantic and into Europe. Negative phases of the NAO are typically associated with colder and snowier-than-average conditions on both sides of the Atlantic, but in this case it's mainly going to affect Europe, at least at first. Soak this 500mb height anomaly pattern up as we don't see +300m height anomalies over Greenland in a 5 day aggregate map often. Newest NAO forecasts are down to -3.10 sigma, breaking the monthly NAO record low during the cold season by ~0.35sigma. pic.twitter.com/s4R7paWC8P — Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) February 23, 2018 The high pressure area over Greenland, however, may favor a significant winter storm along the East Coast of the U.S. sometime in early March, though the uncertainty in this forecast is higher than average. While millions of Europeans may be less than pleased by the late-winter cold blast, residents of the Arctic, who are seeing a rare drop in sea ice coverage in the dead of winter, when there is no sunlight to melt the ice, could really use some of the cold air up that way. Instead, the temperatures at the North Pole itself will be flirting with the freezing mark for the next several days, as higher-than-average temperatures are pumped into the Arctic from the Atlantic and Pacific sides. Arctic sea ice is at a record low, and temperatures have soared to above freezing at the northernmost land-based weather observing station in Greenland, just 400 miles from the Pole. It's as if someone opened the freezer door in North America's kitchen, and let all the cold air drain out toward the midlatitudes. The Arctic is unusually warm, from Alaska to Norway, while Europe and parts of North America freeze. This setup should persist for at least the next two weeks, making it quite likely that the Arctic will set another record for the smallest peak in wintertime sea ice.","A bone-chilling, frigid air mass will soon stretch from Ireland to Siberia, as a record-shattering weather pattern establishes itself across the North Atlantic Ocean.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","A line of semi-trucks, tow trucks and cars sit on Interstate 40 westbound as road crews clear up an accident on Jan. 12, 2018, near Henderson, Tenn. (Photo: Adrian Sainz, AP) As the southern anchor of brutal weather system stretching northeast into Canada, Nashville caught the brunt of a snow and ice storm overnight into early Saturday that sent cars and trucks spinning off highways and closing two interstates. At one point, the Tennessee National Guard was called out with Humvees and a wrecker to held clear I-40, which was was shut down over a 12-mile stretch because of multi-vehicle accidents. Downtown bridges were closed at one point in Nashville and jack-knifed tractor-trailers dotted interstates throughout the city and surrounding area. Much of the state felt the effect of the winter storm. The National Weather Service said Jackson, Tenn., 130 miles southwest of Nashville, received more than 3 1/2 inches of snow. Ice and snow were expected to remain a threat for much of the three-day weekend, prompting the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency to urge people to drive ""only if absolutely necessary."" Forecasts for Saturday called for temperatures in central and eastern parts of Tennessee to hover around 20 degrees. The unusually icy conditions that gripped parts of the state are part of a long system angling across the eastern U.S. that is expected to bring ice and heavy snow from the interior Mid-Atlantic to New England. ""Ice accumulations up to a quarter of an inch could cause power outages and create hazardous travel conditions,"" the National Weather Service said. The greatest threat for freezing rain and ice accumulations was expected from southern New Hampshire into eastern Maine: up to a tenth of an inch as the arrival of a strong cold front sends temperatures plummeting.. Forecasters said there could be up to to 12 inches of snow around the Great Lakes. For the northern tier of the country, there was little relief in sight from the bitter cold. Bismarck. N.D., was already in the deep freeze at minus 9 degrees. Across the northern Plains into Kansas and Missouri, high temperatures for Saturday were expected to average 15 to 20 degrees below average.

CARYN ROUSSEAU / AP,"(CHICAGO) — A winter storm started sweeping across the Midwest on Friday, leading to slick roads and runways, as it inched its way toward New England, where it was forecast to dump up to 2 feet (0.61 meters) of snow.
The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings from the Dakotas, across the Great Lakes states and into New England. The weather service at one point warned that conditions in New England over the weekend “could approach blizzard criteria.” Ice was also a possibility in some areas in the storm’s path.
In Nebraska, where freezing drizzle was falling Friday afternoon, authorities closed Omaha’s Eppley Airfield after a Southwest Airlines plane slid off an ice-slicked runway. No one was injured. The airport suspended all afternoon flights.
In Iowa, the Department of Transportation warned that visibility was less than a half mile in many locations due to snow and wind. And in South Dakota, where snow was starting to pile up, authorities warned drivers to give plows extra room.
The storm was expected to bring between up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow to the Midwest before walloping the Northeast on Sunday. The National Weather Service in Albany, New York, said snow could fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.5 centimeters) an hour, creating “difficult to impossible travel conditions” in areas.
New York City is expected to see up to 6 inches (15 centimeters). Amtrak canceled some trains Saturday from Chicago to Washington and New York and between New York and Boston and Pennsylvania on Sunday.
Chicago is forecast to receive as much as 8 inches by Saturday and wind gusts in the Chicago area are expected to reach 35 mph (56 kph).

Photo: Tyler Sizemore, Hearst Connecticut Media NWS posts winter storm warning; doubles snow totals The fourth nor’easter this month is taking aim at Connecticut with more than a foot of snow and gusty winds. The National Weather Service has posted a winter storm warning from midnight to 8 a.m. Thursday. In its warning for Fairfield, New Haven and Middlesex counties, the NWS says “Heavy mixed winter precipitation transitioning to heavy snow is expected. Total snow accumulations of 11 to 15 inches and light ice accumulations are expected.” Locally higher amounts are possible. Here’s what you need to know. Snowfall timing Before precipitation changes to snow, a period of sleet is forecast between 1 and 5 a.m. Areas like Greenwich, Stamford, New Canaan and Norwalk could see the onset of steady precipitation between 2 and 4 a.m. Areas north and east including Danbury, Milford, New Haven to New London have will see steady sleet, freezing rain and snow between 4 and 7 a.m. According to the NWS hourly forecast, the best chance of snow is 9 a.m. to 9 p.m Wednesday. The heaviest snowfall will be between 2 and 8 p.m. A map prepared Tuesday morning by the NWS New York office has expected snowfall at 16 inches in Danbury, between 13 and 15 along the southwest Connecticut shoreline, a foot in New Haven and 8 to 10 inches along the state’s southeastern coast. The NWS Boston office map has higher totals with up to 18 inches in southwest Connecticut and northern New Haven County. Potential blizzard warning The current snow accumulation totals are a big increase from late Monday afternoon’s forecast that called for 6 to 8 inches across the state. In its forecast discussion, posted at 4:14 a.m. Tuesday, the NWS says: “Steadier precipitation is expected to develop after around midnight from south to north tonight, becoming more intense through the Wednesday morning commute. “Areas from about NYC eastward will also need to be monitored for a potential blizzard warning with strong winds around 20-30 mph with gusts up to 45 mph are expected. “Primary uncertainty maybe with visibilities, as snow ratios will be lower across these areas leading to a wetter, heavier snow.” The ‘IF factor’ Of course, the NWS says the forecast could change. “There are still uncertanties with the exact track and strength of the storm,” it says. “A track farther to the north and west could result in more rain and sleet over coastal Connecticut and heavier snow totals elsewhere. “A track farther to the south and east could reduce accumulations from NYC on north and West and increase accumulations for southern Connecticut.” Wednesday’s AM and PM commutes The NWS says travel on Wednesday will be “difficult to imposssible.” Getting to work Wednesday morning doesn’t look to be too much of a problem because any accumulation will be less than an inch. But getting home is another story. With snowfall rates between 1 to 3 inches an hour expected by early afternoon, road crews will have a challenging time keeping roads clear. As he did during previous nor’easters, Gov. Dannel Malloy will likely ask people to stay off the roads to allow crews to clear highways. Tractor-trailer trucks may also be banned from roads for a period of time. Metro-North may need to temporarily suspend all service depending upon the severity of the weather. Amtrak is sure to cancel all trains Wednesday in the Northeast. Commuters are advised to check websites for the most up-to-date information. Metro-North trains: www.mta.info/mnr Amtrak trains: www.amtrak.com Shore Line East trains: www.shorelineeast.com CTtransit buses: www.cttransit.com CTfastrak buses: www.ctfastrak.com Power outages Given this is a late winter storm and temperatures will be some what warmer,snowfall is once again expected to be heavy, and combined with strong winds may lead to downed trees and powerlines. In southwest Connecticut, the strongest wind gusts - between 35 and 45 mph - are expected from the shoreline to about 25 miles inland. Southern New Haven County and nearly all of Middlesex and New London counties are in the 35 and 45 mph gust category. Peak wind gusts between 25 and 35 are forecast in the greater Danbury area. For Eversource outage information, click here For United Illuminating outages, click here Likely closings, cancellations It’s likely that school districts will be closed, businesses shut down and travel on roads discouraged. If the forecast holds, the nor’easter will put the Northeast at a standstill with dangerous travel on roads, cancelled flights and Metro-North and Amtrak trains. New York City has a forecast calling for 5 to 9 inches during the day ion Wednesday and another 5 to 9 during the night. Boston and southeast Massachusetts will get slammed with more than a foot of snow and wind gusts of more than 40 mph. The forecast Today: Increasing clouds, with a high near 39. Wind chill values between 15 and 25. East wind 8 to 11 mph. Tonight: A chance of rain and snow before 1 a.m., then a chance of rain, snow, and sleet between 1 a.m and 2 a.m, then snow, freezing rain, and sleet likely after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 30. Wind chill values between 20 and 30. Blustery, with a northeast wind 15 to 21 mph, with gusts as high as 31 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60 percent. Little or no ice accumulation expected.

Cat Schuknecht,"A snow plow moves on a snowy Durham, N.C., street on Sunday. Weather Prediction Center forecaster David Roth told NPR this could be a ""historic storm"" for southwest Virginia and western North Carolina. Jonathan Drew/AP Up to a foot of snow and possibly more is expected to fall on Sunday night across the southern Appalachians and nearby foothills in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. ""Some places might get what the equivalent of a year of snowfall is for that area,"" David Roth, a forecaster Weather Prediction Center, told NPR. ""I would think this will end up being a historic storm for southwest Virginia and western North Carolina."" The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for areas from northeast Georgia to southern Virginia. A mix of wet snow, sleet and rain are predicted to hit southern Virginia and the coastal plain of the Carolinas, which is still recovering from Hurricane Florence. Churches across the region have canceled Sunday services, and many schools are planning to shutter their doors on Monday. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on Friday. On Saturday, the governor urged people not to risk travel during the snowstorm, which he reminded residents isn't the same thing as ""snow fall."" ""This weekend isn't the time to head out to see the winter wonderland. Stay safe where you are,"" Cooper said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam followed suit, declaring a state of emergenc y on Saturday. ""Virginians should take all necessary precautions to ensure they are prepared for winter weather storm impacts,"" said Northam. Being prepared means having up to three days worth of food on-hand and an emergency kit in your car, said North Carolina's emergency management officials on Saturday. It won't be easy for people to travel during the storm by road, train or air. Cooper warned that North Carolinians who brave the roads could make it harder for first responders and road crews to do their jobs, which includes keeping roads ice-free. ""Each night, any snow that melts during the day...it could refreeze,"" forecaster David Roth told NPR. ""You're going to end up with black ice on the roads."" As of Saturday morning, the governor's office said that road crews had spread more than 1 million gallons of brine solution on the state's roads to keep them from getting icy. Flights to and from cities in North Carolina and Virginia have been impacted, too, according to travel advisories from multiple major airlines, including Delta, Southwest, United and American. Flights in Tennessee and South Carolina have also been affected. FlightAware, a website that tracks flights, reported more than 6,500 delays and 1,500 cancellations on Sunday morning. And, on Saturday, Amtrak announced it would be canceling trains and changing services through Tuesday. As heavy snow and ice weigh down branches and cause trees to fall, power lines could fall, too, causing power outages. One of the country's largest electric companies, Duke Energy, announced on Saturday that the storm could bring more than 500,000 power outages in the Carolinas. According to a website that tracks live power outages, almost 150,000 people in North Carolina were without power as of Sunday morning. More than 80,000 were without power in South Carolina.",Up to a foot of snow is expected to fall across the southern Appalachians and nearby foothills in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","Albuquerque woke up to a blanket of snow that prompted school closures and traffic delays across New Mexico. (Feb. 19)
 USA TODAY
A winter storm expected to batter every state east of the Mississippi River pushed east early Wednesday, bringing snow, ice, school cancellations and vehicle restrictions.  
While the Central Plains was set to see the bulk of its snow in the overnight hours, cities including Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and Washington should get the worst of the storm on Wednesday, AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Edwards said. The winter storm is expected to end Thursday.
""Significant ice threat is also expected across the spine of the Appalachian Mountains all the way from far southwestern North Carolina up and through Pennsylvania and into parts of far southern New York,"" Edwards said. ""Ice secretion of over a half-inch can be expected in parts of West Virginia and Virginia that can lead to downed power lines, tree branches falling down and very icy road conditions.""  
Both Minneapolis Public Schools and St. Paul Public Schools cancelled classes and activities Wednesday, anticipating an inch of snow per hour during the morning commute. Officials scheduled vehicle restrictions on Pennsylvania highways early Wednesday, urging people to monitor snow and ice. 
A quarter-inch of ice weighed down branches and power lines in Boone County, Arkansas, knocking out power for 2,000 households on Tuesday night. Car accidents and road closures occurred throughout Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa on Tuesday night, AccuWeather said.
More than 1,200 flights had already been cancelled Wednesday, flight tracking service FlightAware counted as of 2 a.m. EST. 
Its snowing again. You know the drill. We say roads are getting slick, tell you to stay home, most of you do, some of you cant, some of you like to slide around to pick up Cheetos at the gas station. It is what it is.

Scott Dance,"An inch or two of snow and a glaze of ice are forecast across Maryland from Thursday night into Friday morning, especially to the west of the Interstate 95 corridor.
And then meteorologists are still watching a chance for heavy snow, or heavy rain, over the weekend.
A low-pressure system is forecast to move in from the west and pass quickly through Maryland overnight Thursday into Friday.
At first, the air is likely to be cold enough to produce snow, with temperatures forecast in the upper 20s. But then a layer of warmer air is forecast to creep in overhead, possibly turning the precipitation to a wintry mix by daybreak.
The National Weather Service predicts an inch or less of snow along the Interstate 95 corridor, and 1 inch to 2 inches at higher elevations to the north and west, including much of Harford, Baltimore, Howard and Carroll counties. Then, a few hundredths of an inch of ice is forecast across the region.
After that, forecasters eyes are on a more potent storm system likely to move up from the southwest Saturday. It is expected to pull in abundant cold air from Arctic high pressure moving down from the north, and a flow of Gulf of Mexico moisture from the south.
On Tuesday, it appeared the storm may track along the Appalachians, which would put Central Maryland on the warm side and produce an inch or two of rain. But it was still possible that the system could track farther south, putting the region on the colder side and bringing heavy snow.
Its too early to tell which type of precipitation will be dominant in the Baltimore region, weather service forecasters said.
AccuWeather meteorologists predicted a wintry mix for Maryland, as a surge of warm air from the Atlantic counteracts the cold coming from the north. But they said travel could nonetheless be treacherous along the I-95 corridor into the Northeast.
After that, bitterly cold air is forecast to move in across the eastern United States. Weather service forecasters said it could potentially drop wind chills below zero next week.
Love winter weather? We've compiled an array of photos from our archives of winter in Baltimore and beyond. You'll find pictures of an icy Chesapeake Bay, a snowy Ocean City, people engaging in winter-weather sports, kids sledding and frolicking in the snow, gorgeous scenes that look like paintings, and more.

Associated Press,"(DETROIT) — People throughout parts of the Midwest woke Saturday to a heavy and steady snowfall that forced the cancellation of hundreds of airline flights and made driving dangerous.
More than 460 flights were canceled Saturday morning at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport in Chicago and about 50 flights were canceled at Chicago’s Midway International Airport. In the Detroit area, many motorists were moving well below posted speed limits along freeways due to slushy conditions.
The snowfall is part of a wall of hazardous weather that trekked from the Dakotas and across the Great Lakes states, headed toward New England. The National Weather Service has warned that conditions in the Northeast “could approach blizzard criteria.” Some areas in the storm’s path saw ice instead of snow.
The storm was forecast to bring between up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow to the Midwest before walloping the Northeast on Sunday, where it could dump up to 2 feet (0.61 meters) of snow.
Amtrak canceled some trains Saturday from Chicago to Washington and New York and between New York and Boston and Pennsylvania on Sunday.
Chicago was forecast to receive as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) and wind gusts in the Chicago area are expected to reach 35 mph (56 kph).
In Nebraska, authorities closed Omaha’s Eppley Airfield on Friday afternoon after a Southwest Airlines plane slid off an ice-slicked runway. No one was injured.
The National Weather Service in Albany, New York, said snow could fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.5 centimeters) an hour, creating “difficult to impossible travel conditions” in areas.
The storm prompted the cancellation of a Special Olympics competition in upstate New York. Nearly 200 athletes from around New York state were expected to compete in snowshoeing, snowboarding, cross country, and Nordic and Alpine skiing at West Mountain, just outside Glens Falls.
In New York City, the worst of the storm was expected from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon, with snow accumulations of 3-6 inches (7.5-15 centimeters), followed by rain that could turn to ice as temperatures drop later Sunday. Single-digit temperatures could last into Monday. Strong wind gusts beginning Sunday afternoon could bring down snow- or ice-burdened tree limbs and power lines.
Bitterly cold air was expected in the storm’s aftermath.

Rachel Reeves,"As frigid air plunges into and builds over the central United States, a stormy pattern with snow, ice and rain may unfold from Texas to Maine for Christmas holiday travelers. During a typical winter, this weather pattern can bring a storm and travel concerns once every five to seven days. However, with the pattern anticipated from Dec. 21 to Dec. 26, there is the potential for two storms that may be disruptive to travel in areas from the Rockies and southern Plains to the Midwest and Northeast states. ""The key to which areas stand the best chance of snow and/or ice will depend on how far to the south and east frigid air pushes out from the North Central states,"" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Mike Doll. The first storm and its snow will primarily be a concern from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest later this week.

REUTERS/Brandon Wade In the wake of this storm, colder air may settle from parts of the southern Plains to part of the Ohio Valley on Saturday, Dec. 23. Meanwhile, most areas along the Atlantic Seaboard can expect above-normal temperatures for late in the week. Since cold air will not be established in time for the arrival of precipitation in the East, most travelers in the Northeast will likely have to deal with delays associated with rain, fog and a low cloud ceiling around Saturday, Dec. 23. Some pockets of ice and snow are possible over parts of the northern Appalachians. ""We have concerns for a second storm to spring up in the south between Dec. 24 and Christmas Day,"" Doll said. How quickly the cold and the next storm move eastward will determine which areas might get snow and ice. One scenario brings the cold air eastward with the storm riding along the Northeast coast on Christmas Day. This would keep it generally dry across the Upper Midwest with areas of lake-effect snow. Snow and ice may be a concern for the Northeast. The second scenario has the storm and cold air moving eastward even more quickly. Should this be the case, the Midwest and Northeast would trend drier and colder, aside from traditional bands of lake-effect snow. In this scenario, some snow and ice may make another visit to parts of the Deep South on Christmas Eve as the storm quickly passes through.

Charles Q. Choi Live Science Contributor,"A gigantic solar storm hit Earth about 2,600 years ago, one about 10 times stronger than any solar storm recorded in the modern day, a new study finds.
These findings suggest that such explosions recur regularly in Earth's history, and could wreak havoc if they were to hit now, given how dependent the world has become on electricity.
The sun can bombard Earth with explosions of highly energetic particles known as solar proton events. These ""proton storms"" can endanger people and electronics both in space and in the air. [Top 10 Greatest Explosions Ever]
In addition, when a proton storm hits Earth's magnetosphere — the shell of electrically charged particles — it is trapped by Earth's magnetic field. When the solar storm causes a disturbance in our planet's magnetosphere, it's called a geomagnetic storm which can wreak devastation on power grids across the planet. For example, in 1989, a solar outburst blacked out the entire Canadian province of Quebec within seconds, damaging transformers as far away as New Jersey, and nearly shutting down U.S. power grids from the mid-Atlantic through the Pacific Northwest.
Scientists have analyzed proton storms for less than a century. As such, they may not have good estimates of how often extreme solar eruptions happen or how powerful they can actually get.
""Today, we have a lot of infrastructure that could be badly damaged, and we travel in air and space where we are much more exposed to high-energy radiation,"" senior study author Raimund Muscheler an environmental physicist at Lund University in Sweden, told Live Science.
The so-called Carrington Event of 1859 may have released about 10 times more energy than the one behind the Quebec blackout in 1989, making it the most powerful known geomagneticstorm,, according to a 2013 study from Lloyd's ofLondon.. Worse yet, the world has become far more dependent on electricity since the Carrington Event, and if a similarly powerful geomagnetic storm were to hit now, power outages might last weeks, months or even years as utilities struggle to replace key parts of power grids, the 2013 study found.
Now, researchers have found radioactive atoms trapped within ice in Greenland that suggest an enormous proton storm struck Earth in about 660 B.C., one that might dwarf the Carrington Event.
Previous research found that extreme proton storms can generate radioactive atoms of beryllium-10 , chlorine-36 and carbon-14 in the atmosphere. Evidence of such events is detectable in tree rings and ice cores, potentially giving scientists a way to investigate ancient solar activity.
The scientists examined ice from two core samples taken from Greenland. They noted a spike of radioactive beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 about 2,610 years ago. This matches prior work examining tree rings that suggested a spike of carbon-14 about the same time. [Photos: Craters Hidden Beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet]
Previous research detected two other ancient proton storms in a similar manner — one happened about A.D. 993-994, and the other about A.D. 774-775. The latter is the largest solar eruption known to date.
Regarding number of high-energy protons, the 660 B.C. and the A.D. 774-775 events are about 10 times larger than the strongest proton storm seen in the modern day, which occurred in 1956, Muscheler said. The A.D. 993-994 event was smaller than the other two ancient storms by about a factor of two to three, he added.
It remains unclear how these ancient proton storms compared with the Carrington Event, since estimates of the number of protons from the Carrington Event are very uncertain, Muscheler said. However, if these ancient solar outbursts ""were connected with a geomagnetic storm, I would assume that they would exceed the worst-case scenarios that are often based on Carrington-type events,"" he noted.
Although more research is needed to see how much damage such eruptions might inflict, this work suggests ""these enormous events are a recurring feature of the sun — we now have three big events during the past 3,000 years,"" Muscheler said. ""There might be more that we have not yet discovered.""
""We need to search systematically for these events in the environmental archives to get a good idea about the statistics — that is, the risks — for such events and also smaller events,"" Muscheler added. ""The challenge will be to find the smaller ones that probably still exceed anything we measured in recent decades.""
The scientists detailed their findings online today (March 11) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"cgaines@businessinsider.com (Cork Gaines), Cork Gaines","That island, which looks a little like a curling stone, produces every curling stone for the Olympics. Andrew Redington/Getty Images Curling stones in the Olympics all come from the tiny Scottish island of Ailsa Craig. The island is better known as the backdrop to Trump Turnberry, a golf course that has hosted the Open Championship four times. The formation of the island was a perfect storm that created unique granite that is both smooth enough to glide on ice and strong enough to withstand collisions with other heavy stones. Curling is the darling sport of the Winter Olympics. Every four years fans become transfixed by athletes that look like us sliding and curling 40-pound rocks down a 50-yard ice track with often laser-like precision. Those stones spend a lot of time banging into each other and yet they rarely break. It turns out that is due to where they come from, the tiny and unique Scottish island of Ailsa Craig, better known as the beautiful backdrop island for the Ailsa Course at Turnberry, the Scottish golf course owned by President Donald Trump. Turnberry has hosted the Open Championship four times, most recently in 2009. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images According to the BBC, the granite used in all curling stones comes from one of two places, the island of Ailsa Craig or a quarry in Wales. For the Olympics, all stones are made from the Ailsa Craig granite. The birth of the 220-acre island island was a bit of a perfect storm that led to something extremely rare — granite smooth enough to be predictable on ice and strong enough to withstand banging into other large and heavy stones. Michael Easter of Scientific American described what makes the stone so special: The stones' performance traces back to the island's formation about 60 million years ago. Ailsa Craig is a volcanic intrusion—a mass of magma that forced its way up between existing formations—explains John Faithfull, a geologist at the University of Glasgow. The magma then cooled relatively quickly to form granite, and the surrounding rock eroded away, ""leaving just the very resistant hard mass of Ailsa Craig poking up out of the water,"" Faithfull says. As the volcanic rock crystallized, it developed a strong, uniform surface. ""When magma cools quickly, it creates very small crystals. These ones interlocked, and chemical bonds developed between them,"" says Martin Gillespie, a geologist at the British Geological Survey. ""It also doesn't seem to have any microcracks,"" he says of the granite. This led to the formation of three types of granite on the island, two of which are used to make curling stones. Blue hone granite makes up the layer of the stone that glides on ice and common green granite is used for the middle layer that strikes other stones. ""The layer of rock that runs along the ice doesn't chip or absorb water, but most important, it's very predictable on ice — you know what your shots are going to do,"" U.S. women's team skipper Erika Brown told Scientific American. ""And the middle layer doesn't break when the stones collide.""","Andrew Redington/Getty Images Curling stones in the Olympics all come from the tiny Scottish island of Ailsa Craig.

Riley MacLeod,"Fortnites latest update brought scoped revolvers, brought back the ability to re-deploy gliders, and added new mysteries that players are already unravelling.
Patch 7.20 dropped this morning, a day after Fortnite development studio Epic announced that it would let players re-deploy their gliders, a contentious feature that was removed from the game in November. It turns out gliders werent the patchs biggest deals. There were some big surprises.
One of these is a mysterious ice orb thats appeared over Polar Peak. If you get close to the orb, your screen ices over and turns white. Its unclear what the orb will do, but players are already comparing the orb to Kevin, last seasons cube (including, of course, debating what to name it).
1 / 2
The other mysterious addition is a mound of ice on an island across from Happy Hamlet. The mound had a health bar. It started with roughly five billion health points and quickly ticked down. Attacking it dealt 50 damage. Players speculated that the mound would take days to fully melt, but they seemed to have taken matters into their own hands. When I went to explore the mound this afternoon it was gone, replaced by an impenetrable bunker.
Its hard to say what this all means. Fortnite previously introduced a bunker in Wailing Woods that fascinated players who couldnt enter it and which eventually led to a series of rifts. Its possible this new bunker will do the same. Dataminers have suggested the orb will be tied to an in-game ice storm, and some players speculate that it will wreak similar destruction as the cube or introduce enemies like the previous cube-related Fortnitemares event. Its likely well see more as Season 7 progresses or when Season 8 starts at the end of February.","Fortnite ’s latest update brought scoped revolvers, brought back the ability to re-deploy gliders, and added new mysteries that players are already unravelling.

Mark Kaufman,"Weve entered some profoundly unfamiliar planetary territory. Amid a backdrop of U.S. politicians still questioning whether the changing climate is attributable to humans (it is), it's quite likely that weve actually boosted Earth's carbon dioxide a potent greenhouse gas to the highest levels theyve been in some 15 million years. The number 15 million is dramatically higher than a statistic frequently cited by geologists and climate scientists: That today's carbon levels are the highest they've been on Earth in at least 800,000 years as there's irrefutable proof trapped in the planet's ancient ice. Though scientists emphasize that air bubbles preserved in ice are the gold carbon standard, there are less direct, though still quite reliable means to gauge Earth's long-ago carbon dioxide levels. These measurements, broadly called proxies, include the chemical make-up of long-dead plankton and the evidence stored in the breathing cells, or stomata, of ancient plants. Scientists have identified this 15 million number by measuring and re-measuring proxies all over the world. Ancient air stored in ice core bubbles. Image: nasa Its a good scientific documentation, but its an indirect measure, Michael Prather, a professor of earth system science at the University of California Irvine, said in an interview. And theres several lines of evidence, Prather, a lead author on UN climate reports, added, citing the carbon dioxide evidence in fossilized marine life. Its not just one persons crazy number. Direct measures of the air show carbon dioxide levels have recently hit 410 parts per million, or ppm, the highest-recorded number in human history. For the most part, carbon dioxide was below 400 ppm for the last 14 million years or so, Matthew Lachniet, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change There may have been a time, roughly 3 million years ago during an extremely warm period called the Pliocene Epoch when sea levels were between 16 and 131 feet higher than today when carbon concentrations could have approximated present levels. However, the concentration of CO2 currently in Earths atmosphere is higher or is nearly as high as it has been over any time period during the past 15 million years, Daniel Breecker, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences, said over email. The critical difference today, however, is that carbon emissions are expected to continue rising. With the unprecedented burning of fossil fuels, carbon accumulations will simply keep going up. Different proxies, like phytoplankton (red), give scientists a good range (blue background) of past atmospheric carbon dioxide estimates. Image: United Nations/Ipcc Of course, C02 concentrations arent stopping today, said Lachniet. Were probably going to blow through 550 to 600 ppm. Those sorts of high carbon concentrations haven't been experienced on Earth in well over 20 million years, noted Lachniet. That makes this conversation even more stark, he said. Some folks in the climate community, though, have even argued that todays climate has the highest concentration of total greenhouse gases when gases like methane (natural gas) and nitrous oxide are added to the mix in 20 million years. This idea, called the carbon dioxide equivalent has some support in the climate community, though a variety of climate scientists we reached out to werent aware of research supporting this 20 million-year claim. In the end, its not just the actual concentration of carbon dioxide that matters its how sensitive the planet ends up being to this dramatically rising carbon accumulation, noted Breecker. Already, Earth has proven quite sensitive Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius. Major consequences have already been regularly observed in Earths water cycle bringing greater odds of extremes in deluges and drought. The most easily-predicted results, record-breaking heat waves and historic wildfires, are manifesting globally, as well as more complex atmospheric changes. It [global warming] raises sea levels and makes storm surges worse, it makes the atmosphere wetter, leading to flooding from extreme rainfall, and warming ocean temperatures provide extra energy to tropical storms, climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in September. ""The polar ice is melting, in the ocean the Gulf Stream System is weakening, and in the atmosphere the jet stream is getting weird, Rahmstorf added. Unlike previous geologic epochs, the defining circumstance today isnt just notably high carbon in the air its how fast its all accumulating. The natural world both loads and removes carbon from the atmosphere over long periods of thousands to tens of thousands of years. For example, a warm period called the Eemian, which ended around 120,000 years ago, slowly melted a significant portion of Greenlands ice sheets even with profoundly lower carbon concentrations of around 280 ppm. But these days, the climate hasnt yet caught up. Were warming so fast that we havent even begun to let Greenland melt, noted UC Irvines Prather. Where civilization ultimately ends up, carbon-wise, is contingent upon how quickly global societies transition to clean energy, and generate electricity without a deep reliance on fossil fuels. I would argue what's really relevant is where we stabilize out, said Lachniet. Over the next hundred years we really set the next 10,000 years of climate history.","We’ve entered some profoundly unfamiliar planetary territory.

WIRECUTTER STAFF,"He also looked into battery-powered snow blowers (and tested models from Ego and Snow Joe.) Although he saw much to like, Wirecutter doesnt yet recommend any of them, finding them often underpowered and hard to maneuver: Unlike gas-powered models, which are self-propelled, battery-powered blowers make the operator do all the pushing. Battery-powered tools are also easy to care for just stash them out of the way in the off-season. Gas-powered machines need their tanks drained or treated with a fuel stabilizer before storage. If youre an urban apartment dweller, you probably dont have a driveway to shovel, but you probably do have drafts to deal with. Foam and V-channel (or tension seal) weather stripping helps to eliminate drafty windows while still allowing you to open the windows on warmer days; Lowes has a helpful how-to, and you can find the gear there, online or at any decent hardware store. Clear window-sealing tape or plastic sheeting is easier to install, but using one of those options means keeping your windows shut. If your doors are also drafty, install a door sweep. If you want to go further, Wirecutter has other advice on where to look for and how to deal with climate-control leaks. In the event a storm knocks out the power, youll be happier, safer and more comfortable if youve prepared. A flashlight is a must, and a headlamp is invaluable if you expect to be outdoors doing cleanup, as it keeps both hands free for work. LED lanterns are safer than candles. (And youll find other uses for lanterns, too theyre terrific at a campsite, for example. Collapsible models, like these from Suaoki, take up little room.) A USB battery pack (or power bank) can keep your phone charged, and the larger ones can keep tablets running for a few days, helping to stave off boredom for kids and adults alike. But if outages are a regular feature of your winter, a portable gas-powered generator can keep vital equipment such as a fridge or a medical device running. You should also have a plan for dealing with perishable foods. Even if youre not a beach-goer or tailgater, a hard cooler can help keep fruits and vegetables fresh for days in the event of a blackout. Have a few ice packs ready to go just store them in the back of the freezer, out of the way. (Be on the safe side and dont cook meat or fish that has gone unrefrigerated for more than a few hours.) For a deeper dive into everything you need if disaster strikes, check out Wirecutters guide to emergency preparedness. That guide recommends that people in hurricane territory keep a few heavy-duty plastic tarps on hand to temporarily seal damaged roofs. But tarps are also useful for anyone who has trees on their property, where falling boughs pose a constant threat to roofs especially in winter, when heavy snows can snap weak or dead branches. Even if no branches breach the roof, tarps are handy for post-storm cleanup: Just pile the detritus on and drag it en masse to where it needs to go.","Wirecutter has advice on snow shovels, snow blowers and emergency gear to get you ready before the snow flies.",2018-10-18T21:54:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","For a Safer, Easier Winter, Prep Your Home Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/smarter-living/wirecutter/for-a-safer-easier-winter-prep-your-home-now.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/smarter-living/18wcwinterize/18wcwinterize-facebookJumbo.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,ice storm,1

Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

ABC News,"A storm system is forming east of Florida on Wednesday, but already a mix of ice and snow has brought winter storm warnings to northern Florida and southern Georgia. The storm will move up the East Coast over the next two days, bringing plenty of headaches. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Parts of 15 states from Florida to Maine will see effects from this developing coastal storm. Winter storm watches, warnings and advisories have been issued from Florida to Maine. Winter storm warnings, watches and advisories stretch from Florida to Maine on Wednesday, Jan. 3, 2018. Snow and ice will fall in southern Georgia on Wednesday where some areas could see up to 4 to 6 inches of snow and up to half of an inch of ice. For northern Florida, at most 1 inch of snow is expected with a glaze of ice, mostly east of Tallahassee. Nevertheless, this is a major event for northern Florida, because they don’t have any snow removal equipment or salting trucks. The icy mix quickly moves out of Florida and Georgia by Wednesday evening and moves into the Carolinas where we are expecting 2 to 5 inches of snow. The storm will gain strength off the coast of the Carolinas on Wednesday evening. The storm system will begin to strengthen late Wednesday and move up the East Coast, spreading snow into the eastern mid-Atlantic states and southern New Jersey. By early Thursday morning, snow will cover Long Island and southern New England and will be heavy at times with winds gusting to 50 mph. The storm will bring snow to the East Coast on Thursday morning. The storm begins to move east of Cape Cod on Thursday during the late morning and into the afternoon. As it does so, it will undergo a rapid intensification, or as it’s called in meteorology, bombogenesis. Bombogenesis, or a storm bombing out, means the surface pressure of the storm will drop 24 millibars in 24 hours, or at the rate of 1 millibar per hour. This usually happens when a storm system moves over the warm waters of the western Atlantic and the Gulf Stream at the same time arctic cold air moves in behind from the west. The difference between the two air masses helps to strengthen the storm system. This type of storm system happens almost every year. The storm will ""bomb out"" and undergo a rapid intensification on Thursday evening over Cape Cod. Snowfall totals for the East Coast in the next 36 to 48 hours will span from an inch or two, up to the heaviest amounts in New England and eastern Long Island, where locally 1 foot of snow is possible. Some areas in eastern Maine could see up to 18 inches of snow. Heavy snow will fall in eastern New England, but 1 to 3 inches is likely along much of the East Coast. Cold weather enters Behind the storm, we are expecting the coldest air of the season for the Northeast. Frigid wind chills on Friday morning will reach all the way to the Gulf Coast and Florida once again. Brutal wind chills will enter the Midwest and Northeast following the winter storm.","A storm system is forming east of Florida on Wednesday, but already a mix of ice and snow has brought winter storm warnings to northern Florida and southern Georgia.

Carmela Fragomeni,"And there's much improvement afterwards.
""We're talking just a miserable week,"" Phillip says. ""All week, you are not going to see the sun.""
Worse, with all the freezing rain and strong winds, ice is likely to adhere to tree branches making them more likely to snap and if they hit wires carrying electricity, we can expect power outages, he said.
""The only good news is temperatures are not painfully cold,"" says Phillips.
Expect a temperature high on Tuesday of minus 1 C, but feeling like minus 12 with the wind chill in the morning.
Tuesday's expected storm follows already foul weather last week that created havoc and cancelled school for two days.
City of Hamilton road crews have been monitoring both road and weather conditions since Monday, and still has plenty of salt left to apply to icy surfaces.
The city has also already cancelled a Waterdown community meeting Tuesday evening because the storm warning is calling for icy conditions and freezing rain at the time of the event, which was to discuss planning and transportation studies.
Hamilton's school boards meanwhile, have already had three snow days this year in which they closed their schools for the day due to the weather. There were two consecutive days last week, with the third being on Jan. 29.
""This is the first time in recent memory that we've had to close for two days in a row because of weather,"" said Catholic board spokesperson Marnie Jadon.
The only time that the three days so far has been surpassed since 2011 was four cancelled school days in all of 2013.
There was only one cancelled school day in 2018.
Parents and students are to check the public board's website, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts by 6 a.m. Tuesday to find out if school is cancelled again. 
The Catholic board needs to be checked at 7 a.m., although it generally posts on its board and school websites by 6:30 a.m. regarding whether school is cancelled for the day.

Nancy Gaarder World-Herald staff writer,"Morning commuters in the Omaha area will come across some slick spots Friday morning, especially at intersections, after the region saw some light snow overnight.
The road conditions were much better than what drivers experienced Thursday in central Nebraska. A stretch of about 145 miles of Interstate 80 from roughly Grand Island to North Platte was closed for several hours Thursday while the storm howled and crews cleared crashes.
It reopened about 7:15 p.m. No severe injuries were reported.
The Nebraska Department of Roads reported Thursday evening that most of the roads in the central and northeast parts of the state were completely covered in ice and snow.

Miserably cold weather is forecast for Friday as temperatures remain locked in the teens and low 20s across the state and strong winds drive down wind chills.
Temperatures should rise a bit over the weekend before plunging again early in the week.
That means people should plan for a windy, cold New Years Eve. In Omaha, strong winds could drop wind chills into the single digits for the citys New Years Eve fireworks show.
Thursday, the Nebraska State Patrol helped more than 100 drivers who had trouble with the weather.
In western Kansas, a person was killed in a storm-related collision between a car and semitrailer truck on Interstate 70, according to WDAF-TV.
About 75 miles of I-70 was closed for hours because of the storm.
The storm similarly caused problems in the Dakotas and northern Minnesota.
Cliff Cole, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said the storm didnt produce the widespread high snow totals originally forecast.
For the most part, 5 to 6 inches of snow fell in western and northern Nebraska. Up to a foot of snow had been forecast.
North of Grand Island, there was a report of 8.5 inches in Greeley County, according to Jordan Thies, a meteorologist at the Hastings weather service office.
But strong winds gusting up to 55 mph were enough to pile up drifts between 1 and 3 feet high in some spots.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery. At least 30 people were killed, according to local authorities, when Michael plowed ashore as one of the fiercest hurricanes on record to strike the U.S. mainland, pulverizing a cluster of seaside towns along Florida’s northwestern Panhandle region. Seven days later search crews continued combing through the wreckage of demolished neighborhoods looking for any sign of additional victims in Panama City Beach, Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe, the communities closest to the storm’s landfall. Distribution of food and water to storm-stricken residents farther inland has been slowed by communication outages and storm-shattered roads blocked by toppled trees, power lines and other debris. Florida officials have not said how many people may be missing. Teams of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach more than 700 Florida residents reported unaccounted for by worried relatives and friends, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder. Most of that number, down from 2,100 people the group was trying to locate in the immediate aftermath of the storm, are from Panama City and many of them are elderly, disabled, impoverished or living alone, Marchetti said. He said the search had been hampered by spotty cell phone service in the devastated area, though authorities were making progress in restoring communications. High volumes of missing persons reports are not uncommon in the days following a natural disaster because so many survivors fail to check in with loved ones right away or lack the means to do so because of phone and power outages, authorities said. Nevertheless, at least 48,000 Florida residents in the 12 counties hardest hit by Hurricane Michael had registered for disaster assistance as of Wednesday with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA spokesman Ruben Brown told Reuters. That number represents about 7 percent of the population of the 12 counties designated by President Donald Trump’s federal disaster declaration as eligible for FEMA aid to individuals and households. Nearly a third, or more than 15,000 people, reported storm damage to their homes when they signed up with FEMA, though the full scope of property losses remained to be seen, Brown said. As of Wednesday, 286 families left homeless by the storm in Bay County, at the epicenter of the disaster, were approved for FEMA-furnished hotel vouchers, he said. Florida accounted for 20 of the known fatalities attributed to Hurricane Michael, with six more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of reports from county officials along the path of the storm. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were storm-related. As of Tuesday, FEMA had distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, Brown said. The state government was distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. Countless numbers of people in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.

Patrick Grafton-Green,"A map showing winds around Storm Eleanor as it approaches the British Isles. Earth Nullschool Storm Eleanor is due to hit Britain on Tuesday and Wednesday. Severe weather warnings are in place across the country. Coastal areas are at the most risk with high winds and high waves. This could lead to coastal flooding. Britain is set to be battered by winds of up to 80 mph as Storm Eleanor heads for the nation's shores, forecasters have warned The fifth named storm of the season will bring ""strong winds and heavy rain"" to the UK on Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to the Met Office. Several severe weather warnings have been issued across the country with disruption expected on roads and railways. Meanwhile coastal roads and properties along Britain's western and southern coasts are vulnerable to high waves throwing beach material onto sea fronts. Forecaster Greg Dewhurst told the Standard: ""We are going to experience wet and windy weather this evening which will worsen overnight as a low pressure system moves in from the Atlantic. ""Met Éireann have named this as Storm Eleanor, and it is likely to bring very strong winds and heavy rain, first to Ireland and Northern Ireland, and then the rest of the UK through into tomorrow. ""Tomorrow the storm will move out into the North Sea but throughout the country it will be windy with some showers. ""That will be the story for the rest of the week as more low pressure systems bring unsettled weather from the west."" The Environment Agency warned earlier that strong winds and high tides could bring coastal flooding from Tuesday until Thursday. Carol Holt, the Environment Agency's flood duty manager, said: ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast — take extreme care on coastal paths and promenades, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger trying to take 'storm selfies.' ""If you're travelling, please check your route before setting off and don't drive through flood water."" A yellow weather warning has been issued for between 6pm on Tuesday and 8am on Wednesday for north east and west England, northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. The warning predicts gales with gusts of 60mph to 70mph are likely while some western coastal areas have a chance of seeing gusts of up to 80mph. Mr Dewhurst added that next weekend could bring a return of colder conditions with a risk of frost, ice and wintry conditions. He added: ""We start to see changes over the weekend; it will be drier in the west and in the east quite cloudy with a risk of some showers and snow as the weekend goes on.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - The death toll from Hurricane Michael rose to at least 29 on Tuesday as crews scoured debris for hundreds of people reported missing in the Florida Panhandle, nearly a week after the storm flattened whole communities. Michael slammed into the northwest coastal strip of Floriday last Wednesday with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), unleashing a surge of seawater that demolished homes. One of the most powerful storms ever to hit the continental United States, it has killed 20 people in the Florida Panhandle, five in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of official reports. Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue, which had hundreds of volunteers on the ground, said he expects the death toll to rise as phone service is restored and roads are cleared. “For every one person we have made contact with, there are probably three we haven’t,” Marchetti said. Teams from the volunteer organization were searching for more than 1,135 people in Florida who lost contact with friends and family. Debris and downed trees and power lines have hampered access to stranded people but the group has said a number of its missing person reports resulted from widespread phone and power outages. Most of those missing are from Panama City and many are elderly, disabled, impoverished, or live alone, Marchetti said. “The hardest hit in disasters are generally our most vulnerable populations,” Marchetti said. In nearby Mexico Beach, another hard-hit coastal town on the Florida Panhandle where rescue workers were using dogs to look for bodies buried in debris, the number of people missing dropped to three on Tuesday, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday. “It’s miraculous if all we have is two fatalities,” said Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey. Nearly 190,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. CAMPING OUT Countless others in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage. “I’m staying out here to try to keep away looters, to try to save what I can save,” said Bernard Sutton, a 64-year-old cancer patient, who has been living out of a tent and broken-down minivan in rural Fountain, Florida. The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, according to Governor Rick Scott’s office. Water supply was restored to some residents in Panama City on Monday but Bay County officials said it was not yet safe to drink. “This type of living wears on you,” said Putnal, the Mexico Beach city councillor. “This is about my fifth day and I’m just not used to washing clothes in a tub with no washer and dryer and eating only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” Cellphone service returned to some storm-damaged areas on Tuesday, but many residents have expressed frustration at the slow recovery of wireless networks. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday called for wireless carriers to waive bills for customers affected by the storm and allow consumers to switch carriers without penalties.

ABC News,"The major storm system that brought flash flooding and a record-breaking blizzard is moving east Sunday morning. The storm will bring another round of severe weather for nearly the entire Southeast -- including several tornadoes -- and will spread more snow and ice from Minnesota to Maine through Monday. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Additionally, very heavy rain is heading to the Northeast for Monday morning when flooding is possible. So far there have been 18 reported tornadoes in five states across the South since the outbreak began. There have been over 290 reports of severe weather from Texas to Wisconsin to Alabama. The storm spreads from Minneapolis south to Pensacola, Florida, on Sunday morning. Heavy snow is still falling Sunday morning across parts of the upper Midwest with 1 to 2 inch per hour snowfall accumulation being reported. An icy mix is now extending across Michigan and into parts of New England. An ice storm warning has been issued for western New York state. In the South, a tornado watch remains in effect for parts of Florida, southern Georgia and southwest Alabama Sunday morning as a line of storm moves through that region. Very heavy rain is falling with this line of storms, including rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour. The radar is estimating that 7 to 10 inches of rain has fallen near Mobile, Alabama. Therefore, the flood risk continues this morning along parts of the Gulf Coast. Tornadoes pose a threat to the Southeast coast on Sunday. While the storms are losing their intensity, they will strengthen later Sunday as they head toward the Southeast coast. Storms are expected to be widespread from Florida to Virginia. A slight risk for severe weather has been issued from Miami to Roanoke, Virginia, with the threat being damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes. Damaging winds, hail and tornadoes are possible along the Southeast coast on Sunday. The tornado threat is locally enhanced in parts of the interior Carolinas and southern Virginia -- including Charlotte and Winston-Salem. A few tornadoes are likely in this highly populated area of the country and the impacts from severe storms could be notable. The Carolinas and Virginia will be most at risk for tornadoes on Sunday. The slow-moving nature of the storms will also re-ignite a flash flood risk across nearly the entire Southeast coast -- with rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour likely. Ice, rain in Northeast Dangerous blizzard conditions caused a travel nightmare in parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin on Saturday with multiple counties having to ban travel altogether due to whiteout conditions. Minnesota State Police reported on Saturday night there had been over 400 crashes, 738 spinouts and 16 jackknifed semis. The snow fell so fast on Saturday that motorists all over the region became stranded due to rapidly accumulating snow. With 13.7 inches of snow in Sioux Falls, it is now the snowiest April day on record, and also has pushed April 2018 into the snowiest April on record. Snow and ice pose a threat to the northern U.S. and Great Lakes on Sunday. The storm will move to the east Sunday and Monday spreading snow and ice from Minnesota to Maine. The heaviest snow will move into Wisconsin and Michigan on Sunday. On Sunday and early Monday, rounds of an icy mix are expected to stretch into parts of the interior Northeast. Sleet and freezing rain are expected from Buffalo to Boston. Travel will be treacherous in upstate New York -- especially near Buffalo and Syracuse -- due to icy roads. Icy roads are expected in parts of New England through Monday morning. Locally, half an inch of ice is expected. Heavy rain is likely in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City on Monday. On the warmer side of this system, heavy rain and isolated strong thunderstorms will move over the Appalachians on Sunday and could bring flash flooding from Pittsburgh to Asheville, North Carolina. Then on Monday morning, the heavy rain will hit New York City and Philadelphia. Localized flash flooding is possible. Some isolated gusty thunderstorms will also be possible with a line of storms from Washington, D.C. to New York late Sunday into Monday. Another temperature drop After reaching the upper 70s on Saturday and 80s on Friday, the wind chill in New York City on Sunday morning is 40 to 50 degrees colder. Wind chill readings will be 30 degrees colder on Monday morning than it was Saturday across the Northeast. Behind the major storm, temperatures are plummeting in yet another return to winter.

Drivers trying to get home from work and students trying to get home from school were stuck on roads that turned into parking lots as plows could not get through to clear up to 9 inches of snow that fell in parts of the area. Westchester County, New York, government tweeted on Thursday night that it had brined the Bronx River Parkway earlier in the day, but plows could not get through during the storm because heavy traffic limited the plows' speed, which they need to effectively move snow. ""It was the perfect storm to create a mess on the roads,"" the county said. ""We will immediately review with local governments what we must do better in the future."" The number of accidents quickly added up and caused gridlock on almost every major interstate and highway in New York. People took to social media to plead with local authorities to help, but everyone seemed helpless as the traffic nightmare snowballed out of control. Nov. 16: Early season winter blast creates hellish conditions for commuters Nov. 16: Al Roker apologizes for underestimating winter storm, draws mixed reactions Claudine Gandolfi tweeted that it took her two and a half hours to get from the Chester-Maple parking garage in White Plains to Central Avenue, which normally takes her six minutes. ""Cars were spinning out on level ground, getting stuck,"" she said, adding that school buses were still on Route 119 at 7:30 p.m. ""It was like driving on an ice rink."" New Jersey In New Jersey, commuters weren't shy about their anger. They took to all corners of the internet to tell their horror stories and place the blame squarely at the feet of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. ""The total lack of preparedness from the governors mansion on down left our state in a complete mess!"" said Jay Wanczyk, who spent more than seven hours on an NJ Transit bus from Pompton Plains to Manhattan. Traffic was in a standstill on Route 17 in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018. (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) The storm's impact on the Thursday evening commute was a setback for Murphy, whose administration has failed to improve deteriorating service on NJ Transit since he took office in January. In separate broadcast media appearances Thursday evening, Murphy sought to blame forecasters, saying the storm hit harder than expected. Predictions varied depending on the region, but initially had as much as 4 inches of snow falling on most of the region Thursday, with higher elevations north and west of Route 287 predicted to get more. Instead, some parts of New Jersey received 6 to 8 inches of snow, making it one of the largest totals ever for a single storm in November. Even so, commuters derided Murphy and state agencies for their lack of preparedness. That, combined with a storm perfectly timed with the evening commute, threw North Jersey highways into chaos. Hundreds of accidents were reported. Many drivers were stranded, running out of gas after hours on the road. Others spent hours behind the wheel on commutes that typically take minutes. Angry commuters Dianne Scott, who works in Hasbrouck Heights, reported that it took half an hour to get up the incline on the exit from Route 17 to Allendale. ""Traffic at a complete standstill for half an hour because of rear-wheel drive cars unable to make it up the slight incline heading east toward Allendale and getting stuck, completely blocking both lanes just after the underpass,"" she said in an email. Nov. 16: On a budget? Here are some tips for winter-proofing your car Nov. 15: Snow! Airlines cancel flights, waive change fees for winter storm Scott credited her boss with allowing her to leave the office early, as well as the actions of law enforcement. ""A shout-out to the police officer who went car-to-car to explain the situation and urge those who probably would also get stuck to stay to the right so those of us with 4WD could squeeze left around the stuck vehicles,"" she said. Trevor Fennell said it took two and a half hours to get from Oakland to Ridgewood, which are less than 10 miles apart. ""Everyone knew it was going to snow,"" Fennell said. ""Didnt see one plow."" Last Slide Next Slide Mark Flores said he'd give officials an ""F"" for their preparedness. Flores said it took him three and a half hours to get from Hudson County to New Milford in Bergen County. ""I have driven in blizzard like conditions and the roads were not as bad as they were today,"" Flores wrote in an email. ""Where were the plows and salters?"" John Anderson of Waldwick said he left work at the courthouse in Newark at 3 p.m. It took him three hours just to get to the Garden State Parkway. Nov. 15: 7 dead as potent pre-winter storm moves from South and Midwest toward East Coast The road had been plowed until his exit at Route 17. There, he and four others got stuck. ""Together, we dug each other out without complaint and in solidarity over how the powers that be, dropped the ball,"" Anderson said. He finally arrived home to his wife and kids, six hours later. Some commuters hadn't even made it home. Irfam Kirimca was trying to get across the George Washington Bridge from New York to New Jersey. But Kirimca had been stuck for five and a half hours on the Deegan Expressway. And conservation of fuel trumped concerns about the cold weather. ""I keep checking the traffic reports and the GW Twitter feed and there is no information as to why were not moving,"" Kirimca wrote in an email. ""Also, Im low on gas so I had to shut my car off."" Last Slide Next Slide In and out of NYC Getting out of midtown Manhattan was a particular struggle. As the snow accumulated quickly through the afternoon, commuters backed up at the Port Authority Bus Terminal to the point where it had to essentially shut down. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey advised commuters to use NJ Transit trains to get home from Manhattan, but soon New York's Penn Station backed up, too. While the bus terminal passengers fared the worst, with delays of up to three hours, Penn Station passengers had little comfort, with delays of 30 to 60 to minutes. There were 30-minute delays on all Metro-North train lines in New York. One woman 65-year-old Jeanne McGettigan was stuck at the Tarrytown train station for more than an hour with a dying phone. ""There are about 100 people just milling about the train station. They jump at every ride they can get,"" she said. ""But no one seems to care that we're stranded here... No one is considerate enough to tell us what's going on or what to do."" NJ Transit buses are having trouble accessing PABT due to weather. No estimate of when normal service will resume. All NJT bus passengers should use rail or ferries as alternatives. — PortAuthBusTerminal (@PABusTerminal) November 16, 2018 Murphy's response Murphy admitted in a radio interview that the storm caught state officials off guard. ""If youre inside, stay inside. If youre on the road, please be safe. And were all going to need some patience tonight. Were getting clobbered. This is a lot deeper, its lasting longer, and its taxing all of the systems,"" he told WINS-AM. Even Murphy's predecessor, Chris Christie, weighed in on the debacle. Christie, who lives in Mendham, tweeted that it took him five hours and 40 minutes to get home from Piscataway. The towns are about 30 miles apart. But Christie had his own problems with snow storms at the beginning of his tenure. In December 2010, when he took his family to Disney World just as a blizzard paralyzed the state, Christie came under sharp criticism, and tried to deflect blame by suggesting county road crews dropped the ball. And while he got high marks for handling Superstorm Sandy, Christie also was infamous for how he handled flooding in South Jersey years later during his bid to be a presidential nominee.

The front of that brought snow all the way down to South Texas and Louisiana, with a band of snow extending all the way into New England — pressing to the east tonight. necn Weather Team: Timeline, Projections for Wednesday's Snowstorm New low pressure is developing off the coast of Virginia and there is an energy transfer happening now from the front in Northern New England to the coastal low south of Cape Cod. A minor gap between these two systems is falling in over Massachusetts right now. Trying to time at all, it looks like a 12-hour storm from about midnight to noon far west, from about 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the state of Maine. In Boston, it's 3 a.m. to 3 p.m., but the heart of the system is right during this morning's commute, heavy snow from 7 to 9 a.m. Bands of snow may reach 1 inch or greater per hour for a couple of hours. Snow is going to change to rain quickly along the south coast, that rain-snow line will progress right into Boston by mid-morning. Near the rain-snow line, about 3 or 4 inches are expected near Boston. It's along and just north of that line where the heaviest and wettest snow falls, making it the most difficult to remove. To the north, snow amounts may be a little higher in the order of 5 to 8 inches, but it's a drier and easier snow to deal with. With low pressure being weak and tracking right over southeastern New England, we do not expect a lot of wind with the system.

Weak high pressure will move in with sunshine for most of us tomorrow, with temperatures close to freezing. A weak area of low pressure comes over on Friday, but we expect it to be dry, with a mixture of sun and clouds as temperatures start to moderate, high in the 30s. Though there is a challenge to the weekend forecast we think a front should stay north of New England, perhaps bisecting northern Maine, and we should mostly be on the mild and dry side of this front.

Rebecca Hersher,"A satellite image from Wednesday morning shows a powerful storm system heading east across the U.S. The storm is expected to bring high winds, snow and rain to much of the central U.S. in the coming days.
GOES-East/NOAA
When a storm gets very intense very quickly, it gets a very special, very scary name: bomb cyclone.
And just such a storm has arrived in the central U.S.
The powerful system is already bringing high winds, rain and snow to an enormous chunk of the country, including the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region. The National Weather Service has issued high wind and winter storm advisories for an area ranging from Colorado and New Mexico over to Nebraska and parts of Texas, and up to South Dakota.
""This will be one of the strongest wind events in years for West Texas and Southeast New Mexico,"" warned the National Weather Service office in Midland, Texas, with gusts up to 75 miles per hour on Wednesday.
Winds that powerful can make it impossible to drive safely, especially in tall vehicles such as trucks.
The storm could also cause flooding, as rain falls on accumulated snow and rivers clogged with ice begin to rise. Unlike wind, flood risk can last days or even weeks as rivers crest.
On Wednesday morning, some roads were already flooded in the northeastern part of Nebraska, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning, saying more rain is expected later in the day.
In the Denver area, blowing snow could cause dangerous blizzard conditions. On Twitter, the weather service warned residents to ""cancel any travel plans Wednesday afternoon and evening."" Colorado Public Radio reports that the storm could be the most intense storm ever recorded in the area, with the barometric pressure dropping a walloping 23 millibars in just one day.
Barometric pressure is the pressure of the air in the atmosphere, and it changes when the weather changes. A drop in the barometric pressure generally accompanies ""bad weather"": wind, thunder, snow and rain.
When the barometric pressure drops a lot over a short period of time, the bad weather is especially severe. As NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee reported during one of last year's bomb cyclones, this can happen when masses of cold and warm air collide:
""That's where the word 'bomb' comes in, says Jeff Weber, a climatologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 'We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone.' The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic midlatitude cyclone.""
A bomb cyclone on the East Coast around this time last year killed multiple people, shut down train and plane service and knocked out power to about 2 million people.
Scientists are still studying how bomb cyclones in recent years are, or aren't, affected by the larger trend of global climate change. The increasingly wide undulations of the jet stream the wind highway that blows from west to east around the Northern Hemisphere has allowed for more extreme temperature fluctuations in the continental U.S. And sea surface temperatures, which have been steadily rising, also affect the intensity of storms.
But, says climate scientist Jonathan Martin of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ""There isn't a direct link between the slowly changing climate and this event."" 
Although this storm is ""rather unusually intense,"" he notes, ""these things come around every few years.""","The storm is bringing high winds, snow, rain and dangerous road conditions. Meteorologists and local officials are warning people across the West and Midwest to cancel travel plans.",2019-03-13T16:28:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",A 'Bomb Cyclone' Is Thwacking The Central U.S.,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/702946797/a-bomb-cyclone-is-thwacking-the-central-u-s,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/13/20190721332_goes16-abi-conus-geocolor-1250x750_wide-303e63d7e0bb4920aefc4c5c0c6d443b4648eadb.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,ice storm,1
Andrea Thompson,"As storms go, the one that struck northwest Alaska in mid-November was not remarkable. Its pressure was not particularly low, nor its 30-mile-per-hour winds particularly strong. Still, it sent several feet of rough seas surging into the beleaguered coastal communities that dot Alaska’s northern and western shores. In Deering, a village of 126 people perched on a sandy spit on the northern coast of the Seward Peninsula, the tempestuous waters eroded some 10 to 20 feet of beach, according to local news reports. Such run-of-the-mill storms are eating away Alaska’s shores—which account for over 50 percent of the entire U.S. coastline—as the state’s protective shield of sea ice disappears. Storms that meteorologists and locals would have barely noted 30 years ago now crumble off land in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts fashion. “It’s the slow grind of erosion,” says Rick Thoman, climate science and services manager of the National Weather Service’s Alaska region. “That slow grind over time really has the big impacts.” Several decades ago the sea ice that clung to the state’s shore during fall and winter naturally absorbed some of the energy of storm waves, and gave winds less room to build up significant surge and waves. Now autumn sea ice levels have dropped precipitously, and coastal sea ice forms about a month later than it did when satellites began routinely monitoring sea ice levels in 1979. This leaves the coast more exposed during fall, the prime storm season. Over the last few decades, the wave energy that reaches Alaska’s shores has more than doubled along the north coast, according to Irina Overeem, a research scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. While big storms—such as the 2011 Bering Sea superstorm—garner the most attention, many of the storms hitting Alaska’s coast are like the one in mid-November, Thoman says. Without the sea ice, even ordinary storm waves surge farther ashore with more power, sweeping sand and other sediment back into the sea. Where permafrost is more prevalent, warmer ocean waters cause melt and waves help wash cliffs of once-frozen soil into the sea. “The coast is unprotected,” says Jacquelyn Overbeck, the coastal hazards program manager with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. Erosion from storms has become a major issue for coastal communities such as Shishmaref, Kivalina and Kotzebue. “People who live on the coast of Alaska are very keen observers of their environment,” and have long recognized the looming threat, Overbeck says. The scientific world took longer to notice, in part because of the relative dearth of data from such a remote region. There is no systematic record of ordinary storms hitting the coast, Thoman notes. Scientists could potentially cobble one together from newspaper archives, but it would be a time-consuming task. Other records, such as tide gauges—which provide a record of how high waters get during storms—are also lacking compared to the contiguous U.S. Despite the state’s vast size, there are only three tide gauges along the western coast of Alaska and only one along the northern coast, and their records do not go nearly as far back in time. “Our data systems are so far behind the rest of the Lower 48, we’re still trying to play catch-up,” Overbeck says. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) has been compiling what erosion data are available from high-altitude photography and remote sensing along the U.S. coastline. Comparing images from the 1940s to the early 2000s, they found that most of Alaska’s north coast is eroding at an average of about 1.5 meters per year. (A similar report is in the works for the state’s west coast.) And that degradation of the shoreline seems to be accelerating—a 2007 study found coastal erosion had doubled between 1955 and 2005 along part of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The USGS hesitates to link this trend to global warming because data are sparse and do not extend far back in time. But, Overeem says, “I think we can firmly tie it into climate change” due to declining sea ice which has left the coast exposed to even ordinary storms. In the future, damage from these storms will likely expand farther north and extend later into autumn as warming continues to melt the shield of ice around the shore. More observations are needed to better understand how Alaska’s coastline will evolve, including tidal data and better maps of the ocean floor along the coast. Overbeck visited 17 remote Alaskan communities this summer to install erosion monitors that local residents will maintain. Such data will improve forecasts that will help communities decide whether they need to relocate—and how far inland they might have to go to be safe from the ravages of the sea. It will also help secure relief funds for storms that lack the headline power of a Sandy or a Harvey. “In Alaska, we have a lot of storms with no names, so they may never get the same attention,” Overbeck says. “But they’re impacting Americans just the same.”",Ordinary storms are chipping away at coastal communities as protective sea ice disappears -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2017-11-30T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Alaska's Coast Is Vanishing One Storm at a Time,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alaskas-coast-is-vanishing-one-storm-at-a-time/,https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/3AC1431E-CF2E-4785-ADB4024222ECD7D2_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,ice storm,1
Associated Press,"(SAVANNAH, Ga.) — Three cars on an Amtrak train carrying more than 300 passengers on a route from Miami to New York derailed in snow-covered Savannah after a fierce winter storm, but no injuries were reported. Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said Silver Meteor train 98 was backing slowly into the Savannah station about 10 p.m. Wednesday — hours after the storm clobbered the Southeast coast — when two sleeper cars and a baggage car derailed. “All three cars — a baggage car and two sleeper cars — are fully upright,” Abrams said in an email statement early Thursday to The Associated Press. He said there were 311 passengers on board, in addition to crew, but he had no reports of anyone hurt. Abrams’ statement said the main train was to continue its journey north though some of the sleeping car passengers had to be put aboard a different train. He didn’t say what caused the derailment, and the statement also gave no immediate indication whether the storm that coated Savannah with a rare snowfall on Wednesday was a factor. The National Weather Service said Savannah’s first measurable snowfall since February 2010 was recorded Wednesday in the normally balmy Southern City at 1.2 inches (3 centimeters). It was the first snow in Savannah that exceeded an inch (2.5 centimeters) in 28 years. The fast-intensifying storm on Thursday had moved further up the East Coast. News footage from the site showed police and other emergency vehicles with flashing lights crunching over snow and ice and converging near tracks where the derailment occurred. Passenger Joel Potischman told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he boarded the train early in the day in Delray Beach, Fla., to head home to Brooklyn, New York. He said the train was en route north amid winter scenes of snow and ice. Another passenger, Mike Zevon, told the newspaper that it was the last three cars that derailed. Abrams’ statement didn’t elaborate on how many cars were in the formation and conditions with the weather or the tracks at the time.",The train was pulling into Savannah hours after the storm clobbered the Southeast,2018-01-04T14:19:29Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Amtrak Train With 300 Passengers Derails in Georgia Amid Winter Storm Grayson,http://time.com/5087552/amtrak-train-georgia-derail/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/amtrak-engineer-conductor-rock-accident-distracted.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,ice storm,1

The band of snow will continue to sweep eastward and create slippery travel for a time over Michigan and surrounding areas on Monday night and Tuesday. This snow will graze Chicago and Detroit. The worst of the snowstorm will be over by Tuesday. However, there can still be pocket of heavier snow that may lead to minor travel disruptions across the north-central U.S. See images of storms in the U.S. this year: CHICAGO, USA - JANUARY 20: A view of the frozen trees and ornamentals at Whihala Beach Park with the impact of surges and extremely cold weather in Chicago, Illionis, United States on January 20, 2018.

The southern portion of the nation's midsection will avoid snowy conditions but may face other hazards from the storm. ""While the snow falls to the north, winds strong enough to cause power outages and overturn high-profile vehicles along I-80 and I-70 will gradually sweep southward across the central Plains Monday into Tuesday,"" Pydynowski said. If any wildfires ignite to end the weekend, the winds would create issues for firefighting efforts. Calmer conditions are expected to return at midweek as the storm restrengthens along the Northeast coast, causing residents to face more power outages and travel disruptions.

ART CULLEN,"Storm Lake resident Carol Huntzicker, a former chairwoman of the Buena Vista County Republican Party, says she still prefers Mr. King. She said she couldnt believe how many commentators and politicians have accused Mr. King of harboring racial animosity.
Ive known King, his son and his family for a very long time, she said. I know he doesnt feel the way the media says he does. Sometimes, you cant trust everything publications say about him.
Ms. Huntzicker harbors no ill will against Mr. Feenstra, but she sees no reason Mr. King shouldnt continue being the Fourth Districts congressman. Shes seen him at events in every election cycle, and at each visit hes been calm and a willing listener. She highlighted his appearance at a benefit for the countys Republican Party chairman, Randy Ericksen, who had a stroke in 2018.
Hes just so kind and cheerful every time I see him, she said. And Ive seen him do great things for people for people I know.
Mr. Mosbo said, When Steve had a town-hall meeting at the library in Sioux Rapids he showed us the key fob given to him by a Guatemalan family from Sioux City that Steve and his wife helped. The man has a heart for immigrants, contrary to what many in the media portray him to be.
Mr. King insists he is being attacked for speaking the truth. He blasted Mr. Feenstra for disloyalty. At 69 he sounds very much as if he is running, with or without any committee assignment. Given my little focus group, Mr. Feenstra had better be ready to bring it.
None of my friends who voted for Mr. King 60-something men in Carhartt camo discuss his views on race. They are afraid that Democrats will go after their guns. They hate taxes. And what they really wonder about is why the ice fishing is so lousy. You would think they will never catch another perch. Randy Feenstra? Never heard of him. Would you vote for Mr. King again?

Jeff Baenen and Rick Callahan / AP,"(MINNEAPOLIS) — A deadly storm system churning through the central U.S. has blanketed parts of the Upper Midwest in heavy snow and ice and battered areas farther south with powerful winds and even tornadoes. About 200 flights were cancelled Sunday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where two runways were open but nearly 13 inches of snow combined with strong winds were making it difficult to keep the runways open and the planes de-iced, spokesman Patrick Hogan said. On Saturday, the storm caused the cancellation of nearly 470 flights at the airport. The wintry grip on the Twin Cities continued to keep the boys of summer off the diamond, forcing the postponement of the third straight Twins-White Sox game. The Yankees and Tigers were rained out Saturday in Detroit and had planned to play a double-header on Sunday, but the first game of Sunday’s twin bill was also postponed, leaving just the night game. Two northeastern Wisconsin communities, Tigerton and Big Falls, received more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow over the weekend, the National Weather Service in Green Bay reported. Parts of the state that were already blanketed were getting a second helping of snow on Sunday. The storm finally let up in South Dakota, allowing the airport in the state’s largest city, Sioux Falls, to reopen for the first time since Thursday. Interstates 90 and 29 in parts of eastern South Dakota also reopened, and no-travel advisories were lifted across the state border in southwestern Minnesota. The weather service predicted that a large swath of southern Minnesota, including the Twin Cities, could get up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimeters) by the time the storm moves eastward into New England. Keith White, a weather service meteorologist in Marquette, Michigan, said moderate to heavy snow was falling Sunday morning in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. He said more than a foot was possible by early Monday in the communities of Ishpeming and Negaunee, west of Marquette. Powerful winds knocked out power to thousands of customers in Michigan, which was expected to get more snow and ice throughout the weekend. The weather service also warned of potential coastal flooding along Lake Michigan in Wisconsin and Illinois, where Chicago residents were warned that waves could reach as high as 18 feet (5.5 meters). There have been three deaths blamed on the storm system, which stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. A sleeping 2-year-old girl in Louisiana was killed when a tree fell on her family’s recreational vehicle early Saturday. A Wisconsin woman was killed when she lost control of her minivan on slick roads and veered into an oncoming SUV. And an Idaho truck driver was killed when his semitrailer struck a semi in western Nebraska that had been stranded on a highway by the bad weather. In Arkansas, a tornado ripped through the tiny Ozark Mountain town of Mountainburg on Friday, injuring at least four people. Video showed uprooted trees, overturned cars, damaged buildings and downed power lines. Powerful winds also damaged several buildings at the University of Central Arkansas, though no injuries were reported there. The storm made its mark in Texas, where hail the size of hen eggs fell south of Dallas, according to meteorologist Patricia Sanchez. In Austin, fire officials said strong winds helped spread the flames after lightning struck and badly damaged two houses.",The storms have slammed parts of the Upper Midwest,2018-04-15T18:28:57Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Spring Storm Blankets Parts of Midwest in Snow and Ice, Resulting in Canceled Flights",http://time.com/5240900/spring-storms-midwest/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/winter-storms-travel.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,ice storm,1

Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Up to 9 inches of snow fell in parts of the Great Plains and western Great Lakes yesterday as the large storm system moved east. Visibility was close to zero at times in some parts of the region. Alerts are in place for much of the eastern U.S. on Friday with storms moving east. The rain is changing to ice and snow Friday morning from northern Louisiana to Memphis, and Indianapolis to Detroit. Major issues are expected on the fast-freezing roads. Schools already announced they will be closed in the city of Memphis on Friday. By rush hour on Friday afternoon, the storm system will be moving into the I-95 corridor with very heavy rain -- including 1 to 3 inches possible locally. This could create flooding on roadways, creeks and ponds. Behind the storm, snow and ice will stretch from Nashville to Cincinnati and into western Pennsylvania and New York state. Snow will begin moving out of the Midwest overnight into the weekend. The rain will begin to change to snow and ice by Saturday morning as the colder air wraps around the storm further east, getting close to the more-populated I-95 corridor. Some icy roads are possible close to New York City and Boston. Rain, snow and an icy mix will cover the Northeast on Saturday morning. Ice and snow accumulations for the eastern U.S. could include as much as a foot of snow for western New York and New England. Icy accumulations will be up to half an inch from Pennsylvania into New England. Locally 2 to 4 inches of snow is possible for the Ohio Valley with a glaze of ice possible as well. Snow and ice will bring treacherous conditions to the Great Lakes and Midwest. Temperatures tumble A major temperature tumble is forecast following the storm system. Ahead of the storm, temperatures will be near record highs on the East Coast -- in the 50s and close to 60 degrees from Washington, D.C. to Boston. Temperatures on Friday in the Northeast will feel more like spring than winter. Behind the storm, temperatures will drop 30 degrees into the teens and single digits in the Northeast with wind chills below zero by Saturday night into Sunday morning.

Barbara Goldberg,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Plunging temperatures after a wet winter storm dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of the U.S. Northeast were expected to flash freeze much of the region on Sunday and make travel dicey during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday. 
“Any water that remains on the road will freeze into a sheet of ice and make conditions quite hazardous,” said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS). 
Sub-zero temperatures tied to gusting winds prompted the NWS to issue wind chill advisories and warnings for more than 10 states, from North Dakota and other parts of the central United States to East Coast metropolitan centers including Washington, New York and Boston. 
It will be a roller-coaster ride for temperatures, with Sunday’s warm start melting overnight snow and threatening flooding in areas including southeastern Massachusetts. By evening, temperatures were expected to dive into a dangerous flash freeze. 
High temperatures for Monday are forecast at 17 Fahrenheit (minus 8 Celsius) for New York City, and 12 F (minus 11 C) for Boston. 
“Behind this winter storm is a lot of cold air that has been dropping south from Canada,” said Otto by telephone from College Park, Maryland. “You combine that with winds gusting between 20 and 30 miles an hour and you have pretty dangerous windchills of 10 to 30 below zero.” 
The storm has already dropped heavy snow in Pennsylvania, although the deepest amount reported was 16 inches (41 cm) in the northern New York town of Lake Desolation, he said. It was headed for Maine, where it was expected to lay a white carpet up to 2 feet deep. 
While the mercury will dive in the Northeast, forecasters say it is unlikely to fall below the storm’s current low of minus 46 Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) recorded in Cotton, Minnesota. 
The wintry weather has contributed to travel disruption across the United States during a busy holiday weekend, with 1,458 flight cancellations and 989 flight delays by mid-morning on Sunday, according to FlightAware.com. 
Amtrak canceled or modified its Sunday train service from Boston to Washington and between Chicago and the East Coast.

Andrew Freedman,"In Boston, officials planning annual First Night festivities don't have to worry about melting ice sculptures this year. In fact, with air temperatures tumbling toward the single digits on Sunday night, New Year's Eve is going to be so dangerously cold that event organizers have canceled all but the fireworks display. In New York City, the ball drop in Times Square will take place amid the coldest weather since about 1962, when the temperature at midnight was a measly 1 degree Fahrenheit. The forecast air temperature at midnight is just 10 degrees above zero, with a wind chill of minus-5 to minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit. This will create dangerously cold conditions for anyone venturing out to celebrate the New Year.

SEE ALSO: Record cold in the U.S. and Canada has no end in sight — a running list of the records so far The cold isn't just disrupting New Year's Eve events in the Northeast, either. The National Weather Service has hoisted cold temperature alerts of some sort, such as wind chill advisories, for 33 states in the lower 48, from Montana to northern Alabama and northeastward to Maine. Alaska climatologist Brian Brettschneider calculated that the eastern half of the U.S. is likely to experience its coldest New Year's in at least 70 years.

Wind chills that low could lead to frostbite on exposed skin in 10 minutes or less. The unusually prolonged Arctic outbreak has already set dozens of records for overnight low temperatures and the coldest daytime highs on record. Many locations in the East appear set to break records for the coldest New Year's Day on record, with high temperatures struggling to climb above 10 degrees Fahrenheit in Boston, for example. Boston and New York City are in the running to break cold duration records, with the most straight days below 20 degrees Fahrenheit in Boston, and largest number of days below freezing in New York City. The U.S. is currently home to the most unusually cold air of anywhere on Earth, with much of the rest of the planet experiencing milder-than-average conditions for this time of year. The frigid weather is the product of a highly amplified, or wavy, jet stream. Height anomalies projection for the coming week, showing persistent unusual cold (blue) across the East. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The jet stream, which is a highway of fast-moving air at high altitudes — about 35,000 feet — helps spin up and steer storms and separate air masses. Right now, the jet stream is flowing far to the north, over Alaska, and then plunging southward toward the Gulf Coast, allowing frigid air to ooze into the U.S. from the Arctic. This pattern is known as an Omega Block, since on a weather map it resembles the Greek letter Omega. Such patterns can be stubborn to dislodge, like a houseguest who says they'll be sticking around for a few days but ends up hanging out for weeks. Recent scientific research has suggested there may be links between melting Arctic sea ice from global warming and stuck, amplified weather patterns like this, particularly ones featuring northward deviations in the jet stream, or ridges, over the Northwest U.S. Sea ice extent is currently at an all-time low for this time of year. And the polar express is showing no signs of relaxing its grip on the U.S., either. An intense storm is likely to develop off the East Coast during the middle of the week, potentially slamming the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with heavy snow and high winds, though it may stay far enough out to sea to merely deal a glancing blow.

Mark Kaufman,"Earth's accelerated warming trend continued this August, as the sweltering month proved to be one of the hottest Augusts in recorded history. In fact, each of the last five Augusts are now the warmest since reliable record-keeping began nearly 140 years ago, in the early 1880s. August 2018 is officially the fifth-warmest, but nearly indistinguishable from 2014, 2015, and 2017. Both data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and that of other experts confirmed the warm, well above average temperatures. SEE ALSO: Earth is the warmest it's been in 120,000 years ""The data show that global warming continues relentlessly, as predicted already in the 1970s,"" climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said over email. The record-breaking rainfall we've seen over the past year, from the likes of Hurricane Harvey and now Florence, carry with them this palpable climate influence. ""And this warming has consequences,"" continued Rahmstorf. ""It raises sea levels and makes storm surges worse, it makes the atmosphere wetter, leading to flooding from extreme rainfall, and warming ocean temperatures provide extra energy to tropical storms."" As the planet warms, the air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water, providing more fuel for storms. These days, very few places on Earth are experiencing temperatures that are below-average. As seen in the NASA image below, this warming is a global phenomenon, not restricted to any one hemisphere or region. August 2018 temperature anomalies. Image: nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies What's more, while this August turned out to be one of the warmest Augusts in history, the average January through August temperatures also happened to be notably warm. This eight-month average proved to be the third-warmest span on record. Only 2016 and 2017 were warmer. Overall, there's little doubt that 2018 will end up as one of the warmest years on record. January through August average temperatures over the last four years. Image: NASA GODDARD INSTITUTE FOR SPACE STUDIES Physicist Robert Rohde, of the Berkeley Earth research organization, estimates it will be the fourth warmest year since 1850. These warming trends have great implications for the globe. Planetary-wide systems are changing, including the jet stream — powerful winds miles above the surface that have been stalling over regions, trapping weather systems like hot masses of air for longer periods of time. ""The polar ice is melting, in the ocean the Gulf Stream System is weakening, and in the atmosphere the jet stream is getting weird,"" said Rahmstorf.","Earth's accelerated warming trend continued this August, as the sweltering month proved to be one of the hottest Augusts in recorded history.

(Photo: Courtesy of The Weather Channel) The Weather Channel dispatched reporters for live Louisville broadcasts of Winter Storm Hunter in all its glory, so naturally, we wanted in on the action. Chris Warren, an on-air meteorologist, talked with us about bourbon, Weather Channel gossip and tornadoes. Yes, we asked about Jim Cantore. No, he couldn't think of a craziest weather story to share. (We almost forgive him for that.) Here's a lightly edited, reorganized transcript of our conversation. Q: What cities are pathetic at dealing with storms? Which keep their cool? A: You always hear, ""They don't know how to drive in this,"" or ""They can't handle this,"" but every city is different. In the South, anywhere from Birmingham to Atlanta, an inch of snow can cripple the city. We saw that a few years ago with the interstates. It looked like something out of ""The Walking Dead."" I mean, it was phenomenal. There's some memes that showed a poster from The Walking Dead and a picture of the snow day in Atlanta. I mean, it was really bad. Weather news: Louisville braces for ice and snow from Winter Storm Hunter But a lot of it is just timing. There's so much you can plan for, but there's only so much you can control. One snowstorm, if it hits on a Friday night, is not going to cause nearly as much problems as if it hits at 3 in the afternoon on a Friday. Q: What's the dumbest thing you've seen someone do in a storm? A: Gosh, I wish I had time to prepare for this. Dumbest thing? I think some people just don't use their heads. And don't understand gravity and friction and how an icy road on a hill is not good. You know? I'm from the Seattle area and I worked in local news in the West. And, in Portland, Oregon, and even Seattle, you see cars and buses sliding down the hills and you just don't understand why they do that. “I think some people just don't use their heads. And don't understand gravity and friction and how an icy road on a hill is not good. You know?” Chris Warren Or the people that will wakeboard or tow their kids behind a car or truck in two feet of water, or a few inches of water. (It's) when people don't think things all the way through. Q: What are your grocery store essentials ahead of snow? A: We being honest? The grocery store essentials would be probably soup and beer. Something to keep you warm, and then to splurge and get a winter-type beer that's a little bit higher in calories than what I'd normally want to drink. You may like: True terror is Louisville with an inch of snow on the ground There's something soothing about a nice winter ale or something when there's snow outside. And a hot meal. Q: What about bourbon? A: My wife and I were here for a wedding two years ago and we kind of cruised in and out of your establishments here on Main Street and enjoyed some. Q: No favorite kind? A : I couldn't tell you. My dad's a Jack Daniels man. Actually, my wife is too. She drinks it neat. ( We won't judge him too hard that he named Jack Daniels, which is, in fact, a whiskey. ) Colder objects getting an icy taste of winter storm #hunter in downtown Louisville, KY @weatherchannel pic.twitter.com/S3kn9cNub4 — Chris Warren (@TWCChrisWarren) January 12, 2018 Q: Do local weather people ever get territorial when you come into a region? A: Never. The weather community is pretty small and chances are you know someone. Everyone's just professional, everyone's excited about the weather. I think if anyone is territorial, it's probably inter-station at the same market, but I haven't seen that in all the local news that I've worked at. Q: What got you into covering weather? A: I've always been fascinated by nature. I always grew up hiking and skiing and snowboarding. I've always just been fascinated, and analytical, too. I always want to know why stuff happens. So, when I was in junior high, I bought my first weather book about clouds and that was it. I got into the TV side because I also love video. I always said, if I wasn't on the TV, my second favorite job would be behind the camera. Related: Think you know how to drive in snow? Think again, pro drivers say I always loved teaching people. I remember how fascinated I was learning about the weather, so that's one of my favorite things to do: to explain why things are happening and why it's so cool. “I've always been fascinated by nature. I always grew up hiking and skiing and snowboarding.” Chris Warren Q: What do you think of Louisville's reaction (or overreaction) to snow? A : I talked with the spokesperson from Public Works. I think they're doing all they can. It's tough, when it starts as rain, because you can't really pre-treat with the brine, because it's liquid. The idea is it's liquid, it dries, and then you have the salt there. But the rain just washes it away. I think they're doing all they can. Q: Do you have a craziest weather story? Something you've been covering that was just completely nuts? A: I had never seen a tornado and when I was down covering Hurricane Nate in Orange Beach, Alabama, I just showed up to the hotel and looked out the window. I saw the radar, there was a strong shower out there. I saw what looked like a wall cloud, the beginning stages of a tornado. And then, boom, just like that I saw it. That was one of the bucket list items. Waterspout #timelapse from the #tornado warned storm heading toward Orange Beach &amp; Gulf Shores, Alabama #Nate @weatherchannel pic.twitter.com/dR4w3Lmxqo — Chris Warren (@TWCChrisWarren) October 7, 2017 Q: I'm going to be in trouble if I don't ask. What's it like working with Jim Cantore? A: Awesome. He's got one of the biggest hearts. He is one of the most genuine, nicest people. When I first saw him, before I met him, I was like ""Who is this guy?"" He's so animated, so passionate on TV. I'm like, ""This guy can't be for real."" But that's exactly the way he is. He is so passionate. Exactly what you see on TV is the way he is in real life. Darcy Costello: 502-582-4834; dcostello@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @dctello.

The Globe and Mail,"Don Cherry, seen here at the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011, has criticized the Carolina Hurricanes over their victory celebrations.
Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press
Don Cherrys latest rant about the Carolina Hurricanes and their victory celebrations didnt go unnoticed by the NHL club.
The Hurricanes even decided to embrace his words.
Cherry blasted the Hurricanes on Saturday during his weekly Coachs Corner television segment for the team going beyond the traditional raised-stick salute to their fans after home wins, saying that: These guys, to me, are jerks.

Shortly after the segment, Carolinas Twitter account tweeted: Wait, was he talking about us?, and changed its Twitter bio to read: That bunch of jerks with the fun celebrations.
Then the club followed up on Sunday by announcing that they are now selling Bunch of Jerks T-shirts available on their online shop.
Were a bunch of jerks and we have the shirts to prove it, they added.
Starting with a thunderous clap at centre ice whats come to be known as the Storm Surge the Hurricanes players have celebrated victories at PNC Arena in various, evolving ways since the beginning of the season.
Players have jumped into the boards, paddled imaginary kayaks, played games of Duck Duck Goose, simulated a walk-off home run and recently ran a limbo line.

Rhitu Chatterjee,"The storm spread snow and freezing rain across the Southeast on Wednesday. It's expected to intensify as it moves up the coast. Stephen B. Morton/AP The eastern United States is about to be hit by a really powerful winter storm that scientists are calling a bomb cyclone. And yes, that is a scientific term. The National Weather Service forecasts that the storm, which has struck Florida and the Carolinas, will move northward along the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Friday. It will bring snow, ice, strong winds, massive storm surges and plummeting temperatures all the way up to Maine. Here is what created this monster winter storm. First, the jet stream brought cold, dry air from Canada southward this past week, casting an unusually cold spell on the entire eastern United States. That mass of cold air eventually collided with relatively warm, moist air off the southeastern coast, giving birth to this winter storm. ""Very warm air coming next to cold air mass creates a lot of energy,"" says Jeffrey B. Halverson, a climatologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. It also creates a dramatic decline in air pressure, he says. ""The pressure is going to drop very, very rapidly."" Winter weather will impact the entire East Coast today through Friday. Here are the latest expected snow totals and current winter headlines. Strong winds will accompany the snow in many locations. Stay informed at https://t.co/VyWINDk3xP or your trusted weather source! 📱💻📺📻 pic.twitter.com/RqCr3h6XR1 — NWS (@NWS) January 3, 2018 That's where the word 'bomb' comes in, says Jeff Weber, a climatologist at the the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. ""We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone."" The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic mid-latitude cyclone. This particular one has similarities to Superstorm Sandy, which hit the eastern United States in 2012. Unlike this winter storm, Sandy began as a full-fledged hurricane. ""As it moved north, it interacted with cold air and transitioned into a baroclinic mid-latitude cyclone,"" Weber says. ""And that happened literally as the eye was getting ready to make landfall."" Sandy was more powerful than this new storm, because it had more time to build up energy as it moved north from the Caribbean, he says. Nevertheless, this winter storm is expected to be very powerful. Scientists are forecasting that the air pressure in the storm will drop by ""about 50 millibars over the next 24 hours,"" says Weber. ""So this will be a big deepening and strong intensification of the storm over the next 24 hours."" ""This storm is a big, big wind-making machine,"" says Halverson. ""This is going to cause a lot of problems."" The National Weather Service predicts between 6 and 12 inches of snowfall between Virginia Beach and Boston. Northern New England could get more than 12-18 inches. Eastern Long Island and northern New England are likely to see blizzard conditions. There will also be coastal flooding and storm surges that can destroy coastal properties and cause beach erosion, especially up along the New England coastline, says Halverson. Massachusetts and Maine are likely to see widespread power outages due to gusty wind. But the storm's impacts won't end there. ""This storm is going to pull down a huge amount of arctic air,"" says Halverson. ""On Friday and Saturday, temperatures are going to be in the gutter."" Temperatures could drop down to single digits, or even below zero. ""And if you're going to be out of power, you're really going to be in trouble."" States such as Massachusetts and Maine should prepare to shelters for people, he says. ""Sheltering for warmth is going to be key, for potentially several days.""","This powerful storm was created by a cold jet stream colliding with warm air over the Atlantic. It is similar to Superstorm Sandy, but will likely cause less damage.",2018-01-03T21:20:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Scientists Warn 'Bomb Cyclone' Will Bring Strong Winds, Cold Temperatures",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/03/575340541/scientists-warn-bomb-cyclone-will-bring-strong-winds-cold-temperatures,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/03/southern-snow1_wide-e9f687e993972b78ac124ad733a64902a22dcfd9.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,ice storm,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption How to keep warm? Tips from cold countries Large parts of Europe are enduring another night of freezing conditions as a Siberian weather system continues to bring chaos. Blizzards and heavy snowfall have closed roads, rail services and schools and forced the cancellations of hundreds of flights. The unusually cold spell is being felt as far south as the Mediterranean. The number of weather-related deaths rose to as many as 55 with 21 victims in Poland, most of them rough sleepers. It triggered a warning from the World Health Organization that the poor, the homeless and migrants would be hardest hit by the big freeze. ""Those most at risk of cold-related illness include elderly people, children, and people who have chronic diseases or physical or mental limitations,"" it said as a statement. Where are the problems? The weather system has been given various nicknames - in the UK it is ""the Beast from the East"" while the Dutch call it the ""Siberian bear"" and Swedes the ""snow cannon"". Snow has even appeared on the normally balmy beaches of the French Riviera. Ireland remains braced for what is predicted to be its heaviest snowfall in decades as Storm Emma moves in from the south. Flights in and out of Dublin airport were suspended with service disruptions expected to continue until Saturday at the earliest. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Heavy snow near Montpellier, southern France, made roads and pavements treacherous Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some stranded families in Montpellier had to bed down in reception centres The airport in the Swiss city of Geneva was forced to shut down on Thursday morning but was reopened after the runway was cleared using snow ploughs. In France, about 2,000 drivers were stranded on a motorway near the city of Montpellier, with some complaining of being stuck for as long as 24 hours. Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was also hit by freezing winds with KLM airlines cancelling or delaying dozens of flights. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Dublin Airport has been badly disrupted by snow and strong winds Some rail services operated by Eurostar between London, Paris and Brussels were axed. Where have the deaths been? As well as those in Poland, weather-related casualties were reported as far south as Spain and Italy. Seven people have died since Sunday in Slovakia, AFP news agency reports, and six more in the Czech Republic in recent days. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The homeless, like here in Berlin, are most at risk from the cold One of three victims in Spain was a homeless man who had been sleeping in an abandoned truck, officials said. Five people were reported dead in Lithuania, four in France, two each in Serbia, Italy, Slovenia and Romania and one each in the UK and the Netherlands, AFP added. In the French capital, Paris, authorities set up emergency shelters for the city's roughly 3,000 homeless. What else is going on? Ukraine, which has further snowstorms forecast in the days to come, has found itself in a fresh row with Russia over gas supplies. The Russian state-run gas giant Gazprom said it would not restart gas shipments - expected on Thursday - because agreements had not been finalised. The shipments would have been the first from Russia since 2015. Media caption Motorists and pedestrians in Ukraine struggle with snow after heavy falls Ukrainian energy agency Naftogaz accused Gazprom of violating contractual obligations and the European Commission later stepped in to act as a broker between the two. Moscow and Kiev have been at loggerheads since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. What is the forecast? Some parts of Europe are expected to see temperatures rise over the next couple of days, although Ireland and parts of southern England are braced for the effects of Storm Emma which is moving up from Portugal and France. On Thursday, Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar urged people to stay indoors until the storm passed later on Friday. ""The risk to life and limb presented by the severe weather conditions should not be underestimated by anyone,"" he said following a meeting with emergency officials. ""It is not safe to be outside in such conditions.""",The continent endures another freezing night with snow and ice claiming lives and causing chaos.,2018-03-01T23:48:07Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Snow in Europe: Deadly winter storm brings chaos,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43251315,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05zqd3n.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,ice storm,1
Cody Perez,"Epic Games is shaking up Battle Royale this week with yet another Limited Time Event mode. While season seven of Fortnite continues to chug along with only a few weeks left, there is also a new Fortnite Ice Storm event to check out as well. This new limited time event mode arrives just a month after the 14 Days of Fortnite event, offering plenty of new content for players.
More Fortnite coverage
There are new challenges to check out and complete, new rewards to get, and entirely new enemies to fight on the Battle Royale map. The Ice Storm event is only going on for a short period of time so players who are interested in its exclusive rewards will want to jump in and take on the challenges right now.
Fortnite Ice Storm challenges explained
New challenges are added to the Ice Storm limited time event each day. All players can tackle these challenges whether or not they are a season seven Battle Pass owner. Most challenges reward players with experience that can be used to level up and gain tiers quickly.
This is perfect as there are only a few weeks left in season seven of Battle Royale and you’ll need all the experience you can get if you are aiming to reach that coveted tier 100 and receive the exclusive Ice King legendary skin before the season comes to an end. One of the challenges in the event that players are having trouble with completing is the ice shards one.
Essentially, players are tasked with finding and destroying an ice shard 10 times. Yes, you have to defeat 10 of these ice shards in order to complete this challenge and receive its reward. Given the requirements of this particular challenge, it can take you a while to do. Here’s everything you need to know about how and where to complete this challenge.
Fortnite ice shards explained
The ice shards in the Ice Storm Limited Time Event mode are basically spawn points for a new type of enemy. These enemies spawn at the ice shards and you can fight them to complete the challenges. For Battle Royale veterans, this is very similar to the Fortnitemares Limited Time Mode from last Halloween. These enemies are NPCs so they are a lot easier to kill than normal players. However, you do have to deal with both them and normal players so it can become a bit overwhelming.
This particular challenge tasks you with finding an ice shard and destroying it in 10 different matches. That’s right, you have to do it in 10 different matches so don’t waste your time trying to destroy as many as possible in each match. This makes things even more challenging and will take much longer than it would if you just had to just destroy 10 of them in total. Thankfully, you can use that time to work on the other challenges in Ice Storm limited time event.
We recommend completing this challenge in the squads mode. Normally, we recommend you do it in a big team mode like Team Rumble but the Ice Legion will only spawn in solo, duos, and squads modes. Squads are good because you have a team that can watch your back and help you destroy the ice shards. We also recommend you just destroy an ice shard and then leave the match or die, especially if you just want to complete this challenge and get its reward. This will speed up the entire process and make going through the 10 matches much quicker.
Where to find Fortnite ice shards
Of course, before you can even destroy an ice shard and leave the match, you will need to find it first. This is actually rather easy to do as they are all over the Battle Royale map. Unlike before, the entire Battle Royale map is now covered in snow and not just in the revamped southwestern quadrant like at the beginning of season seven.
Everywhere that you visit in Battle Royale matches right now is covered in a thick layer of snow. In addition, the visibility is lessened considerably, which makes seeing what’s up ahead much harder to do. This is actually great, though, since it means other players will have a harder time seeing you. Thankfully, it doesn’t make finding ice shards too difficult either.
They are large pillars of ice as seen in the screenshot above. Unfortunately, unlike other challenges in the past, there isn’t a specific place that you should visit in order to find ice shards. This is because they are randomly placed at the start of each match. There are a few places that we recommend you visit in order to find these ice shards. Your best bet is to land in named areas that aren’t super popular with other players. These areas include Pleasant Park (which we visited in the screenshots), Snobby Shores, Lazy Links, Lonely Lodge, and Wailing Woods.
There are a few others, too, but your best chances at survival are at any location that isn’t popular (like Tilted Towers) or anywhere with a related challenge associated with it. This is so that you can safely scour the named area for weapons and supplies at the start of the match. You want to be prepared before you head off to go find you some ice shards. When you are ready, simply go to the outskirts of a location and circle around it. We typically find two to three shards just on the edge of each one.
How to destroy Fortnite ice shards
Once you’ve actually found one of the ice shards, the real fun begins. If you’re familiar with the Fortnitemares event then this will be easy for you to do. Basically, various ice fiend enemies begin to spawn when you approach the ice shard. These ice fiends will stand in your way and attack you, making shooting the ice shard difficult.
All you need to do is kill the various ice fiends to destroy the ice shard. You see, each ice fiend that you defeat will lower the health of the ice shard overall. While it does take quite a few ice fiends, you are able to easily destroy the ice shard this way. Of course, you can also attack the ice shard directly if you’d like.
We recommend focusing on the ice fiends first since you will need to defend yourself from them anyway. Each ice fiend you kill also grants you a small amount of shield so that will help you keep alive. Fighting the Ice Legion and the ice shard can get very overwhelming, which is why we recommend you do this with a squad.
As for what weapons to use, we recommend ranged ones. Explosives like grenades are great for taking out the ice fiends and ice shard, as well. We recommend building a structure to defend yourself or hiding in buildings while you fight. You want to try and keep as much distance between you and the fiends as possible. Keep moving at all times.
Lastly, the recently released boom box item is a fantastic asset for taking out the ice shard as well. For those who don’t know about this item, it does no damage to enemies like the Ice Legion or other players but it is great for destroying various structures. Yes, this includes the ice shards, too. Simply leave the boom box on the ground near the shard, making sure to stay clear of any enemies.
The boom box item should distract most of the ice fiends but that means you need to take them out so they don’t destroy it. Once it’s destroyed, leave the match and repeat the process nine more times.
Fortnite ice shards challenge reward
Once you’ve done this 10 times, you will receive your reward. The reward for destroying 10 ice shards is 500 experience points. While that’s not enough to guarantee a level up, it does take a chunk out of a level. In addition, if you do this challenge and five more of the Ice Storm challenges, you’ll receive an exclusive wrap for your weapons.","The Fortnite Ice Storm limited time event is going on right now, offering plenty of new challenges and rewards for players in Battle Royale.

Daniel AlarcÓn,"Several weeks before he would become a folk hero across Puerto Rico, Jorge Bracero slipped in a puddle at San Juan’s central power plant and broke his leg. After a few days in a cast, he began to feel pain so intense he was unable to sleep or eat. When doctors realized he had developed blood clots in his injured limb, they prescribed a six-month regimen of blood thinners and barred him from returning to work for the duration. It was July 2017. So when the first big storms of that hurricane season began bearing down on Puerto Rico, Bracero—a power plant operator with the island’s public electric power authority, known as Prepa—sat on the sidelines, miserable and frustrated, reliant on a pair of crutches. Bracero is 38 years old and stoutly built, with buzzed hair and a dark beard. He has a sharp, pointed nose and prominent eyebrows that sometimes knit up into twin, back-to-back apostrophes at the middle of his forehead—especially when he is concerned. And he was often concerned that fall. When Hurricane Irma hit the island on September 5, Bracero and his wife, Charlot, were among the 1.1 million Puerto Rican customers who lost power. They rode out the storm and its aftermath with relatives who had a generator; Charlot was seven months pregnant with their first child. Bracero slept on a couch, passing his days laid up in the humid late-summer heat, anxious that his wife might go into early labor, and fuming that he couldn’t do his part to get the power back on. “I felt useless,” Bracero says. The job that Bracero was desperate to get back to can be brutal on a good day. On any given shift, he and one or two partners are responsible for operating two 15-story-high boilers, along with the 20 burners that heat them to produce steam and the six massive power-generating turbines that turn under the steam’s pressure. Bracero’s role is to tend to the machinery itself, while his partner sits at a console monitoring the plant’s water, oil, temperature, and pressure levels, constantly relaying information to Bracero. The heat is intense, the work exhausting. When he comes home, his clothes go straight to the balcony because they smell so powerfully of sweat and diesel. Since he was unable to pitch in at the plant, Bracero settled instead for defending his colleagues on Facebook, where predictable rounds of invective were being heaped on Prepa for its failure to restore power. Normally, Bracero’s Facebook persona tended toward cheeky political memes, Game of Thrones jokes, and Star Wars references. But now he took to posting photos of Prepa workers doing dangerous things to get the lights back on. One grainy cell phone image showed a lineman balancing on a helicopter skid in midair, stretching his arms out into space to repair wires at the tip of a utility pole. “And then they yell, GET MOVING,” Bracero wrote. After Irma raked across Florida, he shared a video that someone had taken from high above a field near Jacksonville; the camera slowly panned across a sea of white bucket trucks that had assembled from all across the United States. “That’s why Florida has light and we don’t. That’s 16,000” workers, he wrote. “Here we are alone.” Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico just two weeks after Irma. “I have a very apocalyptic mind,” Bracero says, but the storm’s ferocity was nonetheless beyond what he could imagine. It brought sustained winds of 155 miles per hour and a 9-foot storm surge, cutting a roughly diagonal line across the island from the southeast over a span of nearly eight hours; its trajectory felt almost deliberate, as if plotted out to inflict the most damage. Bracero compared it to a terrorist attack. Eighty percent of Puerto Rico’s electrical transmission lines went down. The entire island lost power. Bracero couldn’t stand being idle anymore. After the storm, several employees of the San Juan power plant were unaccounted for. No one knew when, or if, they would return to work. Without hands on deck, Prepa was never going to get the lights back on. So Bracero pressured his doctor to sign a medical release. Of course, if you’re taking a blood thinner, a cut can be catastrophic, so the doctor agreed on the condition that Bracero wear an extra pair of gloves, an extra long-sleeve shirt, and a pair of spandex pants underneath his work clothes. When he looked in the mirror wearing this new uniform, Bracero laughed. In the boiling heart of a power plant the temperatures routinely soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but he was dressed as if he was going skiing. Once he was back at Prepa, Bracero quickly came to understand the magnitude of the damage. But his head was also still stuck in social media, which—like all media after the storm—was maddening to him. News coverage appeared to be designed to spread panic. “My wife and family were watching me yell at the television,” he says. Nor was Prepa doing a particularly effective job of communicating. So Bracero made another drastic move: “I decided to become a news outlet myself.” He started using his Facebook page to post daily updates on the effort to repair the grid. Favoring extreme transparency, he posted raw screenshots of the spreadsheets listing the work assignments of every power and light brigade on the island, alongside frank attempts to explain how the grid works and what it would take to get each part of it up and running. One day, when a steam turbine at a major power plant failed, he dug up an animated video about how steam turbines work. He warned that the clip was “ASTRONOMICALLY BORING” but pointed people to the five-minute mark if they wanted to get a visual sense of the component that was broken. Toward the end of each post, Bracero would switch gears and offer a kind of running pep talk; he developed a voice that was simultaneously gentle, urgent, and reassuring, completely free of cynicism or panic. In practically every update, he implored his readers to post videos as soon as their lights came back on. “Tomorrow help others cook, help those who have no light to feel a gift of normalcy,” he wrote to people who were about to regain power. “Help wash clothes, help cook. Make Ice!” He’d vary the message slightly, so it didn’t seem like boilerplate. “In the dark we have met again as neighbors. Don’t forget,” he wrote. “Don’t go back to your bubble.” To people whose pleas for help flooded his comments, he said: “The moment will come. You are not forgotten.” When people did post images of their lights finally on, and photos of their freezers full of all the ice they had made for their neighbors, his response was unfailingly earnest. “I’m proud of you!” he wrote, again and again. By publicly sharing inside information from Prepa, Bracero knew he was taking a risk—he was afraid he might lose his job—but he did it anyway. “If I get fired, it’s for doing what’s right,” he thought. By November, he had to switch over from his personal Facebook page to posting as a public figure on a fan page, because he was overwhelmed by posts, tags, and messages. Within a day, his new page had more than 12,000 followers. Someone made a portrait of Bracero in the style of Shepard Fairey’s famous image of Barack Obama—an ersatz block print of Bracero with his long beard and hard hat, an enormous smile on his face—and this became his public profile picture. People sometimes stopped him in the street to thank him, to give him a hug. In private, however, Bracero was frightened. Now that he was in contact with thousands of Puerto Ricans, he could feel how fragile they were—how fragile the whole island was—after the storm. “I wasn’t expecting this level of desperation,” he told me. “It scares the shit out of me.” Jorge Bracero, a power plant operator with Puerto Rico's public electric power authority, known as Prepa. All across Puerto Rico over the past year, people like Bracero have taken matters into their own hands in ways that are both inspiring and distressing. When it became clear to Javier Jiménez, the mayor of a northwestern town called San Sebastián, that power wasn’t going to be restored right away after Maria, he decided to go rogue. He gathered a handful of brave (some might say reckless ) city workers, along with a few retired Prepa employees willing to volunteer, and mobilized them to reconnect the 40,000-person town to the grid themselves. It was inordinately dangerous, but Jiménez felt that the greater risk was inaction. San Sebastián is about two hours from the capital, San Juan, and for many residents, particularly the elderly and the infirm, having electricity was a matter of life and death. “It was a state of emergency,” the mayor told me. “Nobody could’ve stood in my way. Not Prepa. Not the governor. Not the president of the United States.” Jiménez called his band of vigilante line workers the PPA—the Pepino Power Authority—after the surrounding Pepino mountains. The PPA asked men and women in San Sebastián to come out with their own machetes to prune back the brush and tree limbs, helping clear a path to fallen poles near their homes. Then the PPA’s core team of volunteers would step in, repairing poles, scavenging parts, and running new cable. Officially, Prepa was not pleased to have a local amateur utility reconnecting high-voltage power lines. Unofficially, Prepa employees were slipping spare parts to the renegade municipal power crew, one volunteer told me, to help speed up the reelectrification. In another town, Adjuntas, nestled in the mountains about an hour and a half southwest of San Juan, an NGO dedicated in part to solar power, called Casa Pueblo, became a pillar of the local recovery. When the town’s 18,000 residents were cut off from the rest of the island after Maria, the NGO’s solar-­powered radio helped authorities find out which roads were clear and which families were in danger, and attend to emergencies when the central government and federal authorities were not yet responding. Casa Pueblo subsequently gave out some 14,000 solar-powered lamps and also offered a solar-charged satellite phone at its offices for locals to use. At any given time, five to 10 people waited to make a call. Arturo Massol, the associate director of Casa Pueblo and an ardent evangelist for decentralized, renewable energy, described what was happening on the island as “an energy insurrection.” Ordinary Puerto Ricans, he said, had woken up to the fact that when it came to electricity, they would have to look for alternatives. “Tomorrow help others cook, help those who have no light to feel a gift of normalcy,” Bracero wrote to people who had regained power. ""Help wash clothes, help cook. Make Ice!” On the mainland, green-tech commentators pointed to Maria as an opportunity to turn the island into a laboratory for experimenting with microgrids, renewables, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Two weeks after the storm, a Twitter user in Virginia named Scott Stapf issued a hypothetical challenge: “Could @elonmusk go in and rebuild Puerto Rico’s electricity system with independent solar &amp; battery systems?” Musk replied with characteristic bravado: “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” But as they waited for the lights to come on, the vast majority of Puerto Ricans found alternatives to the grid in the most obvious, least sustainable places. Diesel and gas generators became the island’s constant, deafening background noise. Long orange extension cords slithered out of windows, connecting houses to one another, as neighbors shared the power their generators were producing. (One of Bracero’s constant refrains on Facebook was a set of pleading instructions on how to power multiple houses using one generator without hurting anyone.) During its busiest period after the storm, one store in San Juan was selling about 400 generators a day. In the town of Río Grande, less than an hour east of San Juan, the Puerto Rican journalist Ana Teresa Toro told me the hurricane had forced her to rethink the viability of the island itself. “You can’t trust the infrastructure anymore,” she said. Barely anyone she knew had stayed at their normal weight after the storm: Without consistent refrigeration, people either ate processed food and put on pounds or they suffered through shortages and depression and lost weight. Toro told me some of her friends joked darkly about the thrilling results of this diet. Heroic improvisation and gallows humor can only get a population of 3.3 million people so far. Electricity is, of course, the utility upon which modernity rests. Without it, there can be nothing approaching normalcy. And the crippling cost of keeping generators fueled just underlined how essential grid power was. Solar power, meanwhile, was uneven without powerful battery backups—and while the number of such batteries on the island was growing, thanks to companies like Tesla, there were still hardly enough to make a dent in demand (see “Balloons, Batteries, and the Crypto Invasion”). Yes, Prepa was a basket case—dysfunctional, archaic, overwhelmingly reliant on imported oil—but it was still palpably and undeniably Puerto Rico’s most critical infrastructure. However ­little people trusted it, there were very few ways around relying on it. As the post-Maria period moved past its feverish first few weeks, electrical power inevitably became the simplest way of measuring progress toward recovery. And Bracero became one of the most trusted voices on technical questions that had come to feel like existential ones. How many people are connected now? What percentage of the population? When is the 50900 transmission line going to be operative again ? The bigger question was not so much whether the crisis would lead to a new model for climate resilience, but whether the existing system would even be up and running by the next hurricane season. Doing so would require repairing far more than the damage caused by a single storm in September 2017. Javier Jiménez, the mayor of San Sebastián, took power restoration into his own hands and founded the Pepino Power Authority. Arturo Massol, the associate director of the NGO Casa Pueblo, describes Puerto Rico's response to the aftermath of Maria as an ""energy insurrection."" When Jorge Bracero began working for Prepa back in 2005, it was an institution that commanded some respect. By some measures, Prepa was (and still is) the largest public electric utility in the US, serving more customers than the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power or the Long Island Power Authority. Its grid, splayed across the rugged landscape of Puerto Rico, had been instrumental in the island’s economic development. Its finances were sound. “I chose to be a blue-collar worker,” Bracero recalls. But as it happened, 2005 was also around the time when Puerto Rico’s entire economy began a long, as yet unchecked slide, taking Prepa with it. The causes of the collapse were no mystery. For decades, federal tax law had offered US corporations major exemptions if they set up shop in Puerto Rico. Waves of this tax-incentivized industrialization had brought petrochemical plants, and then pharmaceutical and tech companies, to the island. But by 2006 the last of those tax breaks were phased out, and an exodus of Puerto Rico’s industrial employers began in earnest. The island’s GDP per capita fell in tandem. Unemployment spiked. Between 2000 and 2015, as economic stagnation took hold, nearly 10 percent of the population, mostly working-­age Puerto Ricans, left for the mainland. The island’s tax base became a hopelessly moving target. From 2002 to 2014, the Puerto Rican government overestimated its revenue eight times, on one occasion by as much as 19 percent. Deficits grew year after year. To cover costs, Puerto Rico began to borrow heavily, issuing bonds to close budgetary gaps in ways that might be charitably described as creative. And they were easy to sell, in part because of another quirk in the US tax code: Earnings on Puerto Rican bonds were triply exempt from state, federal, and the island’s own territorial taxes. Investment banks, retirement funds, and individual investors from the island and the mainland bought billions of dollars’ worth, helping to prop up what amounted to a fiscal Ponzi scheme. By 2015 the situation was untenable, and then-­governor Alejandro García Padilla declared that Puerto Rico’s $72 billion in debts were not payable, setting into motion a series of negotiations with bondholders that culminated in an unelected oversight board taking control of the island’s finances. Since then, to pay off creditors, Puerto Ricans have borne draconian cuts in education, public transportation, health, and utilities. As the most economically mobile Puerto Ricans have fled the island, these cuts have fallen on a population that is older, poorer, more isolated—and angrier—than ever. May Day protests in the past two years have turned violent. The years of austerity and economic contraction took a particularly harsh toll on Prepa. In 2016 a report ordered by the regulatory body in charge of overseeing Prepa laid bare the utility’s sorry state with grim clarity: “Prepa’s generation, transmission, and distribution systems are falling apart,” it said. Prepa’s electrical service had cost more than other US utilities, yet its customer interruption rates were four or five times higher. As a result of “historically thin budgets,” Prepa had adopted a self-­defeating policy of postponing maintenance and extending outages to avoid paying overtime to its employees. Blackouts had become more frequent, the report said, while the rate of worker injuries and fatalities in Prepa’s shrinking workforce was “alarming.” Some of the utility’s challenges were a legacy of Puerto Rico’s industrial past. The island’s largest power plants had been built on its less populated southern coast, to serve a now mothballed set of massive petrochemical plants nearby. Now those power facilities were primarily responsible for supplying electricity to the major population centers some 50 miles away on the island’s northern coast, via transmission lines that had to cross a rugged, heavily jungled mountain range. Maintaining those lines was an extraordinary task even in the best of times. The utility was, according to the report’s authors, stuck in a vicious cycle: The precarious state of the grid, which lurched from outage to outage, precluded the kind of massive, visionary investments needed to shore up or renovate the system. Not that Prepa’s leadership seemed much inclined toward vision. Prepa administrators were alleged to have participated in a fraudulent scheme to accept kickbacks in exchange for buying low-quality fuel oil at inflated prices. A 2016 report from a special investigative committee of the Puerto Rican Senate found that labs working for Prepa had manipulated tests of sulfur content in its fuel to cover the utility’s tracks. The scheme is alleged to have involved billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. (A class action filed on behalf of customers is still pending.) On top of it all, the utility was more than $9 billion in debt. Well before the apocalyptic 2017 hurricane season, one thing had been made very clear to all Puerto Ricans: It didn’t take a hurricane to knock out Prepa’s grid. On the afternoon of September 21, 2016, almost exactly a year before Maria made landfall, a single power switch overheated at the island’s largest power plant, causing a cascading blackout that snuffed out the lights for 1.5 million customers. As if to underline the system’s fragility, all of this happened under clear skies. By December 2017, San Juan felt half-empty, permeated by the rumble of generators and the sharp smell of diesel. Puerto Ricans had been leaving for the mainland by the thousands each week. It was common to find wreckage that had yet to be cleared; at major intersections, one side of the street might be lit up and the other still dim—a bolsillo, or pocket, of darkness. The pattern of illumination followed no discernible logic. According to best estimates, roughly half of Puerto Ricans were still living without power. A sketch comedy troupe called Teatro Breve was putting on five sold-out shows a week in San Juan, all about living without power, waiting in lines for no reason, and the myriad daily indignities that made up the post-hurricane ennui. The crowd’s laughter was deep and guttural, almost pained. In one scene, an actor berated her skeptical husband: “The lights aren’t going out today. Jorge Bracero said so!” Outside, on the streets, there were work crews everywhere—line workers from Prepa and from Florida, New York, and Texas in bucket trucks. The Army Corps of Engineers was also on the scene, but federal rules prevented them from upgrading Prepa’s grid. They had to “replace in kind”: A wooden electrical pole felled by Maria had to be replaced by another wooden pole, even if a metal one might better withstand the next storm. Ordinary Prepa employees I spoke to approached their work with a sense of pride and resignation. I spent an afternoon with one brigade of Prepa line workers doing repairs near the city of Bayamón. Raul Lebrón, a grizzled 21-year veteran of the utility, showed me parts he and his coworkers had scavenged from fallen transmission lines, cleaned up, and were now set to reuse. He held a brown porcelain insulator in his hand and estimated it was around 60 years old. The ingenuity of Prepa’s line workers astonished their colleagues from the mainland. Johnny Price, a Con Edison manager from New York who oversees line workers, spent six weeks in Puerto Rico that winter and told me he’d never seen work like this before. “They see a pole, they stop, strip it, use what they can. They would reach into oil-filled transformers and start rewiring on the fly. They do calculations in their head. It was pretty impressive.” But no one could be impressed by the overall slow pace of recovery. In January, Governor Rosselló made an announcement. “The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,” he said. He announced his intention to privatize Prepa and sell off its assets, and signaled that he intended to move fast. Prepa line workers return power to a home in Puerto Rico. By spring, the number of customers for whom power had been restored in Puerto Rico had climbed past 1.4 million, but it could lurch down again in an instant. On February 11, an explosion at the Monacillos power plant plunged the capital back into darkness. A few weeks later, in early March, blackouts hit San Juan once more, two days in a row. On April 12, a tree fell along one of the island’s electrical transmission lines near Salinas, knocking out power to nearly 1 million people. Six days later, a contractor hit a line with an excavator and the island went dark once more. “As soon as the lights go out, my phone blows up,” Bracero told me in April. “People are traumatized.” He was as busy as ever at work, recovered from his injuries, and posting all the time. During the second blackout that month, one of Bracero’s updates was shared more than 4,000 times and gathered hundreds of comments. The thread included conspiracy theories about the privatization effort, speculating that the outages were part of a plan to further delegitimize the utility, paving the way for Rosselló’s deal. All day long, Bracero provided updates, trying to maintain the same tone of serenity he had been using since the hurricane. That month, I went to see Francisco Rullán, the official appointed by Governor Rosselló to direct public energy policy and help oversee the government’s privatization plans for Prepa. His office sits in what is known as La Milla de Oro, San Juan’s Golden Mile, the city’s financial center. There isn’t much that’s golden about it anymore, the disrepair and blight that preceded the storm apparent even here in boarded-up windows and half-empty office buildings. A modest gathering of former teachers stood in front of the building, protesting cuts to their pensions and school closures, posing for pictures in front of their homemade signs, and handing out flyers to passersby. Before assuming his current role, Rullán had worked as an engineer at Prepa for more than two decades, so he knew the utility from the inside and was keenly aware of both its assets and its shortcomings. But Prepa’s inability to fulfill its mission of providing consistent electricity to Puerto Rico was, no matter how you looked at it, a scandal. It was, after all, an inefficient state monopoly that lost money despite its captive customer base. “My entire family still has no power,” he told me, just moments after we’d sat down. He was referring to his parents, who lived in a town called Utuado, in the island’s mountainous center. “I always use them as an example. Going without power has become normal.” He encouraged me to visit them so I could see for myself. The first step in the privatization plan, Rullán told me, was to get Puerto Rico’s legislative assembly to change the law to allow Prepa to sell its assets. The next step would be to get buyers lined up—either for the entire utility or for different elements of Prepa’s broad portfolio: its aging plants, tens of thousands of miles of power lines, irrigation systems, right-of-way easements, and fiber-optic cable, to say nothing of its contracts with thousands of employees and its considerable debt. The new Prepa, he assured me, would offer lower prices for the consumer, more options, 50 percent renewable fuel sources by 2040, microgrids, and more. But many observers were skeptical. Rosselló’s proposed bill to privatize Prepa had explicitly blocked the utility’s regulator, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, from overseeing the sale of private contracts. The plan instead stipulated that Prepa’s seven-member governing board would run the 18-month-long process. The credit-rating agency Moody’s called the timeline “quite aggressive.” Cathy Kunkel, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, worried that privatization without regulatory oversight would just open up opportunities for corrupt, politically driven business deals. Prepa’s leaders, after all, had already been accused of taking kickbacks and making bad deals for their customers, as with the fuel oil scandal. And the fact remained that Prepa was the largest single public asset in all of Puerto Rico—the biggest thing the territory had left to sell off. What terms might a buyer demand to purchase a creaking electrical system that provides power to a shrinking customer base on an island sure to be hit by more storms and hurricanes ? In a report that Kunkel helped author, the IEEFA was particularly dubious that a new private owner, absent robust regulation, would voluntarily shift toward renewable fuel sources: Why would you pave the way for distributed forms of energy generation, like solar, when they compete with the centralized power grid you’ve just bought? I asked Rullán what the model was for a wholesale transformation of a public utility like the one he was proposing. He shook his head; Puerto Rico would be the model. His tone wasn’t boastful; it was optimistic in a way that felt surprising, given the context. “What we do here will make history,” he said. José Roman, then the interim president of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, the sidelined regulatory body overseeing Prepa, was less optimistic. He wasn’t opposed to privatization in principle, but he had ­little faith in the process that had been set in motion. Privatized energy markets have to be designed carefully: Supply and demand must always be in balance, or the entire system fails. He feared that the sale would become yet another missed opportunity for the Puerto Rican consumer. “Yes,” he told me. “We will be studied. We’ll be studied for everything we did wrong.” A shower that has been rigged to work without electrical pumps at a nursing home. The facility, run by Luz Collazo (pictured), went without grid power for nine months. During my final trip to Puerto Rico in April, I decided to visit Utuado, the town where Rullán had said his family was still living without power. Along the road there, I ran into two men picking up telephone wire that had been knocked down by the storm. Michael Casiano and Carmelo Fuentes were cutting the cable they had gathered into meter-long lengths, stacking the pieces in the bed of their beat-up truck, and then bringing it to someone from the phone company, they told me. They seemed happy to have a job. Casiano was tall and thin, wearing dark glasses. He had a broad, friendly smile. Fuentes was heavyset and strong, with thick arms and giant hands. Fuentes told me he’d almost lost his mind after Maria, and though I barely pressed him, it soon became clear he wasn’t speaking in metaphor. His family had had no water and never managed to buy a generator. Everything seemed hopeless. One of Fuentes’ neighbors, a 22-year-old woman, had hung herself. The young woman’s mother and brother had followed suit, though both survived. I asked Fuentes how he knew he was having mental troubles. “Because I was arrested,” he told me. He woke up in a straitjacket. But he was better now. He smiled bravely, as if to prove it. Casiano wanted to agree but instead offered: “Puerto Rico can’t withstand another one of these.” Along the way to Utuado, the roads narrow and snake. These sparsely populated towns up in the hills, where the brush is thick and the trees curve over the roads, may well be the last places where power is restored. If another massive storm comes, residents worry they’ll find themselves once more at the back of the line. Rullán’s parents met me halfway up the hill, and we drove up together toward a small nursing home called Ciudad Dorada, Madre de Dios, which was still operating without grid power. Its director, Luz Collazo, told me she couldn’t afford to use her generator much; she was spending around $300 a week on diesel. She had invested thousands of dollars in solar panels, but the building was too large for them to power it all at once. A visitor staying in the home had died a few weeks after Maria. Two of Collazo’s 10 residents needed oxygen, more than half had Alzheimer’s, and all but one were over 80 years old. For hot showers, Collazo and her husband, Miguel, warmed water on the stove. They also gathered rainwater in a large plastic kiddie pool on the roof. Collazo took me out to the terrace, looking over a lush valley. “No one’s come to pick up the power lines,” she said. “No one’s even come to survey the damage.” What was most maddening was that the vast majority of the utility poles along the road to the nursing home had survived. In all, Collazo’s nursing home would go without grid power for nine months. By the spring, one piece of good news had arrived from Washington: The new congressional budget allowed for an exception to the usual rules of federal disaster funding, and now FEMA could pay for major upgrades and new designs for Prepa’s grid. But that exception was only guaranteed to apply as long as the utility stayed public. Nevertheless, on June 11, the Puerto Rican legislature approved a bill to privatize Prepa. And on June 20, three weeks after the start of the new hurricane season, Governor Rosselló signed it into law. Exactly one month later, Prepa was in crisis once again. On July 11, the utility’s CEO of just four months, a non-Spanish speaker named Walter Higgins, announced his resignation, citing personal reasons. There had been considerable public outcry over his salary, which at $450,000 ranked among the highest of American public electric utility CEOs. The utility’s governing board, the same body that Rosselló had hoped would oversee the privatization process, then appointed one of its own members as the new CEO. The new head promptly told a San Juan radio station that the $750,000 he’d accepted to work as director of the beleaguered utility was “a sacrifice.” Amid public uproar, the governor asked the board to lower his pay; rather than comply, more than half of the board members resigned in one extraordinary day. By the following week, yet another chief executive had been appointed, the fifth since the storm. In the midst of the shake-up, the governor was on his way to Russia to watch the World Cup soccer finals. Hurricane season was under way, and after the largest blackout in the history of the US, the utility charged with keeping the lights on appeared to be all but leaderless. For workers like Bracero, this was all demoralizing. When we last spoke, he confessed that he’d expected at some point to be named Prepa’s spokesperson, or at least moved to the communications team. But every time he broached the issue, the CEO of Prepa would resign, and Bracero would be back at square one. He still lived an odd double life: at once a public figure and a guy climbing around a power plant in a hard hat, reeking of diesel. He’d been in talks to become an island-wide radio personality, and had in fact been scheduled to go on the air that week. But he’d had to postpone his debut: The San Juan plant was as understaffed as ever, and he had been working double shifts for two weeks straight. “I’ve been doing this for 13 years,” he told me, with weariness in his voice. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep going before he burned out.
