PATRICK McGEEHAN,"“Having all these terminal operators as sort of independent operators complicates J.F.K. and makes it more difficult than any other airport in the country,” Mr. LaHood said. But, he added, Los Angeles International has a similar structure “and they’ve got it down to a fare-thee-well.” Los Angeles does not have to cope with snowstorms, he said, but its airport has had other troubles, including the fatal shooting of a Transportation Security Administration screener in 2013. “They’ve had some serious incidents and they’ve handled it very well,” Mr. LaHood said. Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, said his agency accepted the criticisms in the report and embraced its recommendations for change. He said the emergency operations center would evolve into a “24/7” operations center, though probably not with all 26 entities represented at all times. The Port Authority has addressed another breakdown highlighted in the report by ordering more snow-removal equipment. The report detailed the trouble Kennedy’s crews had clearing snow from the airport’s runways after the Jan. 4 storm, which Mr. LaHood referred to as winter storm Grayson. When the storm’s combination of snow and wind created “whiteout” conditions, airport officials closed Kennedy at about 11 a.m. and said it would reopen at 3 p.m. That reopening time was repeatedly pushed back, first to 6 p.m., then to 8 p.m. and eventually to 7 a.m. the next day. Meanwhile, Kennedy’s airfield became “gridlocked” and “passengers were stuck on inactive planes for unacceptable periods of time,” the report said. Many planes that had taken off for Kennedy from overseas had to turn around or detour to other cities. A total of 8,400 passengers on 28 planes were diverted to O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, where some “were virtually abandoned” because their airlines did not have a presence there, it said. Mr. Cotton has vowed that Kennedy will not get into another jam like that. To help ensure there is no recurrence, the Port Authority has adopted a practice of barring airlines from sending planes to Kennedy during a period when a winter storm is expected unless they have an assurance from a terminal operator that a gate will be available.","Ray LaHood, a former transportation secretary, laid out dozens of changes to avoid a repeat of the failure that followed a fierce January snowstorm.",2018-05-31T22:43:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Report Offers 50 Ways to Avoid the Chaos That Crippled Kennedy Airport,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/nyregion/kennedy-airport-snowstorm-report.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/06/nyregion/01KENNEDY-01/07xp-jfk-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snowstorm,1
ANDY NEWMAN and JONATHAN WOLFE,"The heaviest snow is expected to fall in a relatively narrow area -— no more than 50 miles wide —- that was gradually shifting eastward, said Trent Davis of the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, N.J. “Banding is starting to become a big thing,” he said. “The highest amounts will be where the bands set up.” Pottstown, Pa., northwest of Philadelphia, had six inches as of 11 a.m. Photo Lasha Mgebrishvili sweeping the snow off his car in Brooklyn on Wednesday, but much more is expected. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times The snow moved north gradually. At 11 a.m., parts of New York City had 3 inches of snow, but forecasters are expecting one to two inches an hour to fall throughout the day. “It may seem kind of quaint in the morning, but it’s going to get a lot worse as the day goes by,” said John Homenuk, a meteorologist at New York Metro Weather. If the forecast holds, this could be the biggest spring snowstorm in New York City history. The current record was set on April 3, 1915, when 10 inches fell. The storm is expected to hit Boston by the afternoon rush hour, with as much as nine inches expected. In some areas, the storm is expected to be accompanied by winds gusting up to 50 miles an hour, which — combined with the weight of wet snow — could bring down tree limbs and trigger power failures. Minor to moderate coastal flooding is also expected along the Eastern Seaboard.

Back Story Each week, The Times’s crossword column, Wordplay, highlights the answer to one of the most difficult clues from the previous week’s puzzles. This week’s word: nene. Photo Behold the nene: a rare goose (and a frequent answer in The Times’s crossword). Credit Barry Batchelor/PA, via Associated Press If it looks like a goose and honks like a goose, it should just be a goose, right? The nene, however, is special. Not only is it Hawaii’s state bird, it’s also the world’s rarest goose. Its webbed feet have adapted to living on hardened lava, but it is a weak flier. Nenes were once hunted nearly to extinction, but conservation efforts have bolstered their population. Another reason to know your nenes is that, although rare in the wild, they often come up in crossword puzzles. Nene has been an entry in Times crosswords 295 times since 1944. It appeared in the puzzle on March 12 with the clue “Hawaiian goose.” The word might also appear in easy puzzles with the clue “Hawaiian state bird” or “Hawaiian honker.” Later in the week, as the crosswords become harder, it might be referred to as “Aloha State bird,” “Endangered state bird,” “Lava geese,” “Bird so-called from its call” or “Gray-brown goose.” You can find out about the nene and other birds that appear regularly in our Crossword Aviary.

My concern is that I’m not going to be able to get out of the city later in the day.” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo warned New Yorkers of “an ugly, difficult commute.” “You have to expect a very rough day, right?” he said in an interview on NY1. “It is a combination of snow and wind and frigid temperatures. That is a bad mix. I have been driving around myself this morning. Look at the conditions, they are terrible and only going to deteriorate further through the day.” Cars were skidding and slipping in the suburbs outside New York City.

Most of the disabled cars have been spin outs.” The NYC Ferry suspended service to some of its docks on Thursday morning, but continued to operate other routes on the East River. Aside from a handful of delivery trucks and bike messengers, the major thoroughfares of Astoria were largely empty on Thursday morning, as the storm descended on this northwestern corner of Queens. Cars inched along, with a number of side streets still waiting to be plowed by rush hour. Commuters kept their eyes to the ground, fearful of being battered by the horizontal snow. On the aboveground subway platform at Astoria Boulevard, riders hid behind signs and advertisements to avoid the whipping winds. But on a morning like this, commuters brave enough to face the storm welcomed the unexpected: the subways, at least for the moment, seemed to be running on time.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A snow storm struck the US's south-eastern states over the weekend A heavy snowstorm has swept through the US's south-eastern states, killing at least one person and leaving hundreds of thousands without power. A state of emergency has been declared in North Carolina, with some areas reporting as much as 0.5m (18.5ins) of snow over the weekend. One man died after a tree fell on his car. A search is under way for a driver whose vehicle was found in a river. Thousands of flights were also cancelled across the region. More than 300,000 people were affected by electricity outages in the Carolinas, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia on Sunday, while storm warnings remained in place in the south-east ""especially North Carolina and Virginia"", the National Weather Service (NWS) said in a tweet. The storm was expected to move off the coast on Monday, although the NWS's lead forecaster Michael Schichtel warned it would continue to be ""a dangerous system"". ""It's slow to move off the Carolinas but a saving grace is that it won't hit New England,"" he told Reuters news agency. In some areas, so much snow fell the weight brought power lines crashing down. But the main danger appeared to be on the roads. Almost 60 crashes were reported in Virginia, state police told local media, with the number rising to 500 in North Carolina between midnight and 11:00 local time on Sunday. As a result, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told CNN the state's ""biggest concern"" was not the snow but ""ice making roads even more dangerous"".

A second person was taken to hospital following the accident, WRAL.com said.

NICK CORASANITI,"The storm comes just as many in the region have finally dug out from two relentless storms in early March — the second one left two people dead and thousands of people in New Jersey and the suburbs north of New York City without power for days as utility companies came under scrutiny for their response. Gov. Philip D. Murphy, Democrat of New Jersey, speaking at the train station in Madison, said that he was closely monitoring the coming storm, and was considering declaring a state of emergency to begin around midnight should the forecasts hold true. “Our concerns have somewhat intensified,” Mr. Murphy said, warning residents that the evening commute on Tuesday could turn icy and windy, but that the snow accumulation and storm were unlikely to begin until early Wednesday. Addressing what he called the “the biggest shortfalls” of the last storm, Mr. Murphy said that one of the state’s much-maligned utility companies — Jersey Central Power and Light — had activated 800 workers to respond to the storm, and that all of the utility companies had activated their mutual aid agreements, meaning that they would share resources in response to outages. “We’ve been in touch with them all day,” Mr. Murphy said of the utility companies, and noted that the state Board of Public Utilities was also “center stage” in planning for the storm. He noted that the storms potential for heavy snow, in addition to gusty winds, has the potential for more downed power lines, and urged caution to residents. “Please do not head out into the snow unless you absolutely have to,” he said.

Credit George Etheredge for The New York Times An unyielding winter is about to dump yet another major snowstorm on the New York region, with forecasters projecting significant snow accumulation just as the calendar ticks toward spring. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for northeastern New Jersey and southeastern New York, including all of New York City, saying that snowfall will likely begin early Wednesday morning and that total accumulations of 12 to 16 inches were expected. “Travel will be very difficult to impossible, including during the evening commute on Wednesday,” the service wrote. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would be sending out information on its preparations for the storm later on Tuesday, but did not anticipate Tuesday evening’s commute to be affected. New Jersey Transit had also not issued any advisories for service changes.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"But let’s get you through the next few hours. Here’s what you need to know for your morning commute: • Subways and Long Island Rail Road are running with normal service. • Metro-North Railroad is running on a reduced schedule. The last Hudson Line train from the city will leave Grand Central at 7:59 p.m. • New Jersey Transit has implemented a limited weekday rail schedule and is cross-honoring tickets for rail, buses and private carriers, but not for PATH or NY Waterway ferries. Bus service in North and Central New Jersey may be suspended this afternoon. • Bridges and tunnels are open, and Seastreak and NYC Ferry are operating normally, but may experience delays. • A travel advisory is in effect for all areas east of Interstate 81, essentially, the entire eastern half of New York State. • Amtrak is operating on a modified schedule in the Northeast Corridor. • Check your flight at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark before you head to the airport. Around 500 flights have been canceled at the three airports so far. The storm should blanket the city unevenly, said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Northern Manhattan and the Bronx are expecting seven to 11 inches; Northern Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island should get seven to nine inches; and Southern Queens is looking at four to seven. “The other wrinkle is that there’s a slight chance of thunder this afternoon,” Mr. Maloit said. “If we get it, anyone who’s underneath the thunder snow could get a rate of two to four inches of snow an hour.” Generally, the snow is going to be heavy, wet and mixed with rain in some areas, Mr. Maloit added. (So pull on your winter boots and pack an extra pair of socks.) Wind gusts are expected to reach 45 miles an hour, well below the destructive gusts seen in Friday’s storm, when eight people were killed and more than two million were left without power. (More than 9,000 customers in the city and Westchester still don’t have power.) A costal flood advisory is in effect along Jamaica Bay. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a storm assistance hotline to update the public on shelters, warming shelters and power outages. New Yorkers can call (886) 697-2434 for help. Travel safely this morning.

CEYLAN YEGINSU,"“Nothing works when it snows in England,” said Kevin Hodge, 37, a London-based accountant who had to take a cab to work Wednesday morning because of the severe delays on the subway lines. “We don’t have the right infrastructure or tools in place, so the city comes to a grinding halt, and people can’t go about their business so they start to panic.” But while some commuters said the authorities were overreacting with dire warnings, temperatures in some areas dropped to minus 10 Fahrenheit, making it one of the coldest days in Britain in the past three decades. Hundreds of schools were shut down, roads were closed, and emergency officials said many drivers had to be rescued from stranded vehicles.

The less-extreme amber alert — different from the United States warning about a missing child — was in place for possible disruption of services other parts of Scotland and England, with warnings of more than 19.6 inches of snow in parts of southwestern England. As a new wave of snowfall and freezing cold arrived Wednesday afternoon, Londoners rallied to provide warm food and blankets for homeless people, with volunteers scrambling to refer them to local services for temporary overnight accommodation. “For many, the snow is all fun and games,” said Alex Harper, a volunteer for the homeless charity Shelter. “But there are thousands of homeless people at real risk who could freeze to death in the night.” He added that on Tuesday night a record number of people had been referred to services in any 24-hour period, and that the numbers were expected to go up by Wednesday night. At least nine people have died across Europe this week because of the freezing weather conditions, prompting a Belgian mayor to detain people who refused shelter overnight, The Guardian reported. “These are the kinds of precautions we should be taking,” Mr. Harper added. “There’s all this panic and chaos over canceled flights and trains and changes to plans, but the homeless are at real risk — and during every cold spell they are overlooked.” Even so, some Britons and tourists said the authorities were spreading “disproportionate hype and panic” over the weather.

J. DAVID GOODMAN,"Then the plan went off the rails. On Friday, Mr. Esposito was among a group of city agency commissioners and a deputy mayor, Laura Anglin, who gathered at the office of emergency management in Brooklyn for a report on the six-inch snowstorm on Nov. 15 that stranded evening commuters and some schoolchildren in traffic for hours into the night. The group meeting went smoothly, participants said, but afterward, Mr. Esposito and Ms. Anglin met in his office. It did not go the way it was meant to. Their exchange, centered around the snowstorm, became heated, the official said, and amid their back-and-forth, Ms. Anglin told Mr. Esposito about the plan for his resignation. She was not supposed to do so at that point, the official said, observing that usually someone does not get fired in their own office. He did not take it well, the official said, but Ms. Anglin, as well as senior officials in City Hall, appeared to believe that he would follow what they termed an order. The first deputy commissioner, Calvin Drayton, apparently did so, accepting the request by City Hall that he resign.

Nicole Gallucci,"Snow has started to fall in the United States, but not in the places you might expect. In yet another example of unusual weather this year, the first week of December brought accumulating snow to places like Austin, Texas, Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta, Georgia — places that rarely ever see several inches of snow, let alone experience a snowstorm before Christmas. Snow even fell as far south as Corpus Christi, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. SEE ALSO: Powerful cold front to usher in winter across the U.S., but it may not mean heavy snow The snow in the South has actually preceded the first measurable snow in traditionally snowy places, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. This is an extremely rare occurrence. Confused, surprised, and excited residents of the South have been sharing their views of the snow on Twitter. For Houston — which had temperatures in the 80s Fahrenheit on Thursday — this first winter snowfall could wind up ranking in the city's top 10 heaviest snowfalls in history. Several inches have fallen throughout the metro area. A lightning strike was detected in a band of heavier snow near Corpus Christi on Friday morning, indicating the most elusive of weather phenomena, ""thundersnow.""

""We think we found something you are missing! Let us know how to return it to you!"" Corpus Christi's official NWS Twitter account tweeted alongside a video of snow falling in Texas. Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge shared photos of a snow-covered Tiger Stadium, and other residents posted footage showing flurries still falling, with cars, roofs, and streets already blanketed.

Isn’t the SOUTH supposed to be warmer than the NORTH? pic.twitter.com/oCEZToSI9c — Ahmed Shihab-Eldin (@ASE) December 8, 2017 Sure the timing of the snow in these areas is premature, but what makes these snowfalls even more bizarre is the fact that cities usually dealing with snow by now have yet to experience it. The Lower 48 states have had very little snow cover so far this winter, with just a quarter of this region counted as snow-covered as of Dec. 8, 2017. The same storm system bringing snow to the South and Southeast, though, is forecast to intensify as it moves up the East Coast, eventually blanketing areas from Washington, D.C. to Maine in several inches. So the South may have had a head start, but the Northeast won't have to be jealous for long.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"If the forecast holds, this could be the biggest spring snowstorm in our city’s history. New York City’s largest snowstorm after the vernal equinox was on April 3, 1915, when 10 inches fell. For those lamenting spring’s slow arrival, note that things could be worse. The latest in the season that New York had substantial snowfall was on April 25 (in 1875), when three inches fell on Central Park. And a trace fell on May 29, in 1995. This nor’easter is forecast to drop more snow on New York City than the previous storms this month, the last of which killed two people and left hundreds of thousands in the region without power. Power failures are possible throughout the day. Like earlier this month, we could see some thundersnow, and lots of sleet. What is sleet, exactly? “Sometimes what happens is that, in between a cloud that’s producing snowflakes and the ground, you get a layer of warm air,” Mr. Homenuk said. “The snowflake from the cloud melts into a raindrop in the warm layer, and then passes back into freezing air, and then it refreezes into like an ice pellet.” (Unlike freezing rain, which freezes after it hits the ground.) “When it’s sleeting, you will know,” he added. “Sleet stings. It pings you. It’s not as gentle as a snowflake.” Here’s what else is happening:","Wednesday: The latest on the storm heading toward New York City, and how it could affect your commute.",2018-03-21T09:43:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Spring Snowstorm,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/nyregion/new-york-snowstorm-spring.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/21/nyregion/21nytoday1/21nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snowstorm,1
PATRICK McGEEHAN,"The proposed changes represent “a much stronger hand on the part of the airport in terms of setting operating standards,” Mr. Cotton said. He said the Port Authority would make “a stronger commitment to articulating performance standards and to enforcing them.” The new rule on flights bound for Kennedy when a winter storm is forecast is an unusual restriction, airline industry officials said. The managers at Kennedy may recommend the cancellation of flights scheduled to arrive when storm conditions are predicted to be severe. If an airline decides to launch a flight anyway, it will have to obtain an assurance from a terminal operator that a gate will be available when the plane touches down. That is a departure from standard practices, said Perry Flint, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines. In Europe, he said, airlines are required to have a landing slot, but not necessarily a gate, reserved at destination airports. Mr. Cotton said he was not aware of another airport requiring prior assurance that a gate would be available. That restriction is appropriate at Kennedy, he said, because so much of its traffic is long-haul flights from overseas. The need for it became apparent after Kennedy was overwhelmed in January with more planes arriving than some terminals could handle. In normal conditions, terminal operators and their airline tenants manage to get planes in and out of gates fast enough to keep up with the inbound traffic. But in the days after the snowstorm that swept up the East Coast on Jan. 4, frozen equipment and staffing shortages slowed operations and left some planes parked for hours without gate assignments. In some cases, the Port Authority had to send staircases and buses to rescue passengers from stranded planes. Mr. Flint said his transport association, which has a liaison stationed at the Federal Aviation Administration’s command center in Virginia, had agreed to help facilitate communication between international airlines and the Port Authority and terminal operators. “We look forward to working with the Port Authority and all stakeholders to collaboratively develop procedures based on industry best practices and expertise that will enhance the customer experience going forward,” Mr. Flint said in a statement. Inside two of the terminals at Kennedy in January, baggage-handling procedures broke down, leaving hundreds of pieces of luggage piled up in waiting areas. Some travelers did not get their bags back for days. To prevent a recurrence, Port Authority officials said they would require terminal operators to have a common baggage-service office for airlines that do not have their own. Mr. Cotton said the agency would impose this obligation “so a passenger who is looking for their bag has a clear place to go.” Huntley A. Lawrence, who oversees the airports for the Port Authority, said the agency also would take inventory of all of the equipment at the airport in case it needs to ask an airline to lend a spare piece, “so when you have a winter storm emergency, you’re not scrambling around.” The Port Authority’s primary responsibility in a winter storm is to clear snow and ice from the runways and taxiways. After the January storm, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would investigate how the Port Authority handled snow removal. Mr. Lawrence said he has not learned of the conclusion of that investigation, but the Port Authority has already decided to add snow-moving equipment. “We did see this winter a lot of heavy wet snow,” Mr. Lawrence said. “The heavy, wet snow is more difficult to move.” He said the agency would spend $3.5 million on four snow blowers and $1.4 million on four plows.

Amtrak announced modified service for more than 20 trains on Sunday because of inclement weather, after canceling service for six trains on Saturday.
Snow and wind caused the cancellation of more than 650 flights at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Saturday and resulted in an average delay of 50 minutes, the airport said. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, crews were working to keep runways clear Saturday night, the airport said, as it encouraged travelers to confirm upcoming flights with airlines.
JetBlue announced that it has ""proactively cancelled approximately 770 flights through Monday.""
Delta Airlines has issued travel waivers so passengers scheduled on northeastern flights affected by the weather can reschedule.
Meanwhile, two people were killed and two injured in a car accident on a snow-covered, slippery road in Kohler, Wisconsin late Friday night, according to CNN affiliate WDJT.
The four had been traveling in a vehicle that struck a tree, according to WDJT. Police are still investigating the cause of the accident, WDJT reported.
Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories were in effect Sunday morning across a large portion of the country from the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians to the northern Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service.
The winter storm is expected to drop ""moderate to heavy snow"" Sunday morning across the upper Ohio Valley and into northwest Pennsylvania and the interior of New York and New England, the NWS said.
While snowfall is expected to taper off in the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians during the day, heavy snowfall -- as much as 1-2 inches in some places -- will continue in parts of New York and New England through Sunday night, the weather service said.
New York City can expect cold rain, and Boston will see a mix of heavy, wet snow, sleet and ice through the morning, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. 
The storm has brought harsh conditions across the Midwest and through to the East coast this weekend. 
Following a forecast of more than half an inch of freezing rain between northern New Jersey and southern New England, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning at noon Saturday. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state starting at 3 p.m. Saturday.
On Saturday, more than 100 million people were under some form of winter storm watch, warning or advisory from Missouri to Maine.
'Some of the coldest temperatures of the season'
The National Weather Service said Saturday the Midwest and East Coast can expect ""some of the coldest temperatures of the season by Monday morning.""
Temperatures are expected to drop so fast in some areas that any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects would likely freeze.
Highs on Sunday in the Kansas City, Missouri, area -- where the Chiefs will be host to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game -- will be in the 20s.
The extreme cold will follow the storm and move into the rest of the eastern United States on Monday.
Monday's expected high in Boston is 11 degrees, and New York City will top out at 14 degrees. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency is warning residents the wind chill could drop as low as 20 degrees below zero early Monday.
This arctic air is expected to spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations. First, there's the cold. The first two weeks of April have been the coldest on record for the Upper Midwest, and even some areas to the south, such as Little Rock, Arkansas, have seen temperatures during this period that are far below average. Such extreme cold is noteworthy given trends in the opposite direction related to global warming. The cold set the stage for a blizzard that slammed the Upper Midwest over the weekend. This storm was so severe that it set all-time records, not just milestones for the heaviest spring snowstorm. SEE ALSO: Researchers hit back at climate change deniers twisting polar bear science A staggering 24.2 inches of snow fell in Green Bay, Wisconsin, making it the heaviest April snowstorm on record, and the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm on record at any time of year. Similarly, Wausau, Wisconsin, picked up 20.7 inches of snow, setting an April snowstorm record and making it the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm of all-time at that location. The snowfall jackpot was Amherst, Wisconsin, where 33 inches fell, according to the National Weather Service. Minneapolis, which is no stranger to snow and cold weather, picked up 14.9 inches of snow, making it their heaviest April snowstorm on record. Thundersnow was reported in and around the Twin Cities as the storm intensified, leading to snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour at times. Another, weaker, snowstorm is slated to move across the Midwest during the next 2 days, bringing several inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The thick spring snowpack is raising fears of flooding if temperatures suddenly warm up and heavy rain were to fall in the coming weeks. Then there are the fires. In association with strong storm systems, massive walls of wind-driven flames have swept across the Plains, particularly in Oklahoma, where at least 300,000 acres went up in flames during the past week. Another ""Extremely Critical"" fire weather day looms in the Southwest on Tuesday, including parts of Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, with temperatures soaring into the 90s, winds gusting above 40 miles per hour, and relative humidity plunging to an arid 2 to 5 percent. Average temperature during the first half of April (top) and departures from average (bottom) during the same period. Image: NOAA CPC. The National Weather Service forecast office in Amarillo Texas warned Tuesday morning that ""A regional outbreak of dangerous wind-driven wildfires is possible."" Third, there's the severe weather and flooding. The same storm system that brought blizzard conditions to the Upper Midwest spawned at least a dozen tornadoes across the Southeast on Sunday and Monday, including an EF-2 tornado that struck Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday night. At one point on Monday, a nasty squall line stretched from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic, and rainfall was so intense in New York City that water came pouring into the aging subway system. Air travel was disrupted along the busy East Coast on Monday, particularly at the three major New York City area airports. In Boston, a heavy rain and cold onshore wind challenged runners of the Boston Marathon. And let's not forget the extreme weather whiplash that aggravated millions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic over the weekend, when temperatures in the 70s and 80s Fahrenheit suddenly plunged to the 30s and 40s within a matter of several hours between Saturday and Sunday, thanks to a ""backdoor"" cold front that moved from the northeast to the southwest. Such fronts are most common in the spring, when the temperature difference between the ocean and the land is at its peak. There are some signs of a warmup ahead late in the month and into May, though computer models have shown such glimmers of hope before, only to yank it away at the last minute, in favor of a colder, snowier solution.","The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations.

JULIA JACOBS,"And because Seattle residents are not accustomed to this sort of weather, people are going out of their minds, Professor Mass said. The supermarkets are getting stripped of all food.
In Portland, Ore., which has an average snowfall similar to Seattles, a winter storm warning stretches from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon, and the National Weather Service was forecasting from one to four inches. Up to six inches is expected in areas of higher elevation east of Portland.
Another storm that is predicted for Sunday is likely to keep snowfall totals climbing.
Farther south along the West Coast, heavy snow was expected from Californias northern coast to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. About one to three feet of snow was forecast for the mountainous areas, with four feet likely to fall in parts of Yosemite National Park.
Unlike at Seattles low-lying terrain, the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada makes heavy snowfall common during the winter, Mr. Bann said. After a snowstorm last week, more than 120 visitors and staff members were stranded for five days at Montecito Sequoia Lodge in Kings Canyon National Park, where up to seven feet of snow fell, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Bann said the heavy snow and strong winds likely to hit the mountain range this weekend would make traveling in certain areas difficult to impossible.

The Seattle Times said Friday that the King County Medical Examiners office reported its first death attributed to hypothermia after a man was found at one of the citys light-rail stations earlier in the week. The paper reported the 59-year-old man may have been homeless.
Seattle officials expanded shelter spaces for adults and families in preparation for the nearing storm, with King County Executive Dow Constantine saying at a news conference that if anyone comes to a shelter facility, wethe county, the citywe will find a place for you to be safe overnight, according to the Times.
People in the Washington area are being advised to limit time outside and keep off roads if they can be avoided, Inslee said. Anyone who absolutely must travel and becomes stranded or trapped in their car is advised to stay inside the vehicle rather risk braving freezing temperatures.
The Washington State Department of Transportation also noted that anyone behind the wheel during the snowstorm should use extreme caution around those working to keep roadways safe.
Whether its snowplows or emergency responders, please slow down around road workers and give them as much room as possible, the agency tweeted Friday. The safer they are, the faster they can get things cleared. Help them help you.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Included in the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal is a “bold new approach” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides low-wage working families, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities assistance with buying food. Under the plan, those who receive at least $90 a month from SNAP (the vast majority of recipients) would get about half of their benefits in the form of a “USDA Foods package,” which would include “items such as shelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit, vegetables, and meat, poultry or fish” (in other words, no fresh food). Overall, the budget proposes cuts of $213 billion over ten years to the program. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP aids 40 million people, around 70 percent of which are in families with children. More than 25 percent of participants are in households with seniors or people with disabilities. Currently, SNAP recipients receive a loaded EBT debit card, which they can spend at grocery stores and other authorized retailers. Recipients cannot buy alcohol, cigarettes, vitamin supplements, hot foods or non-grocery household items (like toilet paper or diapers) with the money. The administration writes that this is a “cost-effective approach,” but it’s easy to see how this could be a disaster for people with any type of food allergy, as well as for people who do not have homes or addresses at which they can receive the boxes—and how it could ratchet up costs, considering all of the packaging and shipping costs involved. On Twitter, Annie Lowrey, an economic policy writer for The Atlantic, lays out some very good questions it appears the administration hasn’t fully considered. For example, what happens if there’s a snowstorm or hurricane? More fundamentally, “do poor folks deserve to get to choose their own food?” It’s a good thread worth considering in full.","Included in the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal is a “bold new approach” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides low-wage working families, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities assistance with buyin…",2018-02-13T21:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Some Questions About Trump's New SNAP Proposal,https://twocents.lifehacker.com/some-questions-about-trumps-new-snap-proposal-1822964950,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--o8-u4HxK--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jvobwmaqvmp1as14aque.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,snowstorm,1
MJ Franklin,"*Stretches widely* *Inhales deeply and peacefully* Aaahhh! A snowstorm! Time to bundle up with all your blankets. Time to sip hot chocolate while staring wistfully at the accumulating snow. Time to ask yourself the age old question: ""If I order delivery during this storm, does that make me a trash-ass human?"" SEE ALSO: This comedian's neighbours left her wine in the snow to help beat weather blues The politics of ordering food during a snowstorm, or any storm for that matter, is an moral, ethical, and human decency quagmire. On the one hand, during snowstorms, weather warnings frequently advise citizens to stay off the road, unless for emergency purposes. So skipping out on ordering food seems like the logical and ethical thing to do. But on the other hand, food delivery people augment their hourly income with tips from making deliveries. If a food delivery person has to show up to work, and nobody orders because customers think that ordering food during a storm is rude, are we depriving delivery people of their livelihood? What's a hungry person to do!? Popular wisdom is to order and tip extra: life hack: if you order delivery tonight during the snow storm, tip your driver well for risking their life to bring you pizza — kanye (@queengabbi) January 12, 2018 Reminder to East Coasters: if you order food delivery during a snowstorm, your minimum tip is $20 or 30%, whichever is higher. Hell, go 40% — Dieter Bohn (@backlon) January 4, 2018 New Yorkers: if you're trying to seamless your way through this storm you better tip the HELL out of your delivery person because it is a nightmare out there — Kat Lau (@kat_lau) March 3, 2018 But is that popular wisdom even recommended by the restaurant industry, especially when a storm like today's East Coast nor'easter brings snowfall at a rate of 2 to 4 inches an hour and thundersnow ? To check, we called several New York eateries. One Brooklyn restaurant explained, ""We're open 24 hours. As long as we're open, we can deliver. If we're closed, we'll put up a notice."" Another Manhattan diner echoed the sentiment. ""It's completely okay provided the place is open. I don't think it's wrong to order,"" a customer representative advised. ""But be very patient and expect to wait."" Be very patient and expect to wait. But at the end of the day, the golden rule seems to be: communicate. When it comes to ordering during a storm, the rule of thumb is to play it by ear, explained another Brooklyn restaurant. ""It depends on the severity of the storm. I'd rather people hold off, but you can always call."" Seamless also recommends checking with the restaurant on a case-by-case basis. ""In that type of situation, I would suggest you place your order a little bit earlier,"" a Seamless customer care representative advised. ""We do allow our customers to place their order 24 hours prior. So you can send in your order and give the restaurant a big heads up. And hopefully you can agree on a early enough time when the storm has not hit so hard."" So is there a definitive answer on whether you should order during a snowstorm? Nope! That mystery lives on. But when in doubt, just double check with the restaurant first, and you should be able to enjoy your takeout free of guilt. And if your delivery person arrives caked in snow, the universal way to say ""thank you for braving the storm"" is by giving an extra generous tip.","*Stretches widely* *Inhales deeply and peacefully* Aaahhh!

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"My apologies to anyone who doesn’t happen to live in the Northeastern United States. I don’t want you to feel bad for us. But I do want you to recognize the fact that we’ve been walloped with four enormous snowstorms in three weeks. Adding insult to injury, the most recent one occurred the day after spring “began.” Perhaps this GIF will properly illustrate what we dealt with: For those of you who don’t often look at maps, that’s the southern two-thirds of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Northern Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. On March 18th, they are all mostly snow-free with the exception of Western New York and the Appalachians. On March 22nd, they’re all completely blanketed. NASA’s Aqua satellite took image one, while MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete ) took image two. You can pretty clearly see the foot-plus of snow it dropped across the area, including over 16 inches near Washington, DC, and 20 inches on Eastern Long Island, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. Late-winter/early spring snowstorms aren’t all that rare, despite how badly they suck. And they really do suck: This most recent one left over 90,000 without power, reports NBC. This hell-cycle probably won’t last, though. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) projects a higher probability that much of the US will be warmer than colder this spring, with potential for worsening drought in the southwest, as we’ve reported. However, there’s a greater-than-average chance that the Northeast will be wetter than normal. Also, climate change or whatever, etc. Anyway, hopefully spring has really begun now, and this will be the last time you hear people from over here complain about the weather. At least until hurricane season starts. [ NASA ]","My apologies to anyone who doesn’t happen to live in the Northeastern United States. I don’t want you to feel bad for us.

AFP,"NINE members of a South Korean climbing expedition were killed after a violent snowstorm swept them off a cliff on Nepals Mount Gurja, one of the deadliest mountaineering accidents to hit the Himalayan nation in recent years. The bodies of eight climbers — four South Koreans and four Nepali guides — were spotted near the wreckage of their camp by a rescue team Saturday morning, but strong winds were hampering the search effort. A fifth South Korean climber was initially reported missing, but officials later confirmed he was at the camp when the deadly storm hit Friday and also perished. “A mountain expedition of five South Korean nationals and four foreigners were swept off by strong winds at the base camp during their climb to Mount Gurja. (They) fell off a cliff and died,” the South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement. Helicopter pilot Siddartha Gurung was among the first people to reach the site after the deadly storm and described a scene of total destruction. He said all the tents had been flattened, reduced to a tangled mess of tarpaulin and broken polls, scattered across a wide area, including some in a river bed 500 metres from the main camp. “Everything is gone, all the tents are blown apart,” Mr Gurung told AFP. The freak storm is the deadliest incident to hit Nepal’s mountaineering industry since 18 people were killed at Mount Everest’s base camp in 2015 in an avalanche triggered by a powerful earthquake. The previous year, 16 Sherpas were killed on Everest when an avalanche swept through the Khumbu Icefall during the busy spring climbing season. Then in October, a blizzard killed more than 40 tourists and their guides in the Annapurna region, a disaster that was largely blamed on poor weather forecasting and lacklustre safety standards in Nepal’s poorly regulated trekking industry. Mountain weather is known for being unpredictable with strong winds capable of throwing a person off balance. In April, an Italian climber died after he was blown off Mount Dhaulagiri, the world’s seventh highest peak which neighbours Mount Gurja. But the Italian was at 6,900 metres when his tent was swept off the mountain, whereas the South Korean team were below 4,000 metres when they were hit by powerful winds. “The fact that they were so low when it happened is unusual,” said experienced German climber Billi Bierling, who was forced to call off her own summit bid on Dhaulagiri last month because of heavy snowfall and high winds. Dan Richards of Global Rescue, a US-based emergency assistance group that will be helping with the rescue effort, said it was unclear how a freak storm at a relatively low altitude turned so deadly. “It is hard to understand how this occurred given the depth of (mountaineering) experience among the group,” he said. The expedition was being lead by feted South Korean climber Kim Chang-ho, who in 2013 became the fastest person to summit the world’s 14 highest mountains without using supplemental oxygen. The team had been on 7,193-metre Mount Gurja since early October, waiting for a window of good weather so they could attempt to reach the summit, hoping to do so via a never-climbed route. Rarely-climbed Gurja was first summited in 1969 by a Japanese team but no one has stood on its summit for 22 years, according to the Himalayan Database. Four climbers have previously perished on Gurja’s flanks and a total of 30 have successfully reached its peak — a fraction of the more than 8,000 people who have summited Everest, the world’s highest mountain. Thousands of climbers flock to Nepal each year — home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks — creating a lucrative mountain tourism industry that is a vital source of cash for the impoverished country","NEWS.com.au A deadly snowstorm in Nepal has killed at least nine climbers NEWS.com.au NINE members of a South Korean climbing expedition were killed after a violent snowstorm swept them off a cliff on Nepal's Mount Gurja, one of the deadliest mountaineering a…",2018-10-13T18:15:38Z,"{'id': 'news-com-au', 'name': 'News.com.au'}",A deadly snowstorm in Nepal has killed at least nine climbers - NEWS.com.au,https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/a-deadly-snowstorm-in-nepal-has-killed-at-least-nine-climbers/news-story/59a6ee1050fa9cc7b500c4a73880672b,https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c4cc9707c3ebc4853ded98783ea76aeb?width=650,news-com-au,News.com.au,snowstorm,1

ERIC MOSKOWITZ,"Waiting for the first real snow of winter is an annual exercise in anticipation and dread, with the accompanying hallmarks invariably falling into place: breathless headlines, familiar checkout line chatter, readying the shovels and snowblowers, restocking the cocoa, bracing for traffic tie-ups and rail delays or perhaps doing nothing at all. 
If that all feels eternal, consider what it was like to endure a snowstorm in a time before Gore-Tex and Doppler radar, snow blowers and plow trucks, subway commutes and automobile windshields actually, before automobiles. Instant hot chocolate didnt become a supermarket staple until the 1940s, and it took Swiss Miss until 1972 to roll out a revolutionary cocoa mix with mini marshmallows already inside. (Whatll Swiss Miss think of next, the first ads asked.)
Early New York Times photographs of snowstorms really capture the havoc, misery and peril a blizzard could visit on the city in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Blizzard of 1888, for example, dumped 21 inches of snow on the city and killed an estimated 200 New Yorkers. But even a garden-variety snowstorm in those days would menace the citys main form of transit horses and impose human suffering of all kinds, while posing the immense logistical challenge of clearing an entire city of snow.
Still, then as now, snow slowed the city down in a stop-and-look-around way.

A winter storm warning is in effect until 1 a.m. Expect six to eight inches of snow, strong winds and temperatures below freezing.

Light to moderate snow began falling in New York City around 5 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. Schools in New York City are closed, as are many others across the region ( see the list here ). Commuters are encouraged to avoid driving and use mass transit when possible.

Andrew Freedman,"The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is pummeling the East Coast, bringing heavy snow and sleet to the most populated part of the U.S., from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston on Wednesday. The storm formed overnight on Tuesday as a strong low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere approached the East Coast and helped spark a surface area of low pressure off the coast of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. The low pressure area is intensifying as it moves slowly northeastward, spreading areas of heavy snow inland. SEE ALSO: Does ordering delivery during a snowstorm make me a trash human? This is likely to be the biggest snowstorm for so late in the season on record in Washington, D.C., and it could be the biggest March snowstorm in Philadelphia, where about a foot of snow is expected. More than a foot of snow could pile up in New York City if conditions come together just right, potentially making it one of the top storms for so late in the season. Further north in Boston it will probably just rank as a moderate to heavy spring snowstorm, but not a historic event. The 4th nor'easter of the month as seen from space on March 21, 2018. Image: noaa. The storm is snarling travel across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, with most flights in and out of New York's airports and Philadelphia canceled on Wednesday, and significant disruptions at Washington area airports as well. One feature of the storm forecast has been a dichotomy between the National Weather Service's (NWS) snowfall predictions and those of private sector forecasters. The NWS has both Philadelphia and New York City in a zone of 12-to-18-inch accumulations, whereas reliable media outlets have been predicting less, on the order of 6-to-12 inches, based in part on the high March sun angle and likelihood of a mix between snow and sleet at times. In addition, the precise location of the most intense bands of snow, known as ""mesoscale bands"" because of their small dimensions, is difficult to forecast beyond an hour or two in advance. It's the areas that experience these bands for the longest period of time that will wrack up the highest snow totals, while areas just a few miles away could see half as much snow. Thundersnow also typically occurs in these bands as well. The forecast has been particularly challenging this time because of disagreements between leading computer models, as well. The European model — statistically the most accurate global weather model for the medium time range — suggested far lower snowfall amounts on Tuesday afternoon, which raised forecasters' blood pressure considerably. But other models held steady, predicting serious snow accumulation in big cities. The Weather Service has been warning that this will be a high-impact storm, particularly for the Philadelphia area and New York City, where power outages and ""impossible"" travel conditions are expected by the evening commute, as narrow bands of very heavy snow pivot across this region on the northwest side of the low pressure area. While it's unusual to see four nor'easters in a row, this is not unheard of. The Weather Prediction Center tweeted an example of such an occurrence in December and January of 1987. However, there is statistical evidence showing that slow-to-breakdown weather patterns that can lead to extreme outcomes, such as heat waves and heavy precipitation events, are becoming more common as the climate warms in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. One study, published in the journal Nature Communications on March 13, tied warming Arctic winters and sea ice loss to an increase in intense winter storms along the East Coast of the U.S. However, the precise physical mechanisms that cause Arctic warming to alter weather patterns well outside the Far North have not yet been well-established in the scientific literature, and this is an area of active research and debate in the weather and climate communities. A general explanation of what's been going on so far this March, however, is that the jet stream — the highway of air moving from west-to-east at around 35,000 feet, which steers weather systems and helps energize them — has been repeatedly taking big dips across the East Coast. Right now, the jet stream has a sharp bend to it, carving out a low pressure area in the middle of the curve, or trough. What a dip, or trough, in the jet stream looks like on a weather map. Image: weatherbell analytics Other factors have influenced the fusillade of nor'easters, including a pattern of air pressure over the North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as a strong blocking pattern of high pressure near Greenland that is holding up weather systems like a stop light at an intersection. A Greenland block, which typically consists of a persistent area of high pressure, is considered a prerequisite to causing some of the biggest East Coast snowstorms on record, since it forces the jet stream to dive southward across the eastern U.S., and allows storms time to intensify. A blocking pattern can also force storms to move close to the coast, and sometimes even forces them to move backwards, from east-to-west, prolonging heavy snow, strong winds, and coastal flooding. The storm on Wednesday will move fast enough to avoid causing severe coastal flooding, but if the NWS is right, and a foot-and-a-half of snow falls in some parts of the Washington to Boston corridor, this event will still go down in history as one of the biggest snowstorms for so late in the season.","The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is pummeling the East Coast, bringing heavy snow and sleet to the most populated part of the U.S., from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston on Wednesday.

“Any water that remains on the road will freeze into a sheet of ice and make conditions quite hazardous,” said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS). 
Sub-zero temperatures tied to gusting winds prompted the NWS to issue wind chill advisories and warnings for more than 10 states, from North Dakota and other parts of the central United States to East Coast metropolitan centers including Washington, New York and Boston. 
It will be a roller-coaster ride for temperatures, with Sunday’s warm start melting overnight snow and threatening flooding in areas including southeastern Massachusetts. By evening, temperatures were expected to dive into a dangerous flash freeze. 
High temperatures for Monday are forecast at 17 Fahrenheit (minus 8 Celsius) for New York City, and 12 F (minus 11 C) for Boston. 
“Behind this winter storm is a lot of cold air that has been dropping south from Canada,” said Otto by telephone from College Park, Maryland. “You combine that with winds gusting between 20 and 30 miles an hour and you have pretty dangerous windchills of 10 to 30 below zero.” 
The storm has already dropped heavy snow in Pennsylvania, although the deepest amount reported was 16 inches (41 cm) in the northern New York town of Lake Desolation, he said. It was headed for Maine, where it was expected to lay a white carpet up to 2 feet deep. 
While the mercury will dive in the Northeast, forecasters say it is unlikely to fall below the storm’s current low of minus 46 Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) recorded in Cotton, Minnesota. 
The wintry weather has contributed to travel disruption across the United States during a busy holiday weekend, with 1,458 flight cancellations and 989 flight delays by mid-morning on Sunday, according to FlightAware.com. 
Amtrak canceled or modified its Sunday train service from Boston to Washington and between Chicago and the East Coast.

,"At a Glance The snowstorm that dropped at least 4 inches on the capital created travel disruptions. A record number of traffic jams were reported. Paris was hit Tuesday by a relatively rare accumulating snowstorm that resulted in travel chaos and a record number of traffic jams. The storm dropped at least 4 inches on the capital, forcing the shutdown of bus service in the city that relies heavily on public transportation. The storm also hampered France's high-speed train system and the region's commuter trains. The city's subway system was running at 50 percent on several lines. Dozens of flights out of Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports were canceled or postponed, although the airports remained open, Le Monde reported. Paris saw a record number of traffic jams in the city, with many people stuck for hours, according to authorities.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Moscow got more than 18 inches of snow on Sunday and Monday, the typical total for a month. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin called it “the snowfall of the century,” according to Reuters. The heavy snowfall has already killed one, injured at least 22, and destroyed more than 2,000 trees—just from the snow weight. This snowstorm was so bad that Russia even had to send in the military: 100 soldiers, two snow plows, and a truck came through one Moscow district to clear the snow. And, of course, schools were closed Monday. The last time it snowed this bad in Moscow was back in 1957, reports CNN. Most of the human injuries were related to traffic incidents, so city officials are asking residents to stay home or use public transportation. The main point, though: Don’t get in your car and drive. Even walking seems a little tricky with these conditions. “I have just left home but have already fallen over because the snow has not been cleared from the pavement,” Lilya Belkina, a resident, told Reuters. “It is very difficult to cross the road.” It’s been difficult for planes to take off, too. More than 100 flights were delayed, and almost 30 flights were canceled. After all, not only did snow strike the city; temperatures dipped to five degrees Fahrenheit, though they should reach 12 degrees in the next couple of days. At least it won’t be snowing anymore.

SHAWN MARSH,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) Exhausted commuters pointed fingers and demanded answers Friday, a day after a modest snowstorm stranded motorists on slippery roads for hours, paralyzed the public transit network serving New York City and its suburbs and even forced some New Jersey children to stay overnight in their schools. How, they asked, could a few inches of snow in a region used to this sort of weather lead to such chaos? ""Clearly we could have done better and we will do better,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a ""full review."" ""We're all unhappy with what happened,"" he said. The storm, which had earlier socked the South and Midwest, swept into the New York City metro area just before the evening commute Thursday before heading north into New England overnight. The snowfall totals were modest in most places 6 or 7 inches (15 or 18 centimeters) but it was unusually icy and thousands of slow-speed car crashes led to gridlock that made it tough for plows to get through. In West Orange, New Jersey, more than a hundred students stayed late into the night, some until morning, at a middle school after buses became stranded for hours and turned back. Staffers stayed overnight and made dinner for students who couldn't get home. ""It was so long, I'm just excited to go home and go to sleep,"" student Breanna Dannestoy told NBC New York. Some New York City schoolchildren were stuck on buses for up to five hours. The last one got home at 3 a.m. Friday, Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said. Murphy, a Democrat, said ""lousy"" forecasts were partly to blame. He took a pounding on social media from people complaining about his handling of the storm, including one of his highest-profile constituents. Former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, tweeted at Murphy that it took him nearly six hours to travel roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers). Murphy didn't respond directly to his predecessor. Gary Szatkowski, former chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service in New Jersey, said on Twitter that it was the state's poorly executed snow removal plan, not meteorologists, who screwed up. ""They were planning to clean up while freezing rain/sleet were pouring down out of the sky. That's not a plan; that's a recipe for disaster,"" he tweeted. De Blasio, a Democrat, said forecasts had led city officials to expect just an inch of snow. That meant city buses weren't equipped with snow chains and salters weren't out treating the roads ahead of the storm. The wintry weather also caused a traffic nightmare in Pennsylvania, with numerous vehicles stuck for several hours from the Lehigh Valley to the New Jersey state line. Police sometimes drove on the opposite side of the highway, honking their horns to wake up drivers who had fallen asleep while sitting in traffic. Tens of thousands of businesses were without power Friday in Pennsylvania, mostly in the western part of the state. Among the odd storm sights there was a camel named Einstein. The animal was en route to an event put on by a Jewish organization when the vehicle he was traveling in became stuck north of Philadelphia, the group said. Einstein was not able to make it to his destination, as his handlers turned back to Peaceable Kingdom Petting Zoo where they started. Some drivers woke up in their cars Friday morning after being stuck overnight on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. A multicar pileup on the George Washington Bridge partially choked off one of the three vehicle crossings across the Hudson River. Buses stopped running, causing New York City's major bus terminal to fill with passengers to such dangerous levels that officials closed the doors and had people line up around the block. As many as 17 inches (43 centimeters) of snow fell in some areas of upstate New York. Many schools in upstate New York and northern New England were delayed or closed. In Vermont, aside from the region's traffic nightmare, the storm was a boon for Vermont's ski resorts. Okemo Mountain and Stowe Mountain Resort opened Friday as the snow continued to fall. Sugarbush is opening Saturday. Killington Resort is already open and other ski areas plan to open later this month. Some areas of Massachusetts received more than 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow in the storm, which turned to rain overnight to complicate the morning commute. State police said a stretch of the Massachusetts Turnpike east was closed Friday morning after several tractor-trailer crashes. ___","Philly.com Finger pointing, frustration in eastern US storm's aftermath Philly.com TRENTON, N.J.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"Credit Claire O'Neill/The New York Times In the middle of a nor’easter that disrupted travel in the Northeast and inundated areas already drenched from last week’s storm, some New Yorkers and others on the East Coast made a resounding discovery: “thundersnow.” The curious phenomenon, when thunder and lighting are heard and seen during a snowstorm, has been documented since at least the year 1099. But its rarity — a 2009 analysis found that only 0.07 percent of snowfalls are accompanied by thunder — means that it never ceases to excite. The captivating nature of thundersnow was documented in an article in The New York Times on Sept. 24, 1884 : “I don’t believe there has been a thunderstorm that I have witnessed for the past 30 years,” said a gentleman of this city, “which has not given me occasion to ask scores of people if they had ever seen a thunder and lightning snowstorm, and I never met but one yet, besides myself who ever had.” (That gentleman’s stories about thundersnow must have never gotten old.) There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&amp;M University. The first, which is most common to the central United States, mirrors the way regular thunderstorms are formed: Warmer, moist air close to the ground rises and mixes with colder, denser air higher up in the atmosphere. As the hot air moves up and the cold air moves down, the atmospheric instability can trigger lightning and the thunder that comes with it. In the case of a thundersnow event, air closer to the ground is just warm enough to rise and create atmospheric mixing, but it’s still cold enough that falling snow can stay frozen. This often happens in the Rockies, when the mountains trap pockets of warm air. “The air is cold enough down low that as the frozen precipitation falls out of it, it never encounters a warm enough layer of air to melt,” said Dr. Nielsen-Gammon. So instead of rain and lightning, there’s snow and lightning. The second scenario tends to happen around the Great Lakes in early winter. A thunderstorm develops even though temperatures are very cold, thanks to the relatively warm moist air that comes from the lakes. It’s intertwined with the same conditions that bring the region its lake effect snow. In the third scenario the low pressure of a powerful winter storm creates strong upward motions in the air, generating the atmospheric instability that in a typical thunderstorm would be driven by temperature changes. This is likely what led to New York City’s thundersnow. Even when the conditions are right, you won’t always notice the thunder. Snow is more likely to absorb the light of lightning and the sound of thunder than rain. But thundersnow tends to be accompanied by heavier snowfall, which you may indeed notice when your commute is snarled.","There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, but it always brings the element of surprise.",2018-03-08T00:25:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How Thundersnow Happens: With Considerable Difficulty,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/climate/thundersnow.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/07/climate/cli-thundersnow/cli-thundersnow-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snowstorm,1

(Photo: AccuWeather) Another coastal storm — the fourth to make its way to the Northeast this month — is now expected to track farther south and spare winter-weary residents of the Lower Hudson Valley. However, forecasters think we’re still in for a snowy start to Spring 2018. Meteorologists are monitoring another system, which might deliver some snow between Tuesday night into Wednesday. NOR'EASTER: Con Ed reimbursing customers for spoiled food, medicine OUTAGES: 'Deficient' mutual aid system to blame for utility companies slow response How close the storm tracks to the coast will determine whether places like New York and New England see a little snow or get walloped with another high-impact storm, AccuWeather says. Forecast guidance, as of now, shows it passing far enough offshore to not pose a major threat, however. The National Weather Service notes, it is too early to know for sure and has not, as of Sunday afternoon, issued any watches or advisories for the area. On Tuesday, spring officially begins at 12:15 p.m. After the next week or so — which includes potentially another messy wintry mix over the weekend — we may start to feel more spring-like. Temperatures should begin trending up towards where they should be this time of year, according to AccuWeather’s long-range forecast for the month. By the end of March, highs each day are expected to reach into the lower to mid-50s, the forecast says. On Saturday, a nor’easter that forecasters believed could pose a threat to the tri-state tracked further south and east, reducing the chances it would significantly impact the area. Now, it’s expected to sweep through southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as much of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia between Monday night and into Tuesday. Nor’easters on March 2 and 7 moved up the coast and walloped the Lower Hudson Valley, causing power outages for about 190,000 customers — the majority of them in Westchester County, where hind winds and wet snow toppled trees onto power lines. The third nor’easter, on March 12, grazed most of the New York City area but dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of Long Island and Connecticut. The week ahead: Monday: Mostly sunny, high of 41 and low of 25 Tuesday: Cloudy and cold, high 39 and low 26. Wednesday: Wintry mix in the morning. High: 40, low: 26 Thursday: Mainly sunny with a high of 43 and low of 28 Friday: Mostly sunny. High of 45, low of 28 Saturday: Cloudy.

JAMES BARRON,"Friday dawned clear and sunny, but the Weather Service forecast more cold for the weekend, with wind chills plunging to 10 to 15 degrees below zero in New York City on Friday night. Jasmine Blake, a spokeswoman for the housing agency, said the problems with heat dated to last weekend, when cold temperatures settled in and additional employees were assigned to round-the-clock duty. The snowstorm complicated repair efforts that were already underway, including, she said, in 32 buildings “where we know we have the most chronic issues.” From 6 a.m. to midnight in those places, she said, someone was assigned to do “constant monitoring” for problems with heat. The agency said that on average, heat was restored within five hours of a breakdown. The city’s public advocate, Letitia James, said in an interview that her office had received calls about the lack of heat from public housing developments across the city. She said the problems affected vulnerable residents, as in the case of a family at Drew Hamilton Houses in Harlem dealing with no heat and a baby with a fever of 101 degrees. “We need the boilers replaced, period,” Ms. James said, adding that reductions in federal money for public housing had begun long ago. “At the end of the day, Washington is not coming in on a white horse,” she said. “The city and state has to show them by being responsible.” Continue reading the main story","In the Lower East Side home that Patricia Elcock shares with her grandson Michael, the oven door was left open to provide heat.",2018-01-05T22:33:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","For Many Public Housing Residents, It’s Cold Inside, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/nyregion/for-many-public-housing-residents-its-cold-inside-too.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/06/nyregion/06cold1/06cold1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snowstorm,1
,"The first snow of the year is on the way just a couple of weeks before Christmas thanks to a massive winter storm that will travel from Texas up to Maine. Some parts of Massachusetts could get more than three to six inches of heavy, wet snow, with higher accumulation totals piling up further inland. The storm system will move up along the coastline and bring a mix of rain and snow to the area beginning Saturday mid-morning and continuing through the overnight hours. The heaviest precipitation will occur from 11 a.m. until about 11 p.m. on Saturday. The moisture from the storm is actually the same moisture that dropped early snow on Texas yesterday. Some energy from Canada will merge with that moisture off the coastline Saturday to form our coastal storm. A few areas may go above the 3 to 6 inch range, I am predicting. The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory lasting from 4 a.m. on Saturday until 7 a.m. on Sunday, forecasting 3 to 6 inches for a large swath of the state and a small chance of 7 to 8 inches in the central hills of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Rain vs. Snow Cape Cod and the islands will likely get soaked with rain, and any snow that occurs will be minimal. The outer tip of Cape Ann will also likely end up with some rain, although there could be a slushy coating to a couple of inches. South of Boston, along the South Shore roads, the precipitation may flip back and forth between rain and snow, resulting in lesser snow totals there as well. If the storm jogs a little west or east, however, the rain could push inland or the snow could push toward the coast, so coastal dwellers should be aware that the forecast could change the most for you. The snow will be on the heavier and wetter side. You likely have noticed that some of the trees, especially Japanese maples, are holding onto their leaves right now. This is because that dramatic cold which occurred in November while the plants were growing stopped the abscission process and left the leaves on these trees. Because of that, some of the heavier snow could do some damage. It’s not a bad idea if you can very gently shake the snow off during the storm if it looks like these trees are getting really weighed down. This isn’t the type of storm that’s going to shut down Logan Airport or create long-term travel issues. This is a typical moderate December snow storm. You should leave yourself extra time to get to where you’re going, as roads will be slick much of the afternoon and evening on Saturday. We could see lighter snow showers Saturday overnight, but Sunday will see clearing skies and cold temperatures. A second storm on the horizon? This bout of winter weather isn’t over yet. There is another storm we need to watch for later Tuesday and Wednesday. However that storm shakes out, much colder arctic air is also set to arrive by the end of next week. Temperatures will be well below normal for several days.","Boston.com A heavy, wet snowstorm is headed toward New England Boston.com The first snow of the year is on the way just a couple of weeks before Christmas thanks to a massive winter storm that will travel from Texas up to Maine.

KAREN ZRAICK,"Its going to be a messy week across much of the United States and parts of Canada.
A snowstorm that already pummeled the Seattle area is moving through the Midwest and heading toward the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. Farther south, moisture moving in from the Gulf of Mexico will result in heavy rains, thunderstorms and, possibly, flash floods from Louisiana to Ohio. Those two systems are going to merge by Tuesday morning.
Elsewhere, the Bay Area in California is expecting an atmospheric river. (More on that below.) And the Northwest, which was still cleaning up after unusually heavy snowfall last week, was getting a fresh coat of snow from another storm.
Significant flight and transit delays and cancellations are expected, officials said, and downed trees and power disruptions are also possible. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, more than 275 flights were canceled by midday on Monday.
David Roth, a forecaster at the National Weather Service, reiterated the official advice to stockpile three to seven days of nonperishable food if you are in an area that could get heavy snow.",A storm will move through the Midwest and into the Northeast; there will be heavy rain moving north from Louisiana; and the Northwest will get even more snow.,2019-02-11T22:04:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Snow, Sleet and a Wintry Mix: Expect Messy Weather This Week",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/snow-storm-weather.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/us/12xp-storm/12xp-storm-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snowstorm,1
Andrew Freedman,"The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is taking shape across the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm is expected to become the biggest late-March snowstorm on record from Washington, D.C. to New York City. The fact that the storm is hitting on the first full day of spring is twisting the metaphorical knives in the backs of millions who are weary of shoveling snow, enduring power outages, and facing more travel disruptions. SEE ALSO: Climate change could force millions of people to move within countries This storm has the potential to shatter March snowfall records in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York, where up to a foot or more of snow is possible. Some spots in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey could approach 2 feet, if computer model projections on Tuesday afternoon prove to be correct. The snowstorm will result from an area of low pressure taking shape in the Carolinas on Tuesday. The storm will intensify as it moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast, throwing copious amounts of moisture from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico inland, where the air is cold enough to support snow. The heaviest snow will fall in narrow bands just 10 to 20 miles wide. These are known as ""mesoscale bands,"" since they are so localized, and they form where the strongest atmospheric lift is located. Within such bands, snow could fall at up to 2 inches an hour or greater, whereas in between them, it will be snowing at slower rates, bringing far lower accumulations. The heaviest snows are forecast for the Mid-Atlantic region, with considerable uncertainty about whether the higher snow totals will reach New York City and Boston, as computer models suggest a storm track further offshore than previously thought. Even so, this will still be a major event for the I-95 corridor. It is also a prime example of what can happen when highly amplified weather patterns are established and are exceedingly slow to break down. Let's face it — the atmosphere is stuck in a rut, with the jet stream, the highway of fast-flowing air at about 35,000 feet — setting off one nor'easter after the other as if someone forgot to hit the ""off"" switch. Unlike the past three storms, though, this one is not expected to deliver its most severe impacts to the Boston area, but rather focus on Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Wilmington, and central New Jersey. It won't take much more than a foot of snow to set all-time snowfall records for this late in the month of March in New York and Philadelphia, both of which are within reach if the storm tracks close enough to the coastline to bring the heaviest snow to these areas. The latest nor'easter, so named because the winds in such storms blow predominantly from the northeast, is occurring at a time when the overall climate is warming due largely to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels for energy. Therefore, it might seem paradoxical to have so many late-season snowstorms. However, in a way, this repetitive fusillade of snow events may be what global warming looks like, for two main reasons. Firstly, it will still snow in a warmer world, and there has been a well-documented increase in heavy precipitation events during the warm and cold seasons across the U.S., tied to the atmosphere's ability to hold more moisture as air temperatures increase. Therefore, when it snows, the odds could gradually favor heavier snowstorms, rather than moderate ones. That’s a major increase in precipitation amounts on the Euro across much of NJ, E PA, NYC and Long Island compared to last nights run. Tighter gradient on the northern fringes. Big time snows south of that gradient! pic.twitter.com/IxAjEarjJu — John Homenuk (@jhomenuk) March 20, 2018 Second, some researchers have been noticing an increasingly common tendency for weather patterns to get stuck in place, as large north-to-south undulations in the jet stream are slow to break down, thereby causing extended periods of extreme weather. The physical mechanisms behind jet stream tendencies are not yet well-established, but many of the most severe weather extremes in recent years have been associated with such stuck weather patterns. In addition, there is also some statistical evidence linking rapid Arctic climate change to increased snowstorm activity along the East Coast during the mid-to-late winter months. As for this particular storm, though, one consolation is that the snow will melt far faster under the spring sun than it would've had this nor'easter parade occurred in January. Also, you might not want to hear this, but there are some signs of a fifth nor’easter potentially forming next week, soon after the snow from this one has melted.","The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is taking shape across the Mid-Atlantic states.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Dog plays in US snow A heavy storm has brought a record amount of snow to the US city of Erie on Christmas Day, forcing officials to declare a state of emergency. A total of 34in (86cm) of snow blanketed the city and surrounding areas in the Pennsylvania state. There was no respite on Boxing Day, with meteorologists registering a grand total of 60in over the two-day period. Police warned motorists that ""roads are dangerous and impassable"", with a number of closures reported. More snow is forecast on Wednesday. The officials say the heavy snowstorm is the result of lake-effect snow - when cold air combines with lake water.

The National Weather Center Cleveland on Christmas Day registered a new all-time high for any single day, beating the previous record set in 1956. The state's two-day snowfall record from 1944 was also shattered, as well as a storm total snowfall and a monthly snowfall. How are local residents affected? A number of cars and homes were buried in snow, with some residents having to shovel their way out. Shops and childcare centres were closed. Some flights to and from the Erie International airport were cancelled. Meanwhile, social media users have been publishing amazing pictures from the area.","A heavy storm brings a record amount of snow to the US city of Erie, burying homes and cars.",2017-12-27T05:23:15Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Snow emergency in US town after huge storm,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42490329,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05s3239.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,snowstorm,1

From St. Louis to the South and into the Northeast, snow, freezing rain, and in some parts, sleet, made driving tricky and closed schools Thursday. In New York City, the wet snowfall and wind gusts Thursday downed numerous tree branches. Police advised people to stay indoors and avoid the roads. Commuters also were advised to avoid the Port Authority Bus Terminal - which is also used by some to travel to New Jersey - due to overcrowding. By 5:30 p.m., the terminal had become an immovable block of wall-to-wall commuters all gazing up at the schedule board. Lines of people waited to get into the terminal as officials urged them to take trains or ferries. The poor weather made it difficult for buses to reach the terminal, officials said. And a multi-vehicle accident on the George Washington Bridge and the closure of the Bayonne Bridge connecting Staten Island to New Jersey added to the traffic nightmare. A mayoral spokesman said the early storm meant that Metropolitan Transportation Authority didn't have snow chains on its buses. He said many of them had to pull over, ""further clogging streets."" There were scattered delays on the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit reported 30-minute delays systemwide. Flight delays of up to an hour were reported at JFK, LaGuardia and Newark airports. In New Jersey, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie tweeted that it took him five hours and 40 minutes to commute from Piscataway to Mendham, a roughly 26-mile (41-kilometer) journey that normally takes about 40 minutes. Forecasters said the snow should change to rain overnight. As much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow blanketed the St. Louis area, and forecasters predicted up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) in parts of southern New England as the storm made its way east. They also predicted northern New Jersey could see 4 to 8 inches of snow before the system exits the region early Friday, while parts of suburban Philadelphia had 5 inches (12 centimeters ) of snow by Thursday afternoon. Weather officials said the overnight trace in Alabama missed setting a record for earliest snow by about two weeks. In neighboring Mississippi, a tour bus bound for a casino overturned, killing two people and injuring 44 others Wednesday afternoon. Witnesses said the driver lost control after crossing an icy overpass and the bus rolled over on its driver's side, coming to rest in an interstate median, Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Capt. Johnny Poulos said. The crash happened about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southeast of downtown Memphis, Tennessee. ""All of a sudden the bus started swerving then it spun around two times, hit the rail and then flipped over,"" bus passenger Veronica Love told news outlets as she left a hospital after the wreck. ""The second spin, it started picking up speed. It was, I mean, what could you do?"" Later Wednesday night, near Little Rock, Arkansas, three people were killed in separate crashes on icy roads. The interstate was closed and reopened shortly before daybreak Thursday, but officials said traffic was slow-going because some drivers had fallen asleep. Officials in Ohio reported at least one traffic death that was likely weather-related. Indiana State Police also reported a death early Thursday, which they said was caused by the 60-year-old woman driving too fast on a slick road. In Philadelphia, a meteorologist told the Allentown Morning Call that this storm is ""an overperformer."" By 3 p.m. Thursday, parts of suburban Philadelphia had 5 inches of snow. The freezing rain turned to ice on roads around the state, leading to a number of crashes and reports of cars sliding off roads. In North Carolina, the National Park Service closed a portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway to traffic Thursday because of dangerous road conditions stemming from snow, sleet and freezing rain, the Asheville Citizen Times reported. Schools closed or sent students home early across the lower Great Lakes and the Northeast, including at the University of Connecticut where classes were canceled in the afternoon. In Virginia, the planned launch early Thursday of an unmanned cargo rocket to the International Space Station had to be rescheduled by one day because of the weather, NASA said. The unmanned Cygnus cargo craft is now scheduled to lift off early Friday from Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore carrying supplies and research materials for the astronauts at the space station.","NEW YORK (AP) - The first snowstorm of the season to hit the New York City area brought several inches of snow, slowing Thursday's evening commute to a crawl, after contributing to at least seven deaths as it swept across the country.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Climate change is going to have a lot of unpleasant consequences. But at least those of us on the East Coast wont face as many nasty winter snowstorms, right? Well... a new study is throwing a bit of cold water on that silver lining.
Residents of the Northeast are all too familiar with noreasters, cold-weather cyclones that can deliver eye-popping snow totals accompanied by power outages, terrible traffic, massive school closures, and back-breaking shoveling. Research published recently in Geophysical Research Letters looked at how these and other winter snowstorms will change in a warming world. While snowphobes might cheer the late 21st century forecast of less white stuff on the whole, the biggest and baddest stormswhich frequently fall into the noreaster bucketare unlikely to go away.
The idea is well have less total snowstorms in the future, but when you do have a snowstorm, its more likely itll be an intense snowstorm than a weak one, study author Colin Zarzycki, an assistant professor in Penn States Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, told Earther.
Zarycki reached this bummer conclusion by looking at 35 different climate model simulations run by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (he conducted the research while he was a project scientist there). These models are all based on the same assumptions about our future climate (in this case, a high carbon emissions scenario known as RCP 8.5) but use slightly different starting conditions that can lead to different outcomes for the weather. He then wrote an algorithm to pluck out individual snowstorms from these models and create a probability distribution of different snowy futures. 
This approach is especially helpful for predicting how big, infrequently occurring storms might change, Zarycki said.
The analysis showed that although winter storms will be more likely to dump their water as rain in a warmer future, when snow does fall it could pile up even higher than it does today. Thats because warmer oceans will provide more fuel for storms, and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. Overall, the study predicts the number of big winter storms to look roughly the same by centurys end. 
Several experts not involved with the study said these results made sense. The study points out the obvious, that as things warm, we are more apt to get rain rather than snow, NCAR climate scientist Kevin Trenberth told Earther in an email. But it also points out we can still get big snows. The oceans are warming and thus can readily supply plenty of moisture. Even in a warmer world, though, we still have winter and it gets cold over land and to the North.
MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel also thought studys conclusions about snowfall seemed reasonable but added that its important to consider the coastal flooding impacts of winter storms, too. Indeed, noreasters often produce worse flooding for the northeastern U.S. than hurricanes, and sea level rise will give those icy, car-entombing floodwaters some extra juice.
Zarycki said factoring in the effects of storm surge was an important direction for future work. Hes also hoping to look at how shifts in population density (people moving into or out of cities) could affect future winter storm hazards.
This looks at the big picture of snowfall, but some next generation climate models might allow us to drill down on what this means for New York City or Philly, he said, adding that these hyper-local impacts require really big computers.
Bottom line for East Coasters, though? Youre going to need to keep that snow shovel on hand at least until the end of the century.","Climate change is going to have a lot of unpleasant consequences.

Andrew Freedman,"Just like each of us has our own personality, each nor'easter is different, with its own idiosyncrasies and mood. The rapidly intensifying storm taking shape off the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England on Wednesday, for example, is unusually feisty, with a mean streak. For days now, computer models have locked onto the potential for an unusually widespread display of thundersnow — lightning produced during a snowstorm — due to the strong lift that this storm is going to produce from eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey northward across parts of New York State, on up into southern New England. SEE ALSO: Hang onto your butts as another nor'easter cripples travel, triggers thundersnow These signs have come in the form of meteorological products that are virtually indecipherable to the typical weather consumer, such as model forecast soundings and projections of how much ""convective available potential energy,"" or CAPE, will be present at times. But these indicators have been blinking red, signaling that very heavy precipitation rates, accompanied by lightning and thunder at times, is likely to occur on Wednesday into Wednesday night, potentially in big cities like Philadelphia and New York. The atmospheric lift associated with these storms is key to the forecast for the New York City area, because surface temperatures at the start of this storm have been above freezing at the coast. Thunderstorm outlook for March 7, 2018, showing thundersnow potential in Mid-Atlantic and southern New England. Image: noaa/spc. Meteorologists forecasting up to a foot of snow in New York are counting on a process known as dynamical cooling, initiated by intense precipitation, to turn the rain to snow and cause it to pile up quickly. In fact, if some of the model projections come to fruition, the evening commute could be crippled in the New York City area, as well as Philadelphia and parts of Connecticut. The ingredients for thundersnow are usually different compared to what cooks up a more common summertime storm. For example, summer storms typically form on warm, humid days, and snowstorms obviously lack such heating at ground level. But what they lack in heat they make up for in lift, specifically narrow layers of rapidly rising air. Such lifting is typically triggered by dynamics associated with rapidly intensifying storm systems like the one undergoing bombogenesis, or a process of rapid intensification, south of Long Island on Wednesday. It's this strong lifting, usually in a narrow layer of air below 25,000 feet, that generates thundersnow. Computer model runs show strong areas of lift, associated with the formation of fronts aloft, that will move across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Wednesday afternoon. Meteorologists on Twitter have been impressed by the thundersnow potential. Finally, here is a huge warning sign for later. This morning we are seeing significant CAPE values and convective lifting in the mid levels. If this translates this afternoon in precipitation rates, you have 3""+ snowfalls over these regions. pic.twitter.com/EdbhA9KDdw — NY NJ PA Weather (@nynjpaweather) March 7, 2018 Snowstorms tend to have flat, layered clouds, with most of the precipitation formed in the so-called snow growth layer at relatively low levels of the atmosphere. For thundersnow to occur, the right ingredients need to come together to lift some of these flatter clouds and mold them into protrusions that some meteorologists call turrets. Such turrets protrude like a fist above the the broad and flat layers of snow-producing clouds, driven to greater heights by lifting from approaching weather features. These weather systems may be a deep dip in the mid-level jet stream, known as a trough, that causes air to rise ahead of it, or ascend from the formation of frontal zones within storm systems, known by the fancy term ""frontogenesis."" Both of these factors are present in abundance on Wednesday. For example, this chart of mid-level frontogenesis shows a clear signal that this will occur over the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England during this storm. However, also making Wednesday's storm unique is the presence of an abundance of extremely cold air aloft, which will make it possible for vertically growing clouds to take on a shape that more resembles summertime thunderstorms than more typical thundersnow events. Such storms could produce more lightning than usual, and, as the Washington Post 's Capital Weather Gang noted, the possibility of hail falling at the same time as heavy snow. When the right conditions are present, these turrets can form what's known as elevated convection (elevated because the cloud is not based near the Earth's surface). Within these clouds, large snowflakes mix with icy pellets known as graupel, and electrical charges can build up from static electricity as these particles collide in the turbulent atmosphere. This static electricity buildup eventually can trigger occasional cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. Areas of thundersnow are typically associated with extremely heavy snowfall rates because the extra lift in such snowbands enhances the production of snowflakes. This is partly why weather geeks love thundersnow so much, it combines heavy snow with lightning and thunder, a combo of the seasons, if you will. Interestingly, because thundersnow occurs as a result of elevated convection, the thunder typically sounds different than the rumbles from an average summertime thunderstorm. Thundersnow tends to be somewhat muffled, influenced by its altitude, the cold air the sound waves are traveling through, and the snow on the ground. Also, most cloud-to-ground lightning discharges during thundersnow events tend to be triggered by human-made structures, like tall skyscrapers like One World Trade in New York, or massive broadcast towers, for example. Such towers can poke into the base of the clouds and cause a buildup of electrical charges.","Just like each of us has our own personality, each nor'easter is different, with its own idiosyncrasies and mood.

Billy Perrigo,"Some students in New Jersey were forced to spend the night in their classrooms on Thursday, thanks a major early winter storm that dumped up to six inches of snow on the Midwest and northeastern U.S. School buses and parents were unable to get to several schools in West Orange county, N.J., forcing students to sleep on gym mats and staff to stay up overnight to supervise. Liberty Middle School in West Orange county posted rolling updates through the night on its Twitter feed, showing students watching the film Frozen in an auditorium and eating ice cream, as well as playing games as the storm raged outside. Some parents braved the weather and travel chaos to reach schools in the early hours. “If I could sum it all up in one word I will say ‘treacherous,’ it was very treacherous,” one parent picking up a child from West Orange High School at 5.30 a.m. told NBC. Across the country, at least eight people were killed by the storm, hundreds of flights were cancelled, and travel chaos caused hours of delays on the roads. While winter weather was in the forecast leading up to Thursday night, there was more snow than expected across the New York tri-state area. More snowfall is forecast for Friday across the northeast.

Metinka Slater,"DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) — It’s cold, windy and snowy outside as a strong snowstorm continues to move through the state. Northern Iowa has seen snowfall all overnight, with some reports of thundersnow and winds reaching over 40 mph at times. DOWNLOAD THE KCCI APP | CHECK LATEST WEATHER ALERTS In the bullseye of the storm, which encompasses Cerro Gordo county and its county seat of Mason City, well over a foot of snow fell overnight. In Garner, reports show up to 13 inches fell; in Clear Lake, there were 10 inches of snow; in Hampton, 7.1 inches; and in Rockwell City, there were 6 inches of snow. The National Weather Service in Des Moines said an additional 4-6 inches is possible by 1 p.m. across northern portions of the state, as winds of 15-25 mph and gusts up to 30 mph will reduce visibilities to one-fourth of a mile at times. The Weather Service said to watch out for slick and snow-packed roads. If you’re traveling, be sure to use extra caution and slow down, as visibility will be reduced due to the falling snow and deteriorating road conditions. Be sure to monitor the latest road conditions at 511ia.org. Des Moines is on the back edge of the system, seeing a turnover of heavy rain into wet snow. The brunt of the snowstorm is east of Interstate 35 and north of Interstate 80. There will be potential to moderate heavy snow falling throughout northern Iowa into the mid- to late-afternoon hours Saturday, at times falling at a rate of an inch or so per hour. The system should clear by this evening, and weather conditions will be spring-like by Sunday.

Emma Laperruque,"Eight Christmases ago, Barbara Reiss was stranded in New Orleans. She was there to celebrate the holiday with family and, as often happens in late December, there was a snowstorm, a big snowstorm, a really big snowstorm in New York where she lived. So she stayed put. And then something magical happened: Cookies. This was, of course, somewhat inevitable. In Barbara’s crew, baking is the answer to science projects and school functions, dinner parties and holidays. “Baking,” she later wrote, “is the language of our family connection.” Her family holed up with Barbara’s sister, Linda, who worked as a first grade teacher. “Every year, her students give her boxes of candy, bags of pretzels, tins of popcorn,” Barbara said. “One of her good friends made delicious homemade granola, which we thought would make a great cookie.” They decided to riff on Christina Tosi’s famous, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink compost cookies—started with an oatmeal cookie recipe, only to end up with something magical, marvelous, and memorable. Barbara’s husband proclaimed them “the best cookies” ever and her family, to this day, can’t get enough of them. Neither can our site. Since Barbara—here known as drbabs —published the recipe in 2011, it’s been saved over 5,000 times. That’s a lot of cookies. We love this recipe for its flexibility, its make-the-most-of-anything spirit. The base is a classic, buttery, sugary cookie dough. From there, you add: granola, or any other cereal; pretzel pieces, or any other salty snack; chocolate chips, or any other chopped-up candy; pecans, or any other nut. (Pro tip: Leave these goodies chunky and hunky for eaters to admire!) “I’ve made them so many different ways that it’s hard to remember,” Barbara told me. “I almost always have balls of cookie dough in the freezer for guests and potlucks.” Note to self: Get invited to one of Barbara’s potlucks. Head here to try out the original recipe in all its glory, then explore the treasure map above for mix-and-match combos. Just remember, there’s no wrong path. Because it always leads to cookies.

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) NEW YORK – A fast-moving spring snowstorm swept through parts of the Northeast Monday, spreading a wintry mix that made for a slow, slippery and slushy commute to start the work week. The storm stretched from Ohio to coastal southern New England early Monday, and northern New Jersey took a hard hit with 4 to 8 inches of snow accumulation, leading to dozens of vehicle spinouts and crashes. A winter weather advisory was issued for parts of New York, and a steady snow forced the Yankees to postpone their scheduled 1:05 p.m. home opener against Tampa Bay. A total of 5.5 inches of snow fell at Central Park in New York City. That's the biggest April snowstorm in the city since 1982, and the 7th-biggest April snowstorm of all-time, the National Weather Service said. The highest snowfall total from the storm as of midday Monday was 7.8 inches in White Plains, N.Y. Some school districts closed for the day and others opted for a delayed opening. In the New York City area, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty airports all reported some flight disruptions. The storm was to move off the coast later Monday, giving way to warming temperatures and melting. Monday’s snowstorm was the fifth in the area after four nor’easters in March. A separate storm will spread snow across the northern Plains and upper Midwest Monday and Tuesday.

Jack Stewart,"Self-driving cars are like snowbird retirees. Given the freedom to live, or operate, anywhere in the country, they turn their backs on wintry states and flock to the sun. There’s a reason Waymo, Uber, and even grocery story giant, Kroger, are testing their shiny new autonomous vehicles in southwestern cities like Phoenix. Yes, Arizona’s regulations are friendly to them, but the year-round good weather is the major draw. As sophisticated as these machines are becoming, they still struggle when fog reduces visibility, or when snow covers lane markings. But eventually, AVs will have to learn to navigate the wintry mix. That's where WaveSense, a Boston-based startup, sees an opportunity. The company, launching formally today, wants to take technology developed at MIT for the military, and use it to give self-driving cars an extra sense. It says equipping vehicles with a radar looking down, penetrating the ground, will give them a new way to map exactly where they are in the world without relying on visual clues or GPS. Autonomous vehicles use a suite of sensors to monitor the world around them. Most of their creators have settled on a combination of lidar laser sensors, radar, cameras, short-range ultrasonic sensors, and GPS, combined with on-board maps. But the final component mix that will turn cars into fully autonomous vehicles is far from finished. (Waymo, for example, added microphones too, to hear sirens, and Tesla says it can do it all with cameras, no lidar.) For a robo-car to be able to navigate a city, it needs to know where it is, and where it should be, within an inch or so. Before carmakers let their creations loose, they usually send a mapping vehicle around the environment they’re going to drive in, to build up a detailed lidar picture of the signs, the access roads, the bike lanes, and the awkward junctions. Then, when an autonomous vehicle is cruising, it can use that map as a reference, even when GPS satellite navigation signals are blocked by tunnels or tall buildings. But when a heavy snowstorm obliterates all landmarks and blankets the world in a homogenous layer of white, those reference maps are useless. The same is true when lane markings fade, or get scrubbed off by snowploughs. (Some autonomous engineers say the most cost effective way legislators could help the tech is by spending money on lines of fresh paint.) “Our solution is to look below the ground, where you don’t have the same issues that optical sensors on the surface have,” says Tarik Bolat, CEO of WaveSense. His company uses an extra radar sensor on cars, usually mounted just behind the front wheel, pointed down. Even a low-power signal can penetrate up to 10 feet into the road. “It’s seeing rocks, tree roots, soil density changes, any road infrastructure,” says Byron Stanley, CTO and co-founder. Those features can be combined as a geographical fingerprint, and just like a lidar map of the world above, give a car a reference to help figure out where it is. Wavesense says it can pinpoint a location to within an inch, even at highway speeds, and that it is weather-independent. The tech comes out of MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, a defense R&amp;D center, and was first deployed in 2013 to help troops navigate in Afghanistan, where staying on path and avoiding landmines is a matter of life and death. But adding sensors to autonomous cars comes at a cost, both literally and computationally. WaveSense says its radar is cheap and doesn’t need too much power to crunch the data, which is crucial when manufacturers are trying to shrink the trunk-sized supercomputers that gobble electricity into something that’s commercially viable. WaveSense’s radar might not replace the other sensors on a car; its role is more likely as a supplementary verification of location, using an unrelated data stream, which improves redundancy and safety. And it might come with an added bonus. Right now ground-penetrating radar is used by geologists and archeologists to discover underground mineral deposits or the remains of ancient buildings. “I was driving in Rome a couple of weeks ago, which in addition to having no lane markings and crazy traffic, you could imagine you could find some pretty interesting ruins if you drove WaveSense around there,” says Tarik, jokingly. Ancient ruins, that could help the very latest in automotive technology stay on track.","A Boston-based startup wants to equip AVs with ground penetrating radar, which they can use to identify exactly where they are.",2018-08-20T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Self-Driving Cars Should Look Down, Not Just Ahead",https://www.wired.com/story/ground-penetrating-radar-self-driving-cars/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b770e400bbd3b1d690260ee/191:100/pass/WaveSense_2_final.jpg,wired,Wired,snowstorm,1

Mark Kaufman,"The nor'easter that has shut down much of New England ion Tuesday s reaching its great arms into regions over both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, sucking moisture into the powerful storm. In a technical forecast discussion on Monday night from the National Weather Service forecast office in Boston, meteorologists said the storm was even importing moisture from as far away as the Pacific Ocean. The result — aided by the storm also drawing in cold air from Canada — is a blizzard wherein enough moisture and freezing temperatures can create copious snowfall and high winds. SEE ALSO: Did a nor'easter whip a puffer fish into a tree? An investigation Satellite images captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) weather satellite GOES-16, shows what exactly is going on with the storm from high above. GOES-16 orbits more than 22,000 miles above Earth, allowing it to capture such wide-field images of the planet. It's high-resolution cameras can also see detailed images of the *nor'easter*, including the eye-like feature near the center of the storm. This is the third nor'easter — which is broadly defined as a winter storm with strong winds blowing from the northeast — to hit New England in two weeks.

J. DAVID GOODMAN and WILLIAM NEUMAN,"The demand for his resignation, reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday, threw many in New York City government into a state of uncertainty. Top officials at the police, fire and sanitation departments said they knew nothing of the firing of Mr. Esposito, formerly the Police Departments highest-ranking uniformed member. Legal experts and former city officials said that a deputy mayor did not have the authority to unilaterally fire a commissioner appointed by the mayor, as Mr. Esposito was by Mr. de Blasio in 2014. Ms. Anglin made her demand for Mr. Espositos resignation late last week at the emergency management headquarters in Brooklyn, according to the person who was briefed on the exchange. She was in the building to attend what was described as a routine meeting to follow up on the citys response to the mid-November snowstorm that snarled city traffic and sparked the ire of residents and elected officials. After that meeting, she met with Mr. Esposito, the person said. It was not clear how the decision to ask for Mr. Espositos resignation was made and whether Ms. Anglin acted on her own or at the direction of Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Esposito refused to provide details or say whether he had a one-on-one meeting with Ms. Anglin. She was here for a couple of meetings, he said. The sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, said on Monday that she attended a meeting at the emergency management offices, which included Ms. Anglin and other senior officials and staff members. She described it as a run-of-the-mill meeting focused on improving the citys response in similar situations and on how you share data in an emergency. She said that she had not been notified of any changes in the leadership at the emergency management office.","Joseph Esposito, center, was asked by a deputy mayor to resign his post as commissioner of the New York City Office of Emergency Management.

Scores of schools in Virginia and North Carolina were remaining closed for a second day. Georgia also announced a late start for state government workers because of fears about ice on roads. The storm that blew in over the weekend was blamed for at least three deaths in North Carolina, along with numerous car crashes, power outages and canceled flights. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Monday that the worst of the storm had passed, but residents particularly motorists should keep watch for dangerous conditions. Melting snow and ice could make roads slick Tuesday morning as temperatures fall and moisture refreezes, Cooper said at a news conference. The Highway Patrol already had responded to more than 670 collisions and nearly 1,600 calls for services since the storm began. We need to stay vigilant. Were not out of the woods yet, Cooper said Monday. This storm dropped staggering amounts of snow, ice and rain across our state. A years worth of snowfall or more fell in some places in little more than a day. Last Slide Next Slide More than 20 inches fell in parts of western North Carolina. A truck driver died Sunday after suffering what appeared to be a heart attack from shoveling out his rig that got stuck at the height of the storm along Interstate 77 in the central part of the state, Yadkin County Emergency Services Director Keith Vestal said. The state emergency operations center also said one man died Sunday when a tree fell on him in Mecklenburg County, while an ailing woman died in Haywood County when her oxygen was cut off due to power outages. In Charlotte, police shut down a street Monday after reports of ice falling from the Duke Energy Center. And an overturned truck full of pigs added to traffic delays in the western part of that state. More: National Guard called in as snow, ice paralyze much of Southeast Still, the snow gave some people a chance for fun in places that dont normally see a lot of snow. In North Carolinas Durham County, where a foot fell in places Sunday, kids reveled in a day off from school as a second dusting of snow and sleet fell Monday. Children threw snowballs or built snowmen, and a young girl in a pink jacket threw her hands up and yelled Merry Christmas! at a passer-by along a residential sidewalk. Ron Gordon, 75, donned boots and a hooded winter jacket to take out his dog, Easy. She seems to like it, he said, holding a walking stick for extra traction. She enjoys it more than I do. The semi-retired photographer said he could work inside for the rest of the day, and he can cook on the gas stove even if the house loses power again, as it did for several hours Sunday. He said he moved to Durham from Chicago several years ago and was surprised to see this much snow: I didnt expect this.

Riley  Johnson,"A powerful spring blizzard swept into the state Friday, first smacking the Panhandle and central Nebraska before threatening northeastern counties. Lincoln was never supposed to see the worst of this storm, but by noontime Saturday, it appeared the impacts here would be even less than expected. The capital city has been just warm enough to prevent rain from switching to snow, with an area of low pressure essentially parked between Beatrice and Falls City keeping the rain-snow line at bay for now, said Van DeWald of the National Weather Service office in Valley. To the north and west, though, the blizzard's effects were seemingly inescapable. At least one person died on Interstate 80 during the storm. Rollo Ward, 61, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, was killed after losing control of his eastbound semitrailer, entering the median and crashing into an already stranded semi on near Chappell, according to the Nebraska State Patrol. The patrol and other agencies also helped more than 100 motorists who became stranded on I-80 near Sidney, ferrying them from their vehicles using Sidney Public Schools buses escorted by patrol cruisers and snow plows. +5 Sidney Public Schools buses carry stranded motorists from Interstate 80 near Sidney overnight Friday as a blizzard sweeps across Nebraska. Courtesy photo/Nebraska State Patrol ""The assembled law enforcement officers went door to door, knocking on all vehicles and rescuing all of the occupants in freezing temperatures,"" the patrol said in a news release. ""The rescued motorists were taken to Light Memorial Presbyterian Church in Sidney or to a hotel of their choice."" Travel across much of Nebraska was still near-impossible Saturday afternoon, with road closures on Interstate 80, U.S. 30 and U.S. 20. Westbound I-80 was closed from Grand Island to the Wyoming state line, and eastbound I-80 was closed from Wyoming to Ogallala. “Road conditions are still not safe across the state and travel is not recommended,” said Bryan Tuma, assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a news release. “Stay home and be safe.” Gov. Pete Ricketts declared an emergency, making state funds available to local entities responding to the blizzard. And the Emergency Management Agency was working to set up a temporary communications tower after 60 mph winds toppled a dispatch tower that served several counties in the Loup Valley in north-central Nebraska. The town of Newport in Rock County had seen 14 inches of snowfall as of 8 a.m. Saturday, and more was falling. At least 11 inches of snow had fallen in Valentine, and areas near Chadron and Sidney received nearly 10 inches. But even areas with less snowfall saw whiteout conditions due to high winds. Much of Nebraska experienced wind gusts in excess of 50-60 mph. the Ogallala area clocked a 68 mph gust Friday afternoon. In Lincoln, snow was expected to arrive by mid-afternoon and linger into the evening, with possible accumulations of about 1 inch. Wind gusts already exceeded 43 mph. City crews planned to treat major streets and bridges with granular salt pre-wet with brine starting at noon. ""The application is expected to be completed after 8 p.m. and crews will remain on patrol to monitor street conditions,"" city officials said in a news release. The Lincoln area is under a winter weather advisory until 7 p.m. Much of the rest of the state is under a blizzard warning. Just Friday, the high in Lincoln was 82 degrees.

Bill Novak | Wisconsin State Journal,"Eastern Wisconsin could see up to six inches of snow on Wednesday but less to the west, setting up the chance for slippery roads and rough travel in most of the state, except for the southwestern corner. The National Weather Service said the best chance for accumulating snow is along and north of a line from Burlington to Madison to Wisconsin Dells, with a winter weather advisory or winter storm watch likely to be issued for that area. Snowfall amounts aren't forecast yet, but early indicators show 4-6 inches from southeast Wisconsin to the Fox River Valley, and lesser amounts to the west, including 1-2 inches in Madison. The Weather Service said drivers should be watching for hazardous road conditions and slippery travel on Wednesday. The snow is the result of an Albert Clipper, a fast-moving system coming from Canada. They normally don't produce much snow, but if a ""snow band"" sets up, meaning snow falling over a specific area because of a lack of movement of the storm, it most likely would run from Milwaukee to the northwest, all the way up to the Medford area. The day-to-day outlook: Tuesday night: A 20 percent chance of snow after 5 a.m., low around 18. Wednesday: A 60 percent chance of snow and possibly freezing drizzle in the afternoon, high near 28. Ice accumulation unlikely but an inch of snow is possible. Wednesday night; A 20 percent chance of snow before midnight, low around 17. Thursday: Mostly cloudy, high near 27. Thursday night: Mostly cloudy, low around 19. Friday: A 20 percent chance of snow, high near 28. Friday night: A 20 percent chance of snow before midnight, low around 18. Saturday: A 20 percent chance of snow after noon, high near 32. Saturday night: A 50 percent chance of snow, low around 24. Sunday: A 20 percent chance of snow, high near 33.

Maya Rhodan,"Growing up in Chicago, I didn’t have much experience with extreme weather. Sure, there was a snowstorm when I was eight years old that was massive enough to shut down public schools, a rare occurrence in a city proud of its ability to handle snow. And when I was in college, I had some Manny &amp; Olga’s pizza delivered during the massive Snowmageddon storm in D.C. in 2011. But, I’ve never had to prepare for the potential of floods and massive power outages. So when I needed to find out what you should actually buy in a storm as Hurricane Florence rolled in to Raleigh, I went some officials sources: friends from New Orleans who lived through one of the nation’s most devastating storms in recent history and a federal website. And while my friend Travis told me to stock up on peanut butter, canned nuts and “three bottles of whisky, at minimum,” the federal government recommends at least three days worth of bread, canned meat and vegetables, bottled water and cereal ahead of an extreme weather event. Some of those were easier to buy than others. A Harris Teeter near Cameron Village in Raleigh was well-stocked with bottled water. Case upon case of water was shrink-wrapped and set in the center of aisles in the 24-hour store. But a last minute trip to a Northwest Raleigh Walmart on Wednesday evening didn’t prove very fruitful. As the storm approached, the aisles of several grocery stores I visited were well-stocked with misfit foods, as all of the recommended staples had been cleared out by residents ready to meet the storm. At Walmart, the bread aisle was bare save for two bags of “Dark Pump” pumpernickel bread, some powdered donuts and a bag of mini bagels. The store had been cleared of canned meats, save for a couple of cans of chopped clams. There were plenty of cookies canned cranberry sauce and maraschino cherries, though. Chopped clams were also left behind on a shelf at a Food Lion on Wycliff Road and long with a few cans of tiny shrimp, pink salmon and canned roast beef and gravy. A guy named Thomas I spoke to in the store was stocking up on non-perishables. The Raleigh native didn’t want to give his last name because he works at a competing retailer. His home store ran out of canned meat, but he was able to get some of the stray chicken on the shelves at Food Lion. Sherri Carroll, who was staffing the customer service desk at Food Lion, said the first thing the store had run out of during the week was bottled water. “Then batteries and propane,” she said. When the store ran low on bottled water, she said, people started buying flavored water. The store had plenty of jelly, but only a few jars of all natural almond and peanut butter left on its shelves on Thursday afternoon. The federal list recommends “comfort foods,” though, and depending on how you snack the stray jars of Biscoff Cookie butter that were left on the shelf would likely qualify. Charcoal and toilet paper were also low in stock, as were paper plates. Ronnie Barnes, a Nature’s Own delivery man, said people didn’t even wait for him to put the bread he was delivering on the shelves earlier this week — they just snatched loaves right off of the stacks he brought into stores. “At around 9 a.m., I delivered about $900 worth of bread to a Walmart,” he said. “I went back at noon and it was all gone.” I mentioned the “dark pump” I saw left on the shelves at the Walmart I visited. “When a hurricane comes, everything sells,” he said. Vikram, an employee at the Whole Foods on Wade Avenue, said on Monday their sales were “almost Thanksgiving level” with customers wrapped around the store. By Thursday, with news that the impact on Raleigh wouldn’t be as bad as other places in the state, traffic in the store had died down. You know what really sells in a storm? Alcohol. “If we run out of bottled water, people are going to get sparking. But when we run out of sparkling, people are grabbing the alcohol,” said Vikram who proudly noted that beer and wine sales were higher than they expected, but said he “couldn’t disclose” exactly how many sales they made. Gloria Jones, a resident of Knightdale, was shopping when I met her at Food Lion. She said she was concerned about the power outages the storm may bring, but “I’m not having an anxiety attack or anything.” The only things on her list on Thursday: “Beer and wine,” she said. “And maybe some bread.” Like I said, I’m new to this. And so, I followed their lead and bought some wine.","Growing up in Chicago, I didn’t have much experience with extreme weather.

Max Golembo,"Heavy rain and snow are expected this morning in the Northeast, after the East Coast already saw 1 to 2 inches of rain on Monday and parts of southern Vermont got a foot of snow. Winter storm warnings and advisories as well as coastal flooding alerts have been issued throughout the Northeast. Significant lake-effect snow trailing behind the storm has been reported in Ohio and Pennsylvania, each of which has seen a number of weather-related traffic accidents. Advisories and warnings have already been issued throughout the Northeast this morning. Heavy rain is expected today in coastal Maine because of a double low-pressure system. Later today, as the storms merge into a single low-pressure system, it'll move very slowly north into Maine, delivering more precipitation and with more lake-effect snow in its rear-view mirror. Some areas could see 6 to 12 inches of snow -- parts of northern New England may see 18 inches. A massive winter storm is targeting the Northeast this morning. Much of the far Northeast could see at least a foot of snow over the next 48 hours. Out West, warnings and watches for high winds, floods and storms have been issued up and down the coast in anticipation of a series of storms.

Heavy snow and strong winds already are pounding Chicago and Detroit, where major public school systems opted not to open Friday, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. ""Make no mistake about it: This is a heavy snow, heavier than we have seen in a number of winters,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Thursday at a news conference. ""Now, Chicago is used to this. On the other hand, over the last winters, we haven't had a snow at this level. And it is not just one night; it is going to go through the weekend."" More than 25 million Americans are under winter weather alerts as an arctic front pushes from Montana through the Midwest, CNN meteorologists said. Chicago could get around a foot of snow -- 8 to 14 inches -- by late Friday, plus 4 more inches through the weekend, forecasters said. The bulk of flight cancellations affect Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, according to the tracking site FlightAware.com. Four major US airlines -- Delta, United, Frontier, and Southwest Airlines -- have issued weather waivers for passengers, allowing travelers to change their reservations without incurring a fee. Chicago's biggest snowstorm since 2015 A foot of snow is still a big deal for Chicagoans. Since 1884, the city has had only nine days when 12 or more inches of snow fell. Authorities across Illinois prepared some 300 pieces of snow-fighting equipment and thousands of tons of salt for nearly 16,000 miles of highways and state roads. Road conditions began deteriorating Thursday night as the system neared Chicago, the Illinois Department of Transportation tweeted. ""Our crews are out in full force clearing snow but please consider postponing any unnecessary travel!"" Chicagoans headed to grocery and hardware stores on Thursday to stock up on food and essentials before the storm. ""We have our shovels, we have our potassium for the sidewalks,"" Pam Smith told CNN affiliate WGN. ""We have our food, our wine and our fireplace."" In 2011, residents weathered 20 inches of snow over two days. A storm in February 2015, logging in at 16.2 inches, was the last time Chicago had more than 10 inches of snow in a single storm.

The Associated Press,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Public officials were on the defensive Friday after the season's first, surprisingly strong snowstorm stranded thousands of motorists for hours and forced some students to stay overnight in their schools. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said ""lousy"" forecasts were partly to blame. He took a pounding on social media from people complaining about his handling of Thursday's storm, including one of his highest-profile constituents. Former Republican Gov. Chris Christie tweeted at Murphy that it took him nearly six hours to travel roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers). Murphy didn't respond directly to his predecessor. ""Clearly we could have done better and we will do better,"" Murphy said. Snowplows and salt trucks were unable to make a dent throughout the New York metro area due to crushing gridlock on highways and local roads. In West Orange, New Jersey, more than a hundred students stayed late into the night -- and some until morning -- at a middle school after buses became stranded for hours and turned back. Staffers stayed overnight and made dinner for students who couldn't get home. Student Breanna Dannestoy told NBC New York she and other West Orange students were taken to a diner before heading back to school. ""It was so long, I'm just excited to go home and go to sleep,"" she said. Among the odd sights in the storm, which dumped as much as 17 inches (43 centimeters) in some areas of upstate New York, was a camel named Einstein. The animal was en route to an event put on by the organization Jewish Philly when the vehicle he was traveling in became stuck, the group said. Einstein was not able to make it to his destination, as his handlers turned back to Peaceable Kingdom Petting Zoo where they started. Some drivers woke up in their cars Friday morning after being stuck overnight on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. Accidents on the George Washington Bridge halted traffic on the crossing and led to backups in New York and New Jersey. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he understands why people are frustrated that city officials were caught off guard by a snowstorm that stranded some New Yorkers in their cars for hours. De Blasio said on New York 1 Friday that the city ""will do a full review of what happened here."" A mayoral spokesman said the early storm meant that Metropolitan Transportation Authority didn't have snow chains on its buses. He said many of them had to pull over, ""further clogging streets."" Bus delays caused a logjam of commuters Thursday, forcing officials to close the doors at New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal. The wintry weather also caused a traffic nightmare in Pennsylvania, with numerous vehicles stuck for several hours from the Lehigh Valley to the New Jersey state line. Police sometimes drove on the opposite side of the highway, honking their horns to wake up drivers who had fallen asleep while sitting in traffic. About 105,000 homes and businesses were without power as of Friday morning in Pennsylvania, mostly in the western part of the state. In Vermont, aside from the region's traffic nightmare, the storm was a boon for Vermont's ski resorts. Okemo Mountain and Stowe Mountain Resort opened Friday as the snow continued to fall. Sugarbush is opening Saturday. Killington Resort is already open and other ski areas plan to open later this month. Some areas of Massachusetts received more than 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow in the storm, which turned to rain overnight to complicate the morning commute.

MICHAEL WILSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN,"But interviews with experts familiar with Kennedy’s operations this weekend, as well as with scores of passengers both inside that jampacked airport and others far away, hint at the complicated story to someday come, and offer a view from within the chaotic scene. The arrival of a severe winter storm on Thursday was not a surprise. With a snowstorm ominously described as a bomb cyclone bearing down on the New York area, the Port Authority started warning about airport disruption and flight cancellations on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, as the snow piled up and winds strengthened, the Port Authority announced that Kennedy would temporarily shut down. At 1 p.m., it was telling travelers that it intended to resume flight activity later that day. Around the world, airlines were reading that forecast as a green light to take off for long hauls to New York City. As late as 6:20 p.m., the Port Authority was still sending out tweets that it expected to reopen Kennedy that night. But an hour later, close to 7:30 p.m., the Port Authority decided to keep Kennedy closed until Friday morning. That meant that all of the flights bound for Kennedy had to divert to other airports or turn around. The sudden, unplanned detouring of all of those planes set off a chain reaction that stretched to various continents and left Kennedy tied in knots for the next few days, with passengers stranded in overcrowded terminals and on planes. “Virtually no foreign airline canceled any flights into J.F.K.” on Thursday, said Jason Rabinowitz, a freelance aviation blogger who tracked the cascading pileup as it played out. “They all launched their aircraft, but by the time they got halfway over the Atlantic, they found out they couldn’t land at J.F.K.” As an example, Mr. Rabinowitz cited Iberia Flight 6253, which got halfway to New York from Madrid before making a U-turn and going back to Spain: an eight-hour fight to nowhere. Norwegian Air Flight 7019 made a similar journey Thursday night en route to New York from France. “That was kind of weird,” said Mona Bismuth, 27, a passenger. “We turned around at the southern tip of Greenland.” A passenger on a different flight was sent back to Moscow — twice — because of what was happening in New York. When Kennedy gradually reopened on Friday, the airlines started sending their diverted planes on to Kennedy. The airport’s runways could handle the traffic, but some of its terminals were quickly overwhelmed with planes arriving faster than gates could be cleared for them. That mismatch continued into Saturday, as the airlines played catch-up on the flights they had sent elsewhere or had canceled.

Chacour Koop,"A winter storm is predicted to dump up to a foot of snow on the suburbs the next two days. National Weather Service meteorologists first issued a winter storm warning from Thursday night through 9 p.m. Friday, with heavy snow making travel ""very difficult to impossible."" Late Thursday night the warning was shortened so that it now lasts only until noon. More than 200 flights were canceled ""proactively"" at O'Hare International Airport, the Chicago Department of Aviation reported, and more than 70 at Midway. Metra's BNSF Line will run 84 instead of 94 trains Friday in an effort to reduce switching operations. Heavy ice and snow can cause switching problems and subsequent delays. To learn more, go to metrarail.com. Pace bus service is warning riders to take transit only for essential trips from Thursday night through Sunday and postpone nonessential travel. ""Significant delays due to heavy snow and hazardous driving conditions,"" are expected, officials said. Suburban school districts began announcing closings for Friday, including all schools in Elgin Area School District U-46, Hawthorn District 73, Wheaton Warrenville Unit District 200, Naperville Unit District 203, Palatine-Schaumburg High School District 211, Northwest Suburban High School District 214, Barrington Area Unit District 220 and Community Unit District 300. Plus day care centers, senior centers and other businesses are not opening Friday morning, the Emergency Closing Center is reporting. Go to emergencyclosingcenter.com for a complete roundup of closings. Various suburbs are reminding residents that cars should not be parked on streets so snow plows can sweep through. Many suburban governments have announced village or city halls will not be open on Friday. The Circuit Court of Cook County also said it will close Friday. ""There will be no court in session in any Cook County courthouse and that the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court will be closed,"" except for Central Bond Court at the Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago, Chief Judge Timothy Evans said in a statement. All cases set for Friday will be rescheduled. The storm warning includes all of northern Illinois and northwest Indiana. Six to 12 inches of accumulation is possible. The weather service is warning of significant reductions in visibility at times. ""If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency,"" the weather service said in a statement. The snow will add on to the three inches that have fallen over the past three days. The Illinois Tollway announced it is deploying its fleet of nearly 200 snowplows to combat the expected snowfall, and the Illinois Department of Transportation warned travelers to avoid driving through Friday night. Officials said snowy and icy roads are expected to cause low visibility and significant delay. For those who have no choice but to brave the snow, officials recommended driving with extreme caution and preparing for the worst by keeping a full tank of gas and cold weather essentials such as blankets, food and water and an ice scraper in the car. • Daily Herald correspondent Christopher Hacker contributed to this report.","Chicago Daily Herald Canceled flights, various closings announced as snowstorm begins Chicago Daily Herald A winter storm is predicted to dump up to a foot of snow on the suburbs the next two days.

Daniel Manzo,"Wind chills in the Northeast are in the teens and single digits on Friday morning, while a new winter storm could dump several inches of snow on the central U.S. and mid-Atlantic over the weekend.
Interested in Weather?
Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
Although there will be some relief from the cold on Saturday, it will still be quite cold across the Northeast. Wind chills will be near zero for Boston and Albany, New York, and below zero for the interior Northeast.
Wind chills will be in the single digits and teens across much of the Midwest and Northeast on Friday.
A major winter storm is developing Friday in the central U.S., which will bring impacts from the Midwest to the East Coast through this weekend. Some rain and snow are moving into New Mexico and Colorado on Friday morning. Additionally, some mixed precipitation and snow are moving into Arkansas and Missouri.
Winter weather alerts have been issued for nearly 40 million Americans from Colorado to Maryland, including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis; Indianapolis; and Roanoke, Virginia. Some of the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Chicago are also under a winter weather alert Friday morning.
Winter storm warnings and watches are in place from Colorado to the East Coast on Friday.
Snow will begin to spread later in the day Friday across parts of the Central Plains -- from Denver to Wichita, Kansas -- and likely mix with a little bit of rain near Kansas City and St. Louis. Locally heavy snow, with rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour, and wind gusts of 20 to 30 mph will be possible.
The snow will briefly intensify across parts of the Midwest as the storm receives some colder air from a different storm sliding in from Canada.
Snow will fall in the Plains on Friday while rain stretches south through Oklahoma and Texas.
The snow will spread eastward into Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky on Saturday morning. Travel will be dangerous along the I-70 corridor from Kansas City to Indianapolis.
The storm could bring 3 to 6 inches of snow in Missouri, Iowa and Chicago.
However, as the storm slides east, it meets some drier, colder air and is pushed to the south. Additionally, a new low pressure will develop off the North Carolina coast and begin to draw some of this moisture onto land. On Saturday night, the storm will spread snow into the mid-Atlantic, including Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; and Roanoke.
Snow might briefly intensify in North Carolina and Virginia on Sunday morning before the storm pulls out to sea.
The mid-Atlantic could see 3 to 6 inches locally through Sunday.
The bullseye for this storm will be somewhere near the Missouri and Illinois border with 6 inches or more of snowfall through Saturday. A large swatch of 3 to 6 inches of snow is possible from Colorado all the way to Virginia. Snowfall could exceed this estimate in parts of Virginia and Maryland should the storm receive a little bit more moisture from the new coastal low on Sunday.
On the West Coast, a particularly wet pattern is setting up again -- but this time all the storms will target California. One storm will arrive late Friday, and then another will arrive on Sunday.
By early Monday morning, a third storm quickly moves in right behind the second storm. This pattern will persist through the next week or so.
As much or more than 6 inches of rain could fall along the coast in Southern California over the next five days.
The result of this rainy pattern will be locally heavy rainfall along the coast of California. As much or more than 6 inches of rain is possible for Southern California through the middle of next week. Additionally, several feet of snow is possible in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
While some rain in the next couple days isnt immediately a widespread concern, there is the potential for this to become a concerning story next week.",A snowstorm could bring several inches of snow to the mid-Atlantic.,2019-01-11T11:31:39Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Cold blast grips Northeast as major winter storm develops in central US,https://abcnews.go.com/US/cold-blast-grips-northeast-major-winter-storm-develops/story?id=60307699,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/oswego-waves-ugc-mo-20190111_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,snowstorm,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"• Alternate-side parking rules are suspended for snow removal. Meters remain in effect. With 12 to 18 inches of snow in the forecast, the nor’easter was expected to break the record for the largest spring snowstorm in our history. The previous record, of 10 inches, was set on April 3, 1915. A little after midnight, the ruler in Central Park read 8.2. Your snow-shoveling experience may vary. The snow fell unevenly, dropping 11.7 inches in Bedford-Stuyvesant, 12 in Queens Village, 10 in Gramercy Park, and around 8.5 inches at both La Guardia and Kennedy. “But Staten Island won the lottery,” said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Port Richmond is waking up to 13.8 inches. Even though parts of the city saw higher snow totals “the record is still going to the April storm,” Mr. Maloit said. Central Park is used for the official city total because record-keeping there is more extensive and “because, let’s face it, when you think New York City, you think Central Park, not La Guardia or Kennedy,” he said. We did set one record yesterday, though. It was the most snow seen in New York on March 21. And you can take comfort in knowing you lived through a spring snowstorm and the fourth nor’easter in one month, a super extra rare occurrence. The National Weather Service found at least one other instance of four nor’easters taking place in one month — between Dec. 30, 1986, and Jan. 26, 1987 — but that was in the dead of winter.

Zoë Henry,"Dan Ariens, the CEO of a Brillion, Wisconsin-based equipment manufacturer, has been preparing for a superstorm since last February. That's when his company ordered its annual shipment of blowers and plows for the 2018 winter season, which Ariens predicted would bring 20 percent more snow than the year before. Arians had reason to be confident. His family has been in the business of weather since 1933, when his great-grandfather, Henry Ariens, began building rotary tillers. ""We don't know when a specific snow event is going to happen,"" Ariens says. ""But we know that from Baltimore north there will be something that happens one or two times a year."" His foresight paid off: Ariens is among the dozens of manufacturers that are now benefiting from the so-called ""bomb cyclone"" that began pummeling the Eastern seaboard this week. The blizzard, which started Tuesday in the Gulf of Mexico, brought 50 and 60 mph gusts of wind while dumping inches of snow, sleet and ice on coastal states. As of Thursday, the storm has led to thousands of flight cancellations and the shuttering of schools, tracking from Tallahassee, Florida, through the Carolinas and New York, and all the way up to Maine. Meteorologists say the blizzard, or what some refer to as ""bombogenesis,"" is so named for the sudden drop in atmospheric pressure. Even after the snow and sleet have passed, East Coast cities should expect to see blisteringly cold temperatures in the days to come. That's good news for Ariens and his ilk. After an uncharacteristically mild winter in 2017, the CEO explains that his business needed to make up for lost time. ""The mild winter hit our bottom line in the second quarter,"" he says. By contrast, a single major snow event can mean a serious boost in business. ""This [bomb cyclone] should carry our sales for the next two years,"" he says. Generally speaking, manufacturers and landscapers will attempt to make up for any lost business during the winter months--and especially as global temperatures continue to rise--through selling summer equipment. Ariens explains that the sale of lawnmowers, in particular, helped his business to recoup money in 2017. Companies that focus solely on snow, however, have had to be more creative. Jason Case, the co-founder and CEO of Case Snow Management in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, generates revenue on both fixed seasonal and per-inch contracts. The nine-year old firm provides snow and ice removal services for both residential and commercial clients in more than a dozen states. ""We do a 60/40 split,"" Case explains, referring to the share of contracts they draw up. That means that even during mild winters, the company can still plan on a fixed amount of revenue, from commercial clients such as fast food restaurants, pharmacies, and gas stations that need to ensure that their walkways get cleared for business. Case has made his peace with a fluctuating balance sheet nonetheless. In 2015, the business brought in $28 million, before falling to just $15 million during the mild 2017. This year, and thanks in no small part to bombogenesis, Case Snow Management is anticipating more than $20 million in revenues for the 2018 season. Still others are hoping to marry cutting-edge technology with service providers to stamp out some of the inefficiencies associated with winter storms. James Albis, a Connecticut native, came up with the idea for an app-based marketplace for snow plowing, à la Uber, after decades spent shelling out for mom-and-pop services. ""There was no rhyme or reason as to how I got serviced,"" Albis explains. ""All I knew was that at some point the snow would be cleared from my home."" Enter: SnoHub, an app that connects homeowners to contract shovelers on demand. The company, which charges a baseline fee of about $60 per six inches of snow, then takes a 30 percent cut on all transactions. Since launching in beta last year, SnoHub has been downloaded more than 10,000 times, signing on roughly 500 contract workers. Although Albis, too, is at the mercy of El Niño, he concurs with Ariens that a single major snow event can mean a boost in sales. ""If everything lines up on a day like today,"" Albis continues, referring to the bomb cyclone, ""we're talking over $100,000 in net revenue."" All said, he hopes to bring in $1 million in sales in 2018. There are still other considerations, even if founders predict the weather accurately. With national and international equipment firms, for instance, it not only matters how much snow sticks to the ground, but also where it's concentrated. Last year, not anticipating that Western mountain regions would see a large share, Ariens failed to order enough large-scale snow blowers with tracks attached to the bottom. Ultimately, the company was forced to turn down some orders, even as it wasn't selling enough small-scale plows in the East. Ariens describes the process of preparing for the winter months as little more than a crapshoot. ""Even after all of these things we do,"" he adds, ""we're still going to Vegas.""","The first major snowstorm to pummel the Northeast this winter means an uptick in sales for manufacturers of blowers, plows, salt spreaders and more.",2018-01-04T21:32:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","'Bombogenesis' Can Mean $100,000 a Day for Some Snow Entrepreneurs",https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/bomb-cyclone-2018-business-of-snow.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_901254678_2000133320009280171_339057.jpg,,Inc.com,snowstorm,1

(In Florida, only the Panhandle should reach 32 degrees, while in Hawaii, the sub-freezing temps will be atop the Mauna Kea volcano.) Overall, temperatures will be some 10 to 20 degrees below average for much of the week, the National Weather Service said. By week's end, cities such as Minneapolis and Chicago will only see high temperatures in the teens and 20s. The cold air comes directly from the Canadian Arctic, the weather service said. Then, the snow: A storm ""is expected to bring a widespread wintry mess of snow, sleet and freezing rain through parts of the nation's southern tier and possibly the East Coast late this week into next weekend,"" the Weather Channel warned. More specifically, ""a weather system will develop and gain strength from Texas into the Southeast U.S. heading into the weekend,"" said weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue. ""This southern track means the cold air to the north will allow for frozen precipitation, including snow."" Although it will be too warm to snow in much of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, the state will instead have to deal with severe storms and potential flooding, AccuWeather said. By Saturday or Saturday night. Snow, sleet or freezing rain could affect travel from portions of northeast Georgia into the Carolinas and southern Virginia, warned the Weather Channel. What the storm does by Sunday and early next week is still far from certain. Some of the computer models that meteorologists use to forecast weather show the storm will slide off the Southeast coast of the U.S., sparing the big cities of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, according to meteorologist Wes Junker of the Capital Weather Gang. Other models show more of a northerly track that could bring significant snow to cities such as Washington, D.C., he said. It won't be until Thursday that meteorologists will get a better sense of the weekend track of the storm.

AZI PAYBARAH,"Dec. 27-28, 2010 Mayor Michael Bloomberg, fresh off his unpopular push to extend term limits, was coldly dismissive of complaints from residents who said they were buried under a storm. The city is going fine. Broadway shows were full last night, Mr. Bloomberg told reporters, playing into critics caricature of him as a Manhattan-centric mayor unaware of life in the less-gilded quarters of the city. Later, it was reported that Mr. Bloombergs private plane and presumably its owner were in Bermuda. The same storm was, apparently, not enough of a concern to curtail Mr. Christies plans. He had planned, paid for and executed a vacation to Disneyworld while the people whod just elected him, were, as The Daily News put it, buried in an epic snowstorm. Feb. 9, 1969 The storm that lives in infamy. A sudden dump of 15 inches of snow eventually led to the death of 42 people and injured 288 others. It permanently scarred Mayor John Lindsays reputation, and, some said, gave cover to his successors: Anything short of Mr. Lindsays disastrous response was bound to appear favorable. The Timess J. David Goodman, Al Baker and James Glanz interviewed more than 100 people, and analyzed housing authority records. They write : For at least two decades, almost every time a child in its apartments tested positive for high lead levels, Nycha launched a counteroffensive, city records show. From 2010 through July of this year, the agency challenged 95 percent of the orders it received from the Health Department to remove lead detected in Nycha apartments. Private landlords almost never contest a finding of lead; they did so in only 4 percent of the 5,000 orders they received over the same period, records show. Nychas strategy often worked. The Health Department backed down in 158 of 211 cases in public housing after the authority challenged its finding, the data shows. Look ahead: Mr. Goodman emails to note that the de Blasio administration is trying to parry criticism over its handling of lead in public housing by exploring holding paint companies accountable. For help, a city official met with a historian and a lawyer.","For mayors and other officials, the backlash over storm preparations can be perilous. Now it’s Bill de Blasio’s turn.

Adam Duvernay,"Here's your Delaware weather forecast for March 30 through the middle of next week. 3/30/`8 Damian Giletto/The News Journal Snowfall between Sunday night and Monday morning is expected to be light for the area, according to the National Weather Service, but could lead to accumulation on the ground and roadways if conditions are right. (Photo: NWS) Easter Sunday may end with snowfall that lasts into early Monday. ""Unfortunately, this isn't an April Fools' Day joke,"" the National Weather Service in Mt. Holly, New Jersey, tweeted Saturday night. The forecaste calls for 2-3 inches in northern Delaware, part of a ""quick-hitting system"" with the most accumulation during a three to four hour window between 3-10 a.m., according to NWS. The heaviest accumulations are expected north of Philadelphia. A winter weather advisory will be in effect between midnight and 1 p.m. Monday. NWS says snowfall rates and temperatures will be the deciders for accumulation. The snow may accumulate because it's expected to fall mostly at night, avoiding the melting affect of daytime heat, NWS said. But April temperatures are above freezing. The most severe forecast for northern Delaware calls for 4 inches of snow; the least severe calls for less than 1 inch in the north and none elsewhere. A narrow band of heavy snow will set up over the area early Monday. A rate of 1 inch per hour could overcome a warm ground, allowing buildup on the ground and roads. The faster the weather changes from rain to snow, NWS said, the more will accumulate. The angle of April's sun means melting will occur faster than last month. The rain-snow line likely will fall across central Delaware, NWS said, leaving most of the snowfall for the northernmost regions of the state. NWS said the weather comes with a weak cold front that will move into the region Sunday morning and stall farther south by Monday morning followed by a surface low propagating east along the front Sunday night into Monday morning. Wilmington hasn't seen 2 inches of snow in April since 2000, when the city recorded about 2.1 inches of snow, according to NWS. In 1987, April brought 2.4 inches. The highest recorded snowfall for April was 12 inches in 1915, according to NWS. Forecasters are calling for another episode of regional snowfall between Sunday night and Monday morning. (Photo: AccuWeather) Sunday is expected to be mostly cloudy with a chance of showers in the morning, then a sunny afternoon, according to NWS. Highs are expected to be in the upper 40s. Monday morning snow is expected to be followed by a sunny afternoon with temperatures in the mid-40s, according to NWS. The region is likely to see two rounds of rain Tuesday into Wednesday, according to NWS. One with a warm front Tuesday morning, another with a cold front Wednesday. There's a chance a storm system may move through the region Friday night, NWS said. Contact at aduvernay@delawareonline.com or (302) 319-1855 or @duvINdelaware.

"Salisbury Daily Times, Meg Ryan, Salisbury Daily Times","A Greenbackville couple's premature baby was born the front seat of their truck during a snow storm. This month, he celebrates his first birthday.
 Meg Ryan, Salisbury Daily Times
As a storm ravaged the Delmarva area on the East Coast in January 2018, the peninsula was struck by subzero wind chill, hurricane-force wind gusts and snow.
Nikki and Tyler Watkinson were driving from Greenbackville, Virginia in the heavy snow as Nikki  at 24 weeks pregnant continued to feel pressure. 
I had no idea I was in labor,"" Nikki said. 
With the blizzard, dubbed winter storm Grayson by media outlets, already plowing through the peninsula, Tyler needed to navigate the drive with 4 inches of snow on the roads.  
I was literally screaming in his ear Please help me', "" she recounts. 
As the couple endured the 40-minute ride, Nikki felt the urge to push, causing her water to break. The next push brought their micro preemie son, weighing 1 pound, 11 ounce, into the world on the truck's front seat at 12:39 a.m. Jan. 4. 
""Is he breathing?"" Tyler asked. 
He got out three little cries,"" she responded. 
The Watkinson's son came into the world in his own storm and, after transferring hospitals, spent the next four months at the Children's National Health System neonatal intensive care unit in Washington, D.C.
Today, baby Grayson is happy and healthy. In mid-December, Nikki recounted the family's story to first lady Melania Trump during a return visit to the D.C. hospital. This month, they're celebrating Grayson's first birthday.

It was amazing, she was so sweet,"" she said. 
Tara Floyd, Children's National Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care Nursing director likes how the hospital has this national platform to share families stories. 
Kids are just super resilient, and I dont think the average person walking around on Michigan Avenue has any idea really that we are able to save these 1-pound babies now,"" she said. 
A treacherous hospital journey: Truck to NICU
Earlier in the night Grayson was born, Nikki and her OB-GYN doctor thought her pain could be caused by an urinary tract infection.
But, after taking prescription medicine, her condition continued to worsen.
The pain just kept getting worse and worse,"" she remembers. 
This is what led to the Watkinson's drive to PRMC.
As Nikki found a wax rag in the back of the truck to wrap Grayson in for warmth, Tyler called the Snow Hill Volunteer Fire Department to let paramedics know they needed assistance. 
As Grayson was swaddled in the wax rag and Nikki's jacket, the couple made it to the Snow Hill firehouse, where mother and child were scooped into an ambulance. Grayson's color was blue and his bronchial pulse was low, so Nikki, who's an emergency room registered nurse,  began doing compressions on her newly born infant. 
With their medical backgrounds (Tyler is a firefighter/paramedic), they were able to contribute calmness to the situation which allowed Nikki to focus and make sure Grayson was OK. 
People tell me all the time if it was anybody else, he wouldnt have made it, Nikki said.

A premature baby is born before reaching 37 weeks in the womb, according to March of Dimes. A micro preemie is born around 24 to 26 weeks, possibly even as early as 22 to 23 weeks, said Dr. Lamia Soghier, Children's National medical unit director. 
A micro preemie is born on the borderline of viability meaning if they were born a week or two before, they probably would have died because their systems are so immature, Soghier said. 
Pregnancies should be carried as close to full term as possible as long as there is no risk to the health of the pregnant mother or her fetus to avoid vulnerable preemies experiencing a delay in brain development, according to study results published by Pediatrics in October in a news release from Children's National.
During the third trimester, or the final 13 to 14 weeks of gestation, fetuses brains grow exponentially, and the body shifts energy to the brain to accommodate the neurological growth spurt. As the brain size increases four-fold, it develops critical structures and connections that will be relied upon for life, according to a news release. 
This is why every way the NICU takes care of a micro preemie and how quickly they react is incredibly important to quality of life. 
Being born at 24 weeks and weighing 1 pound, 11 ounces, Grayson couldn't stay at PRMC's NICU due to the equipment and specialist care he needed, leading to his transport to Children's National, which is a level four NICU, offering the highest level of care to babies born even at the youngest week of viability. 
The roller coaster of the NICU
Many babies in the NICU take two steps forward and one step back while fighting for their lives. 
Grayson was definitely the poster child for the roller coaster ride that is the NICU,"" Sullivan said. 
Saving a micro preemie starts with respiratory support in the form of mechanical ventilation until he is able to effectively breathe on his own. Next, total parenteral nutrition was given through his veins to provide the proper nutrition he needed to grow, and medications are given through central lines.
For four months, Nikki and Tyler stayed at the Ronald McDonald House Charities while Grayson was treated in the NICU. The couple shared updates on their journey through a Facebook page with family and friends. 
Nikki gets emotional as she remembers the various health scares Grayson went through during his stay. While friends and family watched over their dogs and home in Virginia, the couple stayed in the D.C. area. They would arrive at the hospital around 8 a.m. daily and stay with their newborn until about 10 p.m. 
It was a rough road,"" Nikki said.

The infant received multiple blood transfusions and underwent patent ductus arteriosus surgery, a type of heart duct surgery. This surgery was performed at his bedside as this keeps the baby safer than taking a trip to the operating room. 
But the biggest worry for Grayson and his parents were his grade four bilateral bleeds in the brain. When the bleeds were discovered Nikki and Tyler were told to really think about what quality of life they wanted to give their son. 
They told us were probably going to have to make harder decisions and pull the plugs pretty much,"" Nikki said with tears in her eyes. 
But the couple stood by their son, visiting him daily and praying he would pull through. 
And he did.
After more time and healing, the breathing tube was removed and he began to slowly get breastmilk through a feeding tube. From here he kept feeding and growing until he was strong enough to go home.
With an original diagnosis of little to no brain function or cerebral palsy, the Watkinsons took Grayson home after four months with the only concern being fine motor skills with his hands. 
To go from telling us were going to have to make some harder decisions to him being here is just nothing short of a miracle,"" Nikki said. 
Grayson turns 1 
Grayson is now a happy and alert baby after a whirlwind first few months. 
The Children's National staff was happy to see Nikki be able to share that story with Trump and everyone else in the NICU during the December event. 
Im really glad he got this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and Im sure hell have some unique pictures to share in his baby book! The first lady is a mother, too, so I imagine she understands how hard it is for our NICU families to be here, and why we do everything we can to help children. Grayson and all our NICU babies are like family to us, Floyd said. 
When Grayson is at home, he loves to play with the family's dogs, listen to his parents read and watch ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse."" 
He still needs to do physical therapy regularly for the motor skill issues and, like most premature babies, will have neurological visits every six months until he's 2 years old. 
Its just one day at a time with him, but hes just the happiest baby youll ever meet in your entire life, she said.  
The baby is continuing to meet milestones, now weighing 16 pounds, 3 ounces. Nikki said his growth chart shoots straight up as he continues to grow and catch up to other children his age. 
To celebrate Grayson's 1st birthday, the Watkinsons will hold a small party with close family and friends. For this family of three, every day is a celebration they're able to have their baby at home. 
Not many people get to be this lucky to bring their baby home out of the NICU when theyre born at 24 weeks,"" Nikki said.

Forecasters for the service said Sunday afternoon that it was “still too early to say” how much snow the region could get. However, flooding is a concern for coastal Massachusetts due to high tides and wind. Meteorologists have been tracking the storm since last Tuesday’s nor’easter, which resulted in heavy snow and roughly 160,000 power outages across the state. According to WBZ’s Eric Fisher, this week’s storm doesn’t look as intense, but the system and accompanying cold temperatures could conspire to result in snow.

"USA TODAY, Bart Jansen, USA TODAY","Stranded passengers relax near baggage claim at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on December 18, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo: Jessica McGowan, Getty Images) WASHINGTON – The Transportation Department is investigating scores of lengthy tarmac delays at the Atlanta airport in December, when a snowstorm followed by a power outage more than a week later disrupted thousands of flights. The snowstorm on Dec. 8 delayed 14 flights on the tarmac for more than three hours while waited to depart Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the department’s Air Travel Consumer Report announced Thursday. A fire Dec. 17 knocked out power lines that serve the airport, which halted flights most of the day. The outage led to 77 lengthy delays for domestic flights and 19 delays of at least four hours for international flights, according to the report. The department is investigating all of the lengthy delays. Hefty fines are possible when planes don’t allow passengers to exit within three hours for a domestic flight or four hours for an international flight. ARCHIVES : DOT: Delta fined $90,000 for lack of snacks during tarmac delays ARCHIVES : Snow in Atlanta! Flight cancellations spike as storm intensifies ( story continues below ) Last Slide Next Slide Delta Air Lines, which is based in Atlanta, suffered disproportionately. The airline estimated in January that it lost $60 million in pre-tax income from the storm and power outage. The airline typically prides itself on its completion factor. But Delta had the highest rate of cancelled flights among the dozen airlines that report to the department, with 2.9% of flights cancelled. Delta CEO Ed Bastian has said the airline would try to recover losses from the outage from the airport and the city of Atlanta. But no resolution has been announced yet. The six longest domestic delays for the month and the five longest international delays were all Delta flights, and all were on the day of the power outage.

The longest delays were 414 minutes for a flight arriving from Las Vegas, 411 minutes for a flight arriving from Rochester, N.Y., and 408 minutes for a flight arriving from Baton Rouge, La.

Andrew Freedman,"It's April. I know. Flowers should be blooming, outdoor lunches should be starting. But that springtime reality is a long way off for tens of millions of Americans. For people living across the Upper Midwest, Great lakes, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and New England, an Arctic blast and series of storm systems will make it look and feel more like February during the next week. There are now three separate storms threatening to bring snow to parts of this swath of the country between April 4 and April 12, as bitterly cold air — courtesy of the polar vortex — blasts its way south and east to the Atlantic seaboard. SEE ALSO: Watch this drag Elsa push a police van stuck in the snow during a blizzard in Boston On Friday, for example, temperatures in the north central states are likely to be at least 30 degrees below average for this time of year, with air temperatures holding below freezing all day in northern Minnesota and the Dakotas. The National Weather Service is forecasting Minneapolis' coldest April day on record on Friday, with a high temperature of just 21 degrees Fahrenheit. On Wednesday, the air temperature dropped to minus-6 degrees Fahrenheit in Aberdeen, South Dakota, setting a new monthly record low, the NWS found. The combination of the Arctic cold and an active storm track across the northern two-thirds of the country will keep snow in the forecast for places that would normally have high temperatures well into the 50s and 60s Fahrenheit at this point.

It's possible, too, that heavy snow will extend northward to Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston on Saturday. And that's not all. There are early indications that a coastal storm may form on Tuesday, April 11, bringing more wintry weather to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The cold is being driven by a large, polar vortex-associated upper level low that has set up shop near Hudson Bay, Canada for much of the latter part of this winter and into spring.

Andrew Freedman,"The fourth coastal storm in three weeks to hammer the Eastern Seaboard appears likely to form early next week, potentially delivering yet another crippling snowstorm to millions from the Mid-Atlantic to New England. Unlike the previous storms, this one is going to form further to the south, putting the Washington, D.C. area, along with coastal Maryland and Delaware, into play. We're sure they're thrilled to be included. The nor'easter continues to show up in projections from all the most reliable computer models, including the American model, known as the Global Forecast System or GFS, and the European Model, or ""Euro."" Other models, including one run by our Canadian neighbors, also depict the event. SEE ALSO: Third nor'easter in 2 weeks to slam New England: What's going on here? However, each of these model projections differs in important details that will ultimately determine who gets accumulating snow, who gets slop, and who gets heavy rain. Computer model projection for Wednesday March 21, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The most confident of all the storm impacts is that it will be a slow-mover, spinning off the coast of the Mid-Atlantic and moving to the northeast from Tuesday through Thursday. This will bring the threat of high onshore winds, battering waves, and coastal flooding to the beaches of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey. There's added uncertainty about whether the storm will move close enough to southern New England to result in another round of accumulating snow and coastal flooding there, but that is a possibility. If this storm follows a track that socks the D.C. area with heavy, wet snow and then slams the Philadelphia area, New York City, Hartford, and Boston, it would be a remarkable feat in a month that is already going down in the books in some areas as one of the snowiest Marches on record. Though snow fans in the DC area have had one of the most disappointing winters on record there, with fewer than 5 inches of snow falling all season so far. Parts of the Berkshires, Green and White Mountains have picked up nearly 100 inches of snow in the past 2 to 3 weeks alone, with about 5 feet at Snowshoe resort in West Virginia, too. But while the ski areas are rejoicing at this late season bounty, millions are getting tired of shoveling out their driveways, enduring power outages, and clearing up tree damage from their property. To them, another storm is not exactly good news. The string of storms is the result of a combination of factors that meteorologists observed as they moved into place in February. Computer models of the next storm show a familiar scenario of a large dip, or trough, in the jet stream carving out a slow-moving storm system across the East next week. The storm will be effectively stuck in place, hemmed in by a blocking pattern over the North Atlantic and Greenland, consisting of an area of high pressure in the mid-to-upper atmosphere. Such blocking patterns tend to be prerequisites for big East Coast snowstorms, because they help disturbances embedded in different branches of the jet stream to come together, or ""phase,"" creating a major storm system. Other factors – including a displaced polar vortex, record negative North Atlantic Oscillation index, and climate pattern in the tropics that favors more storminess – help explain why the East Coast is having such a hard time letting winter go. Differences between computer models in projecting the evolution of the midweek storm have to do with how and when weather disturbances phase, as well as the precise track of a low pressure area along the coast. Computer models will likely jump around through the weekend as they try to get a better handle on the ingredients for the storm, potentially resulting in big changes to the forecast.","The fourth coastal storm in three weeks to hammer the Eastern Seaboard appears likely to form early next week, potentially delivering yet another crippling snowstorm to millions from the Mid-Atlantic to New England.

Andrew Freedman,"It all started innocently enough. Shortly before New Year's celebrations kicked off in the Southeast, a record-cold air mass blew in from the north. This air had a direct connection to the Arctic, spilling out as if someone left the Northern Hemisphere's refrigerator door open. This frigid air oozed across the Gulf of Mexico, into Florida, and served as one of the catalysts for a low pressure area to develop in the Bahamas on Tuesday. Snow flurries were even reported on an oil platform off the coast of Louisiana. SEE ALSO: Incredible photos from space show off the historic East Coast 'bomb cyclone' The cold air sitting over unusually warm Atlantic Ocean waters helped set up a huge thermal, or heat, contrast, which the East Coast's bomb cyclone was then able to take advantage of and intensify at nearly unheard of rates late Wednesday and Thursday. During the 24 hour period ending at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, the storm's central air pressure dropped by 59 millibars, to 951 millibars, which put the blizzard in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying storms. No other non-tropical storm has intensified this rapidly off the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast in the past 30 years or more.

So much to see! pic.twitter.com/OS4hLO9wOd — Jeff Frame (@VORTEXJeff) January 4, 2018 After the cold air moved into the Southeast, all that was needed for a storm to form was a trigger to come along. Mother Nature delivered multiple triggers on Wednesday, when three distinct, potent waves of energy embedded within the jet stream moved over the area. According to meteorologist Alex Lamers of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, meteorologists are scrambling to understand how this storm got so strong, so quickly. The temperature contrast was just one of the key ingredients that set this storm off, he said. “You had a really anomalously cold air mass south to the Gulf,"" Lamers said in an interview. “I think that was a big driver, just the big gradients in temperature and moisture,” he said. Some other factors, he said, may not be known now, and will require further study by researchers. “I think that was probably a big factor, and then jet [stream] dynamics probably played a big role too,” Lamers said. Winds at the upper levels of the atmosphere, within the highway of air that steers weather systems, promoted ascending air and storm intensification, Lamers said. 10 AM official WPC analysis has low pressure down to 951mb, a remarkable drop of 59 millibars in 24 hours. Also 38mb in the last 12 hours. pic.twitter.com/TgoLDS9J7h — Alex Lamers (@AlexJLamers) January 4, 2018 Sam Lillo, a meteorology Phd. student at the University of Oklahoma, said the jet stream disturbances acted ""like a vacuum, evacuating mass out of the column of atmosphere [and] resulting in decreasing pressure at the surface."" ""Even one shortwave interacting with the low and its subtropical connection would've resulted in a strong Atlantic storm. The three shortwaves also aren't perfectly phasing, so the actual ceiling for the strength of this storm was likely even higher."" Another ingredient in the bomb cyclone was unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Western Atlantic, Lillo said in a Twitter message. ""These origins, along with the unusually high Atlantic sea surface temperatures are important because there has been extraordinary influence from latent heat fluxes and deep convection in this storm...,"" he said, referring to the formation of powerful thunderstorms as part of the low pressure area. The above normal sea surface temperatures also produced an unusually sharp zone of temperature contrasts, which helped to fuel the low pressure area, Lamers said. Such storms, after all, feed off of the differences in air masses, so the bigger the contrast in air masses, the stronger the storm may get.

The main difference between a rapidly intensifying storm like the one on Thursday and one that intensifies at a more typical rate for the Northeast is that storms that undergo bombogenesis tend to produce higher wind gusts, as well as more thunderstorms. They can also be more difficult to predict, since computer models may struggle to predict their complex evolution. With winds gusting to at least 80 miles per hour, and a foot-plus of snow already falling in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, it's clear that the bomb cyclone of 2018 lived up to most of the hype. Now it's up to meteorologists to figure out how to better predict more storms like it in the future.","It all started innocently enough.

Andrew Freedman,"The ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday exceeded weather forecasters' expectations in nearly every way. It dumped more than a foot of snow on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including 16 inches in Islip, Long Island, and flooded parts of downtown Boston with a storm surge that sent water rising to historic levels. The storm got its name for the process known as bombogenesis, which describes a storm whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained On Thursday, the bomb cyclone intensified by 59 millibars in 24 hours, which is the fastest rate ever observed in any other winter storm along the East Coast since at least 1976, according to data from David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, and Andrea Lang, an assistant professor at the University of Albany. Lang said that research by her and Hannah Attard, a doctoral student in her research group, found 1,218 cyclones that originated north of 30 degrees North latitude and met the bombogenesis criteria in the Northern Hemisphere between 1980 and 2015. This indicates that meteorological bombs, so to speak, aren't that rare. ""What is uncommon is the rate of deepening for the 4 January cyclone,"" Lang said in an email. ""If you filter all 1218 cyclones that meet the 'bomb' criteria for those that occurred in a box just off the East Coast (60-80˚W and 30-55˚N) we find 23 'bomb' cyclones in the 1980-2015 reanalysis data."" ""This storm would be the new number 1 in terms of 24 hr mean sea level pressure fall... for storms on our list,"" she added. The intensification rate isn't just a bit of trivia for weather geeks, either. It had implications for the storm's impacts, primarily by accelerating the storm's winds. Winds gusted to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across Cape Cod and the Islands, and high winds raked everywhere from the Carolinas to Nova Scotia. This occurred because air was rushing in toward the center of the storm in response to the rapid drop in air pressure. Such winds helped drive the storm surge flooding that created so many problems in New England, too. The satellite imagery taken of the storm clearly shows how intense it became, as it even sported an eye-like feature near its center. Meteorologist Jeff Frame annotated an image to show all the meteorological features it revealed. There are many reasons why this storm intensified so quickly and significantly, with a minimum pressure eventually dropping to levels more typically seen in Category 2 or 3 hurricanes. For one, there were tremendous contrasts in air masses between cold, dry Arctic air pouring in from the northwest, and moisture-rich subtropical air streaming north over the Atlantic. ""There are several factors that contribute to the intensification of all cyclones, all of these factors were on the extreme side for this event,"" Lang said. ""All extratropical cyclones, which includes storms like nor'easters, form on boundaries between cold and warm air. However, not all nor'easters form when there is record-breaking cold air already in place along the east coast,"" she said. ""In general terms, the magnitude and scale of the temperature contrast is an indicator of energy available for cyclone intensification."" Zoomed-in satellite image of the eye-like feature in the 'bomb cyclone' on Jan. 4, 2018. Image: noaa Lang said that the southern location of the initial storm, which spun up near the coast of Florida, added more energy to the mix. ""The fact that the cyclone formed as far south as it did allowed the cyclone [to maintain] a link to the subtropics (nicely shown in the satellite imagery),"" she said. ""The subtropical link provided the cyclone with a source of fuel, in the form of water vapor, that fed the large field of precipitation and enhanced the storm strength."" While many of the East Coast's most memorable snowstorms also underwent bombogenesis, there was nothing typical about this particular weather bomb.

Andrew Freedman,"We've been warning for two days now that a major storm would develop along the East Coast and intensify so rapidly that it could earn a place in the record books. We were the first to call it a ""weather bomb"" or ""bomb cyclone,"" and now that that term has taken off in the broader media, it's important to understand just what it means. ""Bomb cyclone"" may seem like an obscure expression invented by meteorologists for attention, or to describe some sinister atmosphere terrorism plot, but it's actually rooted in the science of meteorology. SEE ALSO: 'Bomb cyclone' to pummel East Coast, followed by a polar vortex-related cold snap It refers to a meteorological phenomenon known as bombogenesis, in which a storm's minimum central pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such storms are common in the fall and winter along the East Coast, and most major snowstorms that hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast meet this definition. What's unusual about this particular storm is that it's likely to greatly exceed the typical intensification rate to qualify as a weather bomb, perhaps even doubling that rate. This would put it in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storms in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin. Meteorologist Ryan Maue of Weather.us said on Twitter that this storm is likely to be in the top 15 percent of all ""bomb cyclones,"" based on the intensification rate. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections have consistently been showing that this storm could reach a peak intensity, as measured by its minimum air pressure, close to that of Hurricane Sandy when that monstrous storm slammed into the New Jersey coast in Oct. 2012.

It then spirals inward toward the center, rises and exits through the top. If more air is leaving the storm than is sucked inward, the pressure falls even more and the system will continue to grow."" The rapid intensification of this storm, which the National Weather Service has repeatedly pointed to in its public forecast discussions, is tied to its impacts over land, because such a sharp drop in air pressure will cause extremely strong winds. The Weather Service is predicting winds as high as 50 miles per hour along much of the East Coast, including New York City, with gusts to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across eastern New England.

The greatest risk for such outages is across southern New England, including the greater Boston area and Cape Cod and the Islands. The storm currently gathering strength over the Gulf Stream waters off the Southeast coast may end up being comparable in its intensification rate to a storm that struck New England in March of 2014, which brought 80 mile-per-hour winds to Cape Cod despite tracking farther off the coast than the present-day storm. Though the term may be new to you, ""bomb cyclone"" isn't a new weapon developed by some mad scientist, or a desperate attempt by weather nerds to get clicks. Instead, it's a type of storm that is relatively rare, but which you've probably experienced before. These storms are awesome to behold, transforming from small splotches of cloud cover to fully formed, comma-shaped behemoths in as little as 24 hours. This transformation will occur between today and tomorrow, leading to some spectacular weather satellite imagery. With weather communication, as well as science communication in general, it can often be difficult to engage a wide audience and make them aware of imminent risks. Pulling terminology from the scientific lexicon is a valid way to do that, provided that the terms match the phenomena being predicted. A similar dynamic played out with the polar vortex winter four years ago, when an actual weather term was popularized for the first time, and became part of popular culture seemingly overnight.

Andrew Freedman,"An unusually powerful storm is threatening the East Coast of the U.S. this week with heavy snow, high winds, and record-shattering cold not seen in some places since the early 20th Century — if at all. The storm will be the result of a combination of three strong pieces of atmospheric energy, known to meteorologists as shortwaves. Think of these shortwaves as protein bars for storm formation. This particular storm, which is already beginning to form off the coast of Florida, will devour enough of them to allow it to become so powerful that it will contain hurricane force winds by the time it moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast late Wednesday night. SEE ALSO: Niagara Falls is a frigid, beautiful wonderland right now Because of the cold air in place ahead of the storm, winter storm watches and advisories for this event have been issued as far south as Florida, all the way northward to Massachusetts, which is nearly unheard of. In fact, some computer model runs show that the storm could intensify far faster than what would be required for the tempest to be known as a weather 'bomb,' for a process called ""bombogenesis."" This term refers to a low pressure area whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. By feasting off of intense atmospheric disturbances as well as differences in air masses and ocean temperatures, including the moisture rich Gulf Stream waters, the upcoming tempest is projected to exceed that intensification rate by several more millibars in 24 hours. This intensification rate, if it comes to pass, would be astonishing. Some computer models are projecting a minimum central air pressure of below 950 millibars at its peak, which would be nearly unheard of for this part of the world outside of a hurricane. For comparison, Hurricane Sandy had a minimum central pressure of about 946 millibars when it made its left hook into New Jersey in 2012. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections show that this storm is likely to reach a peak intensity that is rarely seen off the East Coast, with a minimum central air pressure of about 950 millibars. This is comparable to the air pressure measured in a Category 3 hurricane. Storm track is key The big question concerns the storm's track. As of Tuesday morning, most computer model projections and human-made forecasts showed it heading just far enough out to sea to spare all but Cape Cod and the Canadian Maritimes from a punishing blow of heavy precipitation, damaging winds, and coastal flooding. Animation of projected satellite imagery, showing the explosive storm development along the East Coast. This is NAM 3KM model data. Image: tropicaltidbits However, even a 50-mile shift westward in the storm track, which is entirely plausible at this point in the game, would put Boston in the crosshairs for potential blizzard conditions, and a 100-mile shift — which is also within the realm of possibility, would put New York City in play. The forecast trend through midday Tuesday has been to move the track slightly to the west, given forecasters in New York, Philadelphia, and Connecticut heartburn. As of Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service was forecasting 2 to 4 inches of snow in New York City from this storm on Wednesday night through Thursday, but such amounts may have to be raised dramatically if the storm shifts west, and conversely if there's an eastward shift. The track of the storm depends on the subtle interactions between the two pieces of energy diving southeastward from the Pacific Northwest, as well as energy from the southern branch of the jet stream. Even with supercomputers and other modern assets at their disposal, forecasting storms such as this one still tests meteorologists' ability to anticipate what the capricious atmosphere will do. Nova Scotia is likely to take a direct hit from this storm on Friday, with widespread power outages from hurricane force winds, along with heavy snow, heavy rain, and battering waves. This could be a storm for the record books there, as well as Downeast Maine, again depending on the exact track of the low pressure area. Stupid-level cold follows this storm Even if the storm leaves a fluffy 3 to 4 inches of snow in New York and Philadelphia, rather than a crippling blizzard with snow measured in feet, it is still going to have one dangerous impact that is quite certain to occur in those locations. The heart of cold air over North America and parts of the Arctic is currently parked over Hudson Bay, Canada. Temperature departures from average projection from the Euro model for Saturday morning, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell The enormous circulation around this storm is likely to drag this cold air down behind it, as if the low pressure area itself is reaching around and slapping New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Washington, D.C. residents right in the face. How rude. The cold weather that will result is going to be more frigid than anything that residents of the Midwest and East Coast have experienced so far during what has been an unusually intense and long-lasting cold snap. Instead of breaking daily temperature records, as dozens of cities have been, all-time cold temperature records will be threatened on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. For example, the high temperature in New York City may not get above the single digits on Saturday, with overnight lows in the metro area plunging below zero. Forecast record cold high temperatures on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018. Broken records indicated by circles. Image: nws/weatherbell Record low temperatures that have stood for decades or longer could fall, and infrastructure from home water pipes to city water mains and fire hydrants could fail in such cold. As former Weather Service meteorologist Gary Szatkowski explained via Twitter on Tuesday morning, areas that don't get much snow from this storm, but that do get into the heart of the cold air mass, could have more infrastructure problems since snow cover acts as an effective insulator to the ground below it. For people venturing out into the cold this weekend, frostbite will be a risk on any exposed skin within minutes of being outside, particularly on Friday night, as gusty winds whip across the Northeast behind the storm. The good news, however, is that there are signs of a ""warm up"" toward more average temperatures in the Midwest and East by early to midweek next week.

ELIZA SHAPIRO and MICHAEL GOLD,"Mr. de Blasios then-schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, defended their decision by declaring, Its a beautiful day. The comment landed her days of unflattering coverage on the front pages of the citys tabloids.
Snow day decisions involve a complicated calculus of politics and logistics. The citys response to the most recent storm typically influences the next decision; if the mayor was seen as overly alarmist over just a few inches, he may be more hesitant to cancel schools, but if he took heat for mismanaging a storm, it is easier to make the case for an abundance of caution.
A morning snowstorm can be particularly tricky for schools because a massive fleet of yellow buses have to leave their depots, typically before the sun rises, and pick up tens of thousands of students. Those buses then interfere with the 1,600 snow plows the mayor said would comb the streets overnight. Heavy snow can impact subway service, and New Yorkers are familiar with city buses skidding and sliding across avenues in bad weather.
Then there is the question of unreliable forecasts: Mr. de Blasio defended his administrations response to the November storm by noting that the forecast only called for an inch of snow, when six inches that fell during rush hour an especially inconvenient time paralyzed the city. One meteorologist noted on Monday that had the temperature been just a few degrees colder overnight, the modest snowfall could have been closer to eight inches or more.
With the start of spring just a few weeks away, Mr. de Blasio was likely also betting that it would be the only snow day of the season. In the past, the city has been more hesitant to close schools early in the winter.
Mr. de Blasio was not the only local official who shuttered schools on Monday. In New Jersey, where Gov. Philip D. Murphy declared a state of emergency, school districts began announcing closures or delayed openings as early as Sunday evening.
Schools in the cities of Hoboken, Secaucus and Jersey City, all just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, were all closed on Monday. In suburban Bergen County, about 30 school districts opted to close for the day; roughly an equal number opted to open late.",It is a fact of New York City politics that a mayor is only as popular as his most recent snow day decision.,2019-03-04T17:45:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Snow Day: Was de Blasio Too Quick to Cancel School?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/nyregion/school-snow-day-nyc.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/nyregion/04SNOWDAYS-01/04SNOWDAYS-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snowstorm,1
Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"NASA may have declared its Opportunity rover lost, but well always have its data and bank of raw images. The mission team has now processed an incredible panorama from these files for your viewing pleasure. You can see it below and scroll around a larger version on the NASA press page here.
Opportunity, along with its partner, Spirit, launched in 2003 as part of the Mars Exploration Rover program to study Mars surface. Over nearly 15 years, it traversed more than 28 miles of Red Planet before ultimately meeting its end during a planet-wide snowstorm last June. Oppy gave us an understanding of what Mars truly looks like and found evidence that the planet was once wet.
One important part of the mission was sharing images with the public as they came outa practice that has now become standard for space agenciesand it has had a big impact on the way we conceive of Mars. This latest panorama is like a greatest hits of the Red Planet, containing Mars signature reddish rocks, the rim of Endeavour Crater, pieces of Opportunity itself, and views of its tracks. The Rovers Panoramic Camera, or Pancam, took the 354 photos in the image from May 13 to June 10. NASA also produced a 3D-version of the panorama, viewable through blue-and-red 3D glasses.
If you look at the raw images that came from Opportunity, youll notice that theyre all black-and-white. The Pancam contains filters in order to view light as only a single wavelength, or color, so these black-and-white images correspond to light received by the camera in only one color. For these images, the filters block out all light except for three wavelengths: 753 nanometers (near-infrared), 535 nanometers (green), and 432 nanometers (violet). If you combine these images by putting each one into the red, green, or blue color channel, you can see an approximate true-color image of what Mars looks like. You can learn more about how NASA turns raw files into full-color images for the general public here.
Opportunity might be dead, but there are tons of raw images left cataloguing its incredible journey across the Martian surface. Ive had some fun playing with them in Photoshop, and I encourage you to do the same.","NASA may have declared its Opportunity rover lost, but we’ll always have its data and bank of raw images.

SARAH MERVOSH,"Although Mr. Lund was not responsible for delivering mail door to door, he tried to follow the Postal Services unofficial motto, which says that neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will keep the mail from being delivered.
Ive run through snow that was four feet deep, Mr. Lund said in a phone interview.
Once, he said, he was stopped by a highway patrolman who told him a road was closed. I said, This is a U.S. Mail truck. You cannot stop it legally if there is a possible chance that it can get through, Mr. Lund recalled. I bluffed him, I guess, because he let me go.
He recalled one big snowstorm in the 1970s that shut down his route between Utah and Arizona for two days, and a few instances when a truck breakdown caused a short delay. But other than that, he said, weve delivered the mail.
In recent years, Mr. Lunds work day started at about 5 p.m., when he picked up mail from the post office in Richfield and drove it about two hours north to Provo, where mail is processed and sent across the country. At 2:30 a.m., mail destined for Richfield and beyond was ready to be picked up, and he drove it back to his home post office.
If it wasnt for this guy, we wouldnt ever get our mail in our post offices, Mr. Kirschner said. He is the one who gets it to us so we can do our jobs.

VIVIAN WANG,"Movie Theater: Some of the most famous films in history opened at Radio City: the original “King Kong,” “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” “To Kill a Mockingbird” and Disney’s “The Lion King,” to name a few. Ms. Paley, a lifelong New Yorker, recalled going to see Mary Poppins, which also premiered there, “a whole bunch of times.” Sports Arena: The first sporting event to be held at Radio City was a light-heavyweight boxing match that took place on Jan. 15, 2000. Sports didn’t return to the hall until 2004, when the Liberty, New York’s WNBA team, played six games there while the Republican National Convention took over their home court at Madison Square Garden, according to a story in The Times. Fans might have missed the stadium, but they at least got their court: The actual court from the Garden was transported to Radio City and put onstage, The Times reported. Mall? Theme Park? American Stock Exchange?: It seems unthinkable today, but Radio City was almost demolished in 1978, after plummeting attendance threw the hall into debt. The Rockefellers considered turning the space into a mall or a theme park, the former New York Times editor Daniel Okrent wrote in his book about the history of Rockefeller Center. A Times article from the time said it might be the new home of the American Stock Exchange. But New Yorkers rallied to save their beloved hall, and its interior was designated a landmark in March 1978. Kent Barwick, the chair of the Landmarks Preservation Commission at the time, recalled how the city came together. Calls jammed the switchboards at Rockefeller Center. The Rockettes danced on the steps of City Hall. “Radio City Music Hall is something that people felt belonged to them,” Mr. Barwick said.

Photo Radio City Music Hall, circa 1975. Credit Hulton Archive, via Getty Images The rescue of Radio City in 1978 wasn’t just a victory for New Yorkers who wanted to see a movie, show or the Rockettes on that storied stage. It was also a major victory for preservationists and historians. Radio City was the first big test for whether the city could landmark the interiors, in addition to the exteriors, of buildings, said Kate Wood, a preservationist and co-author of a book on New York’s interior landmarks. Legally, the answer was clear: The 1965 New York City Landmarks Law was amended in 1973 to include interiors. But until Radio City, the landmarks commission had never applied the law to the inside of a commercial building without the owner’s cooperation, Ms. Wood said. Radio City was different. Rockefeller Center’s owners were determined to tear down the hall. When the city tried to landmark it, they sued. “They brought out the big legal gun,” Ms. Wood said. “It could’ve overturned the entire landmarks law and the ability to protect any interiors.” When the landmarks commission prevailed, Ms. Wood said, it reaffirmed the group’s mission. “To me it’s that moment of realization that the value of these spaces is not just in dollars,” she said. “It’s what they mean to New Yorkers and the spirit of New York.” Ms. Wood said Radio City’s interior is the city’s most extensive interior landmark, protecting everything from the auditorium to the grand staircase to the bathrooms. “To me, it’s worth buying a ticket for a show or going on a tour of Radio City just to go into the bathrooms,” she said. “They’re bathrooms like you’ve never seen before.” New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

Adam Rosenberg,"Parts of the Southeastern United States woke up to a most unusual sight on Wednesday morning: Snow and ice. The icy onslaught came from the incipient stages of a rapidly intensifying storm that threatens to set off a ""meteorological bomb"" as it creeps north through Wednesday night, but it's already making history in the South. Regions of the U.S. that aren't accustomed to seeing snowy weather are bracing for record-setting accumulation. SEE ALSO: People are losing their minds over historic Southern snowstorm In Tallahassee, a Florida city that hasn't seen any snow in decades, a measurable (if small) amount was visible on Wednesday morning. The 0.1 inches of accumulation might seem like nothing to a northerner, but it was more than enough in Tallahassee to prompt a warning from local police. The nearby Gulf Coast of Louisiana has also gotten a rare taste of snow and freezing rain, thanks to the unusual Arctic air mass in place ahead of the storm.

But the storm's historic impact will be well-established by then. The storm's unusually heavy impact on southern states is the product of a powerful and long-lasting Arctic blast that brought cold air much further south than is normal.

http://kdvr.com/fox31-kdvr-channel-2-kwgn-on-facebook/,"Denver and the Front Range will see the biggest accumulations so far this season with a storm that moves in tonight. This storm system will bring big snowfall totals and impacts to travel. Snow is already falling in Western Colorado and in the northeast mountains and will make its way to Denver and the I-25 corridor between 10pm and 1am tonight. It will most likely start in Denver, the Front Range, and plains as freezing drizzle and then change over to snow early Sunday morning. Freezing drizzle will create a layer of ice underneath snow on the roadways making roads slick through the day on Sunday. Snow showers will stick around for most of the day in the mountains, plains, and on the I-25 corridor and will be heavy at times. Winds will be gusty (especially on the plains) causing reduced visibility and making travel difficult at times. It is best to stay home if you can. Snow will taper off from west to east Sunday night ending on the I-25 corridor and mountains by 11pm and clearing out of the plains by 6am Monday morning. Totals will reach 4-8 inches for the Front Range including Castle Rock, Denver, and Fort Collins. The central mountains will see 6-14 inches of snow with the northern mountains expecting 5-12 inches. The northeast plains will see 5-10 inches of snow with Southern Colorado and the southeast plains picking up 1-4 inches. The last time Denver saw over 4 inches of snow was back on December 16, 2016. A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for the Denver metro area and northeast plains until 5 p.m. Sunday. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for the mountains until 2 p.m. Sunday. High temperatures will only reach the 20s in most spots on Sunday. It is possible we will still see slick roadways for the Monday morning commute with morning lows in the teens. Denver will dry out for the rest of the week with highs in the 30s and 40s each day. There is a slight chance for some flurries on Friday. Check interactive radar and zoom in to where you are.

The West Orange public school district ordered its buses to ""shelter in place"" on Thursday afternoon as car crashes jammed up traffic on the icy highway nearby. ""When the West Orange Police Department provides the all clear, those buses will begin their route,"" the school district said in an update on its website Thursday evening.

Faculty stayed to supervise the students who remained. As the hours ticked by and snow continued to fall, the school district ultimately decided to follow a ""shelter in place protocol"" for the students still in their care. ""Elementary, middle and high school students who remain in the schools have eaten dinner and are safe with familiar teachers and staff,"" the West Orange public school district said in another update Thursday night. Students hang out in the auditorium of Liberty Middle School after some were forced to stay overnight due to a snow storm, West Orange, New Jersey, Nov. 15, 2018.

Rain, freezing rain and flurries are anticipated throughout the morning Monday in many areas as temperatures hover in the low 40s. A wave of low pressure will bring accumulating snowfall Monday night, around 10 p.m. It is expected to continue into Tuesday morning. The National Weather Service predicts most counties will see roughly 1-2 inches, but along the New Hampshire border and out west in the Berkshires, a total of 3-6 inches of snow is possible.

Dave Dildine,"WASHINGTON — It’s the bottom of the sixth inning and winter weather has only gotten on base a few times. Warm-weather fans have high hopes for a shutout in Washington. The total snow score at Reagan National Airport this winter? A measly 3.1 inches, most it falling in paltry doses. By this point in an average winter, D.C. should have seen over 10 inches, according to climate data maintained by the National Weather Service. Up until recently, precipitation in general had been hard to come by. Recent sleet and rainfall in the past week has stabilized the escalating drought, but the precipitation deficit persists as the growing season draws closer and the snow drought drags on. So far, this season appears to be following in the footsteps (not foot prints) of last winter, which only yielded 3.4 inches of snow. No measurable snow fell last February, and just a trace has been recorded this month. Despite being the shortest, February is typically the snowiest month of the year for the region, with a total accumulation of 5.7 inches expected for the District. Dulles Airport averages 7.8 inches for February. The northern and western suburbs have seen slightly more snow, but the tallies are still lower than normal. “This winter our storm track just hasn’t been favorable to get snow in our area,” said Storm Team 4 meteorologist Amelia Draper. Draper said the large-scale weather pattern over the North Atlantic Ocean can shunt storms straight out to sea or drag them northward as snow-packed nor’easters. “What we’ve seen is a positive North Atlantic Oscillation, a pattern that we monitor. We really want the NAO to be negative to get more storms moving into our area,” Draper said. Chance is still alive for diehard snow lovers. The long-range weather pattern over the eastern U.S. and Atlantic Ocean is forecast to become slightly more favorable for coast storms by the middle and end of the month. Several recent winters have featured measurable snowfall during March as well, including last year. A few winters have delivered much more late-season snow: The 1993 March Superstorm blindsided fair-weather fans in D.C. just days after highs near 60 degrees at the tail end of a winter that had only seen a few inches. As we approach the anniversary of the Blizzard of 1983, it’s also worth remembering that D.C. owes its average 15.4 inches of seasonal snow in part to the prolific snow producers that zero in on the Mid-Atlantic once in a blue moon. Curiously, virtually all of Washington’s most memorable snowstorms, including the 1993 Superstorm, occurred on a Friday or on a weekend. For the underdog, a late-season comeback is still possible.

Mark Torregrossa | mtorregr@mlive.com,"It really looks like the first widespread winter storm will move through Michigan Sunday night into Monday. The big question is what path will it take? The path determines who shovels four inches or more of heavy, wet snow. To figure out the track of an approaching storm, we look at weather computer models. There are two models that are preferred for forecasting storm tracks a few days in advance. It's usually a battle of which model turns out with a better forecast. And that's the scenario with this coming storm. Two totally different weather scenarios are forecasted by the U.S. model called the GFS, and the European Model. You might wonder why Europe cares about the U.S. weather. Remember these are global models that forecast more than 10 days in the future. The storm hitting Michigan now will be in Europe in five days. On the image above I've drawn where the heaviest swath of snow is forecast from the two different models. The U.S. model (called the GFS) takes the storm center across central Michigan. The heavy snow band is in the colder air in the northwest half of Lower Michigan. This is the model the National Weather Service is basing its placement of winter storm watches. The European Model has a totally different idea. It takes the storm center farther south, placing the heavy snow swath across the southern half of Lower Michigan. Both weather models have similar timing on starting and ending of the storm, and amounts in the heavy part of the snow. But the big difference is the placement of the heavy snow. It means the difference between rain changing to some snow or an all-out snowstorm. Which model will be correct? The European Model is usually more accurate, but the U.S. model seems like it would have the more plausible solution. We are going to be in the 40s in Lower Michigan today and Sunday. So for the European Model to be correct and shift south, cold air would have to move in before the storm. It seems like cold air getting in ahead of the storm is going to be hard to do. The National Weather Service is leaning toward the U.S. solution of a northern Lower snowstorm. This will be a great example to see which model is running better for the early part of winter. If the European comes through, and we eventually have the southern snowstorm, it will hint toward another winter of the European model's superior performance. Over the next 24 hours we will see the trend, and I'll keep you updated. Another scenario is the final outcome is somewhere between the two current forecasts. Whatever happens, we have to realize we are in a truly winter pattern.","MLive.com First big winter storm for Lower Michigan, but for what parts?

Veuer's Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60 A pedestrian walks during heavy snowfall along Garland Groh Blvd. in Hagerstown, Md., Tuesday, March 20, 2018. (Photo: Colleen McGrath, AP) The first full day of spring brought yet another snowstorm to the eastern U.S. Wednesday, leading to travel chaos and widespread school and business cancellations. Up to a foot of heavy, wet snow was forecast to fall from the mid-Atlantic and into New England today will lead to property damage and power outages through tonight, AccuWeather said. Noting that we're in the midst of a ""hyperactive weather pattern,"" the National Weather Service issued winter storm watches and warnings were all the way from Kentucky to Maine, a distance of some 1,000 miles. Winds will strengthen throughout the day especially along the coast where coastal flooding will become possible. If the wind coincides with the heavy snow bands, blizzard conditions are possible in parts of southern New England and New Jersey coast. “I didn’t think I’d still need to keep storm stuff in my car in late March, but what are you going to do?” Wilson Collins said as he prepared to leave his Toms River, N.J, home on Wednesday morning, Residents were being urged to stay home and off the roads, if possible, on Wednesday, so crews could work to keep streets clear. In Washington, D.C., the federal offices closed for the day. This included the White House, which cancelled all public events for the day. Some 4,000 flights were canceled across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday as of 7:25 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Nearly all had been canceled preemptively by late Tuesday. In New York City, where 16 inches was expected, the snow started at about 6:30 a.m. and was soon swirling around the skyscrapers of Midtown Manhattan and residential neighborhoods in the borough. Workers could be seen scurrying to work, emerging from subways to face the increasing precipitation. There were no students on public transportation, however, because early Tuesday evening the New York City Board of Education called a snow day, meaning the system’s 1.1 million public school students would be staying home. Meanwhile, city workers had spread chemicals and grit on streets in anticipation of the snow, which was predicted to keep falling until the early hours of Thursday morning. In the West, another storm will bring heavy rain to southern coastal California, where flash flooding and mudslides are possible.

DES MOINES  Corey Brown, the missing 13-year-old Iowa boy who was found dead Sunday, died of blunt force trauma after he apparently fell from a communication tower, police said Wednesday.
The body of Brown was found by a search team near the tower in a secluded area on the west side of Marshalltown, Iowa, authorities said. He had suffered a significant head injury.
Brown went over a secured fence and climbed onto the tower before he fell from an undetermined distance, authorities said their preliminary investigation showed. Police again said no criminal activity was suspected in Brown's death. 
The state medical examiner performed Brown's autopsy Tuesday. Toxicology results would not be available for as many as eight weeks, police said.

Temperatures dipped below zero for three days after Brown disappeared. He left his parents home on the city's south side after they had a ""disciplinary discussion"" with him and took his phone away, police chief Michael Tupper said. 
When Brown did not return, a couple hundred people, many in snowsuits and winter boots, offered to help police in the search. But officials sent the volunteers home so the search could be handled by professionals.
Green ribbons were tied around trees across town, and neighbors replaced porch lights with green bulbs in support of Brown, whose favorite color was green.
Residents said Brown's death was another blow to the city of about 27,000 people after a twister plowed through town in July, damaging numerous buildings that included the downtown courthouse.

Mid-to-late January is typically the heart of winter for much of the nation, and it's certainly no exception this year.
Yet another winter storm began to batter the central U.S. on Tuesday, closing schools and wreaking travel havoc on the roads and at the airports.
The storm will ramp up in intensity Wednesday across the upper Midwest and around the Great Lakes, according to the National Weather Service. Brutal cold will follow the storm later in the week.
On Tuesday, a 100-mile stretch of I-80 was closed in Wyoming, dozens of accidents were reported in the Denver area, and hundreds of flights cancelled at several airports, the Weather Channel said. 
Fatal accidents involving vehicles sliding off icy roadways were reported in Wisconsin and Illinois on Tuesday.

Winter storm watches and warnings remained in effect late Tuesday from eastern Colorado to northern Michigan, the National Weather Service said. Up to a foot of snow is possible over portions of the Great Lakes.
The bulk of the snow will fall along parts of interstates 80, 90 and 94 corridors from Nebraska to Wisconsin, AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said. The snow will lead to slippery roadways and disruptions to daily routines.
Omaha, Nebraska; Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Madison and Green Bay, Wisconsin are among the communities where the heaviest snowfall could set up into early Wednesday, AccuWeather said.
The Weather Channel has named it Winter Storm Indra. 
South of the snowy weather, heavy rain will pelt much of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic on Wednesday and into Thursday. Due to the rain, urban flooding is possible in the major I-95 cities from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston.
Then, once the storm moves offshore, the next Arctic blast will roar into the northern Plains and upper Midwest on Thursday and into the eastern U.S. by Thursday night. ""High temperatures on Thursday will struggle to reach above zero from North Dakota to Wisconsin, with widespread wind chill values between minus 10 and minus 20,"" the weather service said.
Friday may be Chicagos coldest day of the winter thus far, with a forecast high in the single digits, AccuWeather said.
Even though the storm will have passed, snow will still be a problem: The weather service warned that ""existing snow cover and strong winds with the Arctic cold front may combine to produce ground blizzard conditions in parts of the northern Plains from later Wednesday into Thursday morning.""
A ground blizzard occurs when snow that's already fallen is blown around by the wind, leading to whiteout conditions.
The intense cold will move into the East and South by Friday and into the weekend.

"AP, AP","Los Angeles Angels' Shohei Ohtani works against the Oakland Athletics during the second inning of a baseball game on Sunday, April 1, 2018 in Oakland, Calif. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — As an early April snowstorm hit New York City on Monday morning, Philadelphia Phillies reliever Pat Neshek found a fun way to pass the time. Opening packs of baseball cards, the avid collector unwrapped a rare gem and shared the news on Twitter. ""Ripping open packs in ny, I found it!!!!!!! Ohtani #'d 1/69,"" the 37-year-old Neshek tweeted, along with a photo of his prize — an autographed Shohei Ohtani rookie card from the 2018 Topps Heritage set. Since the two-way phenom signed with the Los Angeles Angels in December, his cards and other autographed items have been highly coveted throughout the sports collectible industry. This particular card was signed by the Japanese star in red ink, making it the rarer of two parallel groups of Ohtani autographs found within the set. Only 69 of this variation were produced, each one numbered individually. What makes Neshek's lucky haul extra special is it's the first one in the group that the pitcher/slugger signed, numbered ""01/69"". Neshek often solicits autographs from teammates and opponents to add to his robust memorabilia collection. When he discovered the Ohtani card, though, he got a little flustered and accidentally placed it upside down in a protective case. ""Noticed how excited I was and put this in upside down...brutal,"" he tweeted. Ohtani autographed cards have been selling for a premium on secondary markets such as eBay, which is exactly where Neshek's discovery appeared to be headed. ""Im going to give this to my dad to put up on eBay later this week, buy some more cases!"" Neshek tweeted. With listings ranging from $2,000 to $5,500 for the card, Neshek and his father might be able to purchase a whole bunch of boxes with their potential windfall. A two-time All-Star who signed a $16.25 million, two-year contract with the Phillies last offseason, Neshek is on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right shoulder. He was sent for an MRI in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the team said. Philadelphia's scheduled game against the New York Mets on Monday night was postponed due to the wintry weather and will be made up in July. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Scott Dance,"An inch or two of snow and a glaze of ice are forecast across Maryland from Thursday night into Friday morning, especially to the west of the Interstate 95 corridor.
And then meteorologists are still watching a chance for heavy snow, or heavy rain, over the weekend.
A low-pressure system is forecast to move in from the west and pass quickly through Maryland overnight Thursday into Friday.
At first, the air is likely to be cold enough to produce snow, with temperatures forecast in the upper 20s. But then a layer of warmer air is forecast to creep in overhead, possibly turning the precipitation to a wintry mix by daybreak.
The National Weather Service predicts an inch or less of snow along the Interstate 95 corridor, and 1 inch to 2 inches at higher elevations to the north and west, including much of Harford, Baltimore, Howard and Carroll counties. Then, a few hundredths of an inch of ice is forecast across the region.
After that, forecasters eyes are on a more potent storm system likely to move up from the southwest Saturday. It is expected to pull in abundant cold air from Arctic high pressure moving down from the north, and a flow of Gulf of Mexico moisture from the south.
On Tuesday, it appeared the storm may track along the Appalachians, which would put Central Maryland on the warm side and produce an inch or two of rain. But it was still possible that the system could track farther south, putting the region on the colder side and bringing heavy snow.
Its too early to tell which type of precipitation will be dominant in the Baltimore region, weather service forecasters said.
AccuWeather meteorologists predicted a wintry mix for Maryland, as a surge of warm air from the Atlantic counteracts the cold coming from the north. But they said travel could nonetheless be treacherous along the I-95 corridor into the Northeast.
After that, bitterly cold air is forecast to move in across the eastern United States. Weather service forecasters said it could potentially drop wind chills below zero next week.
Love winter weather? We've compiled an array of photos from our archives of winter in Baltimore and beyond. You'll find pictures of an icy Chesapeake Bay, a snowy Ocean City, people engaging in winter-weather sports, kids sledding and frolicking in the snow, gorgeous scenes that look like paintings, and more. So put on your ear muffs and take a peek.

Dangerous winter weather slams U.S.
A large, powerful and dangerous winter storm is taking aim at about one-third of the nation this weekend. It rapidly moved from the Central Plains to the Midwest and is moving toward the Northeast and New England. Some northern areas of New England could see up to 18 inches of snow.
The storm is expected to drop snow, sleet, freezing rain and ice in many places. After that, temperatures are expected to turn bitterly cold.
Follow along below for updates:
Slick road leads to 15-vehicle Missouri pileup
A 15-vehicle crash has blocked a section of Interstate 55 in southeastern Missouri as snow from a massive winter storm swept through the area and slicked roads.
The Missouri Department of Transportation issued the news of the pileup near Ste. Genevieve on its Twitter page around 4 p.m. Saturday. The department says the interstate was blocked because of the crash, which included a responding firetruck. Motorists were urged to find an alternate route. There was no immediate word on injuries.
Transportation officials said crews hoped to clear the interstate's lanes within a few hours, but said snowfall was slowing that work.
Officials say many roads in Missouri have been slicked over with ice from rain earlier in the day before conditions turned to snow and plummeting temperatures.
Plane skids from runway at Chicago airport
A United Airlines plane has skidded off a runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport amid snowy and icy weather. Chicago fire officials say the incident occurred Saturday morning. No injuries were reported. The flight came into the airport from Phoenix and 129 people were on the plane.
A massive winter storm has brought up to 10 inches of snow to some parts of the Midwest and is expected to hit the Northeast on Sunday.
The storm prompted the cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights at Chicago's airports on Saturday. The average delay at O'Hare International Airport was nearly an hour on Saturday afternoon.
Winter storm doesn't stop some Midwesterners
Many people across the Midwest woke up to see a coating of snow or ice on Saturday. Areas where the storm had already moved out by midday faced bitter cold and strong winds.
Some Midwesterns didn't let it keep the indoors. Celeste Tremmel was outside in Detroit on Saturday training for a marathon. The 56-year-old chugged slowly through the several-inch-deep snow.
""When you run a marathon, you run no matter the weather,"" she said.
Tremmel said running in snow is ""like running in sand, so you have to go a lot slower.""
Connecticut governor to hold news briefing
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont held a news briefing Saturday at 6:30 p.m. ET to update residents as the state prepares for the storm.
Lamont announced on Saturday that he will ""partially activate"" Connecticut's Emergency Operations Center starting at 6:00 p.m. to monitor storm conditions.
""Forecasts are showing a range of accumulating snow, sleet, and freezing rain,"" his office said in a news release Saturday.
1,600 plows being deployed across NYC
Salt spreaders are hitting the streets as the Tri-State area prepares for the winter weather headed its way, CBS New York reported.
About 700 spreaders and 1,600 plows will be deployed this weekend across New York City. Extra precautions are being taken to make sure the city is better prepared than it was just a few months ago, when thousands of drivers were stalled in traffic all night during a minor snowstorm.
This time, public works and utility crews were getting prepared on Friday.
Officials warn of flight disruptions
Officials have warned of flight disruptions at airports, as well as possible changes in train schedules.
By Saturday morning, 1,135 flights within, into or out of the U.S. were canceled for Saturday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport reported that airlines there canceled nearly 470 flights ""due to overnight snow and strong winds expected throughout the day."" It advised travelers to get updates from airlines.
Due to overnight snow and strong winds expected throughout the day, airlines at ORD have cancelled nearly 470 flights. For most up to date flight info, check directly with carrier.

Amtrak canceled some trains Saturday from Chicago to Washington and New York and between New York and Boston and Pennsylvania on Sunday.
Chicago is forecast to receive as much as 8 inches by Saturday and wind gusts in the Chicago area are expected to reach 35 mph.
N.J. and Pennsylvania declare states of emergency
On Friday, New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency.
""This storm has the potential to deliver every, every winter weather option that mother nature has,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolfe said at a news conference.
In New Jersey, the state of emergency will go into effect at noon Saturday. ""Our top priority is the safety of New Jerseyans, and we urge residents to stay off the roads and prepare for potential power outages,"" said Gov. Phil Murphy.
Winter storm warnings issued for the weekend
The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for the weekend from the Dakotas across the Great Lakes states and into New England. It warned that conditions in the Northeast ""could approach blizzard criteria.""
The National Weather Service in Albany, New York, said snow could fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches an hour, creating ""difficult to impossible travel conditions"" in areas. Ice was also a possibility in some areas in the path of the storm, which was forecast to dump up to 2 feet of snow.
In New York City, the worst of the storm is expected from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon, with snow accumulations of 3-6 inches followed by rain that could turn to ice as temperatures drop later Sunday. Single-digit temperatures could last into Monday.

Associated Press,"(CHICAGO) — A winter storm blanketed much of the central Midwest with snow on Sunday at the end of the Thanksgiving weekend, bringing blizzard-like conditions that grounded hundreds of flights and forced the closure of major highways on one of the busiest travel days of the year. “It’s going to be messy,” said Todd Kluber, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service who is based in suburban Chicago. With much of the central Plains and Great Lakes region under blizzard or winter storm warnings, around 1,200 flights headed to or from the U.S. had been canceled as of 6 p.m. Sunday, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Most were supposed to be routed through Chicago or Kansas City — areas forecast to be hit hard by the storm. Strong winds and snow created blizzard conditions across much of Nebraska and parts of Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. The National Weather Service was warning those conditions would make travel difficult in places. By midday, the blizzard warning was extended to parts of eastern Illinois near Chicago, where snow is forecast to fall at a rate of about 2 inches per hour. Other parts of the central Plains and Great Lakes region were under a winter storm warning that could see a foot or more of snow dumped in some places by the end of the day. In eastern Nebraska, part of Interstate 80 between Lincoln and Omaha was closed Sunday morning because of multiple accidents after snow blanketed that area. That included semitrailer trucks jackknifed across the highway. It was re-opened by Sunday afternoon. In Kansas, Gov. Jeff Colyer issued a state of emergency declaration. The action came as a large stretch of Interstate 70, spanning much of the state, was closed between Junction City and WaKeeney. Separately, a portion of Interstate 29 was shut down in Missouri, near the Iowa border. The weather service posted some snowfall totals on Twitter Sunday night. Kansas City International Airport got 5.3 inches of snow, and at least 7 inches of snow was reported in Rockford, Illinois. As much as a foot was expected in Chicago. Forecasters predict more than a foot of snow is likely in southeast Nebraska, northeast Kansas, northwest Missouri and southwest Iowa. By Monday morning, the storm was expected to hit parts of northern Indiana and southern Michigan. Kluber said the storm was expected to hit the Chicago region sometime Sunday evening. He said rain will give way to heavy snowfall and “near whiteout conditions” that will make for dangerous travel.

Morgan Winsor,"A pre-winter snowstorm caught commuters off-guard in the tri-state area Thursday evening, bringing icy roadways to a standstill and paralyzing mass transit. Car accidents and bridge closures during rush hour snarled traffic coming in and out of New York City, where more than half a foot of heavy wet snow accumulated in Central Park. Meanwhile, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan was jam-packed with enraged commuters who waited hours for buses that couldn't get there. Officials urged commuters to take trains or ferries instead, as a line of people outside trying to get into the terminal stretched down the block. There were also delays for subway and train services. But that didn't stop some from trying to make light of the situation. ""Last night was a lot of fun!!!"" one commuter sarcastically wrote on Instagram Friday morning, with images of the overcrowded Port Authority Bus Terminal from the night before. Others blamed officials for the transportation nightmare and lack of preparation. ""But you should totally build a Helipad for Jeff Bezos and Co.,"" another commuter quipped on Twitter with a photo of the congested terminal, tagging New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The tweet was in reference to news that the mayor's office will help Amazon get access to a helipad on or near the company's new headquarters in Long Island City. Elsewhere, twin toddlers bundled up for the early winter weather were seen driving through snow-covered sidewalks in a miniature replica of a New York City Police Department patrol car, which their father had custom converted from a toy Range Rover. ""Please drive carefully and get home safe. Stay indoors if you can, we got this covered, literally,"" the father wrote on Twitter with a video showing one of his cop-obsessed twins in the car. It was the city's mysterious Mandarin duck who appeared to be enjoying himself the most during the season's first snowstorm. The spectacularly colorful male duck was spotted Thursday happily swimming through the snowfall in Central Park's pond where he has recently made himself home, though the species is native to East Asia. Speaking to NY1 on Friday morning, de Blasio acknowledged that the storm had crippled the city's transportation system but blamed it on ""bad luck."" ""I am upset the way everyone else is upset. I was out in the middle of traffic stuck with everyone else and it was a horrible experience,"" the mayor told the local news channel. ""This was a bad, bad situation. There were definitely some things we need to learn from this and some things we need to do better. But it's important to note we got just about every form of bad luck we could have gotten yesterday."" De Blasio said he would have advised drivers to stay off the roads if the city knew there would be accumulating snow. He urged New Yorkers to avoid driving on Friday and to leave work early, if possible. ""The problem was, Wednesday night, the word was a couple inches of snow, nothing exceptional,"" he added. ""When it finally became clear we were going to get very fast, heavy, intense snow, rush hour was already beginning.""","A pre-winter snow storm caught commuters off-guard in the tri-state area Thursday evening, bringing icy roadways to a standstill and paralyzing mass transit.",2018-11-16T18:53:19Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Social media makes light of heavy snowstorm and nightmare commute,https://abcnews.go.com/US/social-media-makes-light-heavy-snowstorm-nightmare-commute/story?id=59243098,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/port-authority-nj-transit-commuters-gty-jef-181116_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,snowstorm,1

Andrew Freedman,"For the tens of millions who live in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Ohio Valley, and the East Coast, the first taste of true winter weather is just days away. Ushered in by a powerful cold front, the cold air, with high temperatures running 10 to 15 degrees below average, will come as a shock following one of the warmest fall seasons on record. Computer models are in agreement that the weather pattern across the Northern Hemisphere will become extremely amplified, which means that the jet stream — that high altitude superhighway of winds that steers weather systems and forms the boundaries between air masses — will carve out large dips, or troughs, as well as strong, practically immovable ""blocking"" ridges. Such weather patterns are ideal for creating extreme weather. SEE ALSO: La Niña is officially here to shape U.S. winter weather, along with global climate This configuration of the jet stream will lead to a bizarre but increasingly common situation in which the Arctic is unusually mild for this time of year (while still being cold, by lower latitude standards), as parts of North America, Europe, and Asia experience colder than average conditions. However, there are two big caveats to keep in mind about the cold air about to invade the East Coast, so don't panic quite yet. First, the cold air coming to the U.S. won't be coming straight out of the Arctic, but rather it will be oozing south from Alaska and Canada. It also won't traverse snow-covered ground, keeping the cold air warmer than it might otherwise be. Snow cover across the lower 48 states is unusually low, with virtually no snow on the ground south of the U.S. border with Canada from Michigan eastward. All that means that this will not be a historic cold snap, not even close. One should expect few, if any, cold temperature records to be set or tied during the coming two weeks, even though temperatures will run below average in the eastern half of the lower 48 states. Computer model projection showing a cold air mass in place across the Midwest and eastern U.S. as of Dec. 9, 2017. Image: weatherbell analytics Second, while the large-scale weather pattern will be primed for a big East Coast snowstorm, with a blocking high pressure area over Greenland, a negative phase of a cycle known as the Arctic Oscillation, and a deep dip in the jet stream from Canada southward to the Gulf of Mexico, it's unclear if any formidable storm will materialize. Winter storms require a spark or trigger in the form of atmospheric energy riding along the jet stream. As of Monday, computer model projections showed no indications of a significant storm in the near-term, 7-day period. We'll have to wait and see if one emerges after that.

Can we get a major storm? pic.twitter.com/p10mr3vQZB — Michael Palmer (@MPalmerTWC) December 3, 2017 For East Coast snow lovers, it would be a huge disappointment if the next 14 days or more turn out to be cold and dry, despite most of the pieces being in place for a big storm. There is one snow-making machine that will kick into gear with the arrival of the cold front: lake effect snow. As cold air blows across relatively mild, unfrozen waters, moisture will be dumped downwind in the form of heavy snow squalls. Feet of snow could pile up in parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, and New York State. This will at least increase the proportion of the U.S. with snow cover, which stood at a measly 15.5 percent as of Monday.","For the tens of millions who live in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Ohio Valley, and the East Coast, the first taste of true winter weather is just days away.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Passengers' relatives have been gathering as they await news of relatives Relatives of 66 people who were on board a plane that crashed in Iran are desperately waiting for any news, as a search operation is set to resume. The Aseman Airlines passenger plane came down in the Zagros mountains on Sunday, and all those on board are feared to have been killed. Heavy wind and snow forced rescuers to stop the search late on Sunday. The ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop was travelling from Tehran to the south-western city of Yasuj. Flight EP3704 left Tehran at 04:30 GMT on Sunday, and crashed about an hour later on Dena Mountain, near the city of Semirom in Isfahan province. The crash site is about 22km (14 miles) from Yasuj, Iranian media reported. Image copyright Mehrad Watson Image caption The plane that crashed was a French-Italian made ATR 72-500 The crashed plane was 25 years old, Iran's civil aviation organisation said. Search and rescue teams were dispatched to look for the wreckage, but were later forced to stop the operation. ""With the wind intensifying, and with snow, rain and darkness, it is not possible for rescue and relief teams to reach high altitudes and the search operation has been postponed until tomorrow,"" broadcaster IRIB announced. ""Five helicopters are on alert to resume the search at dawn if the weather conditions are better."" Sixty passengers, two security guards, two flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot were on board. Aseman Airline initially said everyone had been killed, but said later: ""Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane."" Passengers' relatives earlier gathered at a mosque near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, according to AFP news agency. ""I can't bring myself to believe it,"" said one woman whose husband was on the plane. One man told Tabnak news website that he had missed the flight. Showing an unused ticket as proof, he said: ""God has been really kind to me but I am so sad from the bottom of my heart for all those dear ones who lost their lives."" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani expressed sympathy for all involved, saying in a statement that the incident brought ""great grief and sorrow"". Iran has suffered several aviation accidents in recent years and has an ageing aircraft fleet. The country has struggled to obtain spare parts to maintain its planes in the face of international sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear programme. Those sanctions have been mostly lifted under a 2015 deal between Iran and the US alongside several other powers. Aseman, Iran's third largest airline, signed a contract with Boeing last year to buy 30 of its latest medium-range 737s. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has also expressed ""deep sympathy"" for relatives of those on board, saying the accident ""saddened the hearts"".

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings, watches and advisories from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast on Tuesday in preparation for a coastal storm that’s expected to bring heavy snow and strong winds. The storm could blanket some cities with as much as 10 inches of snow. “Both coasts will be in an active wet pattern over the next few days,” the NWS said in a note. “Accumulations and coverage will increase across the Northeast as the system tracks northeast up the coast. “The greater potential for heavier snowfall accumulations will be across the higher elevations of the Appalachians and into portions of New Jersey, the New York City metropolitan region and southern New England Tuesday night into Wednesday,” it added. Washington, D.C. is forecast to get 2 to 5 inches of snow, while New York City and Boston could see as much as 6 inches or 10 inches, respectively. The storm could blanket some cities with as much as 10 inches of snow. The snow will begin in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and part of New Jersey on Tuesday evening and will spread north overnight into the tristate area, meteorologists said. The early snowfall will most likely accumulate about an inch or two of snow along the I-95 corridor overnight, but areas further inland could see much heavier snow accumulations. Residents in the Northeast are gearing up another major storm. The heaviest snow will be falling during the day on Wednesday for the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to Boston. The worst part of the storm is forecast to wrap up by Wednesday night into Thursday morning as it exits New England.","Residents in the Northeast are gearing up for another major storm that could blanket some cities with as much as 10 inches of snow.

Kate Baggaley,"When Winter Storm Grayson plowed into the East Coast earlier this month, it brought a few unwelcome gifts—namely brutal cold, power outages, coastal flooding, and whiteout conditions from Virginia to Maine. But the blizzard also gave parts of New York and New England the chance to experience the rare and thrilling weather event known as thundersnow. It happens when a snowstorm produces thunder and lightning, and has been known to send meteorologists into ecstasies of delight. It might seem odd to have lightning flashing in the middle of a blizzard. In fact, thundersnow isn’t really that mysterious. “Lightning and thunder, they don’t care about the calendar, whether it’s January or any other month,” says Antti Mäkelä, a climate scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki. “If conditions in the atmosphere are favorable then lightning can occur and it’s the same type of lightning that occurs in the summertime.” Thundersnow does have its dark side, though. Winter thunderstorms can be particularly dangerous exactly because they are so unexpected. Fortunately, we’re getting better at forecasting and understanding thundersnow. Hang on. If it’s the same as regular lightning, why don’t we have thundersnow all the time in winter? Thundersnow storms tend to be a little smaller and weaker than the storms that produce lightning in spring and summer. However, both types of storms need moisture and air currents traveling upwards to produce lightning. “You need instability in the atmosphere; that’s kind of the fuel that drives thunderstorms, and drives those upward motions,” says Matthew Kumjian, an atmospheric scientist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. Inside the cloud, rising particles collide with those falling down and become charged. The negatively charged particles gather at the bottom of the cloud, and the smaller, positively charged ones wind up toward the top. Eventually, the cloud will build up enough electricity that some is discharged as lightning. In winter, these elements come together less frequently than during the warm season, Kumjian says. “A lot of the normal, day-to-day snow bands that people might experience in the northern part of the country, those often do not have the right ingredients to get the type of instability that you need to get the thundersnow.” However, it can sometimes be created in lake-effect snow as cold air moves over relatively warmer water, or when air is forced to rise in strong nor’easters. Thundersnow storms typically only manage to produce a handful of lightning strikes, while summer thunderstorms can produce thousands of zaps per storm, Mäkelä says. Often, thundersnow storms won’t even be able to form lightning until an airplane triggers it by flying too close to a heavily charged cloud. The areas that experience lightning during a snowstorm also tend to be those that receive the heaviest snowfall. As with summer thunderstorms, “Most of the electrification occurs in that same area where the heavy precipitation starts to come down,” Mäkelä says. How rare is thundersnow anyway? Short answer: we don’t know. Some areas do get more thundersnow than others, including those near large bodies of water and parts of the mountainous western United States. Japan and Finland seem especially prone to thundersnow because they have so much coastline, Mäkelä says. Another hotspot is the Palmer Divide, a large ridge in central Colorado that lies between Denver and Colorado Springs. When winds slam into this formation they can be forced upwards, creating the lift needed to kick start the processes that eventually lead to lightning. Over the past few decades, scientists have tried to figure out how often thundersnow strikes. “These types of events…ended up looking like they were extremely rare, maybe only happening a few times across the entire United States per year,” Kumjian says. “But in recent decades we’ve been developing better tools to detect lightning flashes.” A few years ago, he received funding from the National Science Foundation to investigate thundersnow in Colorado. That year, Kumjian and his colleagues reported 17 different thundersnow storms in the northern part of the state alone. “The previous climatology said that part of the country should only have less than one per year, so I think it’s probably safe to say that it’s more common than once thought,” Kumjian says. However, “The jury is still out on exactly how often this happens.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s GOES-16 satellite has been collecting information on lightning flashes across the United States, and might be able to give us a more detailed picture of thundersnow, he says. Is it dangerous? Thundersnow is a problem for airplanes. In Finland, planes are actually more likely to be struck by lightning in the winter months because pilots know to avoid thunderclouds when it’s warm out, but may not take the same precautions in colder weather, Mäkelä says. On one day in October 2011, ten different planes trying to depart from or land at Helsinki Airport were struck by lightning. When Mäkelä interviewed the pilots, some reported being temporarily blinded or deafened. The temperature on this day was a little above freezing, so the storm they were traveling through wasn’t quite thundersnow, but it did demonstrate how much rarer cold-weather thunderstorms are—and how little pilots expect them to produce lightning. Fortunately, airplanes are built to withstand lightning strikes. But the combination of thundersnow and airplanes can still be dangerous for people on the ground. A couple winters ago, a plane that was trying to land at Helsinki Airport triggered a lightning strike that passed to the ground and hit a house, which then burned down, Mäkelä says. And for people outside, there’s probably even less warning that thundersnow is about to strike than you’d get with a warm season storm. “People are generally not expecting it to lightning when it’s snowing outside so there’s always that element of being caught off-guard that makes people a little more vulnerable,” Kumjian says. Plus, the fact that thundersnow doesn’t produce a lot of flashes means you’re even more likely to be caught by surprise. And even if there was a previous strike, you might not know about it. “The snow itself can kind of muffle the sound of the thunder, so you don’t hear the thunder as far away from where the flash actually occurs as you would normally in a warmer season thunderstorm,” Kumjian says. That said, the chances of getting struck by lightning during a thundersnow storm are much lower than in summer storms, which produce many more lightning bolts. So can we predict thundersnow? Forecasters are getting pretty good at identifying which areas will have a high risk of lightning during an event like Winter Storm Grayson, Kumjian says. “And indeed, the big cyclone was actually pretty electrically active.” And once a huge winter storm is underway, we might even be able to predict imminent lightning strikes. Forecasters have identified a distinct radar signature associated with strengthening electric charge. It happens when ice crystals in the cloud get caught by the electrical field. This makes the crystals tilt instead of drifting with their longest sides facing downwards like a sheet of paper you’ve just dropped. “When you get these kind of tilted ice crystals in the cloud, that does something to the radar signal that shows up pretty clearly,” Kumjian says. In nor’easters, he’s seen that this indicates a strong electric field is forming and a lightning flash may happen in the next five to 20 minutes. This radar signal can only be caused by ice; raindrops are too heavy and fall too quickly to be much affected by the cloud’s electric field. “So it’s either higher up in a normal season thunderstorm or anywhere in a thundersnow storm,” Kumjian says. The signature wouldn’t really be that useful for summer storms; there’s not much doubt that a developing thunderstorm will produce lots of lightning. But thundersnow is another story. “The radar signal might be an intriguing way to start to give you that short-term heads up that something is happening,” Kumjian says. “When you see it, at the very least I think the forecasters can say there is a much higher risk of a flash occurring sometime in the next 20 minutes.” He plans to keep investigating how often thundersnow really happens and where it occurs most frequently around the country. Studying these storms could reveal how much buildup of electric charge is needed for a cloud to produce lightning on its own. “We could definitely learn something about the fundamental processes associated with lightning,” Kumjian says. He himself has only experienced the joy of thundersnow on one occasion. It happened during his time as a graduate student in Oklahoma when he stepped outside during a blizzard. “Within a couple of seconds of me standing outside, I heard a fairly loud boom and quickly jumped back inside because it took me quite by surprise,” he says. Still, he said, it’s always exciting to hear—if not see—this rare phenomenon in action. “It’s basically just like a thunderstorm in the warm season, just it happens to be snowing outside,” Kumjian says. “But it still doesn’t take away from the magic of it.”",Environment Nobody expects to see lightning while a blizzard is raging Thundersnow struck again during the bomb cyclone…,2018-01-17T19:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Popsci.com'}","Lightning, meet snowstorm: The makings of thundersnow",https://www.popsci.com/winter-storm-thundersnow,https://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/2018/01/thundersnow_storm.jpg?itok=bP-s5O9h,,Popsci.com,snowstorm,1
Russell Lissau,"At least one fatality was reported in the suburbs from snow that fell steadily Thursday night and throughout Friday, but well short of projected totals. Keith Hartenberger, a spokesman for Edward Hospital in Naperville, said a man in his 60s died there after shoveling snow Friday morning. It was not immediately known what fire department brought the man to the hospital. DuPage County Coroner Richard Jorgensen could not be reached for comment. Schools, many libraries and some government offices and private businesses closed due to the snow. Hundreds of flights at O'Hare and Midway international airports were canceled or delayed, too, and some Metra trains ran late. But cars moved pretty well on the region's roads throughout the day, and suburban life -- for the most part -- continued as usual. The amount of snow that came down varied through the suburbs, but for the most part it was significantly less than the foot or so some meteorologists expected for parts of the region. The Aurora area may have gotten the worst of it, with 10 inches reported in a few spots there, according to the National Weather Service. O'Hare reported 7.3 inches, Buffalo Grove reported about 6 inches, and Carol Stream reported 6.5 inches. More snow was expected to fall Friday night into Saturday, perhaps up to an inch in the Chicago area, according to the weather service. A revised forecast shows new accumulation of less than one inch is possible Saturday night and a 50 percent chance of snow before noon Sunday. O'Hare International Airport reported 1,030 canceled flights with average delays that gradually declined from the 25-minute range to about 15 minutes Friday night. At Midway International Airport, arrivals and departures held steady at average delays of 15 minutes, and there were 319 cancellations. No significant delays were reported on the Metra rail system, though some trains were up to 20 minutes behind schedule Friday morning. Saturday trains are scheduled for the usual times, according to Metra spokeswoman Sylvia Ortiz-Cooper. Metra rider Steven Baldasti had an uneventful trip on the Union Pacific Northwest Line into Chicago from Palatine. ""The express (train) that blasts by about 6:39 a.m. was on time, and my usual (train), the 6:49 a.m., was on time,"" Baldasti said. Many suburban roadways were snow-covered for much of the day, but overall conditions weren't as bad as predicted. That was good news for drivers, many of whom experienced little congestion on their drives Friday. ""(It) definitely appears that people either stayed home or relied on public transportation,"" Illinois Department of Transporation spokesman Guy Tridgell said. Additionally, traffic volume generally is lighter when schools close because of poor weather, as was the case Friday, Tridgell said. The milder-than-expected storm was good news for snowplow drivers, too. Schaumburg's plow crews had been on the roads since 5 p.m. Thursday and were on their third shift by late Friday morning. The plows will stay ready for the slightest new snowfall through at least Monday morning, Engineering and Public Works Director Dave Lawry said. Lincolnshire's public works crews started plowing in 13 trucks at midnight Thursday and worked until about 8:30 a.m. Friday before taking a break, Village Manager Brad Burke said. They resumed midday and continued throughout the day. A substantially smaller crew is expected to be on the job Saturday morning, and another crew will be available Sunday if needed, Burke said. There were some storm-related disruptions. Many suburban libraries stayed closed, including facilities in Barrington, Elgin, Grayslake, Huntley, Lincolnshire, Naperville and Schaumburg. And, some opted to open later than usual, such as the Arlington Heights Memorial Library and the Ela Area Public Library in Lake Zurich. The DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry County courthouses were open for business. But Cook County courts were closed, as were the federal courthouses in Chicago and Rockford. Some suburban businesses also were affected, including the Lovin Oven Cakery in Libertyville. ""We had a bunch of people call yesterday and reschedule their orders for later in the weekend,"" manager Shelby Hoss said. Wauconda's Bulldogs Grill didn't have many lunch customers. ""(We had) a lot of to-go orders,"" General Manager Tony Vazquez said. ""(It's) just a slow day."" The popular White Fence Farm restaurant in Romeoville stayed closed Friday, as did its carryout locations in Downers Grove, Riverside, Romeoville, Joliet and Plainfield. • Daily Herald staff writers Eric Peterson, Bob Susnjara, Christopher Placek, Marni Pyke, Susan Sarkauskas, Marie Wilson and Mick Zawislak contributed to this report.","Chicago Daily Herald Storm update: Warning continues until 6 pm for some areas Chicago Daily Herald The winter storm has been extended again for the suburbs.

Associated Press,"(NEW YORK) — One of the first big storms of the season moved across the eastern half of the country Thursday, causing at least seven deadly traffic crashes and closing schools as it dropped snow as far south as central Alabama. As much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow blanketed the St. Louis area, and forecasters predicted up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) in parts of southern New England as the storm made its way east. They also predicted northern New Jersey could see 4 to 8 inches of snow before the system exits the region by early Friday, while 2 to 5 inches is expected in the central region of the state. Roads in Ohio were clogged by midday Thursday, where officials reported at least one traffic death that was likely weather-related. Indiana State Police also reported a death early Thursday, which they said was caused by the 60-year-old woman driving too fast on a slick road. In North Carolina, the National Park Service closed the Blue Ridge Parkway to traffic because of dangerous road conditions stemming from snow, sleet and freezing rain. The park service said the closure Thursday includes the so-called “Asheville commuter zone” between mileposts 389 and 375, Asheville Citizen Times reported. School districts closed or sent students home early across the lower Great Lakes and the Northeast. The University of Connecticut canceled classes starting at 3:30 p.m. or later at its main campus, satellite campuses and law school. The South, where weather officials said the overnight trace in Alabama missed setting a record for earliest snow by about two weeks, began to clean up. In Mississippi, a tour bus bound for a casino overturned, killing two people and injuring 44 others. And in the Little Rock, Arkansas, area, three people were killed in separate crashes on icy roads Wednesday night, while Interstate 40 was shut down overnight in the eastern part of the state because of several crashes. The interstate reopened shortly before daybreak Thursday, but officials said traffic was slow-going because some drivers had fallen asleep. Witnesses told Mississippi investigators the tour bus driver lost control after crossing an icy overpass and the bus rolled over on its driver’s side, coming to rest in median of Interstate 269 in Byhalia around 12:35 p.m., said Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Capt. Johnny Poulos. “All of a sudden the bus started swerving then it spun around two times, hit the rail and then flipped over,” bus passenger Veronica Love told news outlets as she left a hospital after the wreck. “The second spin, it started picking up speed. It was, I mean, what could you do?” The crash happened about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southeast of downtown Memphis, Tennessee. Killed were Betty Russell, 70, and Cynthia Hardin, 61, both of Huntsville, Alabama, said DeSoto County Coroner Joshua Pounders. The injured were taken to Memphis-area hospitals, with at least three listed in serious condition Wednesday evening. Officials said the group was traveling from Huntsville, Alabama, to gamble at a casino in Mississippi’s Tunica County, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) to the west. In Virginia, the planned launch early Thursday of an unmanned cargo rocket to the International Space Station had to be rescheduled by one day because of the weather, NASA said. The unmanned Cygnus cargo craft is now scheduled to lift off early Friday from Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore carrying supplies and research materials for the astronauts at the space station.

Andrew Freedman,"The East Coast ""bomb cyclone"" on Thursday looks both beautiful and sinister from space. While scientists have been tracking storms using satellites in orbit for decades, they now have a brand new tool at their disposal: GOES-16, also called GOES-East. The brand new satellite — which wasn't available to scientists last winter — is one of the most powerful weather-watching tools in history, able to take snapshots of the storm every minute. The result? Some truly astonishing images. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained The storm, which is bringing blizzard conditions to areas from Virginia to Maine, along with hurricane-force wind gusts and damaging coastal flooding, looks like a classic non-tropical storm. It took on a comma shape, drawing in moisture all the way from the Bahamas, and dumping it into an Arctic air mass in place over the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast. Its minimum central air pressure, a key measure of its intensity, has been falling by double digits every few hours, greatly exceeding the criteria needed to fit the definition of a weather ""bomb."" Such a term refers to the meteorological term ""bombogenesis,"" which combines the words ""bomb"" and ""cyclogensis,"" and means a storm that intensifies by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. The current storm has already seen a 53 millibar drop in just 21 hours, placing it in the top 5 percent of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storm systems. Computer model projections show that the minimum central pressure could fall to 947 millibars, which would be comparable to Hurricane Sandy when that storm made landfall in 2012. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, this storm, while not tropical in nature, has a massive wind field, bringing 60-mile-per-hour winds to New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Carolinas at the same time. The center of the storm even developed an eye-like feature, clearly seen in this satellite image: Image: colorado state university/noaa Impressive GOES-16 high resolution infrared satellite imagery showing explosive cyclogenesis/rapid intensification with the hurricane force low pressure system in the W Atlantic from late last night into this morning. pic.twitter.com/h3lLrYcWL8 — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 4, 2018 It's not a hurricane but it has an ""eye-like"" feature where warmer air is trapped, encircled, or ""secluded"" by a bent-back warm front.

Ciara Nugent,"A major winter storm battered Chicago overnight, with heavy snowfall and strong winds causing hundreds of flight cancellations and dangerous road conditions ahead of Monday morning’s rush hour commute. The storm, which has dumped up to a foot of snow across parts of Illinois, is expected to ease off on Monday, with a winter storm warning in effect for Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Will, Kankakee, Livingston counties until 9 a.m. local time. But the Illinois Department of Transportation expects treacherous travel conditions to last throughout the morning, with many roads from the east and south into Chicago covered in ice or snow. IDOT is advising travelers to use extreme caution on the roads and allow extra time for getting to work. Those who can work remotely from home are advised to do so. The National Weather Service describes the snow as “very wet and heavy” and some residents have reported slush conditions. Some 405 flights out of Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport have been cancelled, CBS Chicago reports, following more than 700 cancellations on Sunday. Passengers can expect average delays of 39 minutes. Northeast Illinois’s Metra commuter rail system is currently planning to operate at full service, but is advising passengers to allow for delays to their Monday commute.

IVAN MORENO/ AP,"(MILWAUKEE) — Extreme cold and record-breaking temperatures are crawling into parts of the Midwest after a powerful snowstorm pounded the region, and forecasters warn that the frigid weather could be life-threatening.
Minneapolis Public Schools officials have canceled classes through Wednesday, when the region is expected to experience frigidly low temperatures not seen in a quarter century. Hundreds of Michigan schools were closed Tuesday, including in Detroit, while Chicago Public Schools canceled Wednesday classes because of the anticipated cold snap.
“You’re talking about frostbite and hypothermia issues very quickly, like in a matter of minutes, maybe seconds,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.
Subzero temperatures will begin Tuesday, but Wednesday is expected to be the worst. Wind chills in northern Illinois could fall to negative 55 degrees (negative 48 degrees Celsius), which the National Weather Service called “possibly life threatening.” Minnesota temperatures could hit minus 30 degrees (negative 34 degrees Celsius) with a wind chill of negative 60 (negative 51 degrees Celsius).
The potentially record-breaking low temperature forecast in Milwaukee is negative 28 degrees (negative 33 degrees Celsius), with a wind chill as low as negative 50 (negative 45 degrees Celsius). The current record of minus 26 degrees (negative 32 degrees Celsius) was set in 1996.“That’s 40 degrees below normal,” Hurley said.
The unusually frigid weather is attributed to a sudden warming far above the North Pole . A blast of warm air from misplaced Moroccan heat last month made the normally super chilly air temperatures above the North Pole rapidly increase. That split the polar vortex into pieces, which then started to wander, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research.
One of those polar vortex pieces is responsible for the subzero temperatures across the Midwest this week.
The Chicago Zoological Society said it was closing the Brookfield Zoo on Wednesday and Thursday — marking only the fourth time the zoo has closed during its 85-year history — to ensure the safety of its employees and animals. At O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, the high temperature Wednesday is expected to be negative 14 degrees (negative 25 degrees Celsius), which would break a record set on Jan. 18, 1994.Homeless shelters were also preparing for the onslaught of cold. The Milwaukee Rescue Mission’s call volume was “unusually high,” but officials said there should still be enough beds for those who need them.
In Minneapolis, charitable groups that operate warming places and shelters were expanding hours and capacity “as they do whenever dangerous extreme temperature events occur,” said Hennepin County Emergency Management Director Eric Waage. He said ambulance crews were handling all outside response incidents as being potentially life-threatening.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said city agencies are making sure homeless people are in shelters or offered space in warming buses. He also urged residents to check on their neighbors and take safety precautions.
The governors in Michigan and Wisconsin have declared states of emergency ahead of the dangerously cold weather.
Cold weather advisories are in effect across a broad swath of the central U.S., from North Dakota to Missouri and spanning into Ohio. Temperatures will be as many as 20 degrees below average in parts of the Upper Great Lakes region and Upper Mississippi Valley, according to the National Weather Service.
On Monday, snowplow drivers had trouble keeping up with the snowfall in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where some areas got as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow. Chicago-area commuters woke up to heavy snowfall, with more than 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) already on the ground. In Michigan, nonessential government offices were closed, including the Capitol.
Rare snowfall was also forecast for some southern states.

Snowfall of 6-9 inches is expected as the storm will continue to bear down on Metro Detroit through Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Trent Frey, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in White Lake Township said many areas of Metro Detroit can expect the snowfall to hit the ""upper range"" of the predicted snowfall by the time this storm front passes. ""It's going to be messy,"" Frey said. The weather service issued a winter storm warning for Washtenaw, Wayne, Lenawee, and Monroe counties through midnight Friday. Hopeful travelers hoping to get out of town at Detroit Metro Airport braved long security lines and some trepidation early Friday. A line of at least 200 people waited to clear security around 6 a.m. Friday at the airport. Communities declared a snow emergency as early as Thursday evening in preparation for the storm. Schools throughout the region closed Friday and the storm is expected to continue throughout the day. The cancellations racked up Friday with more than 110 flights were canceled at the airport, according to FlightStats.com. The canceled flights included trips to Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York, New Jersey, Flordia, Illinois, Ohio and Maine. In addition, meteorologists say light accumulating snow is possible Saturday night into Sunday as low pressure tracks through the eastern Ohio Valley. No more than a couple of inches are expected. Extended forecast Friday: Snow with a high near 28 degrees and a low of 18 degrees. Up to 9 inches of snow is expected to fall in the region.

At our booth, C230, you can explore a range of Chromebooks, including devices that flip from laptop to tablet, integrate with a stylus and have world facing cameras. Follow along on The Keyword and Twitter for the latest news and updates. In late 2017, a snowstorm clobbered Wheatley Park School, a secondary school just east of Oxford, England. Determined to continue learning despite the snow, teachers grabbed their Chromebooks and sent a message through Google Classroom to students at home stating “learning must go on!” In the following days, teachers broadcast live lessons (much to the dismay of would-be sledders) using touchscreen Chromebooks. They used Cast for Education to share screens, and recorded everything so students could watch later with a cup of cocoa in hand. Having Chromebooks “was wonderful to not only satisfy parents but also, genuinely, for learning not to halt,” said Head Teacher, Mr. Martin. The ability to adapt to unexpected learning scenarios and a wide variety of learning styles is a cornerstone of Chromebooks. At Bett, we’re excited to announce a diverse lineup of 2018 Chromebooks including two next generation Chromebooks: the Lenovo 500e Chromebook and Dell Chromebook 11 2-in-1 5190. With cameras on two sides, stylus capability, larger screens, Intel® Celeron™ processors and laptops that flip into tablets, these Chromebooks are designed to be flexible for students with tools to learn in the way that’s right for them.

Bruce's snowfall caused a 20-vehicle pileup on Interstate 70 near Frisco, Colorado, on Saturday, and forced the closure of I-80 in southeastern Wyoming into Sunday. Twelve people were injured in a multi-car accident on Sunday afternoon in Piedmont, Kansas, where heavy snowfall was reported, and several accidents were reported along snowy I-35 in eastern Kansas. (MORE: Stranded Drivers Rescued in Illinois, Hundreds of Flights Canceled ) In Belleville, Kansas, snow drifts of up to four feet high were reported. Winter Storm Bruce produced blizzard conditions in several locations, including Kansas City, Lee's Summit and Independence, Missouri; Manhattan, Emporia and Salina, Kansas; and Shenandoah, Iowa. Blizzard conditions were reported in northwestern Illinois early Monday. Snowdrifts on Route 6 in Princeton, Illinois, caused several drivers to be stranded in their cars, sparking overnight snowmobile rescues, the Illinois State Police reported. Roads were still too dangerous for drivers on Monday morning, according to the Ogle County Sheriff, and schools in the area were closed for the day. More than 2,000 flights have been canceled due to the storm, according to flightaware.com, most of which occurred at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

Mark Kaufman,"NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently dove deeper into the sun's atmosphere than any spacecraft before. And it has the photos to prove it. Launched four months ago, the heavily-shielded probe an exploration craft that will swoop progressively closer to the sun over the next six years came within 16.9 million miles of the sun's surface when it captured this orange-tinged image on November 8. Here, the probe was well inside the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, a difficult-to-visit place that's still largely a mystery to astronomers. The dominant part of the scene is a horizontal bright streak emanating from the sun. On November 8, the probe approached this beam of energized particles, called a ""coronal streamer,"" that had been blasted out from our medium-sized star. The solar scene as captured by the Parker Probe's WISPR camera. Image: nasa The bright spot in the photo is sunlight reflecting off the planet Mercury, which is millions of miles away from the probe. Also visible are darker dots beside and just above Mercury. These are photo remnants of both Mercury and Jupiter as both planets orbited in the background as the solar probe captured long exposure shots of the looming coronal streamer. Although this is one of the first solar probe images to get transmitted back to Earth, NASA will eventually get images of the probe flying directly through this massive blast of energy. ""It's like flying through a snowstorm,"" Russ Howard, the head scientist for the camera that took the image, said in an interview. ""As you get closer to the storm, they [the sun's particles] go above, below, and by you."" ""We are going to be flying through it thats really exciting,"" added Howard. Blue line shows the probe's travels in early November. Image: nasa While the primary image here was taken on November 8, the final product is a combination of images taken about 12 hours apart as the probe traveled through space. This was necessary, said Howard, because there's quite a bit of dust floating around the solar system, and ""averaging"" the photos together allowed the team to clear out the unwanted ""noise,"" from the dust in the image. Ultimately, NASA hopes to understand the highly-energized gases that the sun is constantly emitting into space, known as the solar wind. These winds are largely responsible for creating ""space weather"" in our solar system. ""As we send spacecraft and astronauts further and further from home, we must understand this space environment just as early seafarers needed to understand the ocean,"" explains NASA. An artist's conception of the Park Solar Probe. Image: nasa When it comes to the more concentrated blasts of energy the coronal streamers scientists know that they are denser and more slowing moving beams from the sun, but scientists are still largely unsure of how and when they form. The specialized, military-built camera that took these photos sits behind an eight-inch thick heat shield that protects both the camera and instruments from the brunt of the sun's heat. During this swoop into the sun's atmosphere, the Parker probe's heat shield experienced temperatures reaching 820 degrees Fahrenheit, though during future, closer passes, temperatures are expected to hit some 2,500 degrees.","NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently dove deeper into the sun's atmosphere than any spacecraft before.

Laurel Wamsley,"American Airlines is offering its pilots 150 percent of their hourly pay to work during the holidays, after a glitch allowed too many pilots to take vacation at the same time. Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images A glitch in American Airlines' pilot scheduling system means that thousands of flights during the holiday season currently do not have pilots assigned to fly them. The shortage was caused by an error in the system pilots use to bid for time off, the Allied Pilots Association told NPR. The union represents the airline's 15,000 pilots. ""The airline is a 24/7 op,"" union spokesman Dennis Tajer told CNBC. ""The system went from responsibly scheduling everybody to becoming Santa Claus to everyone."" ""The computer said, 'Hey ya'll. You want the days off? You got it.' "" Tajer called it ""a man-made snowstorm"" and said the union estimated that more than 15,000 of the airline's flights don't have pilots. More pilots were granted time off between Dec. 17 and Dec. 31 than should have been, resulting in the shortage. American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNBC that the airline was working on the problem and expected to avoid cancellations during the holidays. He did not specify how many flights were affected. ""We have reserve pilots to help cover flying in December, and we are paying pilots who pick up certain open trips 150 percent of their hourly rate — as much as we are allowed to pay them per the contract,"" he told the network. ""We will work with the APA to take care of our pilots and ensure we get our customers to where they need to go over the holidays."" In a post to its website, the union warned its members that because ""management unilaterally created their solution in violation of the contract, neither APA nor the contract can guarantee the promised payment of the premium being offered."" It said management had disclosed the bidding system failure on Friday. The union told NPR on Wednesday afternoon that management had not yet reached out to resolve the issue. The snafu is reminiscent of one that afflicted budget carrier Ryanair in September. The airline scheduled too many pilots for vacation, leading it to cancel hundreds of flights. Bloomberg reported that the airline was likely to take a $30 million hit for its mistake as it paid out refunds and compensation. American's pilots have had a tense relationship with the company on previous occasions. ""This is certainly not routine,"" Tajer told Bloomberg News. ""This is a crisis right now, and in that crisis, they've gone solo."" NPR's David Schaper contributed to this story.","The pilots union says 15,000 flights at the end of the year don't have anyone to fly them, because of a glitch in the system pilots use to bid for time off.",2017-11-29T21:13:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Oops: American Airlines Accidentally Let Too Many Pilots Take Off The Holidays,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/29/567286235/oops-american-airlines-accidentally-let-too-many-pilots-take-off-the-holidays,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/11/29/gettyimages-476488850_wide-71beb72de17b3ef0538ae8808cca347e1f7162d2.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,snowstorm,1
Andrew Freedman,"Everyone should be wary when weather geeks start getting excited about an upcoming shift in the jet stream because it usually means inclement weather is ahead. After all, weather enthusiasts — whether they be armchair forecasters or professionals — tend to abhor boring stretches of ""nice"" weather. Forecasters have reason to be psyched right now, given strong hints for what could be a major weather pattern realignment during the next two weeks. SEE ALSO: Fans of cold and snow in the U.S. will love this new winter outlook Computer models are increasingly showing the potential for a cold and possibly snowy weather pattern to develop along the East Coast of the U.S. during the second week of December. While there are many uncertainties associated with the forecast so far in advance, the general contours of what is likely to happen are becoming clearer. Some of the building blocks for the cold weather are already in place, including a predominantly negative Arctic Oscillation, which favors — but does not guarantee — colder-than-average conditions in the eastern U.S. ""Where have you gone (negative) #Arctic Oscillation our nation (of weather geeks) turns its lonely eyes to you."" Nearly classical AO- predicted by the models early Dec with three poles of #cold, Europe, East Asia and East US (Euro not quite there yet). It's been at least 5 years! pic.twitter.com/EwnJja2Wmv — Judah Cohen (@judah47) November 22, 2017 The Arctic Oscillation, or AO, is climate pattern that describes the atmospheric circulation over the Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean. During a negative phase of the AO, the polar vortex over the Arctic is weaker, resulting in a slackening of the upper level winds ringing the Arctic from west-to-east. This can allow frigid, Arctic air to spill into the midlatitudes, including Europe and the U.S. For much of late November, we've had a strongly negative Arctic Oscillation with milder-than-average conditions in much of the U.S., which goes to show that other factors, including weather patterns across the North Pacific Ocean, also have an influence on winter weather in the lower 48 states. Computer model projections for 11 to 15 days from now show a strikingly favorable weather pattern for cold air to invade the eastern U.S., as well as parts of Europe and East Asia. Strong areas of high pressure at high latitudes, including one in the Gulf of Alaska and another monster high over Greenland, plus another across the Ural Mountains, will each act to help steer air masses around the world. A blocking high over Greenland is typically associated with some of the East Coast's most memorable snowstorms, because it helps direct cold air into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states while also preventing storm systems from quickly escaping out to sea. Computer model projection showing a dip, or trough, in the jet stream developing in the East in mid-December. Image: weather.us According to Judah Cohen, a snow-obsessed meteorologist with AER, a Verisk business in Massachusetts, the upcoming atmospheric events appear to be relatively rare, and exciting. Cohen researches the chain of events that trigger disruptions in the polar vortex, and he says the upcoming weather pattern reminds him a lot of December 2010, which featured a paralyzing blizzard from Philadelphia to Portland, Maine. ""I am following with interest the trifecta of ridging. one in the Gulf of Alaska, one across Greenland and one across the Urals,"" Cohen said via email. ""Respectively, they are bringing cold to the Eastern US, Europe and East Asia. But it is the blocking centered on the Urals that could have the longest-lasting impact. That is key to weakening the polar vortex. It has already begun and I am watching to see if it eventually leads to a major disruption of the polar vortex with longer lasting impacts."" Cohen's statements may not sound giddy to non-weather nerds, but they're the equivalent of a sports fan showing up at a football game shirtless, with the number of a favorite player painted on their chest. He prefaced his remarks by saying, ""The question is not whether I have any comments on the current pattern but whether I can limit myself so anyone else will bother to listen."" Other experts who have been examining the upcoming changes in winter weather patterns are a bit more skeptical that they'll result in a blockbuster event. Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, says the weather pattern in the troposphere, which is the layer of air where most weather occurs, will go through ""major changes"" in the next week to 10 days. ""The changes have started in the Pacific and will eventually propagate over into North America and strengthen the current blocking pattern across the North Atlantic (strong North Atlantic ridge),"" Furtado said in a Twitter DM. ""This overall pattern (ridges in Western US + North Atlantic and troughs in the Central - West North Pacific and Eastern North America) is overall favorable for a colder and stormier regime."" Furtado cautioned that just because the weather pattern will be ideal for generating snowstorms does not guarantee anything. ""... The atmosphere will be primed, but we will need to watch the 'sparks' — the shortwaves/disturbances that ride along the jet stream that are the seeds for individual storms,"" he said. According to Ryan Maue, chief operating officer with Weather.US, the dip, or trough, in the jet stream over the eastern half of the U.S. in a week to 10 days is a ""pre-requisite"" for a snowstorm. But so far, there are no indications of a major storm during that time frame. Forecasters with Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang blog also raised the red flag on the upcoming weather pattern change on Monday, saying it ""screams winter weather potential."" Two time periods experts there cited as analogs to the upcoming weather pattern include December 1989, which set cold temperature records, and December 2009, which featured a blizzard known as "" Snowpocalypse.""","Everyone should be wary when weather geeks start getting excited about an upcoming shift in the jet stream because it usually means inclement weather is ahead.

John Brandon,"Room for seven people? Check. A sun-roof that's big enough to impress even a few young adults ? Perfect. A setting called ""slippery"" that causes the vehicle to hug the road when the snow starts to fly? Nice. I tested out the 2018 Lincoln Navigator recently, driving one to the airport in Minneapolis during a heavy snowstorm, a little worried about how such a large SUV would behave on snowy roads. It took me a few seconds to notice that there's a specific setting--you use a dial that's located between the seats--for slippery roads. I can tell you what it does from experience. As I drove, the vehicle obviously adjusted the power of the tires to make sure the vehicle never went askew. I'm no daredevil, but it was interesting to press the gas a little and have the vehicle make micro-adjustments you can actually sense as you drive. This is not the case in the vehicles I actually own, which do not have a setting for traction control. They have acceptable traction, being a bit older with normal tires, but nothing like this test car. In one case, another vehicle swerved in front of me and I decided to change lanes quickly, but never felt like I was going to lose control or swerve. I experimented with a few other settings for traction control as well. One was called Deep Conditions, which is meant for deeper snow. The vehicle didn't lurch forward as quickly, presumably preventing tire slip. There are also settings for muddy conditions and a normal setting for dry roads. I've never seen such specific options for traction, and I was impressed with how they felt like they made a difference as I drove the vehicle. The Navigator has plenty of other interesting features, although I was surprised the SUV didn't have rear-entertainment screens (at least in the one I borrowed). On that long winter trek, it would have been handy to play a DVD for the passengers in the back. It's possible that fewer and fewer cars will offer these screens since people can use their own phones and tablets. One feature that did impress me (but you can only test if you own the car): You can request service using Lincoln Pickup &amp; Delivery, which means someone drives to you, lets you borrow a second car, then returns the Navigator after any maintenance or fixes. I found the seat massage button by accident once. Both seats in the front let you control how the massage works--the level of massage and where it occurs in the seat. In general, the seat in the Navigator are a big selling point because you can adjust them in so many ways. (You might even say you can adjust them a bit too much, if you find it takes a while to find the exact setting that works for your body type and comfort level.) Even on the wintery day driving to the airport with seven people, everyone was comfortable. I had no trouble hearing my wife in the second row as we drove, although the passengers in the far back had to speak a little louder than normal. The base price on the Lincoln Navigator is $72,055--not as high as expected, considering the massive size and all of the tech features and traction control. It's a little cheaper than the similar Cadillac Escalade, at a $74,695 base price. I've never driven an Escalade in a snowstorm, but I can vouch for the Navigator. It was a smooth ride.",The 2018 Lincoln Navigator has a dial meant to help you on slippery roads.,2018-01-16T14:22:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",How the 'Slippery' Setting On This Massive SUV Made a Snowstorm More Bearable,https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/how-slippery-setting-on-this-massive-suv-made-a-snowstorm-more-bearable.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/18NavigatorL-BL-Destination_07_HR_340648.jpg,,Inc.com,snowstorm,1
Matt Levine,"Oh Facebook. Everything, I like to say, is securities fraud. For instance, if you are a public company that suffers a massive data breach and exposes sensitive data about millions of customers without their consent, and that data is then used for nefarious purposes, and you find out about the breach, and then you wait for years to disclose it, and when you do disclose it your stock loses tens of billions of dollars of market value, then shareholders are going to sue you for not telling them earlier, and probably the Securities and Exchange Commission is going to look into it as well. (In fact the SEC recently issued guidance about when you have to disclose a data breach.) The underlying bad thing that you did -- not keep your data safe -- is just an input into a function whose result is ""securities fraud."" But the result is always ""securities fraud,"" whatever the nature of the underlying input. An undisclosed data breach is securities fraud, but an undisclosed sexual-harassment problem or chicken-mispricing conspiracy will get you to the same place. There is an important practical benefit to a legal regime that works like this: It makes it easy to punish bad behavior, at least by public companies, because every sort of bad behavior is also securities fraud. You don't have to prove that the underlying chicken-mispricing conspiracy was illegal, or that the data breach was due to bad security procedures. All you have to prove is that it happened, and it wasn't disclosed, and the stock went down when it was. The evaluation of the badness is in a sense outsourced to the market: We know that the behavior was illegal, not because there was a clear law against it, but because the stock went down. Securities law is an all-purpose tool for punishing corporate badness, a one-size-fits-all approach that makes all badness commensurable using the metric of stock price. It has a certain efficiency. On the other hand it sometimes makes me a little uneasy that so much of our law ends up working this way. ""In a world of dysfunctional government and pervasive financial capitalism,"" I once wrote, ""more and more of our politics is contested in the form of securities regulation."" And: ""Our government's duty to its citizens is mediated by their ownership of our public companies."" When you punish bad stuff because it is bad for shareholders, you are making a certain judgment about what sort of stuff is bad and who is entitled to be protected from it. Anyway Facebook Inc. wants to make it very clear that it did not suffer a data breach. When a researcher got data about millions of Facebook users without those users' explicit permission, and when the researcher turned that data over to Cambridge Analytica for political targeting in violation of Facebook's terms, none of that was a data breach. Facebook wasn't hacked. What happened was somewhere between a contractual violation and... you know... just how Facebook works ? There is some splitting of hairs over this, and you can understand why -- consider that SEC guidance about when companies have to disclose data breaches -- but in another sense it just doesn't matter. You don't need to know whether the thing was a ""data breach"" to know how bad it was. You can just look at the stock price. The stock went down : The social media giant has lost over $60 billion in market value over the past two days, following revelations that personal data of millions of users was obtained by a data analytics firm. And so, whatever other problems it has -- the Federal Trade Commission is examining Facebook's compliance with a 2012 consent decree about user privacy, and various members of Congress are gearing up to investigate -- Facebook has a securities-disclosure problem: Facebook Inc.’s failure to safeguard privacy was blamed in an investor lawsuit for a slump in its share price that followed the revelation user data was harvested without permission by a research firm connected to U.S. President Donald Trump. The world’s largest social media network was sued in San Francisco federal court on Tuesday by shareholders in a class action who said they suffered losses after the disclosure that Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based firm that aided Trump, improperly obtained profile information on 50 million users. You can read the article for more about the lawsuit's allegations -- ""defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Facebook violated its own data privacy policies by allowing third parties access to personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent,"" etc. -- but, again, it doesn't matter. Thing happened, thing wasn't disclosed, thing was disclosed, stock went down. It is a simple legal system but it has its uses. But also its oddities. At worst, Facebook is accused of violating tens of millions of users' privacy, and of doing so in a way that subverted democracy and frayed America's social fabric. Perhaps someone will investigate and punish Facebook on behalf of those users or that democracy and social fabric. But certainly someone will investigate and punish Facebook on behalf of its shareholders. Elsewhere, Sarah Frier: ""How Facebook Made Its Cambridge Analytica Data Crisis Even Worse."" And Paul Ford: ""Facebook Is Why We Need a Digital Protection Agency."" And Emily Stewart: ""Banks have to know their customers. Shouldn’t Facebook and Twitter?"" The petro conspiracy. Ahahahaha the Venezuelan petro, the world's dumbest cryptocurrency, is somehow dumber than I thought : ""A TIME investigation has found Moscow’s fingerprints all over the creation of the petro, a scheme that reveals the range of Russia’s efforts to fight back against U.S. sanctions."" According to an executive at a Russian state bank who deals with cryptocurrencies, senior advisers to the Kremlin have overseen the effort in Venezuela, and President Vladimir Putin signed off on it last year. “People close to Putin, they told him this is how to avoid the sanctions,” says the executive, who spoke to TIME on condition of anonymity. “This is how the whole thing started.” Sure. Good lord. How did that conversation go? Putin's gamer nephew: Uncle Vlad, we can evade U.S. sanctions using the blockchain. Putin:... PGN: Smart contracts via crypto make this super doable. P:... PGN: Don't let FUD hold you back from doing an ICO. P:... PGN: Let's get some crypto and HODL ! P:... PGN:... P: Look, whatever, but why don't we let Venezuela try it first and see how it goes. It seems to be going terribly, but that's only because it is terrible. ""In recent weeks the authorities in Moscow seem to have cooled on the idea of an official cryptoruble."" Elsewhere in terrible crypto things, ""German researchers have discovered unknown persons are using bitcoin’s blockchain to store and link to child abuse imagery, potentially putting the cryptocurrency in jeopardy."" I am not quite sure what that means practically or how seriously to take it, but the question the researchers raise is, if you run a bitcoin mining or trading business in which you download and store blockchain data, are you illegally downloading child pornography? Man, I do not know, and I am not going to give you legal advice, but... maybe someone should? Like, ""does this business require me to possess illegal child pornography"" is a question I would want to answer definitively before getting into any new line of business. Elsewhere in silly crypto things, here's a "" live air drop,"" come on. And here is an "" Initial Chocolate Coin Offering,"" come on. And here is GoGo Chicken : The company uses tracking devices and facial recognition technology to follow the movement of free-range chickens, from hatching to packaging, on hundreds of farms across China. Poultry are fitted with tracking devices on their legs and the data are logged using a blockchain ledger — an unalterable record that underlies cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. That article begins: ""An insurance company in China is looking to shake up the country’s chicken supply chain — using blockchain technology."" I have to say that it is an incredible testament to the power of blockchain evangelism that the first sentence of the article is about blockchain technology, and not chicken facial recognition technology. Chicken facial recognition technology is some wild sci-fi stuff! I don't think I could reliably recognize a chicken's face if I had it in front of me; I am blown away that artificial intelligence has advanced to the point that it can. Blockchain technology, meanwhile, is just a somewhat new way to run a database. But if you want to impress people you don't focus on your uncanny automated chicken-recognition abilities. You give the people what they want, and what they want, always, is blockchain blockchain blockchain. Unicorns are worried about VC diversity. Here is a story about technology entrepreneurs who don't want to be given money by ""a bunch of white guys"" anymore, and who have joined together to demand that the venture capital industry diversify. The group is called ""Founders for Change,"" and ""in a statement underlining the importance of diversity in the tech industry, the tech executives said the racial and gender makeup of a venture capital firm would be 'an important consideration' when they were raising money."" There is an old-fashioned way of looking at the world where, if you have an idea, and you meet with someone and tell him your idea, and he offers to give you millions of dollars to build that idea, he is doing you a favor, and you should be grateful and not quibble too much with the racial and gender makeup of his investing team. I think that was a standard way to think about venture capital not too long ago. Now things have changed. This is in part a story about values -- about the importance that founders personally place on diversity -- but it is also, obviously, a story about power. One thing I think about sometimes is that the power balance between entrepreneurs who come up with ideas and capital sources who come up with money to fund those ideas is tilting in favor of the entrepreneurs these days. SoftBank and Fidelity and whoever else are lining up to throw money at startups; capital is plentiful and ideas are scarce and valuable. It is easy to imagine a world -- a world described in corporate-finance textbooks -- in which the people who have the money use it to buy control, and get to tell the companies whom they should employ. But in the current startup world, the people who found the companies tell the people who put up the money whom they should employ. Elsewhere: ""This White Tech Guy Has an Idea to Make Tech Less White."" And meanwhile in public companies, the sources of capital still matter, or at least assume that they do: The New York State Common Retirement Fund ""intends to oppose the re-election of all directors at hundreds of U.S. corporate boards without a single woman."" Taxes. Here is a story about how Larry Kudlow, the television personality who will now be the head of Donald Trump's National Economic Council, wants to index capital-gains taxes to inflation. The idea is that if you bought stock 20 years ago for $100 and sold it today for $200, you have $100 of nominal profit, but only some of that is real profit. That $200 today won't buy you twice as much stuff as the $100 you had 20 years ago. So taxing you on the full nominal profit seems unfair, and Kudlow wants to tax you only on the amount of profit above inflation: If you need $150 today to buy what $100 bought you 20 years ago, then your real capital gain is only $50 and you should only pay tax on that. One problem with this idea is that Kudlow apparently wants to implement it in a legally questionable way: It wasn't in the recent changes to the tax code that Congress passed, and so the plan is apparently to just have the executive branch implement it, which seems aggressive. (""Some believe Potus could do it as exec order,"" Kudlow told the Wall Street Journal.) Another problem with it is that it rather gratuitously cuts taxes on rich people: ""Democrats have opposed it as a complicated change that would give rich people a windfall for no serious economic benefit,"" notes Jonathan Chait. But one thing that works in its favor is that it is rather intellectually satisfying. You really don't have $100 worth of gains; taxing you on the $100 of gains seems wrong. Not wrong morally -- any choice of how much to tax people to fund the government will feel morally arbitrary in places -- but just wrong intellectually. You should pay taxes on your economic income; indexing capital gains to inflation gets a bit closer -- in one part of the tax code -- to doing that. You occasionally see this problem in tax law: Do you make an intellectually satisfying change to the tax code that happens to cut taxes on rich people, or do you allow for some amount of sloppiness because the impacts of that sloppiness are felt mostly by rich people? On the one hand you have to get revenue from somewhere, and taxing unearned income of rich people in ways that are intellectually sloppy may be better, from the perspective of fairness and economic efficiency, than taxing the earned income of poor people. But there are obvious pressures that push in favor of intellectual satisfying tax cuts on rich people, specifically, (1) they are intellectually satisfying and (2) they are favored by rich people. It's a powerful combination. Uber. I wrote a little yesterday about how a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian. A natural reaction to that event is to try to slow down self-driving car development, and I said that I'm not sure that reaction is correct, because ""if self-driving Ubers fully replaced human-driven cars while still killing only one person -- or 10 people -- a day, then that would represent an enormous improvement in human welfare, even though Uber would be killing people every day."" A lot of people emailed and tweeted to resist the hypothetical, pointing out that the self-driving Uber fatality rate currently seems to be higher (on a very small sample size) than the human-driver fatality rate. Okay? I suppose I should have been clearer that, if and when autonomous cars are safer than regular cars, that will be good for humanity. I presume that the people working on autonomous cars are trying to make them substantially safer than human-driven cars. I recognize that they're not there yet, which is why people are working on them, instead of rolling them out widely. Perhaps they'll never get there! Feel free to resist the hypothetical, but of course I agree that widespread adoption of more dangerous driverless cars would be bad? Anyway: "" Uber Victim Stepped Suddenly in Front of Self-Driving Car."" And: "" Self-Driving Cars Keep Rolling Despite Uber Crash."" And: ""This week’s pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving car is likely to complicate efforts in Congress to speed the vehicles’ development by wiping away state safety regulations,"" which, yes, I can see how it would do that.

Adam Rogers,"Friday morning began with delays at New Yorks LaGuardia Airport. Thats not unusualNew Yorks airports are famously balky. But this time, the cause wasn't something prosaic, like a blizzard. It was staffing. Because of the federal government shutdown, the airport didnt have enough Transportation Security Administration agents and air traffic controllers; things slowed to a ground stop.
Then it started to spreadNewark, Philadelphia, even the key hub of Atlanta all began to wind down. And thats terrifying. Airports are nodes on a global network, and the science that guides how that network behaves means that if one node has a problem, that problem will spread. The international air travel network exists on something of a knife-edge. It doesnt take much to knock it out of optimal flow.
Basically, the delay problem is one of ""connected resources""; planes land and have to get turned around to perform other flights, and some of the passengers on them are getting onto other flights, too. If youve ever flown, you know all that, but what it means in practice is that small mistakes or delays at one airport get magnified as they move down the line, propagating and sometimes intensifying. The systems operating these queues are very close to capacity, says Hamsa Balakrishnan, an aerospace engineer at MIT who studies the air transport network. Both LaGuardia and Newark had wind-related delays today. With full staffing you might have been able to manage, but with a decrease in staffing as well you have delays, which then end up spreading to other airports as well, because of connectivity.
Typically you might expect that the biggest airports in the worldthe ones with the most flights in and out, say, or that move the most peoplewould have the biggest effect on overall movement across the network. But in fact, an airports delay propagation multiplier varies depending on all kinds of things, from how an airport is scheduled to its overall capacity, and even the weather. By one calculation, a minute of delay causes an average of 30 seconds of slowdown elsewhere in the network. But some airports are more resilient than others. The time it takes to get from one to the other has an effect. Its so complicated that it daunts even the most intrepid network modelers.
Airlines try to account for all this by building slack into the schedule. They calculate the amount of time a given flight should takethe scheduled block timeand the amount of time the plane should have to spend on the ground, the scheduled turnaround time. But then they have a choice. They insert buffer time in their schedules and ground operations, says Bo Zou, a transportation engineer at the University of Illinois. They still encounter delays, and a newly formed delay for one flight will propagate to the second and third flights. Part of it will be absorbed by the buffer, but not all of it. Build too small a buffer, and the delays propagate further. Build too large a buffer and youre not using your fleet efficiently, and losing money. One side is efficiency, the other is robustness, Zou says.
And it changes all the time, depending on changing conditionssome are predictable, like winter storms, and some are not, like government shutdowns and informal sick-outs. Thats called a dynamical complex network. It has to adapt, constantly.
Because if it doesnt? According to one study, flight delays cost the US economy over $30 billion a year. Its not just lost time or flight expenses; its whatever the people on those flights were planning on doing when they arrived. A prolonged shutdown, or even slow down, would likely affect all kinds of unforeseen things, says Luís Bettancourt, a network scientist at the University of Chicago. The reliability of time­-sensitive logistics will degrade, and the hub character of some of these cities will have to be bypassed, at least temporarily. A prolonged slow down would be most disastrous to large cities, their influence, and their economies.
Having shut down the shutdown, the government can now get its TSA agents and air traffic controllers back on station. Thatll build some resilience back into the airports just in time for a big-ass snowstorm due to hit the midwest next week. But the overall health of the air travel network will still be precarious.
Thats why researchers are working on accumulating more and more data on how it all works (or doesnt). If humans cant schedule all these flights in an efficient and robust way, maybe an algorithm can. Balakrishnan has even co-founded a start-up thats trying to make it happen. There are so many moving pieces that its hard for a human being to come up with all possible solutions, she says. But thats something we know how to get computers to do. If you enjoy flying on an intractable and incomprehensible network now, wait until its run by an intractable, incomprehensible robot.

Brian K Sullivan,"As if the deep freeze that’s sent temperatures plunging to all-time lows across the eastern half of the U.S. weren’t enough, the region may get hit with a snow bomb. Now that Boston has tied a 100-year-old record with seven days of highs below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, New York’s airports have registered new lows and Chicago has enjoyed its coldest New Year’s Day ever, a storm is set to race up the U.S. East Coast on Thursday and dump snow along the way. Boston may see as much as 11 inches (28 centimeters), Manhattan could get 3, and Brooklyn and Queens are set for 4. Temperatures at 7 a.m. New York time on Jan. 2, 2018, in degrees Fahrenheit. Source: National Weather Service. This storm may end up being worse than your average nor’easter. It could turn into a bomb, short for bombogenesis, a phenomenon that occurs when a system’s central pressure drops steeply -- 24 millibars or more -- in 24 hours. If current computer models hold, that’ll start to happen somewhere off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and continue as the storm moves north. Hurricane-force wind warnings have been posted off the coast where ships could encounter winds of 80 miles (130 kilometers) an hour and waves as high as 26 feet on Thursday. “The real apex, the peak of the storm, will be Cape Cod to Nova Scotia,” said Gregg Gallina, a forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. On its current track, the storm will scrape the East Coast and dump snow from South Carolina to Maine and into Canada, with Boston and parts of Maine bearing the brunt. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal has already declared a state of emergency for 28 counties. The weather stands to wreak havoc on markets for longer, as electricity prices have already surged to the highest level in years and natural gas demand hit a record high. “On Long Island, out by the Hamptons and Montauk, it could be 4 to 6 inches, then we start talking about the really big numbers,” Gallina said. “The main action is the eastern third of Massachusetts.” There’s a silver lining: The storm will offer some respite from the bone-rattling cold that triggered wind chill advisories and freeze warnings across the central U.S. and winter storm watches from Massachusetts to Florida on Tuesday. But the relief will only be temporary as the Arctic chill is set to make a comeback by the end of the week. Temperatures will rise out of the teens and single digits from Philadelphia to Boston before slipping back again by Friday and Saturday. “This is only the appetizer -- the main meal comes over the weekend,” said Judah Cohen, director of seasonal forecasting for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a Verisk Analytics Inc. business in Lexington, Massachusetts. “This is about as intense a cold as I can remember.” The storm will probably cause blizzard conditions in New England and eastern Long Island as high winds accompany the snow, said Paul Walker, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. And that’s not where the bad news stops: Another round of bitterly cold air is forecast to blast across the U.S. by the middle of next week. The chill could linger through Jan. 16.","Bloomberg First Comes the Bone-Rattling Cold, Then Comes the Snow Bomb Bloomberg As if the deep freeze that's sent temperatures plunging to all-time lows across the eastern half of the U.S. weren't enough, the region may get hit with a snow bomb.

One person died in a car crash on Long Island, and the winter storm was blamed for the conditions. Federal offices were shut down in the nation's capital and dozens of school districts called off classes Wednesday as Winter Storm Toby became a major travel nuisance for the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. New York Police said one person died and five others were injured on Long Island when a van flipped over amid wintry conditions on the Wantagh State Parkway in Nassau County, according to the Associated Press. The victim, who was not identified, died in the crash that occurred at about 10 a.m. EDT Wednesday morning, the report added. Schools in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Providence, Rhode Island – even some schools as far south as Nashville, Tennessee – were closed Wednesday because of the winter storm. ""For everyone’s safety, because it could be such a big storm... we want to be ahead of it,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters. (MORE: Check the Forecast for Winter Storm Toby ) More than 4,000 domestic flights were canceled Wednesday, most of which were because of Toby, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. State offices were closed in Rhode Island and New Jersey, and states of emergency were declared in Delaware and New Jersey. As travel conditions worsened Wednesday morning, Virginia State Police troopers responded to more than 250 crashes statewide during the morning rush hour. In Richmond, state offices opened two hours late Wednesday morning, Gov. Ralph Northam said.

ABC News,"A winter storm that roared through California left a snowboarder dead and sent an avalanche crashing down on five people Friday at a Sierra Nevada ski resort, but the danger of another deadly mudslide eased in a devastated coastal community. Dozens of rescuers and rescue dogs rushed to the scene after an avalanche hit the Squaw Valley Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe near the Nevada state line. One man was hospitalized with a serious lower body injury, another person was treated for injuries and released while three other people escaped injury, the resort said in a statement. Heather Turping was snowboarding with her boyfriend when she heard someone scream ""Avalanche!"" and saw ""a cloud of snow coming down."" ""It was massive,"" she said. ""It just happened to literally pass a foot in front of me."" A woman screamed that her husband was missing and someone spotted a snowboard poking out of the snow. ""That's what saved his life,"" Turping said. ""I took my gloves off and I helped dig him out,"" she said. ""When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, 'You were under for six minutes.'"" The man wasn't seriously hurt and was able to snowboard back down the mountain, she said. The skiers and snowboarders were within areas open to skiing at the time and the guests had been warned of the potential danger, resort spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn said. The resort used explosives and other tools to knock down snow to prevent avalanches throughout the day but the snowfall was heavy, she said. ""We had assessed the area to be safe to open to the public and unfortunately an avalanche did occur after that assessment was made,"" Hepburn said. The avalanche occurred hours after the body of a missing snowboarder was found at the same resort. Wenyu Zhang, 42, vanished Thursday as the region was hit by a blizzard packing winds gusting to nearly 150 mph (241 kph) over the ridge tops. It dumped 3 feet (1 meter) of snow in the mountains. A blizzard warning expired Friday but whiteout conditions were still possible around Lake Tahoe, where a winter storm warning remained in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said. About 300 miles (482 kilometers) south, rain fell in the coastal foothill communities of Santa Barbara County, where thousands of people had been told to flee out of concern that the approaching storm might send huge swathes of fire-scarred slopes rushing down on them. But the rain that moved through Southern California Thursday night and Friday spared Montecito, which saw hundreds of homes destroyed in January mudslides. Twenty-one people were killed then and two remain missing. Evacuation orders affecting up to 30,000 people on the south Santa Barbara County coast were lifted at midmorning. ""The worst of the storm has passed and we are cautiously optimistic that due to a significant amount of pre-storm preparation we have come through this with minimal impact,"" said Rob Lewin, director of the county Office of Emergency management. Some minor roadway flooding occurred, but the region's main highway, U.S. 101, remained open throughout the storm. Officials said 87 percent of those in the threatened areas complied with the evacuation order. ——— Associated Press writer John Antczak in Los Angeles and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.","ABC News California storm kills 1, avalanche injures 2 at ski resort ABC News A truck heads west through the snow on Interstate 80, Thursday, March 1, 2018, near Donner Summit, Calif.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","On September 15, NASA will launch a laser 310 miles above the Earth to scan our planet’s ice sheets like never before, recording changes in the elevation of these frozen landscapes down to the width of a pencil. The laser, which lives aboard NASA’s Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 ( ICESat-2 ), will shower the Earth with subatomic particles of green light called photons— 300 trillion per laser pulse, to be exact. The satellite will survey Earth from pole to pole, flying 1,387 unique tracks every 91 days for as long as its fuel supply and hardware systems hold. By the mission’s end, scientists are expecting a slew of new data that will help reveal where ice is retreating fastest as global temperatures rise and what that means for our future. ICESat-2 is, basically, Christmas-come-early for climate and ice scientists. (Or a few years late depending on how you look at it, NASA had originally hoped for a launch in 2016 before technical difficulties set the mission back.) The fact that it’s now launching under the auspices of a president who last year suggested global warming might not be real because of a snowstorm hasn’t tamped down spirits at NASA, an agency that has, so far, proven fairly impervious to the political headwinds of the Trump administration. If there are any jitters at this point, they’re over the success of the launch. “My own place on the spectrum of excited to terrified fluctuates daily,” Tom Neumann, NASA’s deputy project scientist with ICESat-2, told Earther. As its name suggests, ICESat-2 is a follow-on to an original ICESat mission—a satellite that launched in 2003 and collected data until 2009. Both missions are all about measuring the elevation of icy surfaces. To do so both rely on laser altimetry—shooting pulses of light at the ground, and determining the time it takes for some of that light to return to the satellite. Combining that travel time with the satellite’s precise location and the laser’s pointing angle, the distance from satellite to ground can be calculated and used to work out elevation. But that’s where the similarities between ICESat’s Geoscience Laser Altimeter System—the very first laser altimeter launched into space on a satellite—and ICESat-2's Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) end. The latter amounts to a major upgrade when it comes to studying icy surfaces. The original ICESat fired a single beam of light 40 times a second, allowing it to measure elevation about every 560 feet (170 meters) along Earth’s surface. ATLAS fires 10,000 pulses a second, and the laser light is split into three pairs of beams as it exits the instrument. Pairs of beams are spaced 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) apart on the ground. The faster firing means ICESat-2 will take elevation measurements every 28 inches —a dramatic increase in resolution. What’s more, having three spaced-out laser pairs instead of a single beam will allow ICESat-2 to measure the slope of its track as the satellite flies overhead. Finally, while the original ICESat mission only wound up operating about two months a year due to some laser life time issues, ICESat-2 will take measurements year-round. “There’s just going be more data than we necessarily know what to do with,” Brooke Medley, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center, told Earther. Combining all that data with other information collected remotely via satellites or aircraft or in the field, scientists hope to improve their estimates of everything from the thinning of ice shelves holding back West Antarctica’s most imperiled glaciers to subtle changes in East Antarctica’s icy plains that could have a major impact on future sea level rise. ICESat-2 is also the first instrument optimized to measure not just the aerial extent but the thickness of sea ice, which can tells us about the ice’s age and health. The timing seems fortuitous: Just this past year, scientists witnessed open water forming not once, but twice, north of Greenland in a region where the oldest and thickest Arctic sea ice was thought to reside. Beyond the big picture stuff, ICESat-2's data will inform any number of more focused research projects. Helen Fricker, a professor of glaciology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, is looking forward to checking in on more than 100 subglacial lakes—lakes that form beneath ice sheets—discovered by the original ICESat mission. We’re only just beginning to understand these lakes, which can fill or drain over over the course of season, potentially impacting the dynamics of the ice they’re buried beneath. “We’re very excited because as soon as we get data on these lakes, we’ll know if they’ve drained or filled since [the original] ICESat ended,” Fricker told Earther, noting that with ICESat-2's wider field of view, we should also be able to detect new subglacial lakes. In drani Das, an assistant research professor of glaciology at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, is excited about a different sort of lake. She’s hoping to take advantage of ICESat-2's green-colored laser light to measure the depth of meltwater ponds that form on the surface of ice sheets during the summer months. The original ICESat mission, which beamed infrared light, wasn’t super useful for this. “Infrared is absorbed by water, so it doesn’t penetrate [the ponds],” Das told Earther. “But green can. That’s a unique thing I’m really looking forward to.” Then there are applications that have nothing to do with ice at all. Some researchers, for instance, are interested in what this satellite can tell us about Earth’s remote high-latitude forests. Laura Duncanson, an assistant research professor at the University of Maryland College Park and NASA Goddard, told Earther the original ICESat mission was useful for estimating things like forest height, canopy cover, and biomass, information that’s used to make global forest carbon maps that inform climate change models. While ATLAS may have trouble penetrating densely-canopied tropical forests, it should help scientists estimate forest structure and biomass in the more open boreal forests covering vast swaths of North America and Eurasia. Another laser altimeter mission launching to the International Space Station this fall—the Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation, or GEDI—will be optimized for forest structure studies, but it won’t be flying north or south of about 52 degrees latitude. “The synergies between ICESat 2 and GEDI will be particularly exciting,” Duncanson told Earther. “Everywhere GEDI won’t cover, ICESat 2 will.” ICESat-2's road to readiness has been long and at times rocky. As a report published last year by NASA’s Office of the Inspector General detailed, managers underestimated the complexity of building ATLAS when the mission entered development in 2012. As a result, NASA “significantly understated the mission’s cost and schedule,” ultimately drawing funds from other Earth science projects to finish it, per the report. Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, a mechanical engineer at NASA who took over as project manager for ATLAS in 2014, says unexpected roadblocks are par for the course when developing an instrument like this. “Anytime you’re building something new you’re gonna have challenges,” she told Earther. In her view, though, the challenges are worth it for what missions like this are ultimately able to offer the scientific community. “To hear the scientists talk about what they’re gonna do and what they’re gonna learn, and to realize you had a part in orchestrating this huge instrument that took a huge team of people and to see it work, it’s just amazing,” Douglas-Bradshaw said. “I’m just amazed at what we’re able to accomplish.”","On September 15, NASA will launch a laser 310 miles above the Earth to scan our planet’s ice sheets like never before, recording changes in the elevation of these frozen landscapes down to the width of a pencil.

ABC News,"Interested in Italy? Add Italy as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Italy news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The Arctic storm dubbed the ""Beast from the East"" set record temperatures across much of Europe on Monday and brought a rare snowstorm to Rome, paralyzing the city and giving its residents an unusual chance to ski, sled and build snowmen in its famous parks and piazzas. Rome's train, plane and bus services were crippled and Italy's civil protection agency even mobilized the army to help clear slush-covered streets as a city used to mild winters was covered by a thick blanket of snow. ""Beautiful, beautiful!"" marveled Roman resident Ginevra Sciurpa, who donned a fur hat and thick scarf to brave the unusual cold. ""Even though I'm not a child anymore, the enthusiasm for the snow is still the same. It is always beautiful, and above all I didn't have to go to work."" Elsewhere, the storm set dangerously low temperatures: Meteorologists in Germany reported a record low for this winter of -27 C (-16.6 F) on the Zugspitze mountain in the Alps. Moscow, as well, recorded its coldest night this winter, with the mercury dipping to nearly -20 C (-4 F) on Sunday night. Doctors in Britain warned that the already-stretched National Health Service may have trouble coping with extra patients affected by what meteorologists are forecasting will be days of cold and high winds. The intense winter weather has been dubbed ""The Beast from the East"" by British tabloids, citing Siberia as the source of the frigid temperatures. In Croatia, about 1,000 soldiers joined in the clearing operations in the worst-affected areas, where over 1.5 meters (some 5 feet) were reported. Rome saw just a few centimeters (inches) but it was enough to close schools. Parks that usually stay green through winter were blanketed with snow, giving eager Romans a rare opportunity to go sledding, snow-shoeing or skiing. Even the Circo Massimo became a hotspot for snowball fights, while Piazza Navona, with its famed Bernini fountains, turned into a snow-dusted winter wonderland. Rome's Mediterranean climate and proximity to the sea usually result in mild winters, such that restaurants often keep outdoor seating open, albeit with space heaters, even through the coldest months of the year. ——— Associated Press writer Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, and Gregory Katz in London, contributed to this report.","The Arctic storm dubbed the ""Beast from the East"" set record temperatures across much of Europe on Monday and brought a rare snowstorm to Rome, paralyzing the city and giving its residents an unusual chance to ski, sled and build snowmen in its famous parks a…",2018-02-26T13:47:11Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Rome blanketed by snow as Arctic storm sets European records,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/rare-snowfall-blankets-rome-closing-schools-53356194,https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_b015f87284864c5dbdd3e9e8de9021cc_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,snowstorm,1

Zach Berman,"COSTA MESA, Calif. — The Eagles have not needed to adjust their practice schedule because of the wildfires in Southern California, practicing on Wednesday as scheduled. The Los Angeles Rams cancelled their practice and held a walkthrough instead because of air quality concerns. The Eagles have not heard from the league about any contingencies for Sunday’s game. “It is obviously a serious issue with what’s going on and our thoughts and prayers are obviously with the people that are affected,” coach Doug Pederson said. “I know the Rams were affected these last couple of days and it makes it a little uncomforting and unsettling. But I can just remember back a few years ago, we had a snowstorm in Philly that pushed a game [back]. Those thoughts do come back to my mind because I was a part of that, too.” The Eagles are practicing in Orange County, more than one hour south of the areas most affected by the fires. The Rams practice in Thousand Oaks, Calif. The game is at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in downtown LA on Sunday. “As far as how it’s going to affect the game, I’m not quite sure,” Rams coach Sean McVay said in a conference call. “There are some things going on in the area and we have to adjust. Fortunately, we have Cal Lutheran’s facilities right next to us. And first of all, the most important thing is none of our players’ families or coaching staff have been directly affected or their houses have been affected by this. Now with the new stuff going on, we still continue to monitor that, and we’ve had to adjust some things schedule wise, and our players have been able to handle that pretty seamlessly.” Get insights on the Eagles delivered straight to your inbox with Early Birds, beat writer Zach Berman’s newsletter for Eagles fans.

Ashley Collman,"The search for a missing Iowa teen ended in tragedy on Sunday when the boy's body was found. 
 Corey Brown, 13, ran away from his home on the south side of Marshalltown on Tuesday night, during a snowstorm, after getting into an argument with his parents in which they took away his cellphone. 
Corey Brown, 13, ran away from home on Tuesday. He was found dead on Sunday.
Facebook/Marshalltown Police
On Sunday, Marshalltown Police released a statement on Facebook, saying that Corey's body had been located that morning ""in a secluded area on the west side"" of town. They didn't say where exactly his body was found, or what kind of condition it was in. 
 ""At this time, there is no evidence or information that indicates criminal activity is connected to this missing person/death investigation,"" the statement said. ""However, this is still an active investigation and all possible scenarios will be thoroughly investigated."" 
 Police added: ""No other public information is available for release. When additional details are available, we will send them immediately."" 
 The statement said the Brown family has asked that everyone ""honor and respect their privacy."" 
 Shortly after their son went missing, Craig and Michelle Brown held an emotional press conference begging him to come home. 
 ""Corey, you know how much we love you. And I'm not going to stop until we find you,"" his mother said at a Thursday press conference, recorded by KCCI. ""If you're out there, please come home. We love you more than you'll ever know. Please, please just come home.""

 During the press conference, Police Chief Mike Tupper said Corey left home without his parents' knowledge Tuesday night, after the family had a ""disciplinary discussion"" and his parents took his phone away, according to the Des Moines Register. 
 Tupper wouldn't detail what exactly the discussion was about, but said it was ""normal"" and ""nothing extraordinary."" 
Brown's parents, Craig and Michelle, held an emotional press conference on Thursday, in which they pleaded for his safe return.

Yet another snowstorm is expected to dump as much as 10 centimetres on parts of B.C.'s South Coast Friday morning, Environment Canada says.
In a warning issued Thursday morning, the weather agency forecast another blast of winter weather for Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and the Sunshine Coast.
Areas affected by the incoming frontal system are expected to see snowfall early Friday morning, which could be mixed with rain.
The snow is expected to intensify at some point during the morning, then will taper off in the afternoon, Environment Canada said. By the end, the agency expects municipalities under the warning to see five to 10 centimetres.
It warns the snow may fall heavily, accumulating quickly and making travel challenging.
In Metro Vancouver, the warning applies to:
Burnaby
New Westminster
Coquitlam
Maple Ridge
Richmond
Delta
the North Shore
Surrey
Langley
The Fraser Valley warning includes Hope, Abbotsford and Chilliwack.
The Sunshine Coast warning applies to the area between Gibsons and Earls Cove, and Saltery Bay to Powell River. 
Other snowfall warnings are in effect elsewhere in the province.
Ten centimetres of snow are expected overnight in northern B.C., while the Cassiar Mountains area could see as many as 20 centimetres of snow.
Warnings were also issued Thursday for Atlin, inland sections of the Central Coast, Haines Road, South Klondike Highway, Teslin, Watson Lake and Williston.

,"A winter storm that blanketed the Midwest with snow and left seven dead hit Washington and its surrounding areas Sunday with more than 35 million people under winter weather alerts.
Up to a foot of snowfall is possible in Washington and Virginia on Sunday and into Monday morning, the National Weather Service said.
Baltimore is also in the path of these heavier bands of snowfall, with 4 to 6 inches of snow predicted for Sunday. Philadelphia is predicted to get 1 to 2 inches of snow, and there is a possibility of light accumulation in New York along the storm's northern edge.
""We have a strong snowstorm that's stretching 1,400 miles from Kansas to the East Coast,"" CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. ""St. Louis is seeing its worst snowstorm in five years. We're going to see a significant snow event for the mid-Atlantic to start the year for 2019.""
Over a foot of snow has fallen across areas of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado since Friday. The highest snowfall totals were in Montgomery City, Missouri, northwest of St. Louis, which was hit with 20 inches of snow.
More than 35 million people are under winter storm warnings or advisories across the Ohio River Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning effective through 6 p.m. ET Sunday for Washington, parts of central Maryland and northern and northwest Virginia. Sleet, snow and ice are making traveling conditions hazardous if not impossible.
Snowy and icy mess
The Appalachians will pick up ice and snow in the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, forecasters said. Half an inch of ice and 3 to 5 inches of snow are predicted. In anticipation of the storm, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency Saturday.
There is a small chance the southern Appalachians will get enough freezing rain and sleet to bring an ice event Saturday into Sunday.
More heavy rain also will fall on the saturated South. The Southeast has seen abundant precipitation in December and January, and the additional rain could put a strain on already-high rivers.
The storm eased up Saturday in St. Louis after dropping more than 10 inches of snow there.
At least four people have died and scores of motorists were injured and stranded, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.
In Kansas, three people died Friday in traffic accidents, authorities said Saturday: A 62-year-old man in a vehicle that struck a barrier wall on the Kansas Turnpike, a semi-truck driver whose vehicle collided with another truck and a driver whose vehicle struck an oncoming vehicle and ran into a ditch.
In a tweet Saturday night, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said it had responded to 57 injuries, 878 crashes, 1,790 stranded motorists and 3,918 calls for service.
St. Louis recorded 10.4 inches of snow by 1:30 p.m. ET, with higher accumulations in other parts of Missouri. In Columbia, 15.5 inches were reported and Harrisburg had 17 inches.
The Missouri Department of Transportation warned residents not to travel in the storm if it wasn't necessary. The department reported incidents and stalls on interstates overnight. But it cited progress Saturday as crews worked to clear routes and bring ""water and food to stranded motorists.""

"USA TODAY, John Bacon and Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","As a major winter storm brought some of the coldest temperatures and largest snowfall of the season to the northeast US, some residents in Maine are out enjoying the winter weather. (Jan. 20)
 AP
High winds and brutally cold temperatures greeted brave souls armed with shovels digging out Monday from up to two feet of snow that fell across a wide swath of the nation.
""In some cases, temperatures may plummet 40 degrees,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.
The storm has been blamed for three deaths across the country.
Adding to the temperature troubles: Wind gusts of up to 50 mph capable of knocking down tree limbs and electrical lines and disrupting power.
Temperatures across the Northeast were forecast to dip about 20 degrees below average for the time of year. The entire state of Michigan was below zero early Monday, and the wind chill temperature in Rudyard dipped to 46 degrees below, the National Weather Service reported.
At wind chills that low, frostbite can occur in as little as 10 minutes.
Boston's high temperature for Monday was forecast to reach only about 9 degrees, ranking it among the 20 coldest January days ever recorded in a city that began keeping track of such things in 1872, weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue said.

There were some gains for travelers in the skies. Nationwide, only about 315 flights had been canceled Monday and another 1,130 delayed as of 10 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.com. That's an improvement  more than 1,600 flights were canceled Sunday and another 2,165 on Saturday.
Sosnoski said some areas from Ohio to Maine could see snow drifts of up to 10 feet, and the severe blowing and drifting could limit travel and delay crews trying to dig out.
The highest snow total from the storm was the 29.2 inches that fell near Rochester, New York.
Last SlideNext Slide
Newry, Maine, was digging out from 16 inches of snow Monday. But anyone out with a shovel was battling a wind chill of 21 degrees below zero and wind gusts of 20 mph.
Roads cleared by accumulating snow during the storm may become blocked again due to extensive drifting snow in the storm's wake through Monday, Sosnowski said.
More: 2 feet of snow, -40 F possible as storm roars East
More: 'Blockbuster' storm, then an Arctic blast will freeze 200 million.
Winds are expected to ease in the East on Tuesday, but the cold will remain. By then the Midwest will see a brief reprieve from the deadly cold, but it will be short-lived. And the next wave of cold will bring more storms to the battered region.
A significant amount of snow is forecast for parts of Nebraska to Wisconsin. Chicago should see a wintry mix, but up to 8 inches was forecast for Waterloo, Iowa. 
Long term, the forecast is for winter to be wintry.
""The cold shot and warmup will be brief,"" AccuWeather said.  ""We expect longer-duration cold blasts and less pronounced warmups during the latter part of January and into the first part of February,"" AccuWeather long-range meteorologist Max Vido said.

Melissa Griffin,"Over 30 million Americans in 15 states are under weather alerts on Sunday as hazardous conditions await on one of the busiest travel days of the year. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Flight delays and cancellations are likely across the Midwest, as major cities from Kansas City, Missouri, to Chicago will see heavy snow, and possible blizzard conditions in some spots. Winter storm and blizzard warnings are in place as a major storm moves through the Midwest on this busy travel Sunday. A winter storm warning is in place for the Chicago area, while blizzard conditions are possible near Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday. Kansas City is under a blizzard warning due to an expected 4 to 9 inches of snow and wind gusts up to 50 mph on Sunday. The last time the Kansas City metro area was under a blizzard warning was in 2011. Chicago is under a winter storm warning, with 3 to 6 inches of snow possible along with gusty winds. Heavy snow is falling Sunday morning in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, with it eventually moving into Iowa. Strong winds will combine with heavy snow to create whiteout, blizzard conditions in some areas. Snow will move into the Kansas City, Mo.; Des Moines, Iowa; and Chicago areas on Sunday. The storm is moving rather quickly -- by Sunday afternoon and evening it will move into Kansas City, and eventually into northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin. The heaviest snow in Chicago will hit around 5 p.m. Sunday evening through 5 a.m. Monday morning. The combination of heavy, wet snow sticking to trees and power lines could result in widespread power outages. Snow will still be falling in Chicago and all of Michigan by the Monday morning commute. Snow lingers in Chicago on Monday morning and will continue to fall heavily across Michigan. The storm itself will then move into the Northeast, but thankfully it will be mostly rain in the region due to the milder air mass. Some areas of heavy rain are possible from New York City to Boston for the Monday evening rush, but any wintry precipitation will be confined to northern New England. The precipitation will fall as rain from New York City to Boston on Monday evening. A swath of 4 to 8 inches of snowfall is possible from Kansas to Michigan, with over 10 inches possible in some spots. The largest snow totals, possibly over 6 inches, will likely be just outside of the major Midwest cities: north of Kansas City, south of Des Moines, Iowa, and northwest of downtown Chicago. Snowfall totals will be heaviest from Kansas City, Mo., to Chicago. Regardless, heavy snow and strong wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph will bring near whiteout conditions and extremely hazardous travel on this very big travel day. I-35 and I-80 will both be affected and anyone getting on the road in these areas should be very careful of blowing snow and dangerous roadways.",The storm will bring snow to the Midwest and rain on Monday in the Northeast.,2018-11-25T11:22:57Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Snowstorm causing headaches in Midwest on one of busiest travel days of year,https://abcnews.go.com/US/snowstorm-causing-headaches-midwest-busiest-travel-days-year/story?id=59400706,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/colorado-snow-kmgh-mo-20181125_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,snowstorm,1
Scott Davis,"The Las Vegas Aces may have started a discussion about travel in the WNBA by forfeiting a game against the Washington Mystics. Ethan Miller/Getty The WNBA announced on Tuesday that the Las Vegas Aces forfeited a game against the Washington Mystics last Friday that the Aces decided not to play. The Aces decision not to play came after the team experienced severe flight delays on Thursday, spending 25 hours traveling to Washington D.C. WNBA teams fly commercial and don't have their own charter planes. According to SB Nation's Matt Ellentuck, the Aces tried to fly out of Las Vegas at 1:13 pm on Thursday for a Friday night game in Washington D.C. The flight was delayed until 10 p.m. and then cancelled. The team then flew to Dallas, landed at 5 a.m., then took three different flights to D.C. because one flight could not accommodate the whole team. They arrived in Washington D.C. at 4 p.m., four hours before the game. The team said in a statement that after consulting with doctors and the players union that they decided playing the game would not be safe because of the lack of sleep and physical condition of the players. After reviewing the incident, the WNBA determined the Aces forfeited the game, handing them a loss to drop them 12-16. With six games left to play, the Aces are in ninth place, two games back of the playoffs with six games to go. The loss could affect their own playoff pursuit as well as the Mystics, who are in third place and trying to earn a first-round bye. The Mystics were not sympathetic to the Aces' journey. ""They should've showed up,"" Mystics coach Mike Thibault told Ellentuck. ""It's that simple to me. Every team in every sport goes through a day like this or two days like this somewhere in a one- or two-year period. It happens. It's happened to me in this league several times, the NBA, the CBA. There wasn't a snowstorm, they got here. ""So your obligation is to play. Everybody gets tired. For them to say they were tired... we played this year in Seattle on a back-to-back after we played in L.A. It was a 4 o'clock in the afternoon game in L.A., it was a 4 o'clock game in Seattle, we took a red-eye and got to the hotel at 4 o'clock in the morning. We were tired. But you play, that's part of what you get paid for."" ""I think it was pretty unprofessional,"" Mystics All-Star guard Kristi Toliver told Ellentuck. ""It's disappointing for our fans, for our league to forfeit a game. Everybody's been delayed. We dealt with it this year, it's just life, it's how it is. But you still have to show up to work."" Some are torn on whether the Aces made the right call. As ESPN's Mechelle Voepel laid out, some might see the Aces as negatively impacting their own season, handing the Mystics an easy win, and bailing out of an obligation. Others might think the Aces were doing the right thing to protect players from an elevated risk of injury while also making a statement to the WNBA for better travel methods. According to Voepel, the WNBA's collective bargaining agreement prevents teams from using charter flights because of financial and competitive balance issues. Voepel noted that teams owned by NBA teams could access charter flights more easily. The players can opt out of the CBA in October, potentially making travel a bigger issue in the next agreement. ""Something like that is missing from the WNBA's collective bargaining agreement,"" Aces center Carolyn Swords told Voepel. ""I think this is a starting point from which we can have a conversation about implementing something like this.""","The WNBA ruled that the Las Vegas Aces forfeited a game they decided not to play after 25 hours of travel delays.

Matt Simon,"As the glam metal band Cinderella once said, you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone. I’m relatively certain they weren’t talking about snow, but let’s pretend they were anyway: Global warming threatens to wreak havoc on snowpack. The American west in particular already has a snowpack problem, which means less water for drinking and powering hydroelectric plants. Unfortunately you can’t just force snow to fall out of the air. Or can you? For over half a century now, scientists have been toying with the idea of cloud seeding for snow—that is, inducing clouds to spit out more moisture. Think Olympics that never run low on snow (in PyeongChang, almost every bit of snow on the ground was made by machines ), and snowpacks that are forever … packed. Problem is, for all these decades, it’s been tough to prove that cloud seeding is actually working. So, let’s talk about how snow forms in the first place. In a cloud you’ve got a whole mess of gas and water molecules running around bumping into each other. “Getting them to actually start to freeze, they have to bump into each other in the right way to lock into an ice lattice,” says Andrew Gettelman, who studies cloud microphysics at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. “That's much easier if there's a solid substrate.” A closeup of the generator. But clouds aren’t known for being very solid. However, they do contain particles like dust, which forms a sort of foundation on which ice can grow, ice that then falls to the ground as snow. Cloud seeders can theoretically hijack this process by tricking the ice to form around a compound called silver iodide. They go about this one of two ways: by flying through a cloud and spraying the stuff, or by using ground-based generators to burn a silver iodide solution that rises into the clouds on a raft of hot air. “It turns out that silver iodide has a molecular structure that's very similar to ice,” says University of Wyoming atmospheric scientist Jeff French, who studies cloud seeding. “What that means is that if a liquid water droplet were to capture a silver iodide particle, or were to perhaps grow initially on a silver iodide particle as a liquid drop, it would be able to freeze more readily at higher temperatures than it would naturally.” What’s important to understand here is that cloud seeding doesn’t work by creating moisture, but by encouraging it to form into ice. So if cloud seeding works, the results wouldn’t be dramatic: You can only coax so much moisture out of clouds, and this certainly isn’t about creating new clouds out of nothing. And that only makes it more difficult to prove that the process produces extra snow. The problem is that as we all know, weather is finicky. You can seed clouds to your heart’s content and see maybe a 10 percent bump in snowfall over the course of 5 years, but it’s tough to prove that it wasn’t a natural fluctuation in weather that did it. What French and his colleagues have been able to do, though, is confirm the hypothesis of how silver iodide would work to form snow, thanks to some fancy technology. They got a plane loaded with sensors—radar and lidar and all kinds of good stuff. As they flew through a seeded cloud, particles passed through a laser beam. This allowed the researchers to capture a 2-D image of the particle and determine if it was liquid or ice. It also allowed them to quantify the concentration of particles over a certain distance, say 50 or 100 meters, in parts of a cloud that had been seeded versus parts of a cloud that hadn't. These flares are ignited as a plane flies through a snowstorm, releasing silver iodide particles into the clouds. “Under certain conditions, we have demonstrated unambiguously that the chain of events that are hypothesized to occur when you add silver iodide to a cloud do indeed occur,” says French. That is, silver iodide seems to facilitate the freezing of liquid into ice particles. “We can quantify how many particles were being produced, how fast those particles grew, etc.,” he adds. “Now, does that mean that over the course of a year you can produce 15 percent more snow? We're a long way from being able to answer that question.” The problem is that it’s tough to run a controlled experiment with cloud seeding. “That gives it a little bit of a bad reputation in the field,” says Gettelman, “because it's hard to do a really good statistical study that shows you can make it snow more than if you didn’t seed the cloud. How do you know what would have happened if you didn't do it?” Still, that hasn’t stopped a lot of folks, particularly in the western US, from seeding anyway. Take Idaho Power, which runs 17 hydroelectric projects. Idaho Power is in the business of water, so in the early ‘90s, amid a multiyear drought, a shareholder suggested the utility explore cloud seeding to boost snowpack. The utility’s program went fully operational in 2005, and today consists of 55 ground-based generators in southern Idaho, as well as three planes. Idaho Power says it’s seen an annual increase in snowpack of 12 percent in one of its regions (other regions tally somewhere between that and 5 percent). “Everything that we've done points to a benefit,” says atmospheric scientist Derek Blestrud of Idaho Power. “We've never had something that points the other way.” Even if cloud seeding is effective, is this something we should be mucking with? “If we find out that it works, that doesn't mean we should do it,” says Nicholas Anderson, an associate program director at the National Science Foundation, which funded some of French’s seeding research. “It means we should understand what happens downstream of it too.” If seeding helps coax moisture out of a cloud and dump it in one region, that may mean another region down the road loses out on snow. But we’re also dealing with relatively small amounts of moisture here. “When you step back and you look at the scales we're talking about,” says French, “in best case scenarios that might actually fall out as a result of cloud seeding, I think you're having a very tiny impact on the overall water balance in the atmosphere.” Wouldn’t want to upset the neighbors, after all. Engineering the Earth What happens when we can't keep the Earth from heating up? Some say the solution is geoengineering —intentionally altering the atmosphere. It's a relatively unresearched idea, but representatives in the US government are making moves to support studies. That research will be essential before we try any of these ideas, because the side effects could be dire.","You can theoretically \""seed\"" snow in the atmosphere, but it's really hard to tell if it actually works.",2018-02-19T17:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Could Scientists Use Silver Iodide to Make Snow for the Olympics?,https://www.wired.com/story/could-scientists-use-silver-iodide-to-make-snow-for-the-olympics/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a876a26915fc539b509aa20/191:100/pass/snowseeding.jpg,wired,Wired,snowstorm,1
ABC News,"The snowstorm that crippled the Gulf Coast is gone, but cold weather remains in place across most of the eastern U.S., stretching all the way to Florida. The storm on Wednesday left a foot of snow in parts of North Carolina, and daily records in Raleigh (5.9 inches) and Atlanta (2.3 inches). On Thursday morning, the cold has moved all the way to southern Florida. A wind chill advisory has been issued all the way to Naples and West Palm Beach, Florida, where wind chills are near freezing this morning. A freeze warning is in place as far south as Tampa and Fort Myers. Freeze warnings stretch all the way to central Florida on Thursday, Jan. 18, 2018. The early morning wind chills around the southern U.S. include a 25 degree wind chill in Tampa and 13 degree wind chill in Pensacola, Florida. Wind chill temperatures early Thursday were in the single digits across much of the East, and below freezing all the way to Florida. There is one more chilly morning in the South on Friday, where a freeze watch is issued for Florida again. Wind chills will be in the 30s in Orlando Friday morning. There will be one more day of cold temperatures this week, as wind chills will be in the teens and 20s across much of the eastern U.S. After tomorrow morning, a January thaw is coming to the eastern U.S. from Florida to Minnesota as temperatures will be well above freezing.

Andrew Webster,"Even though I’ve been playing Fortnite for the better part of a year, I still get surprised by the butterflies. There I am, running along the edge of a giant crater or sneaking through a dense forest, and some blue, fluttering wings catch my eye. I don’t exactly stop and stare — that’s too dangerous in a battle royale where everyone is out to kill you — but it’s enough to capture my attention for a brief second, before I move on to explore other parts of the island. There’s nothing similar to those charming butterflies in Apex Legends. Respawn’s Titanfall -themed shooter stormed out of the gates when it launched two weeks ago, racking up 25 million players in seven days and regularly dominating the Twitch charts. Apex isn’t the first battle royale game to challenge Fortnite, but none of its contemporaries have had this kind of momentum. Even neon-haired Fortnite star Ninja is playing Respawn’s game, winning the game’s first major tournament last week in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers. This might lead you to believe that the two games are in direct competition. And, at least for a portion of the competitive community, they are. But Apex and Fortnite also offer very different experiences. And while I’m enjoying the high-octane action of Apex, Respawn’s battle royale is missing my favorite aspect of Fortnite : Epic’s game is a much more pleasant place to hang out. As a pure action game, Apex is the superior experience. As anyone who played the Titanfall games can attest, the developers at Respawn are masters at making tight, fast, and approachable first-person shooters. And while it’s missing the mechs and wall running that made Titanfall so unique, Apex is still an incredible action experience. You can run and slide around the map with ease, and the guns all have a specific weight and force to them that just feels right. Even better, while Apex is focused entirely on team play, there are features in place that make it fun even if you’re playing with strangers. Compared to Fortnite, all of these elements — the gunplay, the movement, the social features — are improved in Apex. But that’s only a fraction of the reason why people actually play Fortnite. Epic’s game isn’t just a battle royale, it’s a social network and, increasingly, it’s a virtual place where massive hangouts happen and where people want to explore with their friends almost as much as they want to compete. Often when I play, actually winning a match is low on my list of priorities. I might play a few rounds to complete some rewards or follow the latest ongoing event. Today, I dropped into the island quickly before work just to check on the status of the earthquake-induced cracks. There’s so much to do outside of the core battle royale loop. (And that’s not even including the Minecraft -like creative mode, or the constantly cycled limited-time modes that put you on big teams and let you come back to life after you perish.) Actually winning is low on my list of priorities Some of these elements are likely coming to Apex Legends. The game is getting a subscription battle pass, which in all likelihood will include daily and weekly activities to keep players coming back. It’s possible that the map will shift and change over time as well. But on top of these elements, Fortnite also has a lighter tone that makes it a much more inviting destination, particularly for a game you play on a weekly or even daily basis. There’s a goofy charm to the world, a colorful sense of style that stands in direct contrast to the gritty shooters that dominate the space, and that includes Apex Legends. That makes Fortnite more appealing to a broader range of players, and much more appropriate for kids and palatable to their parents. It also means Epic has free rein to come up with wild ideas to surprise players.

Associated Press,"(VATICAN CITY) — Pope Francis has prayed for victims of California’s wildfires and freezing weather on the U.S. East Coast. Addressing tens of thousands of faithful in St. Peter’s Square Sunday, including pilgrims from New York and New Jersey. Francis prayed that “the Lord welcome the deceased into his peace, comfort family members and sustain all those involved in rescue efforts.” Francis said he wanted to offer a “special prayer to all those stricken by the fires that are scourging California, and now also for the victims of the freeze of the east coast of the United States.” At least 76 people perished, and hundreds are unaccounted for in the California wildfires. In the eastern U.S., an unusually early winter snowstorm last week was blamed for at least seven deaths.

Andrea James,"The Beryozka dance is a dance developed in the Soviet Union in the 20th century. It's now reached the status of beloved tradition because of the way the women's costumes and small dance steps make them appear to glide across the stage. The dance was choreographed by Nadezhda Nadezhdina (1908-1979), the founder and constant director of the ensemble right up until 1979. From 1925 to 1934, she was a solo ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. After beginning work as a teacher and choreographer in the mid-1930s, Nadezhda Nadezhdina in time came to stage original dance compositions on Russian folklore and folk art themes. Initially, the Beryozka ensemble's repertoire was limited to just a few dances (""Girl's Dance"", ""Northern Round Dance"", ""The Swan"", ""The Chain"", and ""Snowstorm""), but each of them was carefully thought out, tried, tested and impressive. With its dances, the ensemble heralded the birth of a new style of performance in Russian theatrical choreography. That was when the famous round-dance-pictures appeared and when the amazing ""floating"" step, which to this day astounds audiences throughout the world, was perfected. In 1949, at the World Youth and Student Festival in Budapest, the ensemble took first prize and the winner's laurels in the folk dance competition. In 1950, the Beryozka dance ensemble was awarded the State Prize of the USSR.",The Beryozka dance is a dance developed in the Soviet Union in the 20th century.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. When it comes to airlines, you might think there are certain business basics beneath which no airline will sink. You might also think that the moon is made of leather, trees speak Greek and cows produce Chardonnay. The latest example of, well, questionable customer service comes from Minnesota-based Sun Country Airlines. It had to cancel two flights from Mexico back to Minneapolis, because the latter suffered a snowstorm. It so happened that these two flights were the last of the season, so Sun Country couldn't offer its customers any flights within a reasonable future. It therefore decided to refund the cost of its customers' tickets and bid them all adios. It surely wouldn't be beyond many imaginations that those customers then had to spend a lot of money on hotels, food and alternative flights. ""The fact that they felt it was OK to send an email telling everybody that 'find your own way home,' I guess to me that doesn't seem right,"" passenger Abby Pettit told CBS. On its Facebook page, the airline offered the almost classic : ""We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."" All this happened on Saturday. Inconveniently, it wasn't until Monday that the airline seemed to realize this didn't look good. ""We cannot apologize enough to those passengers who were hit by the one-two punch of an April snowstorm and the seasonality end-date of our winter schedule. Our fleet was already allocated to fly other operations and unfortunately, we were unable to send additional aircraft to Los Cabos and Mazatlán without canceling more flights causing further disruptions to more of our passengers,"" said the airline's Vice President of Marketing Kelsey Dodson-Smith in a statement. I contacted Dodson-Smith to ask whether the airline felt a greater responsibility to its passengers than it had so far displayed. I will update, should I hear. Of course, Sun Country could have chartered a plane or two in order to bring back its customers. There are plenty of Jumbo Jets currently lying around, doing very little. The airline might have even got a good deal. It might have even made for a PR story of rare airline decency. Instead, Senator Tina Smith has written to the Department of Transportation to express her serious concerns. In it Smith wondered why there didn't even appear to be customer service agents available for 24 hours to talk customers through their options and, dare I say it, help. She also mentioned that one of the first acts of Wall Street private equity fund Apollo Global Management after buying Sun Country was to get rid of, oh, 350 customer service staff, only to encourage them to reapply for their positions -- which were now outsourced at a somewhat lesser level of pay. I want to hear from our federal transportation officials about what can be done to prevent it from happening again. I'm asking @USDOT to work with airlines to ensure cancellation policies adequately protect consumers. https://t.co/ZAiGNwYrG0 pic.twitter.com/sPobm4lfVZ -- Tina Smith (@SenTinaSmith) April 16, 2018 Legally, Sun Country is likely covered. Buying a ticket doesn't guarantee you a seat on a plane. Bad weather causes cancellations all the time. But there's something a little tasteless when an airline appears to shrug its shoulders, offer a wave goodbye and move right along. Some may find it refreshing that it isn't only airlines like United and American that seem keen on making as much money as they can at the expense of customer service. Ultimately, though, when choices are scarce, what can passengers do? Nothing will change. The next time they're booking a vacation, they'll see Sun Country's relatively cheap fares and book with the airline all over again. Or will they?",Was this the wisest approach to customer service?,2018-04-17T16:14:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",This U.S. Airline Stranded More Than 200 Passengers in Mexico (and Never Came Back To Pick Them Up),https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/this-us-airline-stranded-more-than-200-passengers-in-mexico-and-never-came-back-to-pick-them-up.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_636831102_200013342000928079_353555.jpg,,Inc.com,snowstorm,1
Rosie Perper,"Hello! Here's what's happening on Monday. 1. US President Donald Trump threatened ""severe punishment"" over the disappearance of Saudi critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi stock market dropped as much as 7% following the president's statements. 2. Saudi Arabia threatened to retaliate against US ""threats"" of sanctions. Saudi officials have asserted without proof that Khashoggi left the embassy on October 2, but Turkish officials believe he may have been murdered by Saudi agents. 3. Europe's highest court is set to decide whether Britain has the power to unilaterally halt Brexit. The case will test whether Britain's withdrawal from the EU can be withdrawn by the UK prime minister. 4. China appears to have laid out how it wants Google to help it persecute its Muslim minority. Regional authorities in China passed new laws on how to crack down on its Uighur ethnic minority, which includes heavy surveillance, policing, and censorship from tech companies. 5. South Korean President Moon Jae In said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is ""sincere"" in his efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. He urged the international community to reward him for his efforts so far. 6. Executives from JP Morgan Chase and Ford Motors have distanced themselves from Saudi Arabia. JP Morgan &amp; Chase Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Ford Motor Co Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend a Saudi investor conference, joining the growing list of individuals and businesses cutting ties with the Kingdom. 7. Thousands of people in Portugal were left without power following a tropical storm carrying winds of up 100 km/h (60 mph). Emergency services also issued flood warnings for the north and northwest of Spain. 8. The bodies of nine climbers who died on a mountain in Nepal have been retrieved. A violent snowstorm destroyed their camp on a Himalayan peak in what is believed to be the worst climbing accident in Nepal in two years. 9. Sears, once America's most iconic retailer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Sears CEO Eddie Lampert previously blamed the company's decline on the media, shifts in consumer spending, and the rise of e-commerce, among other reasons. 10.

Olivia Singh,"Sophie Turner says that she and fiancé Joe Jonas are going to keep their wedding ""intimate."" 
 ""We're trying to keep it as low-key as possible so it's more of an intimate thing,"" Turner told Harper's Bazaar UK during a new interview. 
 The 23-year-old ""Game of Thrones"" star also played coy when asked if they're tying the knot this year, saying, ""maybe.""' 
 Although Turner didn't share too much information regarding the couple's wedding, Jonas already confirmed that they will exchange vows this summer. 
 ""We're going to get married this year,"" the singer said during an appearance on CBS' ""The Late Late Show With James Corden"" with Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas. 
 We're going to have a summer wedding, which I'm looking forward to,"" he said. ""It's going to be a lot of fun.""

 The 29-year-old also said that Turner's family is enthusiastic about rugby, so they plan on having a rugby game and a flag football game at their wedding. 
 ""If all the groomsmen show up with black eyes and broken arms, I'll be very proud,"" he joked. 
 Jonas went on to say that in preparation for his nuptials, he's learned a few things from his brothers' weddings. Because Kevin experienced a snowstorm during his wedding to Danielle Jonas in 2009, the singer has decided to hold his during a warmer time of the year. It will reportedly take place in France. 
 Joe also explained that unlike Nick and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who had two extravagant wedding ceremonies in December 2018 and held several receptions, he and Turner will only have one ceremony. 
 Turner and Jonas started dating in 2016 and reports of their romance began in November of that year.
