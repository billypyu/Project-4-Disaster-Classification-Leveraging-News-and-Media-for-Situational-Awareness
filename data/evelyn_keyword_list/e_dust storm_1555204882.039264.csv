Shannon Stirone,"This week belongs to darkness, both Mars- and moon-related. Over on Mark Watney’s home away from home, there’s a storm a-coming: The Red Planet is dusty, covered with sandy dunes like many of the deserts on Earth, and its weather system is known to kick up a lot of that fine material. One of those big global dust storms is expected to hit sometime in 2018, potentially lasting through early 2019. And that spells trouble for the actual Martian, the Opportunity Rover, which has been exploring the rusty planet for 14 years. Unlike the Curiosity rover, which gets its power from a plutonium-powered generator, Opportunity is solar powered. If enough sunlight is blocked by the dust, Oppy might have to enter hibernation mode and ride out the storm. While it has managed to survive previous dust storms, the upcoming 2018-2019 storm could be the one that puts the brakes on it for good. The moon itself will go dark this week, at least from our perspective. On January 31, the Earth, the sun, and the moon will get in line, causing what NASA is calling a ‘super blue blood moon.’ (Yes, the term is kind of overblown; it really just means an eclipse that makes the moon kind of reddish). Those on the west coast of the United States will be treated to the best show, starting at 6:07am PST. Scientists will be watching, too. They use lunar eclipses to study the geology on the moon, determining if the material on the surface is larger stones or lunar dust. That rocks. Not done traveling through the cosmos?

Mark Kaufman,"The dust storm on Mars continues to grow. On Wednesday, NASA announced the storm has progressed from a continent-sized tempest to an event that has engulfed the entire red planet. ""The Martian dust storm has grown in size and is now officially a 'planet-encircling' (or 'global') dust event,"" NASA said in a statement.

The space robot, which has been exploring the Martian surface since 2012, took a pretty amazing selfie as the storm was heating up on June 15. That said, NASA's other functioning rover on Mars isn't doing quite as well in the storm. For two weeks, the storm has smothered the Mars Opportunity rover, turning day to night and blocking nearly all light from reaching the robot's solar arrays. A shade simulation of dust blocking out the Martian sun. Opportunity has been experiencing the far right conditions. Image: nasa The energy-starved machine has been in sleep-mode for the past week, and is no longer communicating with NASA engineers — though, they're hopeful the robot will charge up when the storm dissipates. That said, even if Curiosity experiences near total darkness, it won't lose power like Opportunity. Curiosity, a car-sized rover, runs on nuclear energy. It's unknown how long this dust storm will last, though previous Martian dust storms have persisted for weeks to months. It's also unknown why some Martian storms stay relatively small and die off after a week, while others continue to grow. ""We don't have any good idea,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, said of these storms in a statement. But Curiosity, along with spacecraft orbiting Mars, are now in an ideal position to send information about this progressing dust storm back to Guzewich and other NASA scientists. Mars, though, is an ideal place for dust storms to occur. Unlike Earth, it has no trees and vegetation to keep dirt rooted to the Earth. And Mars' oceans have long since evaporated away, leaving a vast dust-ridden desert at the mercy of the callous Martian winds.","The dust storm on Mars continues to grow.

Shannon Stirone,"This week, NASA had to say farewell to the Opportunity rover, which had been exploring Mars for the past 15 years. Its final months are a tale of grit, literal and figurative: Late last spring, a dust storm engulfed the entire Martian planetthe worst, most severe storm ever observed there.
Blasts of wind kicked fine grains of dust and sand off the surface; because of the planets lower gravity, the particles hung in the atmosphere for months. The storm was so powerful and the clouds so thick that they prevented sunlight from reaching the rovers solar panels. NASA last heard from Oppy in June 2018, and after 7 months of trying to wake it up, scientists finally declared they had done all they could. The mission was over.
Opportunity and its twin, Spirit, were only expected to last some 90 days on Mars. When the two rovers landed in January 2004, NASA thought the planets dust eventually would accumulate on the solar panels and keep their batteries from recharging. What scientists didnt fully grasp, however, is that Mars has seasons just like Earth. Yes, the dust would build up, but in time a breeze would come and blow it off the solar panels. The simple fact of seasonal reoccurrence was, in large part, what kept the rovers going for so many years. (The Spirit mission officially ended in 2011.)
Were staying on Mars a bit longer this week. Not only do we have to pay our respects to the intrepid Opportunity, but InSight, NASAs latest Martian lander, is busy getting settled on the surface to do some science. This mission is the first in history that will study the interior of the red planet. After 40 years of exploration, we are still learning new things about our neighbor.
The best way to remember Opportunity and cheer on InSight is by diving into WIREDs full collection of space photos, here.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"These new views of Mars, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, show that the entire planet is now engulfed in the dust storm that began in late May. And while orbiters are studying the storm to understand it better, it could spell trouble for the rovers on its surface. Storms like these occur every six to eight Earth years, according to a NASA release. The most recent one began as a smaller storm, first observed on May 30, which forced the Opportunity rover to enter hibernation mode in early June. By June 20th, the storm encircled the planet. “It’s exciting because it’s the strongest dust storm we’ve EVER seen on Mars,” Tanya Harrison, director of Arizona State University’s NewSpace Initiative told Gizmodo via Twitter direct message. “It’s worrisome for Opportunity because she’s not getting enough sunlight to keep her batteries charged, but thermal models tell us temperature is on our side.” Opportunity will remain asleep until the dust settles, probably some time in September, when scientists will try to wake it up. The main concern is whether the solar-powered rover can survive the cold without power to keep warm, though the thick dust may absorb heat and prevent Opportunity from feeling the worst of the frigid temperature. Harrison said that scientists are optimistic. Meanwhile, other experiments are working to understand the tempest—NASA’s Mars Odyssey orbiter is tracking the planet’s temperature and atmospheric composition to better study it, according to that release. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter takes color photos of the atmosphere and measures temperature, while its MAVEN orbiter is studying how the storm affects the top of the Martian atmosphere, above the dust. They want to know how small storms turn into planet-wide events. And 5,000 miles away from Opportunity, the Curiosity rover is in less danger. It is nuclear powered, so it need not hibernate. It is attempting to measure the properties of the dust particles while it continues drilling into rock, but as we reported, the dust could possibly harm its cameras. Scientists are excited to study the storm to learn about our red neighbor. “The storm gives us the chance to better understand how these storms grow from regional to planet-encircling, and what kind of effects they have on the albedo patterns [how the planet reflects sunlight] on the surface.” [ NASA ]","These new views of Mars, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, show that the entire planet is now engulfed in the dust storm that began in late May.

George Dvorsky,"These photos taken by the Curiosity rover span about a couple of weeks, starting with a shot of the area before the storm appeared. GIF: NASA For the past two weeks, a massive dust storm has churned on Mars, forcing NASA to put its Opportunity rover into hibernation mode. But Curiosity, a rover on the other side of the planet, is now feeling the effects of the storm as well, revealing the dramatic, planet-size scale of this dusty weather system. The extent of this dust storm is nearly incomprehensible—about the combined size of North America and Russia. NASA says the storm now spans the entire circumference of Mars, making it a planet-encircling dust event. The Opportunity rover, which is dependent upon solar power, is (fingers crossed) only temporarily out of commission. The Curiosity rover, located about 5,000 miles (8,200) away from Opportunity, is now feeling the effects as well, with the amount of airborne dust above it doubling in the past week. The dimming created by this atmospheric haze, measured in tau, is now about 8.0 at Gale Crater, which is the highest recorded tau in the history of the Curiosity mission. At Opportunity’s location, the tau is at 11, making it really dark. But unlike Opportunity, Curiosity is in no danger of losing power, as it relies on a nuclear-powered battery. That’s not to say the storm isn’t affecting Curiosity. Because of the dim lighting, Curiosity’s cameras require extra exposure time, and extra exposure time means the optical equipment is more vulnerable to all the dust that’s blowing around. The current situation is not ideal. But Curiosity did manage to take some recent photos of the Martian landscape, revealing an increasingly dense wall of haze, which is about six to eight times thicker than usual. On Earth, planet-encircling storms aren’t really possible thanks to our thick atmosphere, stronger gravity, and plenty of vegetation cover (which binds the soil to the ground). It’s a vastly different story on Mars, as NASA explains : Martian dust storms are common, especially during southern hemisphere spring and summer, when the planet is closest to the Sun. As the atmosphere warms, winds generated by larger contrasts in surface temperature at different locations mobilize dust particles the size of individual talcum powder grains. Carbon dioxide frozen on the winter polar cap evaporates, thickening the atmosphere and increasing the surface pressure. This enhances the process by helping suspend the dust particles in the air. In some cases, the dust clouds reach up to 40 miles (60 kilometers) or more in elevation. Some storms on Mars last for a few weeks, while others go on for years. The factors that drive these variations are still not fully understood, which is why this storm, the most powerful to hit the Red Planet since 2007, is of great interest to scientists. As a neat aside, Mars isn’t the only planet to experience planet-encircling storms. Back in 2013, astronomers detected a massive thunder-and-lighting storm on Saturn that created a seamless ring around the gas giant. That’s a total distance of 190,000 miles (300,000 km), as compared to Mars, which has a circumference of 13,325 miles (21,300 km).

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Mars before (left) and during (right) the dust storm GIF: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Nearly all of Mars has been under the assault of a planet-wide dust storm since June. The nerve-wracking question: Is the Opportunity rover okay? The 15-year-old rover has been incommunicado since June 10, according to a NASA release, as the dust storm cut it off from solar power. NASA scientists are confident that the rover will weather the storm, so they’re just waiting for the wakeup call. First, here’s the background. A small dust storm appeared on Mars at the end of May. It soon spiraled into a planet-wide event. Storms like this occur once or twice a decade. The nuclear-powered Curiosity rover is fine, but the solar-powered Opportunity rover went into hibernation in early June. Scientists worry about what the lack of power and low temperatures will do to the rover but are optimistic it will survive. So, how will researchers know when it’s back? The NASA press release explains that dust storms are measured with a number called “tau,” with higher tau indicating a more opaque atmosphere. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite that circles the planet, can estimate the tau by observing the surface. The rover needs a tau no higher than 2 in order to charge its batteries. Normally its environment’s tau is 0.5, and during the storm, it was as high as 10.8. At present, the tau is somewhere between 2.1 and 2.5, according to the Opportunity team —so they don’t expect to hear from the rover just yet. Meanwhile, NASA engineers are pinging Opportunity, hoping to hear a response back. After that first response, it will take a few weeks to gather information about the rover’s current state and determine what kinds of damage it might have suffered. To protect itself in the event of an error, the Opportunity has automatic safe-mode type behaviors, called fault conditions. NASA scientists expect that the rover has gone through low-power, mission clock, and possibly uploss fault conditions, according to the newest Opportunity update. Low-power faults make the rover hibernate, clock faults tell the rover to rely on things other than its internal clock to make decisions, and uploss faults tell it that its normal communication systems aren’t properly functioning. NASA has put together a playlist of songs it has used to try to rouse the rover. It’s a boring playlist without any hip-hop or dance music that I, too, would try to sleep through. Maybe I’d wake up for Queen or Bowie. Hope to hear from you soon, Oppy! [ NASA JPL ]",Nearly all of Mars has been under the assault of a planet-wide dust storm since June.

Mark Kaufman,"A mighty dust storm swirled around the Opportunity rover on June 10, 2018, forcing the robot to shut itself off and conserve power. The dust blocked out nearly all the sunlight, turning day to night. 
Opportunity would never awake. On Wednesday, NASA announced that they would no longer attempt to revive the 15-year-old machine, formally ending the legendary extraterrestrial mission. 
But on that dark June day, just before Opportunity went silent, the rover took one final picture:
Opportunity's final picture.
Image: nasa
The image captured a Martian world shrouded in darkness by the dust storm. 
""This was the last image we ever took,"" Bill Nelson, chief of the Opportunity mission's engineering team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in an interview just after NASA declared the mission over. 
""We are looking at an incredibly small amount of sunlight .002 percent of the normal sunlight that we would expect to see,"" said Nelson. ""If you were there, it would be late twilight. Your human eye would still be able to make out some features, but it would be very dark.""
But in this final image, no Martian features are visible.
In the picture, the white static amid the black is just image noise the camera picked up in the darkened setting (""It's kind of like the image you get on your phone in a very dark environment,"" said Nelson). The thick black bar at the bottom of the picture is data that never arrived back to Earth as if Opportunity's message was cut off mid-sentence.

If the rover had not been caught in such a dust storm, it would have taken a picture down a channel, about 20-feet across, as Opportunity peered down a valley, said Nelson.
So-called ""Perseverance Valley"" became Opportunity's final resting spot. 
Six days earlier, Opportunity captured the following picture of the wide, sloping environment.

Over the course of Opportunity's life, the rover shot well over 200,000 images and sent them back to Earth.

""It's very evocative of the status of that rover,"" said Nelson. ""Here we are, with one tiny rover on this foreign, alien planet all by itself.""
Now, the 400-pound robot will spend millennia getting shrouded in red dust, and NASA engineers like Nelson will move on to other extraterrestrial projects, as will his entire NASA exploration team.
""It's bittersweet,"" said Nelson, noting how proud he is to have worked with engineers and scientists that directed Opportunity for some 15 years.

A huge dust storm that's now 14-million square miles wide, covering a full quarter of the red planet, has blotted out the sun above Perseverance Valley, Opportunity's home.

The mission clock will trigger the computer to turn back on to check power levels sporadically, NASA said. If the computer finds that power levels are good, it will command the rover to get in touch with engineers back on Earth, but if not, it'll put the rover back to sleep again to wait out the storm. Opportunity has lived an amazing life on Mars. The rover touched down on the red planet with its twin Spirit in January 2004, and the robotic emissaries got to work right away in different parts of the world. Opportunity and Spirit have totally overhauled our understanding of Martian geology, revealing never-before-seen rocky features on Mars. The rovers found evidence of past volcanic activity, water flows, and meteor impacts. Both rovers were only designed to function on Mars for about 90 days, but both outlived that estimate by leaps and bounds. Spirit operational life on Mars ended in 2010, but hopefully its twin will make it through the storm and keep on trucking for years to come.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"As the planet-wide Martian dust storm clears, NASA scientists have increased their efforts to contact the nearly 15-year-old Opportunity rover, which has been silent since June 10. Some scientists are beginning to feel apprehensive, but there’s a plan in place.. The deep-space network of NASA communications satellites began a 45-day period of “active listening” on Wednesday, during which they will send signals from Earth to Mars several times a day. Radio receivers will listen passively and continue doing so until January 2019, at the earliest. “I think we have a plan that, if the vehicle is alive, we’ll hear from it,” Steve Squyres, principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, told Gizmodo. “The question is whether it’s alive.” Powerful dust storms arise on Mars every few years, but the most recent was perhaps one of the largest on record, according to a NASA release. What began as a small storm back in May soon took over the entire planet. The nuclear-powered Curiosity rover is doing fine, but scientists were more worried about how the solar-powered Opportunity would fare, with the sun obscured by the thick dust. It’s not low power directly that would kill the rover. Opportunity is equipped with a warm electronics box, or WEB, which stores temperature-sensitive equipment and ensures it never drops below -40 Celsius (-40 F). But nighttime temperatures on Mars can reach lower than -100 Celsius (-148 F). Every piece of electronics inside the box has been tested to -55 Celsius, Squyres explained, and the dust storm generally has a moderating effect on temperature, keeping nights warmer. Still, it’s unclear how equipment would behave in temperatures below -55 C, or how nearly 15 years of heating and cooling would change the components’ ability to withstand the cold. NASA will actively listen to the rover—meaning send signals and wait for a response—for a period of 45 days that began this week. But that doesn’t mean they’re giving up afterward the period is over. “If the vehicle is actually alive, it should wake up and talk to us on its own,” said Squyres. NASA will await a potential signal until at least January, since perhaps dust has caked onto the solar panels, and a swirling dust devil passing over could clear the panels and awaken the rover. Unlikely, but maybe. There are now conflicting emotions among scientists. Opportunity has been a wildly successful mission, enduring nearly 15 years when it was only scheduled to last for 90 says. Squyres, who has been working on the rover mission since 1987, recalled drinks and storytelling when the similarly resilient Spirit rover died after six years of operation in 2010. But Opportunity, unlike Spirit, would be the end of his project. Still, he said, “I always felt there were two honorable ways for the mission to end. Would would be if we simply wore our rover out, and the other would be if Mars killed it.” Opportunity has made some important observations during its time on the Red Planet. “We found the first sedimentary rocks that showed evidence of liquid water on Mars,” Kirsten Siebach, Martian geologist at Rice University, told Gizmodo. Then, the rover took a long drive to another crater, where it was able to observe some of the oldest rocks on the planet and help shape our understanding of what Mars once looked like. It has driven 25 miles across the Martian surface during its operation. Despite far outlasting expectations, losing Opportunity would be a loss for present-day science. “Opportunity is the only rover exploring the most ancient epoch of Mars history, when strong evidence indicates the planet was warmer and wetter and perhaps not unlike the Earth at that time and when life first got its start here,” Matthew Golombek,Mars Exploration Rover project scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Gizmodo. Opportunity was in the midst of doing more research, studying small gullies that appear to have been carved by trickles of liquid water. If Opportunity is lost, understanding how these gullies really formed will be one more problem that will go unsolved for now. Seibach explained that entire careers were built on Opportunity data, and that it’s an asset to have multiple rovers. “If you land one mission on Earth in New York City and try to understand what all of Earth is like, you’ll have a skewed perception,” she said. We must cross our fingers and hope that the rover reaches back out to us. But if even it doesn’t, the Opportunity mission has been a profound success. “Before we landed, I massively underestimated Mars,” said Squyres. “Mars, it turned out, is way more complicated and interesting than we envisioned.” [ NASA ]","As the planet-wide Martian dust storm clears, NASA scientists have increased their efforts to contact the nearly 15-year-old Opportunity rover, which has been silent since June 10.

George Dvorsky,"A new simulation produced by NASA’s Data Visualization Studio packs four months of swirling atmospheric activity into a two minute clip that reminds us how unrelenting this past hurricane season really was. This looks like a timelapse pieced together from images taken by satellites, but it’s not. Rather, it’s a computer simulation based on real data. Specifically, the model is showing the progression of aerosols—wafts of sea salt, dust, and smoke—blowing through the atmosphere from July 31 to November 1, 2017. This visualization was churned out by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a system of math models developed by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. What’s particularly neat about this video is that the hurricanes kind of appear by accident. Hurricanes aren’t aerosols, but because the NASA scientists were tracking the stuff carried by wind around the atmosphere, they were able to visualize the various storm systems as they moved across the Atlantic. NASA explains : During the 2017 hurricane season, the storms are visible because of the sea salt that is captured by the storms. Strong winds at the surface lift the sea salt into the atmosphere and the particles are incorporated into the storm. Hurricane Irma is the first big storm that spawns off the coast of Africa. As the storm spins up, the Saharan dust is absorbed in cloud droplets and washed out of the storm as rain. This process happens with most of the storms, except for Hurricane Ophelia. Forming more northward than most storms, Ophelia traveled to the east picking up dust from the Sahara and smoke from large fires in Portugal. Retaining its tropical storm state farther northward than any system in the Atlantic, Ophelia carried the smoke and dust into Ireland and the UK. It’s a gorgeous simulation for sure, but scientists can use models like these to understand all the different things that go on in our atmosphere and how they all fit together to produce weather.

Miriam Kramer,"The hardest working rover on Mars is fighting for its robotic life on the red planet. NASA announced on Friday that the Opportunity rover is currently being hit by the worst dust storm it's ever experienced in the 15 years since it landed on Mars. ""A dark, perpetual night has settled over the rover's location in Mars' Perseverance Valley,"" NASA said in a statement. SEE ALSO: 10-Year-Old Opportunity Rover Is Still Finding Crazy Stuff on Mars Scientists are worried the rover won't survive this storm, but there's still hope. On Sunday, Opportunity phoned home, sending a transmission to engineers back on Earth. This means the rover had enough power to send a message despite the fact that the sun was blotted out by dust, preventing a full charge to its solar panels. The storm is actually 7 million square miles across, meaning that it's larger than North America, according to NASA. Since the storm began bearing down on Opportunity, the rover has started conserving energy by ending science operations and only using minimal power to keep it warm during the tempest. This storm is bad, but Opportunity is made of hardy stuff. The rover was only designed to last 90 days, yet here we are more than a decade later, a still-functioning Opportunity on Mars. Keeping watch over the rover Scientists working with the rover and many others have become attached to the intrepid space robot. They're hoping for the best. Oppy’s ops team has really bonded this week. We’ve cried together, we’ve cheered at beeps together, we’ve made silly memes together, and so much more. I honestly am so proud of this team for coming together.

""The storm's atmospheric opacity — the veil of dust blowing around, which can blot out sunlight — is now much worse than a 2007 storm that Opportunity weathered,"" NASA said. ""The previous storm had an opacity level, or tau, somewhere above 5.5; this new storm had an estimated tau of 10.8 as of Sunday morning."" On MER, we call optical depth tau, since tau is what you solve for in the equation. It’s a measurement essentially of how much solar radiation is hitting our solar panels. The value we measured this morning was 10.8. To give context, average non dust storm values are 0.5-1. — Keri Bean (@PlanetaryKeri) June 11, 2018 This might be bad math, but a tau of 10.8 is 0.002% of sunlight reaching the surface. That's equivalent to a 11.5 magnitude difference, so the brightness of the Sun at midday is about -14. That's about one lux, which is the brightness of rural night sky on a moonless night. https://t.co/eDwR3mGNoP — Justin Cowart (@jccwrt) June 11, 2018 The main concern NASA has with this kind of tempest is that the rover's batteries will get too cold and it won't be able to function once the dust storm ends. Opportunity is in low power mode in order to make sure it can keep warm until the storm ends. For now, the engineers will just need to wait it out and see how the little robot comes through the storm.","The hardest working rover on Mars is fighting for its robotic life on the red planet.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Mars is in opposition tonight, meaning it’s about as close and as bright as it’s going to get. To celebrate, Hubble has released new images of the dusty red planet, as well as of Saturn, which was in opposition last month. Opposition means the Sun, Earth, and Mars are lined up (and the Earth is at its closest point to the Red Planet), making Mars appear brighter than usual. Mars will be the closest it’s been in 15 years, only 35.8 million miles (57.6 million km) away, so it’s the best time to look at it through a telescope. But more importantly, you’ll be able to see the entire planet shrouded in the dust storm that currently threatening the Opportunity rover. “If you have binoculars or a telescope, you’ll be able to see some of the structure,” NASA scientist Geronimo Villanueva told Gizmodo. “It will look unresolved because of the dust storm.” It might sound like a bummer that the planet will look fuzzy, but it’s actually pretty amazing. There’s extreme weather happening on another planet, and amateur astronomers on Earth can actually see it. Opposition is a good time to study planets with the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth. Hubble can provide something that experiments on the Martian surface and in its orbit cannot: crisp pictures of the entire planet. Scientists can monitor the evolution of the global dust storm over time in a single image. Plus, opposition allows for slightly nicer pictures. “If you’re doing astronomy, having a bigger body allows you to obtain higher-resolution images,” said Villanueva. This new image comes after a big few months of Martian news. The Curiosity rover recently found 3.5-billion-year-old organic molecules in Mars’ Gale crater. This week, the Mars Express spacecraft announced what appeared to be an enormous standing body of salty water about a mile beneath the Martian surface. All the while, a local dust storm on the planet’s surface went global, cutting off human contact with the Opportunity rover. If you’ve got a pair of binoculars or a telescope, you might want to look at Mars tonight (once you’ve finished looking at today’s lunar eclipse, if you’re in a place that can see it). Mars rises at 8:38 p.m. ET (5:38 p.m. PT) and sets Saturday at 5:29 a.m. ET (2:29 a.m. PT). Also, Jupiter and Saturn will still be shining brightly—Saturn was in opposition just last month.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Five months have passed since scientists last heard from the Opportunity rover, which went into hibernation mode after planet-wide dust storm dimmed the Martian skies. But it appears that NASA has no plans to curtail its search for the rover, at least for the foreseeable future, according to a release. The rover hunt is a two-pronged effort, with both an active and a passive listening component. Wed previously reported that the active listening period would last for 45 days, but that number has been extended for the dust-clearing season. We know that the timeframe from November through January 2019 corresponds to an annual period of dust cleaning at the Opportunity site at Endeavour Crater, Steve Squyres, principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, told the Planetary Society. So active listening through January is a boost to our chances of hearing from the rover if the arrays are very dusty now. NASA is hoping that Martian winds will clear some of the dust from Opportunitys solar panels, allowing the rover to generate power and awaken. In late May, a small dust storm quickly became a global event. Though these kinds of storms occur occasionally, this years was one of the strongest on record. The nuclear-powered Curiosity rover weathered the storm just fine, but solar-powered Opportunity, which has been on Mars for 15 years, went into safe mode. Scientists hoped for the best but worried about the possibility that it couldnt withstand the cold. NASA began hunting for Opportunity once the dust storm cleared. Its efforts include an active listening component, where they send signals to the rover hoping to wake it up, as well as a passive listening component, which involves waiting for a signal from NASAs network of radio receivers it uses to communicate with its deep-space probes. It was widely reported that the active listening component would last for 45 days, but the new press release states that current strategy will continue on, with a reassessment in January 2019. The logic behind the decision is that Opportunity was right at the center of the dust storm. Its possible that dust caked over its solar panels, preventing it from charging its battery. During the current season, the winds blow such that they might knock off some of that dust. Curiosity has already received some dust clearing of its own, according to the Planetary Society. Opportunity has become a charismatic rover for the space agency. After far outliving its initial 90-day lifespan, its generated plenty of scientific results about the history of Martian rocks and about water on the planet. People at NASA and around the world are rooting for it. Some have groaned that this autumn has demonstrated that NASAs infrastructure is aging. After all, both the Hubble and Chandra telescopes faced safe mode-inducing glitches, and both the Dawn mission to Ceres and the Kepler exoplanet mission have recently ended. But all of these missions have in fact been massive successes that endured well past their initial lifespans. Thankfully, there are other missions to get excited about. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in 2021. OSIRIS-REx is nearly at the asteroid Bennu, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has already begun to discover new exoplanets in Keplers stead. Two newer missions, InSight and Mars2020, will further study the Red Planet. Its hard to see a beloved mission like Opportunity die, and we hope that the rover does indeed wake up soon. Were glad that NASA supports the team enough to continue listening for it. But keep your head up, because space and Martian science continues onand will continue to do so, if we vote for politicians who value space science.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Before meeting its end in a planet-circling dust storm, the Opportunity rover traversed nearly 30 miles over the perilous Martian surface. In some ways, we traveled along with Oppy thanks to the thousands of images it sent back to Earth. But what did Oppys journey sound like?
There werent microphones transmitting sounds the sounds of Opportunity or its partner, Spirit, but surely they must have kicked up a ruckus as their wheels ground over rocks and dry dust. Luckily for the curious among us, however, NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California has rover testbeds, including a large area designed to recreate Mars surface called the MarsYard. There, engineering models of rovers traverse the model terrain. Together with the science of sound, we can figure out what the rovers sounded like, both on Earth and on Mars.
Opportunitys cleated metal wheels, each with their own motor rolling 2 inches per second over Martian rock, created the exact crackling sound youd expect from a metal-wheeled robot rolling over dirt. Meanwhile, the larger Curiosity rover presents an utter cacophony of screeches as its own metal wheels traverse the rocks of the MarsYard. 
Testing elements of NASAs Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover.
But theres a pretty big difference in the way sound travels through the air on Mars compared to Earth, Don Banfield, principal research scientist at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, told Gizmodo. Sound is just our brains translating vibrations in air molecules into more meaningful data, but how the sound travels is dependent on the air it travels through. Mars atmosphere is mostly composed of carbon dioxide, and is around 1 percent the thickness of Earths atmosphere, which is of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and a trace amount of other stuff.
The difference in the component molecules structures and the thickness of the air would produce two noticeable distortions to sounds once youre a few feet away from the rovers, Banfield explained. There arent enough molecules to carry the highest-frequency soundsthe ones with the shortest wavelengthsso at farther distances you wouldnt hear sound with frequencies higher than 10,000 Hz, the pitches that give cymbals and bells their brilliant quality. On the other end, the lower bass tones with frequencies around 100 Hz disappear on Mars, as some energy that would otherwise cause the wave to move forward instead is spent making the carbon dioxide molecules rotate. 
Additionally, youre not just standing on Mars in shorts and a t-shirtyoud be bearing the winds, low-pressure atmosphere, and cold temperatures in a spacesuit. The sounds would be a bit more muffled.
Though well never hear what Spirit, Opportunity, or Curiosity actually sounded like on Mars, there will soon be some experiments to measure sounds on the Red Planet. The InSight lander has already measured vibrations from the Martian wind, and the Mars 2020 rover will bring two microphones onboard so we can finally hear the wind, rocks, and grinding metal on Mars surface. 
And who knows, perhaps one day in our lifetime, a human will get to hear those sounds directly.","Before meeting its end in a planet-circling dust storm, the Opportunity rover traversed nearly 30 miles over the perilous Martian surface.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A brutal dust storm engulfed Mars last summer. The planet-wide tempest spared the nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, but the older, solar-powered Opportunity rover shut down as the thick dust blocked light from the Sun. Opportunity has remained silent since June 10, 2018, despite NASAs hundreds of attempts to contact it. When a windy season on Mars began in November, scientists hoped that gusts might clear debris from its solar panels, but that hope appears to have been in vain. NASA continues to send recovery commands, but sadly, it seems the Opportunity mission has finally come to an end.
At the same time, 2019 marks a historic milestone for the rover, which officially reached its 15th year on Mars on January 25. This far exceeds the rovers initial expected lifespan of 90 days. Together with the Spirit rover, whose end came back in 2010, the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission marks one of the most important scientific programs of the modern era, finding evidence that Mars was once covered in liquid and sending back iconic images of the planets surface. 
In honor of Oppys 15th birthday, and with the knowledge that we may never hear from the rover again, we asked some scientists from the MER mission and elsewhere to share their thoughts and memories about Opportunity, Spirit, and their legacy.
Steve Squyres, principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER) and professor at Cornell University:
I havent given up yet. We have a list of things to try, and were not done until we try everything on it. But were getting towards the bottom of the list, so its an appropriate time to start thinking about these things. As far as it feels, it actually feels good... Its an honorable death. [The rovers] arent immortal. You know that youre going to lose them sooner or later. To have a 90-day mission last for 15 years, and then end as a consequence of a one of the most ferocious dust storms to hit Mars in a very long time, we can walk away with our heads held high. The mission exceeded far beyond what I could have expected.
The legacy is tough... The legacy is the legacy of both Sprit and Opportunity, and the spirit and the legacy of the team that built them in the first place, the team of engineers, scientists, managers, leaders, and financial people. The reason its been such a success is because of what they did 15 years ago. Thats where the credit belongs.
On the scientific legacy, Mars turned out to be a much more interesting place than I expected. It changed the way humans look at Mars. The three landings that preceded ours were all on these flat, barren plainson purposebecause they were the safest places to land. Thats all the land we saw. Thats what got me so excited about doing a rover mission. We have these little scenic rovers that have climbed mountains and descended into craters. Mars has become a real scenic, beautiful, interesting place in the sense that you can imagine being there and walking in the rovers tracks and seeing what theyve seen. That changes our perspective.
The third part of the legacy is the effect these missions have had on kids. One of my fondest dreams, and I know this has probably happened, is an 8-year-old who watched television in 2004 the night we landed and thought to themselves, Whoa, I think thats cool, but I can do better. I see evidence that the mission has done that to some degree, inspiring young people to pursue careers in science, engineering, and technology with their own dreams.
Kirsten Siebach, planetary geologist, Rice University:
Those rovers were the trailblazers. They had a huge impact. Having Opportunity on Mars has meant that we have new images from the surface of another planet since I was in high school. Our understanding of Mars has expanded, and I think thats always maintained a level of excitement and interest. Its been an inspiration for those of us working on Mars, students, and anyone in the public following along. It makes Mars accessible and close-by... I think the legacy is important for the idea of exploration, and motivating a generation to think were so close to another planet, and that were continuing to explore the Solar System and learning brand new things every day...
Everyone talks about the amazing engineering that allows us to have a robot driving on another planet without a mechanic in absurd conditions for 15 years. Thats an amazing accomplishment. But for me and the people on the team, theres all of those 15 years. There were people here on Earth on science and engineering teams getting together three to five times a week addressing the progress from the day before, and carefully programming what Opportunity would do the next day. For that team, its more than just a robot, and well miss it.... Its been a lot of fun to work on, were happy its been so successful. And that level of dust was definitely an honorable death if we dont hear from it again.
Kevin Lewis, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University:
I hope Opportunity comes back on line! I was on the MER team back in grad school (2003-2009), which is a testament to how long the mission lasted15 years is about three consecutive Ph.D lengths! Opportunity was doing great science up until it lost contact, and exploring new rock units that it never should have been able to reach by its original design parameters. Both Spirit and Opportunity wholly revolutionized the way we do science on Mars, and it is safe to say that we would not have Curiosity without the overwhelming successes of the MER mission. Spirit and Opportunity *figuratively* paved the way for Curiosity and future rovers throughout the Solar System, through their groundbreaking technical and scientific achievements. 
Opportunity captured images of Martian clouds passing overhead on October 2, 2006.

Tanya Harrison, planetary scientist and director of research at Arizona State Universitys Space Technology and Science Initiative, and science team collaborator on the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity:
Opportunity wildly surpassed any expectations we could have had for her. She unlocked the mystery of the hematite signal detected from orbiters before her, taught us about both watery and windy past conditions on Mars, and drove farther than any other rover beyond Earth. No matter what the Red Planet seemed to throw at her, she and her clever team of engineers managed to find a way around ituntil this last global dust storm. But its only fitting that the thing that was finally able to take Oppy out was the strongest dust storm weve ever observed on Mars. Now she can rest, knowing she did humanity proud as our little robotic emissary.
Ashwin Vasavada, Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity rover project scientist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory:
The Opportunity rover was a real inspiration for me during the development of the Curiosity rover, because it showed how a virtual field geologist really could piece together the story of an ancient environment by studying the record held in the rocks. Ancient water flowing across the surface, playas in between dunes, groundwater soaking the rocks, such good stuff... it all kept me going during the hardest days of getting Curiosity to Mars.
Emily Lakdawalla, senior editor of The Planetary Society:
Spirit and Opportunity really blazed a new path for public communications about an active science mission when Steve Squyres and Jim Bell made the choice to make all of the images available to the public when they arrived on Earth. They wanted to make sure that students could work with the data, and that it didnt have to be on some password-protected server... Jim and Steve said, No, we want the public to enjoy the adventure the same way we are. That decision was so visionary. It created this huge international community of people who were able to follow the everyday dream of exploring another planet through the eyes of Spirit and Opportunity. People would make mosaics and animations, discuss the rocks they were seeing, and what the science team was doing. In a lot of instances, people in Europe would see the images before the American team woke upSquyres like checking these forums because it was easier than dealing with [the server].
Cassinis team had no plan to share their images in this way. NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), having seen the Mars Exploration Rover mission said, ok, were going to share Cassinis images as well. Many other missions followed in their footstepsall of the Mars-landed missions, like Curiosity, Phoenix, and InSight. Its influenced the European Space Agency to be more open with their image datatheir structure is different than NASAs structure, since the institutions build and supply the camerasbut the they were able to start sharing a camera called the VMC that shares images [from Mars] as soon as they hit Earth, and Rosetta shared their NavCam images pretty quickly. Juno and New Horizons shared their data pretty quickly... It had a profound influence on the way missions shared their data with the public.
I think its kind of interesting that when Opportunity originally went silent, a lot of people were ready to write it off instantly. That may have been a more pragmatic thing to do, but it didnt take into account the feeling of the people who had been keeping this spacecraft alive for so long. I think its necessary for the team to exhaust every possibility so they could feel some closure on the mission. Some of them Im sure dont want to give up... It takes a huge emotional investment to keep these missions going. I guess I hope Opportunity does surprise us and comes back. Im guessing it probably wont, and Im sorry to the engineers for their loss. People will need to take the time to mourn, and realize that its emotionally difficult.
Abby Fraeman, Opportunity rover deputy project scientist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory:
Ill miss, first and foremost, just interacting with the team on a regular basis. These folks have been working on this mission for a really long time, and even though people have left and others have come in, theres this really wonderful sense of camaraderie. I can recognize everyone by their voice. I know we can rely on people when we encounter challenges or difficult science questions. Its really fun to work through all these problems with the folks involved. Ill also miss waking up every morning and seeing what the rover sent down, what the newest pictures are. Every day you get to see something no human has ever seen before.
I have a very personal story with the rover. I was in high school when Spirit and Opportunity landed. There was a program run by The Planetary Society called the Student Astronaut Program which brought high schoolers out to JPL to be there the night the rover landed. I was there the night that Opportunity landed, and it was an amazing experience that inspired me to go into planetary science. 
The way both Spirit and Opportunity transformed Mars science was pretty profound... It gave us a new perspective on the planet we didnt have in the year 2000. The rovers were sent to follow the water, and before we go there we didnt have any definitive evidence that there had ever been liquid water on Mars in the past. It was the first images from Oppy, and later images from Spirit, that were incontrovertible evidence that Mars had a different climate that could support liquid water on the surface. It opened a whole new parameter space for questions we could ask about Martian evolution. These questions were answered by the Curiosity rover, a bigger new rover with more sophisticated instruments, and some of them will be answered by the sample return missions; some will need future missions to answer. We didnt even know what questions to ask before we had the results from Spirit and Opportunity.
Im just thrilled that it lasted as long as its been. Its a celebration for how successful and groundbreaking this mission was.","A brutal dust storm engulfed Mars last summer.

Miriam Kramer,"The red planet is popular with science fiction enthusiasts and space scientists alike, and now, thanks to a fortunate cosmic alignment, everyone can get in on the Martian action. SEE ALSO: Mars' ice age may have turned the red planet white 370,000 years ago On Friday, Mars will be directly across from the sun from Earth's perspective. Just days later, on July 31, the planet will make its closest approach to Earth — just about 35.8 million miles from our planet. That's the nearest Mars has been to Earth since 2003, according to NASA. Which means there's only one thing to do: Check out the red planet. On a clear night, the rusty world won't be hard to identify. “When you first spot Mars rising in the east after sunset, you’ll be startled by how bright it looks,” Diana Hannikainen, Sky &amp; Telescope ’s observing editor, said in a statement. “Its pale orange color is unmistakable.” You can even see it with your naked eye if you know where to look. Mars resembles an unblinking, red-tinged star in the night sky, and it should be one of the brightest objects around these days. ""By the end of July, Mars will be visible at sunset. But the best time to view it is several hours after sunset, when Mars will appear higher in the sky,"" NASA said in a skywatching video. ""Mars will still be visible after July and August, but each month it will shrink in apparent size as it travels farther from Earth in its orbit around the sun."" Your view of the planet will be even better through a backyard telescope or binoculars. A little magnification can allow even inexperienced skywatchers to check out surprising details, and this year, you might even be able to see the huge dust storm raging in the planet's atmosphere. That storm has put NASA's Opportunity rover into hibernation mode as it waits for the tempest to pass. And while that has researchers on Earth worried about the long-lived robot, studying the dust storm itself is fascinating from a scientific perspective. ""This is one of the largest weather events that we've seen on Mars,"" NASA scientist Michael Smith said in a statement. ""Having another example of a dust storm really helps us to understand what's going on.""

Gael Fashingbauer Cooper,"This is the final wave that took out the south pier light tower... What a crazy experience! :( :) if you go through them...
Posted by Ann Barbeau on Monday, January 7, 2019
How do you know a storm is really serious? Maybe when it smashes a 20-foot structure into Lake Michigan.
Photographer Ann Barbeau of Manitowoc, Wisconsin told me she enjoys the shore of the Great Lake daily. On Monday, she was out near Manitowoc's South Pier Light Navigational Beacon just as the storm turned fierce.
""I was out this morning taking pictures of the waves,"" Barbeau said, noting that she was using sports mode on her camera to take multiple photos at once. ""This big wave came in, and as soon as it cleared, the light tower was gone.""
The series of 16 photos, which Barbeau posted on Facebook and allowed CNET to reproduce here, show a gigantic wave crashing into the 20-foot structure, then hiding it from view. When the waves clear -- like an evil magician's trick, the beacon is gone.
""I looked in the water, and it was floating for about five seconds, then sunk,"" she said. ""I looked around and cleared my eyes because I couldn't believe what I just witnessed.""
The stunning crash created multiple emotions for Barbeau, who says she felt, ""sad, bad, (and) super-excited at the same time.""
Some news reports said that a lighthouse was washed away, and the Manitowoc Breakwater Lighthouse does indeed stand at the end of the city's north pier. But that wasn't what fell into the water, Chief Eric Olson of the US Coast Guard confirmed to Green Bay's WFRV news. The lighthouse still stands.
Instead, it was the nearby beacon that Barbeau saw crash into the lake, a victim of the strong waves and wind that hit its 20-foot-tall fiberglass tower.
""It's an aid to navigation,"" Olson told WFRV, ""but certainly still an important beacon and we'll definitely look to address the fact that it's missing.""
The event took place around 8:30 a.m. CT Monday morning, and no one was injured. The Coast Guard did not immediately respond to a CNET request for comment.
Olson told the Manitowoc Herald Times Reporter that the Coast Guard will search for the beacon, and that it does need to be replaced. He also told the paper he's not aware of anything similar happening on the lake in the past.
""Rest In Peace, South Pier Lighthouse,"" wrote Manitowoc mayor Justin Nickels in a tweet. (He probably meant ""beacon,"" but the hyperbole is understandable.) ""We can now add this to our upcoming attractions in our Marine Sanctuary along with the shipwrecks. In all seriousness, the Coast Guard has been notified about this since it is their lighthouse. All will be well.""

 Mayor Justin Nickels (@mantymayor) January 7, 2019
Olson told WFRV that the beacon will be replaced in the spring, and said the strength of Monday's waves, aided by the direction in which they were crashing, caused the beacon to wash into the lake.
""The waves got very large and the direction was directly into the break wall,"" he told the station. ""It's not a common occurrence, but in the end Mother Nature sometimes wins.""
For Barbeau, it was a once-in-a-lifetime lake walk. 
""What a crazy experience!"" she wrote on Facebook.

Shannon Stirone,"This week’s series of space photos is truly a tour of the universe. We’ll start with a bang at Cassiopeia A, a remnant of a supernova. When large stars die, they explode in a wondrous burst called a supernova. The death of a star might only take a few hundred seconds, but the material they expel out into space can tell scientists a lot about the makeup of stars. By studying supernova remnants like Cassiopeia A, we can learn more about how elements are distributed in the universe. Next up, we’ll travel to a star-forming region called Sharpless 29. This nebula contains a very young star, only a budding 2 million years old. This baby star is extremely active and is carving out space for itself within this cloud of interstellar dust. And it’s not the only new member of the neighborhood; just next door, as far as space is concerned, the Lagoon Nebula and the Trifid Nebula are also incubating stars. Finally, we will zoom back to our own solar system. This week, NASA served up something very special from the banded gas giant we all know and love: Jupiter. If you’ve ever wanted to visit Jupiter but don’t have a spacecraft, or a rocket, or the biggest radiation shield ever created—it’s OK, there’s video instead!

Catie Keck,"NASAs beloved Mars rover Opportunity has been silent for months after getting swept up in an enormous dust storm on the Red Planet last summer, and NASA engineers have been pinging the rover to answer to no avail. Now, NASA says it will send new commands to the resilient explorer in hopes of waking it up, even as the possibility that it will respond becomes increasingly uncertain.
These new efforts to contact the 15-year-old rover will go on for several weeks and will address three possibilities, according to an update from the space agency, namely that Opportunity is experiencing problems with its radios or internal clock. NASA called the circumstances that would have resulted in the specific problems its addressing unlikely, but Opportunitys team hasnt lost hope yet.
We have and will continue to use multiple techniques in our attempts to contact the rover, John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said in a statement. These new command strategies are in addition to the sweep and beep commands we have been transmitting up to the rover since September.
Opportunity went quiet in June following a massive Martian dust stormthe strongest ever observed on the planetand NASA engineers believed that the solar-powered rover went into hibernation mode to save what power it had left. They hoped that strong winds during a subsequent dust-clearing season would help clear its solar panels and allow it to power back up, but no luck thus far.
Now, as this season draws to a close, engineers are working against the clock. According to NASA, nearing low temperatures could pose new threats to Opportunitys systems and batteries if the rover isnt able to boot up before then.
Steven Squyres, principal investigator for Opportunitys mission, told the New York Times that he still has hope. However, he added: This could be the end. Under the assumption that this is the end, it feels good. I mean that.
This month, Opportunity celebrated the 15th anniversary of its landing on the Red Planet as part of NASAs Mars Exploration Rover mission. Together with its twin rover Spirit, which touched down on Mars weeks before it in 2004, Opportunity embarked on what was expected to be a 90-day mission to search for signs of water on the planet. Both rovers far outlasted their expected mission lifetimes. While Spirits run on Mars effectively ended in 2011, Opportunity persisted and continued to make invaluable scientific discoveries.
Fifteen years on the surface of Mars is testament not only to a magnificent machine of exploration but the dedicated and talented team behind it that has allowed us to expand our discovery space of the Red Planet, Callas said in a statement earlier this week. However, this anniversary cannot help but be a little bittersweet as at present we dont know the rovers status. We are doing everything in our power to communicate with Opportunity, but as time goes on, the probability of a successful contact with the rover continues to diminish.

They can form almost anywhere, in any season, and bring with them 300 mph winds and funnels that can be more than a mile wide. This is what you need to know to survive one of Mother Nature’s most brutal offspring. You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad. Not because you’ll get… Read more Read Where and When They Occur Most tornadoes in the U.S. occur east of the Rocky Mountains. They are especially concentrated in the central and southern plains (what’s commonly known as “ Tornado Alley ”), as well as the Gulf Coast and parts of Florida. That said, tornadoes can occur just about anywhere, so it’s good to be prepared for them wherever you live. Once they form, tornadoes tend to move southwest to northeast, but they have been known to change direction. While tornadoes can occur any time during the year, they’re most likely to strike in the spring and summer months. More often than not, they happen in the late afternoon and early evening when the pressure is rapidly changing, usually between 3 and 9 p.m. Know the Warning Signs Tornadoes can strike quickly and seemingly out of nowhere, but there are usually warning signs of some kind. Make sure you know what different weather warnings mean : Severe thunderstorm watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms may develop in your area. Severe thunderstorms are an early warning sign of a potential tornado. Severe thunderstorm warning : A severe thunderstorm has been observed by spotters or indicated on radar, and is occuring in your area. These storms can produce rain, lightning, hail, and wind of at least 58 mph. These warnings last for around an hour, or until the storm passes or upgrades to something more severe. Tornado watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms are likely and may develop into tornadoes in your area. If you see this warning, review your emergency plans and start preparing for the worst. Tornado warning : It’s happening right now! A tornado has been spotted or indicated on radar in your area, so engage in your emergency plan or take cover immediately. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read If you’re not near your phone, or in an area with poor coverage, there are other tornado signs. Look and listen for : Dark, greenish thunderstorm clouds Dark, low-lying clouds (especially if rotating) Large hail or heavy rain Whirling dust or debris on the ground (tornadoes don’t always have a funnel) Loud, continuous roar that sounds like thunder or a freight train (but never fades away) Knowing these warning signs can save you a ton of time, and time is of the essence in emergency situations. When the Tornado Strikes Once a warning has been issued, or you can see the storm approaching yourself, it’s time to seek shelter immediately. Do not hesitate! Keep in mind, wherever you end up, be sure to protect your head. Most tornado injuries involve flying debris. And never leave a building in an attempt to escape a tornado. You can’t outrun it. If you’re at home Go inside and move to a small interior, windowless room. The lower the room, the better. If you have a basement or cellar, go there. Stay away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. The idea is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible. Once you’re in a safe room, get under a sturdy table or desk, cover your head and neck with your arms, a heavy coat, a thick blanket, or pillows to protect from debris. If you live in a manufactured or mobile home, leave immediately and head to the closest sturdy building. Mobile homes offer very little protection. Keep pets on a leash or in a crate or carrier. If you’re at work or school Head to a pre-designated safe area, like a safe room, storm cellar, or a windowless interior room. If you are in a high-rise building, head to a small interior room on the lowest floor possible. If possible, avoid any buildings with long-spanning roof areas, like gymnasiums, arenas, or shopping malls. These buildings have a high chance of collapsing from pressure during tornadoes. Follow the instructions of your office safety officer or teacher. Remember when you bought a new can opener because you thought you lost your old one? What do you… Read more Read If you’re in a hotel or airport Hotels may have a basement or other designated safe area. Follow the instructions of hotel staff. Otherwise, seek shelter in interior bathrooms or closets near the center of the building. Protect yourself with pillows, blankets, and mattresses. Be sure to inform management of any injuries or damaged property when it’s all over. If you’re in a concourse or terminal of an airport during a tornado warning, airport staff should guide you to a safe area (often designated tornado shelters). You may be advised to leave your luggage behind, so do as instructed. If you’re in your car or truck Do not try to outrun a tornado—it’s faster than you and doesn’t have to stick to roads. Instead, safely drive to the nearest sturdy-looking building. Once there, park your car outside of any traffic lanes and get inside. If you’re caught inside your vehicle : park, make sure your seat belt is on, put your head down below the windows, and cover your head and neck with a coat, blanket, seat cushion, or your hands. The vehicle’s airbags and frame will offer some protection. Never seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. You’re safer in a low, flat, open location. If you’re outside If reaching shelter in time is not possible, you have a couple of options. If you can get next to a building, do so and crouch next to a strong wall. If you’re totally out in the open, get away from trees, cars, and other potentially deadly debris, then lie face down, flat in a ditch or other low-lying area. Cover your head and neck with whatever you have. After the Tornado If you’re trapped by debris, FEMA recommends you don’t try to move, kick up dust, or push your way out. You may be injured and could make things worse for yourself. Instead, tap on a pipe, wall, or other material that makes a sound. Whistle or yell if you can so rescuers can locate you. When the storm has passed, check in with your family and friends to make sure nobody is hurt. Keep them together during the aftermath. Switch on your radio and listen for instructions from local officials and emergency personnel. Use extreme caution as you begin to clean up.

High-speed winds and lightning devastated many villages, bringing down homes and leaving dozens injured. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh reported the highest death toll - 16. More than 70 people had died in dust storms in the state earlier in May. Officials told BBC Hindi that casualties could go up further. Twelve people were reported dead in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, which was also severely hit by the storms. Nine people were killed in the eastern state of West Bengal, while two people have been confirmed dead in Delhi. All three states remain on high alert as officials warn of more thunderstorms over the next few days. ""The danger is not yet over,"" Uttar Pradesh's relief commissioner Sanjay Kumar told BBC Hindi. India's Meteorological Department had issued a warning on Sunday before the storms hit, warning people to stay within their homes. Wind speeds were around 109 km/h (67mph) accompanied by thunder and lightning, officials said.

Amanda Kooser,"NASA shared Curiosity's dusty selfie on June 20. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Mars is a bit of a mess right now. The Red Planet is in the middle of a global dust storm that has forced one Mars rover into hibernation and left another working through hazy conditions. The storm kicked up in late May. Scott Guzewich, a member of the Curiosity rover team, posted a mission update to a NASA blog on Friday noting a slow decline over the last two weeks in the amount of dust seen over Gale Crater. He says ""it's possible the dust storm has reached its 'peak.'"" ""We may now be entering (or soon entering) the period where the massive amount of dust in the atmosphere will slowly settle out and Mars' shrouded surface may once again be clearly visible from space,"" says Guzewich. While Curiosity is busy with its science studies, the Opportunity rover on the other side of the planet is still out of touch with home. The Opportunity team says it continues to listen for contact from the quiet rover every day. It last touched base on June 10. NASA hopes Opportunity will wake from its sleep when the skies clear and the solar panels are able to recharge its batteries. The rover launched in 2003 for a 90-day mission and has exceeded expectations by continuing its science observations well over a decade later. At this point, it's a matter of waiting out the storm and hoping Opportunity is able to revive after a long hiatus in cold and dark conditions.",The planet-encircling dust bomb still shrouds NASA's Opportunity rover.,2018-07-09T21:44:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",NASA: Mars dust storm may finally be calming down - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-mars-dust-storm-may-finally-be-calming-down/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/sm9Nq0p230dTfxBP2uViz_eZZj4=/670x503/2018/07/09/e6b0208b-2cdf-4465-a21a-20e9aa922f2c/curiositydustselfie.jpg,,Cnet.com,dust storm,1
Eric Mack,"A NASA illustration shows what Opportunity would look like on Mars.
NASA
NASA made its final attempts to contact its estranged Martian rover, Opportunity, late Tuesday. There was no response, and NASA is convening its leadership to deliver what appears to be a eulogy for its well-traveled robot Wednesday at 11 a.m. PT.
Tanya Harrison, an alum of Opportunity's operations team, was in the room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Tuesday night and shared on Twitter: ""Spent the evening at JPL as the last ever commands were sent to the Opportunity rover on #Mars. There was silence. There were tears.""
The bot had roamed the Red Planet since 2004, but NASA lost contact with Opportunity during a planet-wide dust storm last June and hope slowly faded that the bot would wake up. Because the rover is solar-powered, it was unable to charge its batteries and operate, presumably due to its solar panels being covered by a significant amount of dust, sand and dirt. 
Opportunity had an initial goal of covering 700 yards (640 meters) and operating for just 90 days on the surface of Mars. It exceeded expectations more than 50-fold by staying operational for over 14 years. 
The notion that the briefing is expected to be a sad one rather than a ""hey, maybe this little robot has a little longer to rove"" one is bolstered by the fact that NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine will be on hand with the Mars Exploration Rover mission leadership and an engineer from the Mars 2020 rover team. I can already hear the parting words about ""passing the robotic torch"" to the next-generation rover set to launch next year.
Also, this highlight reel from Opportunity's career quietly appeared online Tuesday with a description that includes an awful lot of talk about the rover in the past tense. 
The official word on Opportunity's fate will be announced at 11 a.m. PT Wednesday when NASA broadcasts the briefing live via NASA TV and YouTube (which you can access by clicking the embed below). 
Stay tuned for more on the life, times and (likely) end of Opportunity later today.

Jackson Ryan,"NASA officially bid farewell to Mars rover Opportunity in February, but the little robotic explorer is still delivering the goods.
On March 12, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) revealed a set of glorious 360-degree panoramas nabbed by Opportunity in Perseverance Valley, right on the western rim of a huge Martian crater known as Endurance. 
And sure, we've seen some remarkable Mars panoramas before, including those captured at Gale Crater by Opportunity's younger sister, Curiosity. But this one feels a little more special, considering Opportunity has come to rest in this very spot -- with this immaculate view -- until humans (or other sentient beings) are able to retrieve it.
NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/ASU
The color panorama was built via a sequence of 354 images snapped by the rover's Panoramic Camera between May 13 and June 10, 2018. It shows a number of interesting features of Perseverance Valley, in addition to the pristine, unexplored floor of Endurance Crater. The black-and-white frames at the image's bottom-left are a result of the rover not having time to snap the location with its filters before a planet-wide dust storm encircled Mars.
""This final panorama embodies what made our Opportunity rover such a remarkable mission of exploration and discovery,"" said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at JPL.

Amanda Kooser,"People here on Earth have been following news of the global dust storm on Mars that's hobbled one NASA rover and created hazy skies around another. The European Space Agency's orbiting Mars Express spacecraft caught an eye-opening look at dust clouds making their way across the planet prior to the development of that massive storm. Mars Express caught sight of these dust clouds in April. ESA/DLR/FU Berlin Mars Express captured the view of the clouds near Mars' north polar ice cap in April and ESA shared it on Thursday. It shows a fluffy-looking line of dust encroaching across the landscape. ESA calls it ""one of several local small-scale dust storms"" seen earlier this year.

Amanda Kooser,"This global map of Mars shows the dust storm sweeping across the landscape. The blue dot near the center shows Opportunity's location. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS It's hard to complain about Earth weather once you realize just how crazy it can get on Mars. A dust storm larger than the continent of North America is currently plaguing the Red Planet. NASA announced on Friday the suspension of science operations for the Opportunity rover while it waits for the storm to blow over. NASA released a global map of Mars captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on June 6. It shows the growing dust storm and a blue dot indicating the rover's approximate location. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter first noticed the storm building back on June 1. The MRO team warned the Opportunity team to get ready for the blast. The storm quickly grew to cover over 7 million square miles (18 million square kilometers) and swept across Perseverance Valley where Opportunity is located. The swirling dust is impacting Opportunity's solar panels, which it uses to recharge its batteries and power the heaters that allow the rover to function in the extreme cold conditions of Mars. NASA says the dust storm's effect is ""comparable to an extremely smoggy day that blots out sunlight."" ""There is a risk to the rover if the storm persists for too long and Opportunity gets too cold while waiting for the skies to clear,"" says NASA. The Curiosity rover team is also keeping tabs on the dust storm, even though it is located in the Gale Crater on the other side of the planet. ""We expect that even if the storm dissipates before becoming a global dust storm, that the amount of dust in Gale will increase over the next several days,"" Curiosity team member Scott Guzewich wrote in an update last week. As epic as this storm is, it's still smaller than a 2007 storm that forced Opportunity to hunker down for two weeks. The rover's current suspension of activity is expected to be temporary. The long-lived machine is a survivor. It landed on Mars in 2004 for a planned 90-day mission and is still going strong all these years later.

David Lumb,"The most obvious change will be the card shift. The sets from 2016 -- Whispers of the Old Gods, One Night in Karazhan and Mean Streets of Gadgetzan -- will all pass out of Standard format to make way for the new expansion. This is has traditionally been the best time of year for new players to jump in the game, since it has the least amount of cards in play, but the switchover also refreshes the meta of competitive decks and strategies. While this year's three sets are still shrouded in mystery, they will all have free single-player adventure content -- hopefully they'll be as inventive and enjoyable as the Arena-like Dungeon Run that came with the most recent expansion Kobolds &amp; Catacombs. But 2016's cards won't be the only ones joining the Wild format. Three old favorites will be added to the Hall of Fame, the honorific category Hearthstone' s team created last year to retire cards from the previously-immune Classic set that launched with the game. 2017's entries included fan-favorites like Ragnaros the Firelord, Sylvanas Windrunner and Azure Drake, which Blizzard put out to pasture for being auto-includes in most decks that were also becoming too difficult to design around. This year's Hall of Fame slate is much the same: Ice Block and Coldlight Oracle are both being retired for defining decks for years. Curiously, Molten Giant is also getting Hall of Fame'd with his 5-mana nerf reverted to its original cost; The Hearthstone team might be doing this as a gift for veteran fans to resurrect old decks in Wild. If you own any of these cards, you'll get a full dust reward as if you'd disenchanted them -- which can result in some free dust if you manage to craft them beforehand and dismantle them after, as this guide explains. The new year and next set will probably bring back casual and absent players curious about the next smattering of cards, but those who have been away for awhile will have to play catch-up on expansions and strategies they missed out on. To get over that 'homework hump,' Hearthstone is handing out a new Druid hero portrait for free (much like they did for 2017's first new set ). Players will earn Lunara, the gleeful dryad that Heroes of the Storm fans will recognize, after winning 10 games in the Standard format. The most exciting change won't be new cards or content, but the ability for any player to create their own tournament within the game client. Just set up the rules and hit 'launch' -- Hearthstone will matchmake and check decks to make sure they fit your bonkers theme (Lorewalker Cho + Faceless Manipulator + Mirage Caller, let's go). The beta will come later this year at an undetermined time, so in all likelihood, don't expect it alongside the first expansion. Finally, the new year will bring more international stops for the 2018 Hearthstone Championship Tour, which the Hearthstone team announced beforehand.

Mark Kaufman,"The Opportunity rover is dead, at age 15. 
After spending over 5,000 Martian days rumbling through the inhospitable red desert planet, NASA acknowledged on Wednesday that its sun-powered exploration rover hasn't responded to over 600 attempts at contact since June 2018, and is presumed dead. 
""Im standing here with a sense of deep appreciation and gratitude to declare the Opportunity mission as complete,"" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
Deprived of sunlight by a dust storm the size of North America, Opportunity came to rest on Mars in a place known as ""Perseverance Valley,"" which sits on the edge of the 14-mile wide Endeavor crater. It is here that the 400-pound machine, built by NASA engineers in Southern California, will now spend millennia getting blanketed in red dust, for the Martian winds don't ever stop blowing. Its batteries, completely bereft of power, will not turn on again.
""The rover isnt just some hunk of metal on a distant planet,"" Bill Nelson, chief of the Opportunity mission's engineering team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told us last June after the rover stopped communicating with its home base on Earth. 
A proud NASA conception of the Opportunity rover on Mars.

""Its like a family member. We dont talk about it we talk about her,"" Nelson said. 
NASA engineers made their last attempt at contacting Opportunity on Feb. 12.
The rover didn't respond. 
Opportunity traveled farther on extraterrestrial land than any vehicle in human history. Before becoming immobilized in June 2018, the rover had traveled 28 miles (45.2 kilometers), passing the record set by the Soviet moon rover Lunokhod 2, which drove 24 miles in 1973.
But Opportunity wasn't ever expected to travel so far. NASA gave the six-wheeled robot a life-expectancy of 90 days. But after launching from Earth in 2003, Opportunity survived for 14 years on Mars. 
Spirit, Opportunity's sister rover, preceded Opportunity in death, dying after six years of exploration, in 2010. After getting impossibly stuck in the desert soil, Spirit was caught at an unfortunate angle, and the rover no longer absorbed enough sunlight to survive. 
""She simply froze to death,"" said Nelson.
Opportunity is survived by the Curiosity rover, a larger car-sized robot that began its Martian exploration in the summer of 2012, after a terrifying landing. Another, more advanced rover will soon join Curiosity in 2020. The 2020 rover will fire lasers at the long-frozen Martian rocks as it seeks to find past evidence of primitive life on Mars should any exist.

In the end, Opportunity's Martian life ended the way it started, amid a ruthless desert storm. 
As Opportunity hurtled through space in 2003, en route to Mars, a suffocating dust storm began to swirl on the red world, eventually encompassing one-fourth of the entire planet. 
NASA engineers feared that the dust storm would interfere with the deployment of Opportunity's parachutes. Shredded parachutes meant certain death for the rover, which would smash into the rusty ground.
Opportunity's 25-mile path from Eagle Crater to Endeavor Crater.

Because of the time lapse between Mars and Earth, Nelson had to wait for the signal to arrive from Opportunity to hear if the machine had survived. 
""The mission was either made or destroyed before we heard the first word of it hitting the atmosphere,"" said Nelson. ""That was scary. The sense of tension was palpable. People were on pins and needles.""
Opportunity went on to spend well over a decade on Mars, taking over 200,000 images, discovering pearly, blueberry-like rocks, and finding convincing signs of Mars' watery past. 
Opportunity's shadow on Mars, taken on Nov. 26, 2014.
Image: nasa
Its longevity can be credited to the summation of over 2,000 human minds, who ensured, among many things, that Opportunity's wheel motors some of which have made over 100 million revolutions would survive the incessantly rocky terrain. 
In the end, the rover died not due to poor health, but a lack of sunlight. 
The dust storm had turned day to night, and Opportunity went to sleep.","The Opportunity rover is dead, at age 15.

Marcus Gilmer,"It's a dark, sad day for space fans the world over.
NASA is preparing to officially say goodbye to the Mars Opportunity rover, one of its greatest achievements, who's watch has apparently come to an end. 
In late January, Opportunity officially marked 15 years on the surface Mars, but it's been over seven months since the rover was last heard from on June 10, 2018. NASA believes that a planet-wide dust storm that blanketed Mars during that time blocked out the sun so thoroughly that the solar-powered Opportunity was unable to recharge.
SEE ALSO: How NASA recorded the eerie Martian wind, without a microphone
Repeated attempts to contact Opportunity have failed in recent months and days, and it's expected that NASA will finally call an end to the mission on Wednesday. For fans, it's a day of sorrow but also of celebration. Like its counterpart, Spirit, Opportunity's journey continued well beyond its planned 90-sol (days on Mars) mission, a monumental achievement. 
Along the way, Opportunity didn't just survive; the scrappy rover delivered historic discoveries and amazing feats. As its mission is officially brought to a close, it's the perfect time to revisit a few of its biggest moments.
1. Sticking the landing
One of Opportunity's most memorable feats was, appropriately, its first. Even now we treat the landing of a rover on Mars as a pretty big deal but it was an especially epic event 15 years ago particularly because Opportunity's landing came just 20 days after the successful landing of the Spirit rover.
As if a back-to-back rover landing wasn't impressive enough, Opportunity's touch down took place inside a small impact crater measuring just 66 feet across, a perfect place for Opportunity to search for traces of water on Mars. 
The exact landing spot was so impressive that one mission scientist, Steve Squyres, called it ""a 300 million mile interplanetary hole in one.""
A view from one of Opportunity's camera of its landing site on its 2nd sol on Mars.

2. Finding delicious ""blueberries""
One of Opportunity's first big finds, in April 2004 was small, round ""spherules,"" photographed by its microscopic imager near Fram Crater. The spherules are iron-heavy ""concretions formed by action of mineral-laden water inside rocks,"" according to NASA. They're referred to as ""blueberries"" thanks to the color that NASA's false color images assign them and they're also good evidence that Mars was once a wet planet.  
The ""blueberry"" spherules discovered by Opportunity in 2004.

Over 8 years later, though, Opportunity would discover a completely different type of spherule at the Endeavour Crater that were likely older and not as iron-heavy as the original ""blueberries"" the rover found in its early days.

That the discoveries came eight years apart is a testament to not only Opportunity's tools but the longevity of its mission. 
3. Visiting Victoria Crater

In late 2006, already rumbling well past its expected end date, Opportunity visited the half-mile-wide Victoria Crater to examine the exposed levels of rock that gave NASA a look at Mars' geological history. 
It would take a year of circling the crater before scientists found a safe way for Opportunity to begin its descent into the crater in November 2007. After it finally made its way down, the rover spent almost a year exploring the crater before leaving in August 2008. 
4. Surviving a dust storm
Though a planet-wide dust storm has finally brought Opportunity's mission to a close, it survived another severe weather event early on, riding out a dust storm that blocked most of the light from the Martian sky in July 2007 while the rover was looking for way in to Victoria Crater.

The rover survived through low power mode and warmed back up by September 2007 as the skies slowly cleared, paving the way for it to eventually enter Victoria Crater a few months later, as noted above.
5. An off-world record rover
One more testament to the scrappy, spunky rover's longevity: In July 2014, Opportunity set a new record for the longest off-world drive (i.e., not on Earth) ever, surpassing the previous record (24.2 miles) set by Russia's Lunokhod 2 moon rover in 1973. 
That's a lot of roving.

All told, Opportunity journeyed just a hair over 28 miles before NASA lost contact with the rover in June 2018.

Severe thunderstorms are also expected to flare up in Nebraska and Iowa on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Other areas, outside of Kansas, are also at risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday, even if forecaster confidence is lower. These places include Texas and Oklahoma, northward into Iowa. One limiting factor for storms, and a forecasting wild card, is the recent dryness that has contributed to the dire fire weather conditions in the past several weeks. Fires singed more than 350,000 acres in Oklahoma, killing more than 1,000 cattle. Fires are still burning in Oklahoma and Kansas today, at the same time the atmosphere is threatening to unleash a totally different type of hazard. While moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has flowed northward into the heart of what is commonly referred to as ""Tornado Alley,"" the dryness of soils in these states could act to inhibit the formation of severe storms. The threat of severe weather will ramp up on Wednesday and linger into Thursday as a series of storms dives into the Southwest, and moves across the Plains and Midwest. By Friday, it's quite possible that Oklahoma will have recorded its first tornado of the season. While tornado season usually peaks during the next few weeks, the same weather pattern responsible for the extraordinarily chilly April across much of the U.S. helped put a lid on severe storm activity up until now.

Evening Standard,"This global map of Mars shows a growing dust storm as of June 6, 2018. Te blue dot indicates the approximate location of Opportunity. NASA NASA 's little Mars rover is battling a fierce dust storm the size of North America which is raging over the surface of the Red Planet. The Opportunity rover was forced to halt operations last week as the storm swept over Perserverance Valley, bringing enough dust to blot out the sun. Engineers at NASA have put the robot into minimal operations mode and are waiting to see if it will still function once the dust has settled. The exploration rover relies on light to run its solar panels, which charge its internal battery and generate power for its heaters. While the rover sent a transmission down to Earth on Sunday, the storm has intensified in recent days bringing ""a dark, perpetual night over the rover's location"", NASA said in a statement. Scientists are concerned over the robot's power levels. There is a risk that Opportunity will get too cold as it struggles to power its internal heaters, which protect its batteries from Mars' extreme cold. Like the human body, the exploration rover cannot function well under excessively hot or cold temperatures. In order to survive, the rover must not exceed temperatures of -40C to +40C. Nasa The storm was first detected on Saturday, June 1 and promptly grew to span more than seven million square miles - an area greater than North America. Scientists said the swirling dust has created an extreme smog that blots out sunlight. NASA said Opportunity's power levels had dropped ""significantly"" by Wednesday, June 6, requiring the rover to shift to minimal operations. But data from the transmission on Sunday told engineers that the rover still has enough battery charge to communication with ground controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. It also showed the rover's temperature to be around -29C. NASA said it will continue to monitor the rover's power levels closely in the week to come. However, it said that the rover has already proved hardier than expected by lasting nearly 15 years - despite being designed for a 90-day mission. This is not the first time Opportunity has hunkered down in bad weather. In 2007, a much larger storm covered the planet leading to two weeks of minimal operations, including several days with no contact from the rover to save power.","NASA's Mars Opportunity rover has hit a problem: A dust storm the size of North America.

Amanda Kooser,"Dark sediments appear in this NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter image of a section of the Medusae Fossae formation. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Mars is looking pretty hazy these days thanks to a nutty global dust storm that sent one of NASA's rovers into hibernation. All that dust had to come from somewhere, and scientists believe they've found the main source. The over 600-mile-long (1,000-kilometer) Medusae Fossae Formation near Mars' equator traces its origins to long-ago volcanic activity. A new study published in the journal Nature Communications calls out the wind-eroded Medusae Fossae as the single largest source of dust on Mars. ""Mars wouldn't be nearly this dusty if it wasn't for this one enormous deposit that is gradually eroding over time and polluting the planet, essentially,"" said study co-author Kevin Lewis from Johns Hopkins University. The research team looked at the chemical composition of Mars dust using data collected by rovers and landers from different points across the Red Planet. ""Dust everywhere on the planet is enriched in sulfur and chlorine and it has this very distinct sulfur to chlorine ratio,"" lead author Lujendra Ojha said. The scientists compared this dusty fingerprint with data collected by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft showing the same chemical match in the Medusae Fossae Formation. The scientists calculated how much of the formation has eroded over the course of 3 billion years and estimated that the quantity of dust on Mars is enough to form a global layer between 6.5 feet (2 meters) and 39 feet (12 meters) thick. The current global dust storm has been raging since late May, leaving NASA's Opportunity rover out of contact and creating hazy skies around the Curiosity rover.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. Hurricane Michael was a sly storm, one that seemed almost unexceptional at first. It followed its predicted path with seeming obedience, but then burst into sudden fury as it approached the Florida Panhandle, reaching wind speeds at the cusp of Category 5 strength and leaving mud and rubble in its wake. It was, in other words, a hurricane: the product of multitudinous forces that blend heat, wind and moisture into a potent threat, with a whopping dose of chance thrown in. Influences on the formation, direction and strength of hurricanes can involve faraway events like dry air from Saharan dust storms, the heated waters of El Niño in the Pacific, the undulations of the jet stream. Increasingly, climate change is part of the dangerous mix as well. Little wonder that modern weather modeling got its start in chaos theory, which acknowledges that small changes can lead to enormous effects so that, as one founder of the field put it, the flap of a butterflys wing in Brazil might set off a tornado in Texas. In the case of Michael, the National Hurricane Center forecast the storms path with great accuracy, but its sudden intensification as it approached land was harder to predict. Millions of residents were caught off guard as Michael escalated from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in just two days, leaving little time for preparations.","Predicting the storm’s path was straightforward, but a number of factors contributed to its sudden intensification.",2018-10-11T16:33:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Hurricane Michael’s Power Caught Forecasters Off Guard,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/climate/hurricane-michael-science.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/12/climate/12CLI-STORMEXPLAINER1/12CLI-STORMEXPLAINER1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,dust storm,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought. But it looks like we could be granted a reprieve from the fourth horseman of the weather apocalypse—hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane forecast on Thursday, and hey, good news. Due to a burgeoning El Niño, it’s likely that the rest of Atlantic hurricane season will be quieter than normal. It only takes one hurricane to do damage, though, and the peak of hurricane season is still ahead, so we’re not out of the woods yet. The forecast calls for 4-7 hurricanes, of which up to two could become major ones with winds of Category 3 or greater strength. All told, NOAA is forecasting there will be 9-13 named storms. That includes tropical storms, hurricanes’ weaker sibling (though they can still dump copious amounts of rain). Overall, forecasters give this season 60 percent odds of being less active than usual, a huge uptick from the 25 percent forecast issued in May. Saharan dust has played a role in tamping down activity, as have cooler-than-normal waters in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms and hurricanes tend to form. But the biggest reason forecasters think this year could be quiet is the creeping presence of an El Niño, which is characterized by warm waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Those warm waters kickstart a series of changes in the atmosphere, including powerful upper level winds that cut across the Atlantic hurricane basin and tear storms apart or prevent them from spinning up at all. Some storm systems will inevitably defy the odds, though, which is why forecasters continue to urge anyone living near the coast to stay vigilant. “There are still more storms to come—the hurricane season is far from being over,” Gerry Bell, NOAA’s lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said in a statement. This Atlantic hurricane season has been a bit of a weird one so far. It started a few days early when a subtropical storm (yet another flavor of hurricane-like weather) formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Said storm then turned tropical as it passed over land and basically made landfall again on the Great Lakes, all of which is extremely not normal. Three other storms have formed including tiny ass Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the season. The lower odds of a season of horrors like last year are a welcome forecast if ever there was one even with the statistical peak of hurricane season still ahead and the official end months away.","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought.

Tom Nardi,"Everyone knows that space is an incredibly inhospitable place, but the surface of Mars isn’t a whole lot better. It’s a dim, cold, and dry world, with a wisp of an atmosphere that provides less than 1% of Earth’s barometric pressure. As the planet’s core no longer provides it with a magnetosphere, cosmic rays and intense solar flares bathe the surface in radiation. Human life on the surface without adequate environmental shielding is impossible, and as NASA’s fleet of rovers can attest, robotic visitors to the planet aren’t completely immune to the planet’s challenges. Opportunity rover on Mars As a planet-wide dust storm finally begins to settle, NASA is desperately trying to find out if the Red Planet has claimed yet another victim. The agency hasn’t heard from the Opportunity rover, which landed on Mars in 2004, since before the storm started on June 10th; and with each passing day the chances of reestablishing contact are diminished. While they haven’t completely given up hope, there’s no question this is the greatest threat the go-kart sized rover has faced in the nearly 15 years it has spent on the surface. Opportunity was designed with several autonomous fail-safe systems that should have activated during the storm, protecting the rover as much as possible. But even with these systems in place, its twin Spirit succumbed to similar conditions in 2010. Will Opportunity make it through this latest challenge? Or has this global weather event brought the long-running mission to a dramatic close? A Fair-Weather Rover Conditions on the surface of Mars were fairly well understood even before Viking 1 touched down on the surface in 1976. Due to the fact that the surface of Mars only receives around 40% of the sunlight that Earth does, early missions used radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) to provide power rather than relying on the inefficient solar panels of the era. Unfortunately Opportunity does not have an RTG and must rely on solar to recharge batteries. But even as solar panels got smaller and more efficient in time for later missions to Mars, the constant accumulation of dust on them meant they would provide less energy over time. Accordingly, anything that uses solar panels on Mars needs to be designed with certain safeguards if it’s to have any chance of surviving. When the Opportunity and Spirit rovers were being designed, the possibility of them experiencing long periods of darkness was anticipated. When the rover detects that the batteries are running low and the solar panels are not producing enough energy to recharge them, it will trigger a low-power fault. This causes the rover to shut down systems and go into a “hibernation” mode until such time that the solar panels begin producing power again. This mode is sufficient to protect the rover during the occasional dust storms that kick up on Mars, but this is no regular dust storm. View of dust storm from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Unprecedented Event NASA knows that Opportunity would have put itself into hibernation shortly after the storm started, sometime in the middle of June. This would be expected behavior, and normally once the storm cleared and the panels started receiving sunlight, the rover would resume normal operations. But at this point the rover has been in darkness for so long that NASA theorizes the batteries are at or near zero, meaning all systems have completely shut down. This complicates matters, but still doesn’t mean Opportunity is unrecoverable. Eventually, enough sunlight should hit the panels that the system will power itself back up. But the time spent with no power will have caused the onboard clock to reset. If this happens, the rover will attempt to use the Martian sunrise and sunset to get a basic sense of time. The reality of this scenario is that the scheduled transmissions from Opportunity won’t be happening when NASA expects them. It will take very careful observations with the Deep Space Network to try to pick up a transmission from Opportunity if NASA doesn’t know when it’s going to happen. Even worse, after enough time has passed without contact from Earth, the rover will begin doubting itself. Eventually an “uploss” fault will be registered, which will trigger Opportunity to begin going through diagnostics of its communication systems and attempt to use alternate modes of transmission. This will make it even harder to receive the rover’s call home, as NASA won’t know when or even how it will be made. An Uncertain Future Unless its been literally buried during the storm, NASA is confident that Opportunity will wake up once light levels have returned to their seasonal normal. Receiving its signal may prove difficult, but with the agency’s resources on Earth and in Mars orbit, it’s not necessarily a mission-ending challenge. Granted this is about as close to a worst case as things can get, but that’s never stopped NASA before. Though even if everything goes right, and NASA is able to reestablish two-way communication with Opportunity, the rover may have received a fatal blow. There is growing concern that such an unprecedented deep discharge combined with the frigid temperatures during the storm may have had a negative effect on the rover’s lithium-ion batteries. If the capacity of the battery banks have been diminished, they may no longer be able to run mission critical systems. There’s especially concern about running the rover’s onboard heaters during the upcoming Martian winter. Unmitigated Success Opportunity is currently the longest running Mars rover, outlasting its original mission lifetime nearly 60 times over. Even if it never wakes up, or if it only returns to a partially functional state, the mission will still go down in history as one of the most successful interplanetary explorations ever conducted. In that light, the potential loss of Opportunity should not be thought of as a disappointment. If anything, the fact that Mars had to throw everything it had at the veteran rover to knock it out of commission is perhaps a fitting retirement. In any event, science will continue on the surface of Mars. The larger and more modern Curiosity rover uses an evolved version of the RTG technology that powered the Viking landers, and as such has been able to work through the storm. Before the end of the year it will be joined by the InSight lander, and depending on who you believe, we might have boots on the ground within a decade. It’s a very exciting time for Mars exploration, and no matter what happens, Opportunity will forever be remembered as an important milestone on humanity’s journey to the Red Planet.","Everyone knows that space is an incredibly inhospitable place, but the surface of Mars isn’t a whole lot better.

Opportunity lost.
NASA has officially declared an end to the mission of the six-wheeled rover on Mars. Opportunity lost power in a dust storm last June, and all efforts to make contact have failed.
The plucky robot operated on the red planet for more than 14 years an astonishing achievement, given that the mission was technically supposed to last only 90 days. The rover drove more than 25 miles, returned thousands of pictures and changed the way scientists think about Mars.
On landing day in January 2004, scientists were positively giddy about what they saw in the first pictures Opportunity sent after touching down at Meridiani Planum.
""I will attempt no science analysis because it looks like nothing I've ever seen before in my life,"" rover principle investigator Steven W. Squyres said during a news conference at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., shortly after landing. ""We knew, going into this, at a fine scale the texture of Meridiani Planum was unlike almost anything else on Mars. As we had expected ...""
Squyres stopped mid-sentence to gawk at a new picture of the landing site that had just appeared on a monitor screen. 
""Holy smokes,"" he exclaimed. ""I'm sorry, I'm just blown away by this.""
In the weeks, then months, then years following landing, Squyres appeared at numerous news conferences to talk about the rover's scientific discoveries. Asked last summer to share two of his favorites, he said, ""OK, I'll give you two. The first was right at the beginning at the landing site.""
That's when Opportunity found evidence that briny water once sloshed around on the surface of what is now a very dry planet.
The second ""was years and years later [when] we got to the rim of a very ancient crater,"" Squyres said. The robot found evidence of what's called hydrothermal events in which hot water percolates through rocks and changes their mineral content. 
But last summer, the planet that gave up so many of its secrets smothered the rover. 
An artist's concept shows a NASA Mars Exploration Rover on the surface of Mars. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity were launched in 2003 and arrived at sites on Mars in January 2004.
NASA/JPL-Caltech
On May 30, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted a dust storm heading toward Opportunity's location near the equator. Over the next few days, the enormous storm swirled over the entire planet, covering Opportunity's solar panels with dust. 
""The storm is one of the most intense ever observed on the Red Planet. As of June 10, it covered more than 15.8 million square miles (41 million square kilometers) about the area of North America and Russia combined,"" NASA said at the time. ""It has blocked out so much sunlight, it has effectively turned day into night for Opportunity, which is located near the center of the storm, inside Mars' Perseverance Valley.""
Her power dropped to a trickle, and she was last heard from on June 10.
(Opportunity's twin, a rover named Spirit that landed three weeks earlier on the other side of the planet, met a similar cold and dark fate. Spirit explored for more than five years before getting stuck in the sand, its solar-powered batteries draining until the robot fell silent.)
""I made the decision to declare a spacecraft emergency because there wasn't enough energy for the rover to sustain activities,"" John Callas, Opportunity's project manager, told NPR. 
""Prior to this storm, the vehicle was in, actually, remarkably good health,"" Callas said.
Mission managers weren't exactly sure what was wrong with the rover. Opportunity survived a planet-wide dust storm in 2007 but this time, with so little power, the rover might not have been able to protect electronic instruments from damage during the cold Martian nights.
 Instead of waiting for the rover to wake up on its own, managers have spent the past several months pinging Opportunity with commands. But she remained silent and still in Perseverance Valley.
On Tuesday, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that there would be one final attempt to ping the rover.
Keri Bean was among those who helped send that last radio signal. Losing Opportunity, she says, is like a death in the family.
Bean was in high school when she saw a documentary about Opportunity called Roving Mars. ""I especially remember them showing the landing footage,"" she says. ""And when they got the confirmation the spacecraft landed they were all cheering, they were so excited. And I was really drawn to the idea of exploring and being so interested and caring about something that much.""
Bean went to graduate school at Texas A&amp;M University where she worked on the rover as a student, and ultimately landed a job at JPL where she joined the Opportunity mission team. She says losing the rover is like a death in the family.
""Me, personally, it's been really hard because this is a project I've worked on for over a third of my life at this point,"" Bean says. ""And so just to lose that all of a sudden is really tough. But at least it was Mars that killed her it wasn't the rover failing or something else. It was Mars. And I feel like that's really the only appropriate death for her at this point.""
NASA still has one rover operating on Mars. Curiosity landed in 2012 and is currently climbing up Mount Sharp, a three-mile-high mound in the middle of Gale Crater. Curiosity is nuclear powered, so dust storms don't interfere with its power supply.

Megan Molteni,"For the last two days, a colossal, coursing stream of super-soaked subtropical air has been pummeling California with record-shattering amounts of moisture. On Wednesday, parts of northern California received more snow in a day than New England cities like Boston have seen all winter. On Thursday, Palm Springs got eight months worth of rain in as many hours. In San Diego and Los Angeles, brown water thick with desert dust flooded streets, triggered mudslides, and opened up sinkholes.
The 300-mile-wide, 1,000-mile-long atmospheric river that carried all this precipitation is starting to dry up, and the worst of the drench-fest is over. But all the new rainfall records highlight the fact that atmospheric rivers, while long a distinctive feature of weather in the American West, are intensifying in a climate-changed world.
Data from NOAA satellites shows an atmospheric river pummeling the California coast.
If you havent heard the phrase atmospheric river before, dont feel too bad. Its a meteorological term of art that hasnt yet cracked the pop cultural lexicon, unlike some of its flashier cousinsthe polar vortex, bomb cyclone, and fire clouds, to name a few. Even the American Meteorological Society only added a definition for atmospheric river to its glossary last year.
The phenomenon itself isnt a new one: For a long time its been pretty normal for California to receive most of its yearly precipitation in just a few big storms. Most of those multi-day deluges are the product of atmospheric rivers, high-altitude streams of air that originate near the Equator and are packed with water vapor. But its only been in the last decade or so that scientists have learned enough about this type of weather system to tell the difference between the beneficial, run-of-the-mill storms that keep water reserves full and the disastrous ones that overwhelm dams, levees, and reservoirs, like the one that pummeled California this week. As that balancing act gets even tougher for the regions water managers, some scientists are making a push to put a number on those differences, in the same way you would a tornado or a hurricane.
Your typical weather forecast displays a symbola sun for sunny days, a cloud for cloudy days. But the rain cloud symbol doesnt really describe if its going to be a few showers or one of these more unusually substantial storms, says F. Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography and director of its Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. Hes been spearheading a multi-year effort to develop a five-category scale for diagnosing the strength of atmospheric rivers so that water managers, emergency personnel, and the general public can quickly get a grasp on just how destructive (or beneficial) the next storm will be.
Ralphs team unveiled their AR Cat scale earlier this month, in an article published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The key feature it uses to assess the severity of such storms is the amount of water vapor flowing horizontally in the air. Called integrated vapor transport, or IVT, this number tells you how much fuel is feeding the system.
Its not an easy number to calculate. To do it well requires taking multiple wind and water vapor measurements across miles of atmosphere. In the same way that terrestrial rivers flow at different rates at different depths, the water vapor molecules in atmospheric rivers travel at different speeds in the air column. Adding them all up vertically gives you the true measure of how strong a storm really is. Ralphs team classifies storms as atmospheric rivers if theyre moving more than 250 kilograms of water per meter per second, ranging up from weak to moderate, strong, extreme, and exceptional.
But strength alone doesnt predict how dangerous a storm will be. Thats why the AR Cat scale combines a storms IVT with how long its expected to linger. Storms that blow through in fewer than 24 hours get downgraded by one category, whereas storms that last longer than 48 hours immediately get bumped up a notch. So an extreme storm could be either a Cat 3 (balance of beneficial and hazardous), Cat 4 (mostly hazardous), or Cat 5 (hazardous) depending on what it does once it makes landfall.
Thats because the longer a storm hovers over land, funneling many Mississippi Rivers worth of moisture into its watersheds, the more strain it puts on those systems. The most destructive hurricanes in recent memoryHarvey in Texas and Florence in North Carolinaproved so catastrophic because they stalled over land, inundating those areas with multiple days of intense rainfall. But the current hurricane scales, which are based on wind speed, dont take time into account. With atmospheric rivers we had the opportunity to bake those numbers in from the very beginning, says Ralph.
The AR Cat scale is, of course, only as reliable as the forecast model its built upon. And accurately predicting atmospheric rivers has long buggered meteorological researchers. Models built on satellite data regularly flub the location of landfall by 250 miles even when the storm is just three days out. Some of that data got a signal boost this week, as GOES-17, NOAAs next-generation satellite, became operational over the western part of the United States.
GOES-17s powerful new camera will fill in important gaps, especially over the Pacific Ocean, where coverage was previously sparse. It was like watching a black-and-white television, and now we have full HD, says Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services Bay Area station. The new satellite also refreshes data at a much higher ratetaking a new image once every five minutes as opposed to every ten or 15. In special circumstances, NWS forecasters can request to crank it up one notch further. On Thursday, when Rowes office was busy trying to predict where the California storm would go next, GOES-17 was snapping and sending images once every minute.
But according to Ralph, the new satellites not a complete fix for atmospheric river forecasting, because high clouds can mask whats going on inside the storm. More fruitful are the regular reconnaissance missions Ralph has been coordinating for the last three years, sending US Air Force pilots in hurricane hunter airplanes to crisscross incoming streams of hot, wet air. At regular intervals they drop meteorological sensing devices known as dropsondes, which draw a more intimate portrait of eachs storms potential for precipitation.
Its all part of a broader effort to help stewards of the regions freshwater resources make better decisions about whether to keep water and risk a flooding event, or let it out ahead of the storm and risk it being a bust. The AR Cat scale, which Ralph says still needs some tuning to better articulate the risks and benefits of different kinds of storms, is aimed at making those decisions for reservoir operators as easy as one, two, three, four, five.
Knowing that a storm like the one that hit this week is a Cat 4 atmospheric river may not mean much to the average person just yet. Calibrating an arbitrary value to observed reality takes time and experience. But its a sign of the American Wests intensifying weather patterns that its residents need that language at all.

BeauHD,"Opportunity hasn't made a peep since June 10, when dust in the Red Planet's air got so thick that the solar-powered rover couldn't recharge its batteries. Opportunity's handlers think the six-wheeled robot has put itself into a sort of hibernation, and they still hope to get a ping once the dust storm has petered out. And there are good reasons for this optimism, NASA officials said. ""Because the batteries were in relatively good health before the storm, there's not likely to be too much degradation,"" NASA officials wrote in an Opportunity update Thursday (Aug. 16). ""And because dust storms tend to warm the environment -- and the 2018 storm happened as Opportunity's location on Mars entered summer -- the rover should have stayed warm enough to survive."" Engineers are trying to communicate with Opportunity several times a week using NASA's Deep Space Network, a system of big radio dishes around the globe.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

The robot rover has gone to sleep because its solar panels are unable to provide or recharge its batteries. But NASA's other Martian rover, Curiosity, is nuclear powered and is mostly unaffected by the dust storm. For NASA's scientists, Curiosity can offer an unprecedented chance to answer why some Martian dust storms last for months and grow massive, while others are small and last only a week.

Scientists are 'very concerned' The dust storm is the biggest on Mars since 2007. Martian dust storms are common, especially during the planet's spring and summer, when it is closest to the sun, NASA said. As the atmosphere warms, winds generated at different locations mobilize dust particles the size of talcum powder grains, according to NASA. The storms typically stay contained to one area on the planet. Guzewich said the current storm would cover an area larger than North America and Russia combined. Scientists have been tracking dust storms on Mars for more than a century, using telescopes and spacecraft orbiting the red planet. Sometimes the storms are so intense and kick up enough dust that they can be seen by telescopes on Earth.

Kellen Beck,"Early in December, Fortnite developer Epic Games launched an online video game store. On Friday, voice and text chat app Discord revealed it will launch its own online store in 2019. Both companies are undoubtedly aiming to take on Steam, and the way that they're doing that could mean great things for everybody. Well, everybody except Steam. SEE ALSO: The best video games of 2018 Steam, developer by Valve Corporation, has been the dominant digital marketplace for video games for over a decade, and since it first began offering third-party developers to sell games on its platform in 2005, it has basically had no competition. Thus, Steam has been able to operate on the precedent that it takes 30% of revenue of all sales, because they are publishing the games after all, only recently announcing they'd drop their share down a bit if games make tens of millions of dollars (which is not super common outside of the biggest games of the year). The Epic Games store and future Discord games store are questioning that 70/30 split, offering developers much more attractive splits. Epic Games laid out in a blog post that it would offer developers who use Unreal Engine 4 (its own engine for developers) or Unity (a very popular game engine) a more generous 88/12 split, meaning Epic Games would only take 12% of generated revenue. Meanwhile, Discord took a look at the numbers and thought it could do better, proposing a game store that would only take 10% of revenue, leaving developers with an unheard of 90% of revenue. Discord suggests that it could push that 10% number even lower with further technology optimization. This is some heavy competition for Steam, which has been the go-to marketplace for PC games for what feels like forever. While developer-specific platforms like Activision Blizzard's Battle.net, Ubisoft's Unity, and Mircrosoft's Windows game store have certainly cut into Steam's potential profits, they've never really had to deal with something like what Epic Games and Discord are doing. A little competition like this is great for developers The Epic Games store has already nabbed some decent partners, including getting Ashen and Super Meat Boy Forever ahead of Steam. It's no wonder why, really, when developers get to make more money per sale with Epic Games. The worry for some developers with going on Epic Games' store is that it just doesn't have the audience that Steam has. Luckily, Epic Games already has a decent PC audience thanks to the popularity of Fortnite, so it's not exactly lost in the fog. Discord has the potential to be even more disruptive because it already has almost 200 million users, which is a whole lot of people. Meanwhile, in early 2018 Steam had 125 million registered users. If Discord manages to get some exclusives with big games in 2019, it could really cut into Steam's market. SEE ALSO: The US Army is forming a 'Fortnite' team to help with recruitment To combat this, Steam will likely have to give developers a better deal than what they're currently getting. While some users harbor loyalty to Steam, they'll surely buy games through Discord or the Epic Games store if that's the only place they can get them. A little competition like this is great for developers, especially in the indie space where people may not have the support systems (read: salaries) that developers at large corporations have. This competition could also lead to more sales, which is great for the folks who are spending their money through these stores. Although unlikely, there's the possibility that Steam does absolutely nothing and gamers slowly drift away to better platforms, leaving Steam in the dust. But realistically, Steam isn't going down without a fight. 2019 should be an interesting year for the PC gaming marketplace.","Early in December, Fortnite developer Epic Games launched an online video game store.

Chelsea Gohd Space.com Staff Writer,"As an intense dust storm rages on Mars, many are wondering — how bad can a Martian storm really be? Tuesday (June 12), NASA's Opportunity rover stopped communications amid a severe dust storm on the Red Planet. But while the storm hasn't killed the rover yet — Opportunity could still revive once the skies clear — how dangerous can storms on Mars get? For fans of ""The Martian"" novel by Andy Weir, or the film based on that book, the answer may be a disappointment. Storms on Mars aren't quite as dramatic as the book or the film adaptation portray them to be. While Martian winds at the planet's surface can reach up to about 60 mph (about 97 km/h), this is less than half the speed of some hurricane winds here on Earth and probably not strong enough to rip apart or tip any major equipment, NASA officials said in a statement. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: How It Grew &amp; What It Means for Opportunity ] However, even when winds on the Red Planet reach their highest speeds, wind on Mars isn't quite as powerful as it is on Earth. ""Mars' atmospheric pressure is a lot less [than Earth's]. So, things get blown [around], but it's not with the same intensity,"" William Farrell, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in the statement. So, ""The Martian"" film accurately shows Mark Watney sweeping dust off of his solar panels every day, because Martian dust particles accumulate and stick easily because they're slightly electrostatic. But dust storms on Mars aren't as powerful as they might seem based on the movie. Still, Martian storms still could pose risks to humans. In a special NASA teleconference on June 13, researchers said that, while Mars' atmosphere is thin, there is still dust being raised. This could hypothetically complicate regular functioning and visibility for future crewed missions. Additionally, dust storms create ""sort of a greenhouse effect in which the radiation that otherwise would be lost to space is trapped,"" heating up the planet, Rich Zurek, Mars Program Office chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in the conference. Humans on the Martian surface will already have to contend with radiation, and this effect will only increase the risk. Plus, Martian storms can grow to epic scale: The researchers said the current storm is expanding and could potentially stretch across the entire planet, which humans have seen happen on Mars before. So, a Martian dust storm likely won't strand any future space colonists or rip any antennas off of equipment, like what happened in ""The Martian."" Instead, the dangers to humans would more likely range from radiation to dust accumulation (because of the static electricity), or possibly less-dramatic risks associated with winds, researchers said in the conference. Solar-powered tech will also continue to struggle against the dust that sticks to solar panels on rovers like Opportunity. NASA is already seriously considering these potential threats to future space explorers. ""We really need to understand these storms to the degree that we can have some level of forecasting ability,"" Jim Watzin, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., said in the conference. So, it turns out that dust storms on Mars aren't as cinematically dramatic as fans of ""The Martian"" may have thought. Still, NASA is working to protect future crewed missions from the dangers that may arise from Martian weather.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"NASA declared at a press conference today that its Opportunity rover is officially no longer functional, marking the end of an era while celebrating the wildly successful Mars Exploration Rover mission. 
The Mars Exploration Rover team made its final, unsuccessful attempt to reach the Opportunity rover last night. 
Scientists, science communicators, and science fans have being posting on Twitter about their favorite memories of the rover and the nearly 15 years it spent exploring Mars. NASA last heard from Opportunity on June 10, 2018, after a dust storm encircled the planet, blocking the rovers solar panels.
NASA researchers held out, attempting to ping the rover hundreds of times and listening over the radio waves hoping to hear its signal once again. But there was no response. 
The rover, along with its partner, Spirit, landed on Mars in 2004 as part of the Mars Exploration Rover mission. The two rovers far exceeded their expected 90-day lifespans, exploring the rocks and atmosphere of the Red Planet to reveal its history. Together, they found evidence that Mars was once a wet world that could have had the ingredients for life on its surface. In the meantime, they took loads of images of the planet that helped shape the publics view Mars. Spirit met its end in 2010.
We have a tendency to get attached to the spacecraft we send out, not because we care so much about the hardware itself but because they represent large teams of hard-working individuals pushing human knowledge to places its never been before. These missions and the people working to keep them operating come with an important legacy of discovery and each represents a milestone in space exploration. Its sad to see projects like these end.
This isnt the end of Mars exploration, of course. Martian science has pushed onward. The ExoMars and Mars 2020 missions will add two more rovers to the Red Planet. The InSight lander has only just arrived on Mars surface and has successfullydeployed its instruments for measuring the interior of the planet. Curiosity survived the tempest, and theres still banks of data from the rovers for scientists to analyze. And, as some of the scientists weve spoken to have intimated, there arent many more noble ways to go than to perish in one of the largest Martian dust storms on record after enduring for 14 years longer than you were supposed to.

Eric Mack,"A Leonid caught via time-lapse. NASA One of the most potentially exciting meteor showers of the year is here and ready to put on a free show as the Leonids hit their peak Saturday and Sunday. The Leonid meteor shower has been known to very rarely blow up into a meteor storm, when the number of ""shooting stars"" that can be seen skyrockets from one or two dozen per hour to as many as thousands per hour. The last time the Leonids erupted into a major storm was in 2001 and then again in 2002, and there's grainy home video footage to prove it: One account from the 1966 Leonid storm described seeing ""dozens of meteors every second... the effect was similar to watching snowflakes race at your windshield while driving in a snowstorm."" The Leonids occur every year around this time when the Earth drifts through the cloud of dust and debris left behind by the comet Tempel-Tuttle on its trips around the sun. The outbursts occur when our planet hits a particularly dense pocket of comet detritus. While a meteor storm isn't predicted for this year's Leonids, it is possible we could sneak up on an undetected pocket of dense dust that quickly goes up in flames in our atmosphere, putting on quite a show in the process. Even without a major meteor outburst, the Leonids can typically produce 15-25 shooting stars or fireballs per hour in a year, if you can find clear skies away from light pollution. ""The Leonids are often bright meteors with a high percentage of persistent trains,"" according to the American Meteor Society. You don't have to stare at a particular patch of sky to witness the meteors. It's better to find a spot with as broad a view of the night sky as possible, lay back, let your eyes adjust to the darkness and just look up.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"As we remember the now-officially-dead Opportunity rover this week, one fact keeps sticking out to me: That machine traveled a whopping 28 miles across the surface of another planet. And it did so in short, nerve-wracking spurts. Spread over the course of 14 years, 28 miles may not sound like that much, but consider the many obstacles Oppy facedincluding an agonizing 38 days stuck spinning its wheels in a soft sand dune.
Opportunity traveled exactly 28.06 miles (45.16 kilometers) during its time on the Martian surface. Thats more than the distance traveled by the Apollo 17 lunar rover (22.2 miles), the Soviet Lunokhod 2 rover (24 miles), the Curiosity rover (12.3 miles), or Opportunitys partner, the Spirit rover (4.8 miles). Along the way, it took images of vast planes, sandy dunes, and cratersand it found evidence of water on the Red Planet.
Its not easy to drive a rover across Mars. Engineers cant control it in real time, given the 20-minute communication delay between the planets. If Oppy started to slide toward a cliff, for example, engineers wouldnt be able to send commands to stop it until it was too late. So they have to send commands to move a short distance, take new data, reassess, and then send fresh commands. As NASA describes on an informational page, moving Oppy is a painstaking process. 
The rover and its team also overcame many technical malfunctions related to steering, heaters, and onboard memory. Vicious dust storms threatened the rover, covering its solar panels with debris and depriving it of its power source.
Perhaps the best example of the challenges faced by Oppy was the 38 Martian days it spent stuck in a dune, unable to get the traction needed to push out of the soft sand. After more than 629 feets worth of carefully planned wheel rotations, the team was finally able to push the rover out and continue its journey onward.
In the end, what finally defeated the rover was not a sand dune but a massive Martian dust storm. Nonetheless, the mission was a wild success that revolutionized our understand of Mars. During its lengthy travels, Opportunity captured a wide variety of strange and wonderful images on the Red Planet. Below, Ive collected some of my favorite postcards from Oppys great adventure.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"InSight is not a first. Its the eighth successful landing on Mars since 1976, when Viking 1 became the first spacecraft to land and work on the planet, and the 45th exploratory mission of any kind since 1960. Currently, the NASA rover Curiosity is on Mars rolling around on its six aluminum wheels searching for evidence of once-upon-a-time life; another, Opportunity, went into hibernation during a dust storm in June and may never awaken. But each mission is different, facing different dangers and different challenges. InSights landing alone was an extraordinary feat, as the craft had to slow down from 12,300 miles per hour to about 5 m.p.h. at a precise 12 degree angle, all within what scientists and engineers have dubbed seven minutes of terror, to land on the Elysium Planitia. The landing was monitored by two mini-spacecraft, each about the size of a briefcase, whose flight was a cosmic first of its own. Unlike the mobile landers, InSight Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport is meant to stay in one spot and deploy instruments to measure marsquakes (yes, on Earth theyre earthquakes) in order to learn about whats going on in the innards of the planet. One gizmo will take Marss temperature by hammering itself 16 feet below the surface. Deploying the instruments alone is expected to take two months, and the entire mission is meant to last a Martian year, roughly two Earth years. What for? A random sampling of comments from the public suggests not everyone is convinced that digging on Mars is money well spent. But the basic answer is that whether its practical or not, humans will continue to explore the heavens so long as the moon, Mars and the myriad celestial bodies beyond fire our imagination and curiosity. What happened in the earliest days of the universe? How were Earth and its fellow planets formed? And the question of questions: Is there life out there? Mars may not have all the answers, but for now its the most accessible other planet for detailed studies. And unlike on Earth, on Mars surface evidence of how our solar system was formed has not been totally eroded away. And life! Earlier rovers found evidence of water; NASAs coming Mars 2020 mission will have even finer tools to search for ancient biology.

Shannon Stirone,"Space, youre such a mysterious mess. Science has barely begun to explore a universe brimming with befuddling objects, planets, and galaxies. Youve got imploding stars that blow away everything around them, and others that balloon out in a relatively quiet death. For this weeks space journey, were examining some new and strange placesplus one weve been looking at our entire lives.
Humans last stepped foot on the moon in 1972, as part of the Apollo 17 mission. That mission included Harrison Schmitt, the first geologist to ever walk on the lunar surface. Schmitt and the crew brought home 800 grams of lunar rocks, but not all of these samples were available for research. NASA saved them until new technology could be developed that would yield more advanced scientific results. Just this week, NASA announced it would crack open some of the last sample containers for scientists. We might run out of rocks before weve answered all the questions we have about the moon, but at least we know where to go if we need more.
Over on Mars, were not sure what to make of a bizarre feature called brain terrain, similar in appearance to the gray matter in our heads. Ice underground may be skipping the liquid stage and sublimating straight to its gas phase, but if that were happening, wed be seeing changes in the landscape, and scientists cant detect any. What a brainteaser!
Were not done with the red planet yet: We now can see the final image the beloved Opportunity rover took before powering down for good. The rovers mission came to an end last summer after a massive dust storm darkened the Martian skies, robbing Opportunity of sunlight. This panorama shows Perseverance Valley, the rovers final resting place.
Speaking of going out with a bang, we visit two galaxies that have spent the past several million years colliding with each other. Once their stars realign, they will become one single galaxy for future telescopes to gaze atorder out of seeming chaos.

Matthew S. Schwartz,"A massive spring storm is bringing blizzard conditions to several central U.S. states, leading officials to close hundreds of schools and hundreds of miles of roads.
NASA/NOAA GOES Project
Interstates were closed for hundreds of miles in the Midwest and Plains Thursday, as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought a major winter storm to states in those regions. Some towns that just days ago were experiencing sunshine and temperate weather are now under one or two feet of snow.
Most of Nebraska and South Dakota remained under a blizzard warning Thursday afternoon, as snow continued to cause dangerous conditions. Minnesota, Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Upper Peninsula face a winter storm warning. Eastern North Dakota is under a flood warning.
Parts of South Dakota have seen up to 18 inches of snow, and ""thunder snow"" snow that falls alongside the crash of thunder and the flash of lightning was also reported in the central part of the state. ""It's essentially a thunderstorm, but it's cold enough for snow,"" Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist, told the Associated Press.
Minnesota has faced snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Hundreds of schools canceled classes Thursday. More than 200 accidents were reported throughout the state. A video from the Minnesota Department of Transportation shows every power line down along a strength of Highway 59 near Fulda, in the southeastern side of the state.
In Minnesota, the bad weather will continue through Friday, with winds gusting more than to 50, according to the National Weather Service.
Some of the snow might be tinted orange, the Twin Cities NWS said. ""The color is likely due to dust that was blown by high winds all the way from west Texas.""
Whiteout conditions were reported Wednesday night northeast of Denver to the Nebraska state line, Colorado Public Radio reported. Some major roads were closed for hundreds of miles because of poor visibility and blowing snow. Colorado DOT closed 150 miles of Interstate 76, and Interstate 70 was closed between Kansas and the Denver metro area, CPR said.
In Nebraska, Interstate 80 and Highway 30 were closed on Thursday morning between Lexington and Wyoming a distance of about 200 miles.
AS NPR's Bill Chappell reported, ""the storm came ashore from the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and floods to Oregon"" and leading to evacuations there.

Melissa Locker,"NASA’s Opportunity rover just celebrated its 15th anniversary on the surface of Mars today, but no one sent it a Hallmark card. That’s because no one has heard from the little robot since a dust storm enveloped the red planet back in June. The rover, which landed in a region of Mars called Meridiani Planum on January 24, 2004, was powered by solar panels. However, it’s believed the storm sent so much dust flying that Opportunity’s solar panels were soon covered and it couldn’t power its batteries.Opportunity’s last communication with Earth was received way back on June 10, 2018, and NASA has given up trying to contact the rover. However, according to NASA, they haven’t entirely given up hope. Engineers at JPL are still sending commands to the rover and hoping that someday they will hear a signal back, so they can attempt a recovery.
“This anniversary cannot help but be a little bittersweet as at present we don’t know the rover’s status,” said John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We are doing everything in our power to communicate with Opportunity, but as time goes on, the probability of a successful contact with the rover continues to diminish.”

Catie Keck,"NASA has had quite a bit on its plate recently between its Hubble Space Telescope entering safe mode, the prolonged silence from its Opportunity rover, and a technical issue with its Curiosity rover on Mars. But one bright spot appears to be the return of some science operations by Curiosity following a memory anomaly last month. While its not totally back up to full operations, Curiosity will be able to transmit data to its team while they work on its recovery. Sharing the news in an enthusiastic post on NASAs website on Friday, the Curiosity team announced that it had made progress on diagnosing an anomaly that occurred in mid-September. After its engineers switched the rover back to its A-side computer, the Mars explorer was able to send back an image of the Martian surface at Vera Rubin Ridge utilizing a camera it hasnt used since 2013. Thanks to our hard-working engineers, Curiosity is ready for limited science operations while the anomaly work continues, NASA said. Curiosity, which explores the planets Gale crater, is currently using its A-side computer until the team is able to determine the cause of its glitch. The rover swapped to the B-side of its two redundant computers after its A-side became corrupted back in 2013, about 200 days into its mission. Earlier this month, engineers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory commanded the rover to switch brains in order to allow the Curiosity team to do a full diagnosis of the issue that had been affecting its memory since September 15. We spent the last week checking out Side A and preparing it for the swap, Steven Lee, Curiositys deputy project manager, said in a statement at the time. Its certainly possible to run the mission on the Side-A computer if we really need to. But our plan is to switch back to Side B as soon as we can fix the problem to utilize its larger memory size. The car-sized Martian rover was launch in 2012 as part of NASAs Mars Science Laboratory mission. It had a busy couple of months just before its glitch, taking a Martian selfie in September and finding 3.5-billion-year-old organic compounds in June. Earlier this year, it captured a stunning panorama of Mars from the top of Vera Rubin Ridge. Answering questions from its followers on Twitter, the Curiosity team also tweeted Wednesday that there is currently no update on the Opportunity rover (or Oppy, to which its often affectionately referred), which powered down in June in Mars Perseverance Valley after getting swept up in a massive dust storm that may have blocked its solar panels with dust. In response to questions about Opportunitys status, the Curiosity team pointed to the Red Planets upcoming windy season as a potential fix, as NASA said last week it hopes the wind may be able to clear the dust from its panels to help it get charged and back up and running, if that is indeed the issue.","NASA has had quite a bit on its plate recently between its Hubble Space Telescope entering safe mode, the prolonged silence from its Opportunity rover, and a technical issue with its Curiosity rover on Mars.

Marcia Dunn / AP,"(CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.) — NASA’s seemingly unstoppable Mars rover Opportunity has been knocked out by a gigantic dust storm that is enveloping the red planet and blotting out the sun. Officials said Wednesday they’re hopeful the rover will survive the storm, which already covers one-quarter of Mars and is expected to encircle the planet in another few days. It could be weeks or even months, though, until the sky clears enough for sunlight to reach the Martian surface and recharge Opportunity’s batteries through its solar panels. For now, Mars’ oldest working rover is stuck in the middle of the raging storm, in round-the-clock darkness. “By no means are we out of the woods here,” said John Callas, the Opportunity project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “This storm is threatening, and we don’t know how long it will last, and we don’t know what the environment will be like once it clears.” Flight controllers tried late Tuesday night to contact Opportunity, but the rover did not respond. The storm has been growing since the end of May with unprecedented speed. NASA launched the twin rovers Opportunity and Spirit in 2003 to study Martian rocks and soil. They landed in 2004. Spirit hasn’t worked for several years. Opportunity, however, has kept exploring well past its expected mission lifetime. Scientists aren’t nearly as concerned about the newer, nuclear-powered Curiosity rover on the other side of Mars, which is already seeing darkening skies. Dust storms crop up every so often at Mars, sending dust tens of miles (kilometers) into the atmosphere and turning day into night. Spacecraft orbiting Mars are too high to be affected. There’s no chance of Opportunity being buried or getting a wheel stuck in dust. Even in the worst of storms, only a layer of fine dust is left behind. Managers said the main concern is that dust could temporarily cover its optical instruments. The rover’s batteries are likely so low that only a clock is still working, to wake the spacecraft for periodic power-level checks, according to officials. If the clock also goes offline, then the rover won’t know what time it is when it comes back on and could send back signals at any time. This isn’t Opportunity’s first major brush with dust. In 2007, a massive dust storm kept Opportunity silent for a few days. It jumped back into action after awakening from its deep self-protecting slumber. This time, the rover’s energy level is believed to be much lower. On the plus side, Martian summertime is approaching and that should keep temperatures up at night and prevent the batteries and other parts from freezing. Besides electrical heaters, Opportunity is equipped with eight tiny plutonium-powered heaters. Scientists are eager to learn as much as they can about the dust storm to hone their weather forecasting skills. Astronauts living on Mars, for instance, wouldn’t want to get caught outside in a fierce dust storm, where winds can reach 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) — almost hurricane force. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that while the wind can lift dust off the surface, it doesn’t topple a spacecraft. Opportunity was in remarkably good health going into the storm, Callas said, with only an arthritic joint in its robotic arm. “Keep in mind, we’re talking about a rover that’s been working at Mars, hanging in there, for 15 years and designed just for 90 days,” said Jim Watzin, director of NASA’s Mars exploration program. “It just doesn’t get any better than that.”",NASA's Mars rover Opportunity has been knocked out by a gigantic dust storm that is enveloping the red planet and blotting out the sun,2018-06-14T01:43:16Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",NASA’s Opportunity Rover Has Been Knocked Out as a Giant Dust Storm Envelops Mars,http://time.com/5311814/nasa-rover-opportunity-mars-dust-strom/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/rtx68yt8.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,dust storm,1
Miriam Kramer,"Bundle up and head outside in the wee hours of the morning this weekend to check out some shooting stars. The Leonid meteor shower peaks early on Saturday morning. If estimates hold, people in rural areas with little light pollution should be able to see about 15 meteors per hour under good weather conditions. The best time for people in the Northern Hemisphere to head outside should be at around 3 a.m. ET, when moonlight won't interfere too much with viewing the shower, according to NASA. ""The Leonids are best seen after midnight your local time, once the Moon has set,"" NASA said in a skywatching video. The space agency also says that it's possible to see some Leonids on nights other than the peak if Saturday morning won't work with your schedule. ""You should also be able to see some Leonids on the 18th, 19th, and 20th,"" NASA added in the video. ""The maximum for any of these nights is only 10 Leonids per hour."" The Leonids appear each year when Earth passes through the field of dust left behind by Comet 55P Tempel-Tuttle during its journey around the sun. Those bits of debris enter Earth's atmosphere, effectively burning up in the process and creating those streaks we see as shooting stars. SEE ALSO: The real 'X-Files': CIA shares greatest hits from UFO reports If you want to head out and see some meteors this weekend, try your best to get to a dark area and let your eyes adjust for about 30 minutes at least. Once your eyes are adjusted, look up, lie back, and try to take in as much of the sky as possible, keeping in mind that the radiant point for the shower is the constellation Leo. Even if you're in a light-polluted area, you still might be able to see some meteors during the peak of the shower. If you are in a city, try to get somewhere as dark as possible like a park with a clear view of the sky. You likely won't see many meteors from a city, but it's always worth a try. While this year's Leonid meteor shower will be on the average side, sometimes the shower really puts on a show. ""Every 33 years, or so, viewers on Earth may experience a Leonid storm that can peak with hundreds to thousands of meteors seen per hour depending on the location of the observer,"" NASA said. ""A meteor storm versus a shower is defined as having at least 1,000 meteors per hour. Viewers in 1966 experienced a spectacular Leonid storm: thousands of meteors per minute fell through Earth's atmosphere during a 15 minute period.

Dave Mosher,"A satellite orbiting Mars has taken a remarkable yet potentially somber photo of NASA's longest-lived robot on the red planet. That robot is the Mars Opportunity rover, which is about the size of a golf cart, landed in January 2004, and was supposed to last 90 days. However, Opportunity has explored Mars for more than 15 years and trekked more than 28 miles across the planet using solar energy. Its days may be numbered, though. When a global dust storm began to envelope Mars about 100 days ago, Opportunity stopped getting enough sunlight to its solar panels. This triggered it to go to sleep on June 10 and conserve battery power, which the rover needs to run heaters that protect its circuits from blistering Martian cold. ""The rover's team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, hasn't heard from the rover since,"" Andrew Good, a representative for the lab, wrote in a press release. Though a new satellite image gives mission controllers hope that Opportunity will wake up, the mission may be nearing its end. What a new satellite image of Opportunity shows A satellite image of NASA's Opportunity rover on Mars after a global dust storm finally cleared. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Arizona; Business Insider Opportunity was descending into a location called Perseverance Valley when the storm hit in early June. This blocked satellite views of the ground there. Since dust levels have plummeted in the past couple of weeks, though, NASA was able to clearly photograph Opportunity's location on September 20 using the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). That satellite image, shown above, was taken by an MRO instrument called HiRISE. In the picture, there is an unmistakable though almost indiscernible ruddy bright spot on the slopes of a hill: the Opportunity rover. A before-and-after image created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech more clearly shows where the rover stopped. It also shows how the environment has changed as a result of the storm. ""A key unknown is how much dust has fallen on the solar arrays,"" Good said. ""The HiRISE image shows some reddening of the surrounding area, suggesting dust fallout, but it is not possible to determine how much dust is on the arrays themselves."" The image comparison contains some good news: There does not appear to be an ""optically thick layer of dust"" that has coated this spot, Good writes. This may mean there's enough sunlight reaching Opportunity's solar panels to slowly charge its batteries. However, no one can be sure how much dust is coating Opportunity's solar panels, or when a dust devil (a common weather phenomenon on Mars) might blow over the robot and sweep them off. What Opportunity's possible final resting place looks like A 3D illustration showing NASA's Opportunity rover in Perseverance Valley on Mars. Seán Doran/Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0); Business Insider NASA's overhead images of Opportunity are revealing, but it's difficult to get a sense of what the location actually looks like. Luckily, Seán Doran, a graphic artist who lives in the UK, has made a hobby of taking NASA's satellite imagery, maps, and other data and rendering them into realistic, from-the-surface views of spacecraft on Mars. (Doran is also known for his visualizations of Earth using satellite data and Jupiter using Juno spacecraft data.) Just a few days after Opportunity went to sleep, Doran modeled Perseverance Valley and the robot to show its exact location on Mars. The illustration above, which Doran tweeted on Wednesday, renders the scene in color and 3D using HiRISE images and elevation data. Doran also created black-and-white views of Opportunity, one of which is shown below. It provides a look at Opportunity over the ridge of the valley (shown as a small white shape at center). Seán Doran/FLickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) The artistic depictions give a sense of scale and desolation relative to Opportunity, and also a glimpse at where the rover may rest forever. In mid-September, as the dust storm thinned and sunlight returned to battery-charging strength, NASA began a 45-day countdown to recover Opportunity. ""If we do not hear back after 45 days, the team will be forced to conclude that the sun-blocking dust and the Martian cold have conspired to cause some type of fault from which the rover will more than likely not recover,"" John Callas, the rover's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a press release on August 30. The deadline falls at the end of October and, if not met, would mark the end of an ""active"" campaign to listen for and try to contact Opportunity on a daily basis. But Callas noted the agency will still try ""several months"" of ""passive listening"" to see if the robot somehow wakes up after the deadline. Still, the rover is more than 15 years past its warranty, and the dust storm led to one of the longest periods a solar-powered robot has ever hibernated on Mars. This could easily create a situation where some of the robot's battery or other systems suffered damage due to Martian cold and low power levels. ""Even if engineers hear back from Opportunity, there's a real possibility the rover won't be the same,"" NASA said in a press release in August. ""No one will know how the rover is doing until it speaks.""","A dust storm that enveloped Mars in June is finally clearing up.

Rob Beschizza,"NASA published an animation depicting this years' rough hurricane season in two smooth minutes. It's beautifully wispy and liquid, a fascinating contrast to the radar machine-vision we usually get of weather patterns. From the press release: How can you see the atmosphere? By tracking what is carried on the wind. Tiny aerosol particles such as smoke, dust, and sea salt are tranpsorted across the globe, making visible weather patterns and other normally invisible physical processes. This visualization uses data from NASA satellites, combined with mathematical models in a computer simulation allow scientists to study the physical processes in our atmosphere. By following the sea salt that is evaporated from the ocean, you can see the storms of the 2017 hurricane season. During the same time, large fires in the Pacific Northwest released smoke into the atmosphere. Large weather patterns can transport these particles long distances: in early September, you can see a line of smoke from Oregon and Washington, down the Great Plains, through the South, and across the Atlantic to England. Dust from the Sahara is also caught in storms sytems and moved from Africa to the Americas. Unlike the sea salt, however, the dust is removed from the center of the storm. The dust particles are absorbed by cloud droplets and then washed out as it rains. Advances in computing speed allow scientists to include more details of these physical processes in their simulations of how the aerosols interact with the storm systems.","NASA published an animation depicting this years' rough hurricane season in two smooth minutes.

The rover is now celebrating 15 years since it first launched from Earth. Opportunity set off for Mars in the dark of night on July 7, 2003. Engineers at NASA never expected the solar-powered machine to weather a Martian winter, but the golf-cart-sized rover has traveled more than 28 miles on the red planet since it landed there on January 25, 2004.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In the 18th-century English ballad The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a storm drives a sailors ship toward the South Pole, where he encounters all manner of fantastical sights, including floating icebergs as green as emerald. It may sound like author Samuel Coleridge was taking some poetic license, but emerald-colored icebergs are a real thingand more than 200 years after that ballad was inked, scientists might know what causes them.
A study published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans revisits the longstanding mystery of green icebergs, which sea captains have been reporting for nearly a century if not longer. While early work by the same authors suggested green icebergs got their coloration from carbon, new data made them revise their thinking. Now, they suspect that iron-oxide minerals are responsible for dyeing the bergs to look like theyre ready for a St. Patricks Day party.
If true, these iron-rich bergs could represent an important source of a crucial nutrient for the vast Southern Ocean encircling Antarctica.
Theres a lot of interest in where the iron [in the Southern Ocean] is coming from, lead study author Steve Warren, a geophysicist and emeritus professor at the University of Washington, told Earther. If it can get into marine ice, these bergs can travel hundreds of miles.
Warrens experience with green icebergs dates back to 1988, when he joined an Australian expedition to Antarctica as part of his first sabbatical. By lucky chance when the crew reached Mawson research station on the west side of East Antarcticas Amery Ice Shelf, they docked right near a rather striking iceberg that had become trapped in sea ice. 
The iceberg, Warren explained, was jade green and remarkably clear. Its clarity told the researchers they were dealing with marine ice, or ice that forms from seawater freezing at the bottom of a floating ice shelf. While the glacial ice that forms over land through the compaction of snow is opaque thanks to the presence of countless air pockets, marine ice does not contain light-reflecting air bubbles, making it see-through.
Typically, marine ice takes on a deep blue color, reflecting the distance photons of light have to travel before getting absorbed. Clearly, there was something else present in this jade-colored berg. Samples of the iceberg were collected, analyzed in the lab, and found to contain dissolved organic matter (DOM), which can produce green and yellow colors along coastlines as rivers dump tiny bits of organic material into the sea. And so the researchers hypothesized that DOM was responsible.
But in 1996, a new wrinkle to that story emerged, when Warren returned to a different part of the Amery Ice Shelf for his second sabbatical, and once again found himself confronted with a glacier of unusual hue. This one was a chimera of blue, green, and yellow-green marine ice glommed on to white glacial ice. When the berg was analyzed for DOM, both the green and blue ice were found to contain similar levels, suggesting something else was responsible for the color difference.
It was a nagging concern we didnt know what to do about, until two years ago, a paper came out of Tasmania showing large amounts of iron in marine ice collected from the bottom of a drill hole, Warren explained.
Warren and his colleagues now hypothesize that iron-oxide minerals are the culprit behind the green icebergs theyve encountered. If true, those iron-bearing minerals are likely the result of glacial flour, basically dust formed by the erosion of bedrock.
Scripps Institution of Oceanography glaciologist Helen Amanda Fricker, who studied the Amery Ice Shelfs marine ice layer as part of her PhD work and has encountered emerald bergs herself, said that the new paper offered a possible, plausible mechanism for their coloration. 
The ice shelf water [that forms marine ice] has come from the grounding line, Fricker said, referring the point where a glacier pops off the bedrock its tethered to and becomes a floating ice shelf. A lot of it probably still has sediment in it.
Still, more research is needed to be sure these giant ice popsicles are iron-flavored. Warren said he and his colleagues submitted a proposal to travel back to the Amery Ice Shelf in search of more jade bergs next spring. Hes hopeful their potential valueas a sort of dietary supplement supporting the Southern Oceans food chainhelps the group secure a grant.
After all, if that hunch is correct, a climate change-induced shift in the number of green icebergs out there could have far-reaching consequences.
The reason we might get funding [is], they might actually be important, Warren said.","In the 18th-century English ballad The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a storm drives a sailor’s ship toward the South Pole, where he encounters all manner of fantastical sights, including floating icebergs “as green as emerald.” It may sound like author Samuel …",2019-03-06T19:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Scientists Might Finally Know Why Some Icebergs Are Bright Green,https://earther.gizmodo.com/scientists-might-finally-know-why-some-icebergs-are-bri-1833075368,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dGG6KiTX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/its2qs0z6fs7toa6pnze.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,dust storm,1
Tariq Malik Space.com Managing Editor,"On Mars, the sky is dust. A massive dust storm on Mars that covered one-fourth of the planet just a week ago has grown into a global weather event, NASA officials said Wednesday (June 20). The dust storm has knocked NASA's Opportunity rover offline for want of sunlight. The agency's nuclear-powered Curiosity, meanwhile, is snapping photos of the ever-darkening Martian sky. The two rovers are on opposite sides of Mars. ""The Martian dust storm has grown in size and is now officially a 'planet-encircling' (or 'global') dust event,"" NASA officials said in a statement. [ The Mars Dust Storm of 2018 Explained ] The last dust storm on Mars to go global occurred in 2007, five years before the Curiosity rover landed at its Gale Crater site, according to officials with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. The Opportunity rover has been exploring the plains of Meridiani Planum on the opposite side of Mars since 2004. During that 2007 Martian dust storm, NASA also lost contact with Opportunity for days due to low power levels from the lack of sunlight. NASA lost contact with Opportunity last week when it missed a check-in call on June 12. NASA engineers think the rover is in a low-power mode, waking up only periodically to check if its batteries have recharged enough to phone home. All science operations by the rover are suspended while it waits out the storm. ""A recent analysis of the rover's long-term survivability in Mars' extreme cold suggests Opportunity's electronics and batteries can stay warm enough to function,"" NASA officials wrote in a separate update Wednesday. ""Regardless, the project doesn's expect to hear back from Opportunity until the skies begin to clear over the rover. That doesn's stop them from listening for the rover every day."" The Martian dust storm was first detected on May 30 by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Once it was clear that the storm would impact Opportunity, the rover was ordered into a sort of survival mode. A series of photos by Opportunity before it went silent show the Martian sky darkening until the sun itself disappears from view. Scientists measure the amount of sunlight-blocking haze in the Martian atmosphere as ""tau,"" with the current tau at Curiosity's Gale Crater site reaching above 8.0, JPL officials said in the NASA statement. The last tau for Opportunity's site was over 11. The atmosphere is so thick with dust, ""accurate measurements are no longer possible for Mars' oldest active rover."" According to NASA, the 2018 dust storm is not as big as the 2007 dust storm that Opportunity survived 11 years ago. It's more similar to a dust storm seen by the Viking 1 lander in 1977. Past dust storms seen by NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft from 1971 to 1972, as well as by the Mars Global Surveyor in 2001, were also much larger. During those storms, only the tallest volcanoes on Mars were visible poking above the dust. ""The current dust storm is more diffuse and patchy; it's anyone's guess how it will further develop, but it shows no sign of clearing,"" NASA officials wrote in the second update. NASA scientists are maintaining a full-court press on the Martian dust storm. In addition to Curiosity's weather observations on the surface, NASA has several other spacecraft tracking the storm from orbit: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission) studying the Martian atmosphere. The European Space Agency also has two spacecraft in orbit ( Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ). India's Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft is also in orbit. A key question for scientists is why some dust storms on Mars become planet-enshrouding events and last months while others fade away in a week. ""We don't have any good idea,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the statement. Guzewich is leading the Curiosity rover's dust storm work. New photos from Curiosity show a wall of haze over Gale Crater that is up to eight times thicker than normal for this time on Mars, NASA officials said. One photo also shows a curious lack of shadows. That's because the entire sky on Mars is red and illuminating the rocks from all sides, NASA officials explained. While the dust storm won't affect Curiosity's power levels, the low-light conditions are forcing the rover to take longer exposures when it snaps photographs, NASA officials said. When Curiosity is not taking pictures, the rover rotates its mast-mounted Mastcam camera to face the ground, to protect it from blowing dust, they added.

Alejandro de la Garza,"There’s a little bit of Texas in Minnesota this April.
In the wake of a massive “bomb cyclone” storm plowing through the central United States, residents in Minnesota and other parts of the upper Midwest have noticed something unusual. Unusual, that is, beyond the enormous mid-April snowstorm itself, which has pounded the region with high winds, heavy snowfall, downed trees and power outages.
People in some areas have noticed some discoloration in the freshly fallen snow, reporting patches with a red, brown, or faintly orange tint. It’s a phenomenon dubbed “dirty snow.”
The explanation, it seems, is in the sheer size of the weather system. Chris O’Brien, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service (NWS) Twin Cities in Minnesota, tells TIME winds in Texas and New Mexico picked up dust and carried it hundreds of miles north, where it fell back to Earth with the region’s snow.
“[The wind] picked up a lot of dust and got it entrained into the circulation of this storm system and pulled it all the way up into Minnesota where it fell with the precipitation,” he says. “You could actually see it on satellite, which was pretty cool.”
NWS Twin Cities tweeted out one of those satellite images on Thursday, which shows the stream of dust blowing northeast through the atmosphere on its way to the upper Midwest.
Many locals who spotted the strange-looking snow reacted to it on social media:
According to forecasters, this month’s “dirty snow” is a rather unusual phenomenon.
“We get the discolored snow sometimes, but usually it’s from dust that’s closer to here, not … from all the way close to the Mexican border,” says O’Brien.
However, aside from the possibility of needing a car wash after the discolored snow melts, O’Brien says the Texas dust shouldn’t pose much of a hazard to residents.
“I wouldn’t eat it,” he says. “But I think it’s just dust so I wouldn’t be fearful of it.”
Dirty snow on its own might not be much of a danger, but the massive storm system has wrecked havoc across the region, with high winds and heavy snow bringing down trees and leaving tens of thousands without power in Minnesota and beyond. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem closed many state offices for the second straight day on Thursday, and hundreds of schools in the region cancelled classes.
It’s the second so-called “bomb cyclone” in the past month, a weather phenomenon that reportedly features an explosively strengthening storm alongside a rapid drop in air pressure. The storm also triggered reports of “thunder snow” in central South Dakota, per the Associated Press.
Many Minnesota counties remain under blizzard watches or warnings into Friday, according to Accuweather. South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and parts of Colorado also faced blizzard conditions, according to the site.

Marina Koren,"Millions of miles from Earth, tucked inside a rust-colored, rocky valley, a space robot is sleeping. NASA’s Opportunity rover is currently hunkered down on Mars as a dust storm of unprecedented size swirls around the planet. As of this week, the tempest spans 14 million square miles, about one quarter of the entire planet, according to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The storm blocked sunlight from reaching the surface of continent-sized regions, including the valley where Opportunity resides. And it could last for weeks. Warning: the rest of this story features detailed descriptions of a small, hard-working space robot, which some people call “Oppy” for short, that is trying to survive a storm, all alone, on another planet. This may prompt feelings of affection and attachment that don’t make sense because it’s a robot. But this is what we humans do. That includes the humans who operate Opportunity. “We are all concerned,” John Callas, the Opportunity project manager, told reporters on a call Wednesday. “This team has a very strong bond with the rover. We have a very tight emotional connection with it. It’s like you have a loved one in a coma in the hospital. The doctors are telling you that you just got to give it time and she’ll wake up, all the vital signs are good, it’s just waiting it out. But if it’s your 97-year-old grandmother, you’re going to be very concerned.” The Opportunity rover resides in Mars’s southern hemisphere, which is entering the planet’s summer season, a time when dust storms are common. During summer, sunlight warms the air closest to the Martian surface and leaves the upper layers of the atmosphere cooler. This mismatch causes warm air to rise, taking surface dust with it, and winds scatter the tiny particles around the planet. Scientists and engineers weren’t surprised when they spotted one such storm brewing on May 30. But within days, the storm had grown to record-breaking proportions. With the atmosphere padded with dust, Opportunity could no longer use its solar panels to charge its batteries. It’s just too dark, according to Mark Lemmon, an associate professor at Texas A&m University who works on daily operations of the Opportunity rover. Lemmon is an atmospheric-opacity expert, which means he has spent nearly 15 years estimating how bright or dark the sky looks to rovers on Mars. The scientific term for this is “tau,” a measure of the opaqueness of an atmosphere. Usually around this time of the Martian year, tau oscillates between 1 and 2. During an intense dust storm in 2007, the tau value rose to 5.5. On Sunday, as this storm swirled, Lemmon recorded a tau of 10.8 on Mars. The greater that value, the less sunlight permeates the atmosphere to reach the surface. Under these conditions, “the brightness of the sun was 99.9995 percent fainter than it normally would be,” Lemmon said. It was so dark on the surface that engineers could command the rover to take pictures of the sun without the use of its solar filters, which act as eclipse glasses. “During the middle of the day like this, just like on Earth, it’s not advisable to look directly at the sun, but there’s so much dust in the atmosphere that you wouldn’t even have to squint,” Lemmon said. “That’s the scary thing: Even looking straight at the sun, it’s not bright.” If humans were to stand next to Opportunity right now—clad in the appropriate protective spacesuit, of course—the sky would look overcast rather than pitch-black. But for a rover that depends on sunlight to work, it may as well be nighttime. Here’s how the Martian sky looks to another rover on Mars, Curiosity, which runs on nuclear power. (NASA officials said Wednesday that the Curiosity team isn’t worried about that rover, which is located on the opposite side of Mars.) Opportunity isn’t the only Mars rover experiencing dusty skies right now. Dust is starting to accumulate in the skies over Gale Crater, and the change in sky clarity over the last 8 sols has been dramatic. Fortunately, Curiosity doesn’t rely on solar power to run! pic.twitter.com/614bplrmbJ — Justin Cowart (@jccwrt) June 12, 2018 NASA engineers haven’t heard from Opportunity since Sunday, which suggests that the rover, in an attempt to preserve its dwindling power supply, has slipped automatically into a mode that shuts off nearly all of its functions. This mode prevents Opportunity from taking more pictures for Lemmon to analyze, which means scientists don’t know how dark it is for the rover right now. “I doubt that it’s gotten much better than that 10.8,” Lemmon said. “And it might have gotten worse.” In this low-power mode, the only working system is the mission clock, which is programmed to wake up the rover’s computer, check whether the spacecraft has enough battery power to operate, and then go back to sleep if it doesn’t. NASA officials say that the mission clock could die eventually, too. “These are historic, low-energy levels for the vehicle,” Callas said. It’s possible that Opportunity will reach such power levels that it won’t be able to recover even when the storm passes and sunlight returns. It’s happened before. In 2010, extreme winter conditions pushed the power supply on the Spirit rover, already stuck in a sand pit, to critical levels. When spring returned, the rover didn’t wake up. Scientists hope that the conditions in Perseverance Valley, where spring is well on its way, will protect Opportunity from this fate. Callas said Wednesday that engineers believe the rover’s hardware and systems will be able to maintain the minimum temperature necessary to stay live. “We should be able to ride out this storm,” he said. Opportunity is a hardy rover, they point out. Both Opportunity and Spirit were designed for 90-day missions on Mars, and yet they lasted years, uncovering clues of the water that once flowed on the surface. NASA’s next Mars space robot should be unharmed, too. The InSight lander, launched last month, is scheduled to touch down on the surface in November. Callas said the spacecraft’s landing procedure will be unaffected by the dust storm. Like Opportunity, its stewards at NASA are stuck. As the storm drags on, all they can do is point their antennas into space and wait for them to hear the faint ping of a dusty rover calling home. “When you have a robot on another planet and it stops talking to you because it can’t, you just have to hope that everything works out right,” Lemmon said.",Will Opportunity survive a massive dust storm?,2018-06-13T20:41:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",NASA Is Really Worried About Its Mars Rover,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/nasa-is-really-worried-about-its-mars-rover/562730/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/06/PIA22521_sky1b/facebook.png?1528922495,,Theatlantic.com,dust storm,1
Leonard David Space.com's Space Insider Columnist,"NASA's Opportunity Mars rover remains silent as a giant dust storm continues to swirl on the Red Planet. The storm began on May 30 and grew to encircle the entire planet a few weeks later. With so much dust in the air, the solar-powered Opportunity hasn't been able to recharge its batteries and has entered a sort of hibernation. ""We have not heard from the rover for a couple of weeks,"" said Ray Arvidson of Washington University in Saint Louis. Arvidson is deputy principal investigator for the Mars Exploration Rover mission, which originally consisted of Opportunity and its twin, Spirit. The duo touched down in different locations on Mars a few weeks apart in January 2004. Opportunity kept right on rolling, long after Spirit's death. But the dust storm has sidelined the golf-cart-size rover: Opportunity hasn't sent a photo back to Earth since June 10, NASA officials have said. Spirit has long been silent, becoming bogged down in sand in late 2009. Its last communication with Earth was sent on March 22, 2010. Opportunity is now likely in a low-power mode, ""in which the rover wakes up, checks its power and, if too low, just goes back to sleep again,"" Arvidson told Inside Outer Space. ""At some point as the storm subsides, Opportunity should wake up, decide it has enough power to transmit a signal from its low-gain antenna, saying, 'I am awake and OK, but I am going back to sleep again,'"" he added. ""This should happen every sol until it decides to go back to full operation."" (A sol is a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day.) ""We have been listening, but no low-gain antenna communications yet. And the storm continues in full force,"" Arvidson said. ""The storm has gone global and is still raging,"" said Jim Rice, geology team leader for the Mars Exploration Rover Project at Arizona State University's Mars Space Flight Facility. But, he added, ""I'm still confident we make it through this.""

Dan Maloney,"The popular press was recently abuzz with sad news from the planet Mars: Opportunity, the little rover that could, could do no more. It took an astonishing 15 years for it to give up the ghost, and it took a planet-wide dust storm that blotted out the sun and plunged the rover into apocalyptically dark and cold conditions to finally kill the machine. It lived 37 times longer than its 90-sol design life, producing mountains of data that will take at another 15 years or more to fully digest.
Entire careers were unexpectedly built around Opportunity – officially but bloodlessly dubbed “Mars Exploration Rover-B”, or MER-B – as it stubbornly extended its mission and overcame obstacles both figurative and literal. But “Oppy” is far from the only long-duration success that NASA can boast about. Now that Opportunity has sent its last data, it seems only fitting to celebrate the achievement with a look at exactly how machines and missions can survive and thrive so long in the harshest possible conditions.
Fail Early, Then Stop Failing
Failure is always an option, and recognizing that fact is one of the prices of doing business in space. The early days of space exploration were punctuated with multiple catastrophes, mostly within the first few minutes of launch. That just reflects the difficulty of the endeavor; taming tons of volatile propellants and getting everything in the right place at the right time is a challenging business. Mistakes were made, and many missions were lost.
But failures, especially high-profile and expensive ones, teach valuable lessons, and NASA is really good at figuring out what went wrong when anything happens. NASA has entire labs dedicated to failure analysis, from structural and materials failure to electrical issues and software. They take failure analysis very seriously, to the point of writing their own software, the Root Cause Analysis Tool, or RCAT, to track and evaluate undesired outcomes.
Learning from their mistakes has increased the success rate of missions steadily over the years. Losses of missions due to launch issues are few and far between now compared to the early days. NASA still suffers failures once payloads are in transit or on station, of course. For example, Galileo suffered a serious failure while deploying its high-gain antenna en route to study the Jupiter system that almost ended the mission. Failure analysis led NASA engineers to conclude that leaving an umbrella-style antenna stowed for four and a half years and not relubricating the system prior to launch is not a good idea.

Failure analysis doesn’t just look at problems with hardware; NASA is very serious about finding issues with their processes too. When communication with the Mars Climate Orbiter was lost as the spacecraft entered orbit, it joined a lost list of missions that the Red Planet rebuffed. NASA discovered that the root cause was the use of non-SI units in ground-based software used to calculate the thrust of orbital insertion burns, rather than the SI units expected. It also found that warnings from two separate navigators that the spacecraft was not in the right position were ignored because they had not been reported according to policy.
Engineered to Last
Space exploration is an expensive business, mainly because of the cost of getting useful amounts of hardware out of the deep gravity well we all call home. But the spacecraft themselves are pretty pricey, thanks in part to the engineering that goes into them. When something is intended to operate for decades while traversing millions of miles of the most hostile conditions imaginable, close enough won’t cut it.

To make sure that interstellar probes, planetary explorers, and even the ground-based system that support them do not fail, or at least maximize the time until failure, NASA has developed a massive body of very specific and very stringent workmanship standards. As Gerrit Coetzee pointed out a few years back, the workmanship standards documents are themselves works of great beauty. They cover every conceivable kind of electromechanical assembly, showing the “NASA way” of doing it correctly. How to solder correctly, when to crimp instead, how to prevent PCB damage, how to prevent electrostatic discharge damage, and even how to properly tension wire ties are all covered.  For my money, though, the pièce de résistance is the section on lacing wiring harnesses. Pure engineering beauty.
Aesthetics aside, the NASA standards for workmanship and the general engineering principles it follows are a huge factor in favor of spacecraft lasting long past their “best by” date. The amazing success of Opportunity was only the latest in long-haul engineering wins for NASA, thanks in large part to principles like building in redundancies at every level of design. That saved the rover’s bacon a number of times, including in 2014 when “amnesia events” with the vehicle’s non-volatile memory led to several system resets. Controllers were able to reconfigure the rover to use only its RAM and continue the mission for another full year.
Sticking with seemingly outdated technology is another way NASA gets so much life out of its machines. We’ve covered a few examples of this before, like the use of orbital photo labs for lunar reconnaissance, or the 8-track tape decks used on Voyager and Galileo. Both were tried and true and offered reliability far beyond what could have been achieved with other means.
The computers that NASA chooses to fly into space are also decidedly behind the times compared to what is commercially available at the time the vehicle is built. Galileo, for instance, flew to Jupiter with six RCA COSMAC 1802 8-bit microprocessors, built on sapphire substrates for radiation resistance. Even New Horizons, built in 2006 and which recently visited Ultima Thule, was equipped with a radiation-hardened version of the MIPS R3000 CPU, a RISC chip that first hit the market in 1988. Old, slow, and working beats fancy, fast, and buggy any day of the week.
Moving the Goalposts
There’s another aspect to the success of long-term NASA missions, this one more of a social engineering approach than physical engineering. NASA design its missions very carefully, in terms of what science gets done, when it gets done, and how resources on a spacecraft are allocated. For Opportunity, NASA got a lot of mileage out of the oft-repeated “it was only supposed to last for 90 days” figure. I won’t quibble with that, but it’s a little unfair to NASA. The vehicle was obviously engineered to last much, much longer than 90 sols (Martian days), and if that dust storm hadn’t been as deep and as long as it was, the rover would probably still be running today. Rather, NASA planned for all the science to get completed within 90 sols, hoping that it would last longer. Every sol past the scheduled end of the science program was gravy.

This mission extension is something that NASA very much plans for – sending millions of taxpayer dollars out into space without a plan to maximize the return on investment doesn’t work. The Voyager program is a perfect example of this. Technically, the mission for Voyager 1 was over when it flew by Saturn, and Voyager 2‘s primary science was completed after its encounter with Neptune. But with the spacecraft still in good shape and with minimal budget needed to continue communicating with them, NASA began the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) that continues to this day, gathering data from interstellar space.
For my part, as impressive as Opportunity‘s accomplishments were, and for as sad as I felt when that dust storm set in and we stopped hearing from the rover, the real benchmark of space engineering is the Voyager twins. Their RTG power systems should provide enough juice to keep the VIM going for another five years or so. That will be a truly sad moment for me, when the mission that I’ve followed from its launch in 1977 will finally be over. But I’ll take solace in the idea that perhaps someday, an alien civilization will find these exquisite machines and see just what kind of engineering their makers were capable of.","The popular press was recently abuzz with sad news from the planet Mars: Opportunity, the little rover that could, could do no more.

Nina Golgowski,"After three months of radio silence, NASA’s Opportunity rover has emerged from a massive Martian dust storm, still silent but at least now visible. The resilient rover has been photographed by NASA’s Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) on the Red Planet’s Perseverance Valley where a global storm cut off its solar power, putting it in hibernation mode. NASA has consequently not received a single signal from it since June 10, despite increasing daily attempts to communicate, the space agency said on Tuesday. “A key unknown is how much dust has fallen on the solar arrays,” NASA said in a release posted on the website for the University of Arizona in Tucson, which operates MRO’s HiRISE camera. “As the dusty sky continues to clear, the frequent commanding will continue and imaging will be repeated.” At last review, about 25 percent of direct sunlight is reaching Mars’ surface, the agency said. An animated image released by NASA and seen here shows the amount of dust covering the rover’s location today compared to one Martian year ago, which is 687 Earth days. “Aside from the rover (only in the new image), the color and albedo patterns are very similar, so an optically thick layer of dust has not been deposited over the region,” the agency said. The storm had been described as the most intense ever observed on Mars, with it at one point covering more than 15.8 million square miles, or roughly the area of North America and Russia combined, NASA said in June. NASA will continue its listen for signals from the 14-year-old rover at least into early 2019, CNET reported. Opportunity has been exploring Mars since 2004, despite it only expected to operate for 90 Martian days. Its twin rover, Spirit, also landed on Mars in 2004 but ceased operations after 2,210 Martian days, according to NASA. Opportunity’s main mission is to assess the planet’s geology and past habitability at two Martian sites where there is preserved evidence of past and persistent water. Should Opportunity wake up from its hibernation, it could take several weeks or communication sessions before engineers receive enough information to determine the next course of action, NASA said. The agency compared the rover’s wakeup to coming out of a coma, stating, “It takes time to fully recover.” The rover’s team will then do a scan of its battery, solar cells, temperature and will attempt to review the amount of dust that may have become caked inside of it. “Once they’ve gathered all this data, the team would take a poll about whether they’re ready to attempt a full recovery,” NASA said.",The rover went into hibernation mode after a global dust storm blocked its solar panels.

"Tariq Malik, SPACE.com","On Mars, the sky is dust. A massive dust storm on Mars that covered one-fourth of the planet just a week ago has grown into a global weather event, NASA officials said Wednesday (June 20). The dust storm has knocked NASA’s Opportunity rover offline for want of sunlight. The agency’s nuclear-powered Curiosity, meanwhile, is snapping photos of the ever-darkening Martian sky. The two rovers are on opposite sides of Mars. “The Martian dust storm has grown in size and is now officially a ‘planet-encircling’ (or ‘global’) dust event,” NASA officials said in a statement. The last dust storm on Mars to go global occurred in 2007, five years before the Curiosity rover landed at its Gale Crater site, according to officials with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. The Opportunity rover has been exploring the plains of Meridiani Planum on the opposite side of Mars since 2004. During that 2007 Martian dust storm, NASA also lost contact with Opportunity for days due to low power levels from the lack of sunlight. NASA lost contact with Opportunity last week when it missed a check-in call on June 12. NASA engineers think the rover is in a low-power mode, waking up only periodically to check if its batteries have recharged enough to phone home. All science operations by the rover are suspended while it waits out the storm. “A recent analysis of the rover’s long-term survivability in Mars’ extreme cold suggests Opportunity’s electronics and batteries can stay warm enough to function,” NASA officials wrote in a separate update Wednesday. ""Regardless, the project doesn’s expect to hear back from Opportunity until the skies begin to clear over the rover. That doesn’s stop them from listening for the rover every day.” The Martian dust storm was first detected on May 30 by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Once it was clear that the storm would impact Opportunity, the rover was ordered into a sort of survival mode. A series of photos by Opportunity before it went silent show the Martian sky darkening until the sun itself disappears from view. Scientists measure the amount of sunlight-blocking haze in the Martian atmosphere as “tau,” with the current tau at Curiosity’s Gale Crater site reaching above 8.0, JPL officials said in the NASA statement. The last tau for Opportunity’s site was over 11. The atmosphere is so thick with dust, “accurate measurements are no longer possible for Mars’ oldest active rover.” According to NASA, the 2018 dust storm is not as big as the 2007 dust storm that Opportunity survived 11 years ago. It’s more similar to a dust storm seen by the Viking 1 lander in 1977. Past dust storms seen by NASA’s Mariner 9 spacecraft from 1971 to 1972, as well as by the Mars Global Surveyor in 2001, were also much larger. During those storms, only the tallest volcanoes on Mars were visible poking above the dust. “The current dust storm is more diffuse and patchy; it’s anyone’s guess how it will further develop, but it shows no sign of clearing,” NASA officials wrote in the second update. NASA scientists are maintaining a full-court press on the Martian dust storm. In addition to Curiosity’s weather observations on the surface, NASA has several other spacecraft tracking the storm from orbit: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission) studying the Martian atmosphere. The European Space Agency also has two spacecraft in orbit ( Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ). India’s Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft is also in orbit. A key question for scientists is why some dust storms on Mars become planet-enshrouding events and last months while others fade away in a week. “We don’t have any good idea,” Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the statement. Guzewich is leading the Curiosity rover’s dust storm work. New photos from Curiosity show a wall of haze over Gale Crater that is up to eight times thicker than normal for this time on Mars, NASA officials said. One photo also shows a curious lack of shadows. That’s because the entire sky on Mars is red and illuminating the rocks from all sides, NASA officials explained. While the dust storm won’t affect Curiosity’s power levels, the low-light conditions are forcing the rover to take longer exposures when it snaps photographs, NASA officials said. When Curiosity is not taking pictures, the rover rotates its mast-mounted Mastcam camera to face the ground, to protect it from blowing dust, they added.

Associated Press,"NASA’s Opportunity, the Mars rover that was built to operate for just three months but kept going and going, rolling across the rocky red soil, was pronounced dead Wednesday, 15 years after it landed on the planet.
The six-wheeled vehicle that helped gather critical evidence that ancient Mars might have been hospitable to life was remarkably spry up until eight months ago, when it was finally doomed by a ferocious dust storm.
Flight controllers tried numerous times to make contact, and sent one final series of recovery commands Tuesday night, along with one last wake-up song, Billie Holiday’s “I’ll Be Seeing You,” in a sombre exercise that brought tears to team members’ eyes. There was no response from space, only silence.
Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA’s science missions, broke the news at what amounted to a funeral at the space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, announcing the demise of “our beloved Opportunity.”
“This is a hard day,” project manager John Callas said at an auditorium packed with hundreds of current and former members of the team that oversaw Opportunity and its long-deceased identical twin, Spirit. “Even though it’s a machine and we’re saying goodbye, it’s still very hard and very poignant, but we had to do that. We came to that point.”
The two slow-moving, golf cart-size rovers landed on opposite sides of the planet in 2004 for a mission meant to last 90 sols, or Mars days, which are 39 minutes longer than Earth days.
In the end, Opportunity outlived its twin by eight years and set endurance and distance records that could stand for decades. Trundling along until communication ceased last June, Opportunity roamed a record 28 miles (45 kilometres) and worked longer than any other lander in the history of space exploration.
Opportunity was a robotic geologist, equipped with cameras and instruments at the end of a mechanical arm for analyzing rocks and soil. Its greatest achievement was discovering, along with Spirit, evidence that ancient Mars had water flowing on its surface and might have been capable of sustaining microbial life.
Project scientist Matthew Golombek said these rover missions are meant to help answer an “almost theological” question: Does life form wherever conditions are just right, or “are we really, really lucky?”
The twin vehicles also pioneered a way of exploring the surface of other planets, said Lori Glaze, acting director of planetary science for NASA.
She said the rovers gave us “the ability to actually roll right up to the rocks that we want to see. Roll up to them, be able to look at them up close with a microscopic imager, bang on them a little bit, shake them up, scratch them a little bit, take the measurements, understand what the chemistry is of those rocks and then say, ‘Oh, that was interesting. Now I want to go over there.’”
Opportunity was exploring Mars’ Perseverance Valley, fittingly, when the fiercest dust storm in decades hit and contact was lost. The storm was so intense that it darkened the sky for months, preventing sunlight from reaching the rover’s solar panels.
When the sky finally cleared, Opportunity remained silent, its internal clock possibly so scrambled that it no longer knew when to sleep or wake up to receive commands. Flight controllers sent more than 1,000 recovery commands, all in vain.
With project costs reaching about $500,000 a month, NASA decided there was no point in continuing.
Callas said the last-ditch attempt to make contact the night before was a sad moment, with tears and a smattering of applause when the operations team signed off. He said the team members didn’t even bother waiting around to see if word came back from space — they knew it was hopeless.
Scientists consider this the end of an era, now that Opportunity and Spirit are both gone.
Opportunity was the fifth of eight spacecraft to successfully land on Mars, all belonging to NASA. Only two are still working: the nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, prowling around since 2012, and the recently arrived InSight, which just this week placed a heat-sensing, self-hammering probe on the dusty red surface to burrow into the planet like a mole.
Three more landers — from the U.S., China and Europe — are due to launch next year.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the overriding goal is to search for evidence of past or even present microbial life at Mars and find suitable locations to send astronauts, perhaps in the 2030s.
“While it is sad that we move from one mission to the next, it’s really all part of one big objective,” he said.

Joel Langstein,"Residents along the U.S. Gulf Coast were recently met with an unlikely sight. Dust from the Sahara Desert in Africa recently reached as far west as Houston, Texas, denying hurricanes the moisture or fuel they need to develop. The dust contributes to a dry, sinking air mass that suppresses thunderstorms and makes it hard for hurricanes to intensify, senior scientist Chris Davis told Bloomberg. Davis is also associate director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Saharan dust generally travels between 5,000 to 20,000 feet in the atmosphere, according to NOAA. The agency adds that the dust reaches Florida and the Gulf Coast when winds pushing the dust are stronger than normal. HURRICANE IRMA: THE SCIENCE OF THE DEADLY STORM Known as the Saharan Air Layer, the dust also helps restore nutrients in the Amazon rain forest as it sprinkles onto soil that is frequently hit by flooding rains, according to NOAA. Peak hurricane season in the Atlantic basin is from mid-August to late October. Many hurricanes that affect the U.S. mainland originate from Western Africa as tropical waves. Although Saharan dust is a big obstable for tropical development, storms can still form in the adverse conditions. As of this morning, Tropical storm Chris is stationary off the North Carolina coast. While Chris is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, the current forecast track from the National Hurricane Center has the storm remaining offshore. Joel Langstein is a Fox News College Associate.

Hilary Brueck,"NASA's Opportunity Mars rover was built to last just 90 Martian sols, or 92 Earth days. But the scrappy machine shocked engineers by surviving far longer than that. The rover withstood nearly 15 years of tough conditions on Mars before finally succumbing to a violent dust storm that shook the Martian globe last June. 
 NASA made one last unsuccessful attempt to phone Opportunity on Tuesday before declaring the mission officially over. 
 ""When this little rover landed, the objective was to have it be able to move 1,100 yards and survive for 90 days on Mars,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said on Wednesday. ""Instead here we are, 14 years later, after 28 miles of travel, and we get to celebrate the end of this mission."" 
 Opportunity launched toward Mars on July 7, 2003 and landed there on January 25, 2004. Engineers at NASA did not expected the solar-powered machine to weather a single Martian winter; but in the end, the golf-cart-sized rover managed to crawl more than a marathon's distance on the red planet. 
 After Mars endured a global dust storm last summer that covered the planet in red dirt, the resulting darkness made it too tough for Opportunity to capture much-needed solar power. NASA hasn't heard a peep from the golf-cart sized rover since it was put into a nap in safe mode during the big storm. It turned out to be the robot's final slumber.

Kevin Loria,"A number of factors may make the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season calm compared to last year. NASA Earth Observatory image by Kathryn Hansen, using VIIRS data from LANCE/EOSDIS Rapid Response Earlier in the year, there were some signs that we could be in for another intense Atlantic hurricane season. Initial projections pegged the season as being likely to have slightly more storms than average — though 2017's "" extremely active"" hurricane season began with a similar forecast. Yet early signs of activity aside, projections for the rest of the hurricane season are changing, with experts now projecting a year that's average or even below average in terms of activity. First, a named storm, Subtropical Storm Alberto, showed up in May, a few days before hurricane season even officially kicked off. Hurricanes Beryl and Chris both formed by July 10, the fourth time there had been two hurricanes by that date in the satellite era (since 1966). Beryl threatened Caribbean islands still recovering from hurricanes like Irma and Maria. Chris formed off the coast of the US, whipping up strong surf. The remnants of Chris are now headed out to sea near Newfoundland, Canada, though the storm is still expected to create dangerous rip currents in the Northeast US on Thursday and Friday. Chris had the lowest pressure — a measure of a storm's intensity — for an Atlantic hurricane this early in the season since 2010's Hurricane Alex, Colorado State University (CSU) meteorologist Philip Kotzbach said on Twitter. As Kotzbach also noted, this was the first time since 1906 that a storm as strong as Chris was so far north by this time of year. Conditions around the globe, in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacifc, and in the winds from North Africa, all provide reason to think this year's hurricane season will be less stormy than last year's. Much of the Caribbean is still picking up after the 2017 hurricane season. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins An average hurricane season is based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010. By that definition, an average season includes 12 named storms and six hurricanes, with three of those being major hurricanes — storms that qualify as category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. CSU's newest forecast projects four hurricanes and ten named storms, with one being a major hurricane. If you average the predictions from major research institutions, government agencies, and universities, the mean prediction is six hurricanes, which would make this an average Atlantic season. Hurricanes in the Atlantic are formed by a confluence of global conditions, including ocean temperatures in both the Atlantic and the Pacific (which can affect winds), long-term ocean currents, and atmospheric winds. Right now, the tropical and subtropical Atlantic are abnormally cool, which favors less storm activity since tropical cyclones derive energy from warm waters. A weak El Niño is also looking like it may form in the Pacific, meaning waters there could be slightly warmer than normal. That can create wind shear in the Atlantic, which tears apart hurricanes before they form. Caribbean trade winds are also quite strong right now, which can indicate a quiet season, according to Klotzbach. The final factor that's dampening storms right now comes from Africa. A lot of Saharan dust is being kicked up by winds and carried across the Atlantic, according to NASA. This dust can suppress storms before they form or intensify. Anyone who experienced the 2017 hurricane season in the Atlantic is hoping for a quiet season this year. But just one storm is all it takes to do damage to a populated area.","In 2018, we've seen three named storms form early in the Atlantic, including Hurricane Chris and Hurricane Beryl.

Mark Kaufman,"There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins. But following the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 hurricane season, a group of scientists at Princeton University's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory have identified a connection between the six major hurricanes with winds over 110 mph that churned in the ocean, three of which pummeled the U.S. All were supercharged by unusually warm waters, and these warm conditions outweighed other weather factors. This research published on Thursday in the journal Science has significant climate change implications, as the world is expected to continue its accelerating warming trend. Hurricane Irma on Sept. 8, 2017. Image: nasa Critically, over 90 percent of the accumulating heat on Earth is absorbed by the planet's oceans. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" NASA oceanographer Josh Willis said. Hurricanes feed off warm waters. It's their fuel. But still, warm waters alone don't stoke hurricanes. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence To pinpoint the factors that drove the 2017 hurricane season, the Princeton scientists used a sophisticated climate computing model to simulate the different wide-scale weather conditions on Earth. This is no easy task. Any hurricane season has a number of influences that may propel, or dampen, the storm season or any particular storm. ""It's quite complicated, theres many moving parts,"" Colin Zarzycki, a storm scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who had no role in the study, said in an interview. ""It's not just ocean temperature. It's kind of a big tangled web."" Hurricane Harvey as seen from the International Space Station in August 2017. Image: nasa But even so, after simulating different weather conditions, it became clear that other major climate factors like cooling in the Pacific waters were overpowered by the effects of the unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic. The increase in 2017 hurricanes was caused ""mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic,"" the researchers wrote. But there was another critical factor driving these storms. ""The key point is that the Atlantic was warmer than other open oceans all over the world,"" the study's lead author, Hiroyuki Murakami, said in an interview. This caused more warm air to rise up into the sky over the Atlantic, making the atmosphere more unstable and ripe for tumultuous storm activity. In short, the Atlantic ocean got an ""extra kick"" from all this rising motion, Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane scientist at Florida International University, said over email. ""As a result, thunderstorms that feed hurricanes become stronger,"" said Willoughby. Hurricanes Maria and Jose in September 2017. Image: nasa The power of warm waters The Atlantic wasn't just warm it was much warmer than Earth's other oceans. But regardless, just having unusually warm waters in the Atlantic is still going to fuel powerful storms. ""When you get an ocean basin that gets warm like that, it really primes the atmosphere to be conducive to these strong storms,"" said Zarzycki. ""When you boil it down, with warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures, under ideal conditions we would expect storms to be stronger."" That said, Zarzycki underscores that other weather factors like strong wind shear that pummels and weakens hurricanes can weaken or tear apart any storm. But without these weakening factors, hurricanes can really ignite as they did in 2017. Going forward, what might this all mean for the future storm activity? Should we expect more major hurricanes? In future decades, perhaps by 2080, warming oceans may boost the count of major storms in the Atlantic during a busy season from six to eight, said Murakami. This means more opportunities for giant storms to hit the U.S. coast. But in the next 10 years, he can't say if warmer oceans might generate more major hurricanes. Weather patterns, or natural variability, are just too unpredictable. Hurricane Maria passing over Puerto Rico. Image: nasa ""It remains uncertain as to whether we will see more frequent active hurricane seasons like 2017 in the upcoming decade due to the dominant influence of natural variability,"" Murakami said. For example, there's a major climate trend running on 30-year timescales called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, that can warm or cool vast swaths of the Atlantic, said Willoughby. Saharan dust from Africa also blows over the ocean, which can cool the waters, he said. And there are major influences from the Pacific Ocean that can drive down wind shear in the Atlantic. ""All of these well-established oceanic vacillations make it harder to define the long-term warming caused by us humans,"" said Willoughby. So, it's complicated. But one thing is much more certain: Warm oceans fueled the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 season. And overall, we can expect more warm water.","There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins.

(Photo: National Weather Service) Beryl, a tiny, compact storm system in the Atlantic, became the season's first hurricane Friday but is expected to weaken quickly as it moves westward into the Caribbean. The National Hurricane Center said Friday morning that the center of Hurricane Beryl, located off the northeast coast of South America, was moving west at 14 mph with sustained winds near 75 mph. Hurricane-force winds from the compact hurricane extend only 10 miles from the center, with tropical storm force winds stretching only up to 35 miles.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"NASA's Curiosity rover is keeping tabs on the huge Martian dust storm that has sidelined its older cousin on the other side of the planet. That storm, which covered as much area as North America and Russia combined as of today (June 12), has engulfed the golf-cart-size Opportunity rover, plunging its environs into perpetual darkness. The solar-powered Opportunity has therefore temporarily ceased science operations. A recent photo by Curiosity suggests that dust may be encroaching a bit on its locale, the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater. But Curiosity is nuclear-powered, so a drop in sunlight isn't nearly as concerning to its handlers. [ Curiosity Rover's 10 Biggest Mars Moments of Its 1st 5 Years ] Still, the Curiosity team is trying to monitor the storm. ""To measure dust in the atmosphere, we'll first point Mastcam towards the sun and take a tau measurement, which lets us determine the optical depth vertically,"" mission team member Rachel Kronyak wrote in an update on Friday (June 8). (Mastcam, short for ""Mast Camera,"" is the two-camera system on Curiosity's head-like mast. The cameras capture color photos and video of the Red Planet landscape and soil for a variety of purposes.) ""Then we'll take a Mastcam image of the crater rim to determine line-of-sight extinction, which is directly related to the amount of dust present. ENV will also take a few movies with Navcam to assess clouds, wind direction, and to look for dust devils,"" Kronyak added. (""ENV"" refers to the mission's environmental-science team. Navcam is Curiosity's black-and-white navigation-camera system, whose images help the rover team plan routes.) This is not the first major dust storm weathered by Opportunity, which landed on the Red Planet in January 2004: An even larger storm forced the rover to stand down for two weeks in 2007. But the dust surrounding Opportunity now is much thicker than it was during that previous storm, mission team members have said. Opportunity beamed a message to its handlers on Sunday (June 10), which is a good sign; it shows the rover still has a decent amount of battery power left. Mission team members have a delicate balancing act ahead if the dust storm persists; they'll need to run Opportunity's heaters enough to keep the rover from freezing, but not so much that they run out its batteries. And Martian cold can kill. Opportunity's twin, Spirit, which also touched down on the Red Planet in January 2004, apparently froze to death after getting stuck in thick sand in 2010. Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater since August 2012. The car-size rover started its Mars mission on the crater floor, but it's currently climbing through the foothills of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles (5.5 km) into the Martian sky from Gale's center.

Ara Wagoner,"What ""weather-resistant"" means for the Ring Stick Up Cam? IP Code is an international standard developed to help both manufacturers and users better know what kind of protection a device can provide against different kinds of invading substances. Manufacturers list their resistances in the format IP[solid particle/dust-resistance rating][water-resistance rating], which then tells users how deep a device can be submerged in water or how hard it is for debris to get inside. An IPX5 rating tells us that ""water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects"" on the camera, sometimes referred to as ""splashproof"". It means that the Ring Stick Up Cam should stand up to thunderstorms without water getting in. In regards to snow and ice, the operating temperature range for the Ring Stick Up Cam is -5 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, but if slush refreezes around the edges of the bottom cover, expanding ice could damage the cover or compromise your camera's water resistance. When mounting the Ring Stick Up Cam in colder climates, try to minimize the Ring Camera's exposure to snow accumulation by mounting it from the ceiling of a porch. Let's talk about dust That IPX5 rating tells us what level of ingress protection the Ring Stick Up Cam is supposed to have against dust and water, but IP ratings are usually numbers. X means the Ring Stick Up Cam has not been tested or rated to withstand dust. Now, this doesn't mean that the Ring Stick Up Cam is completely vulnerable to dust storms, pollen, or ashfall from a not-so-distant wildfire. It just means that Ring didn't test the Stick Up Cam against it, and if sand from a dust storm infiltrates and damages your camera, it may not be covered under Ring's limited warranty.

Mark Kaufman,"NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently dove deeper into the sun's atmosphere than any spacecraft before. And it has the photos to prove it. Launched four months ago, the heavily-shielded probe an exploration craft that will swoop progressively closer to the sun over the next six years came within 16.9 million miles of the sun's surface when it captured this orange-tinged image on November 8. Here, the probe was well inside the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, a difficult-to-visit place that's still largely a mystery to astronomers. The dominant part of the scene is a horizontal bright streak emanating from the sun. On November 8, the probe approached this beam of energized particles, called a ""coronal streamer,"" that had been blasted out from our medium-sized star. The solar scene as captured by the Parker Probe's WISPR camera. Image: nasa The bright spot in the photo is sunlight reflecting off the planet Mercury, which is millions of miles away from the probe. Also visible are darker dots beside and just above Mercury. These are photo remnants of both Mercury and Jupiter as both planets orbited in the background as the solar probe captured long exposure shots of the looming coronal streamer. Although this is one of the first solar probe images to get transmitted back to Earth, NASA will eventually get images of the probe flying directly through this massive blast of energy. ""It's like flying through a snowstorm,"" Russ Howard, the head scientist for the camera that took the image, said in an interview. ""As you get closer to the storm, they [the sun's particles] go above, below, and by you."" ""We are going to be flying through it thats really exciting,"" added Howard. Blue line shows the probe's travels in early November. Image: nasa While the primary image here was taken on November 8, the final product is a combination of images taken about 12 hours apart as the probe traveled through space. This was necessary, said Howard, because there's quite a bit of dust floating around the solar system, and ""averaging"" the photos together allowed the team to clear out the unwanted ""noise,"" from the dust in the image. Ultimately, NASA hopes to understand the highly-energized gases that the sun is constantly emitting into space, known as the solar wind. These winds are largely responsible for creating ""space weather"" in our solar system. ""As we send spacecraft and astronauts further and further from home, we must understand this space environment just as early seafarers needed to understand the ocean,"" explains NASA.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"NASA's Curiosity Mars rover noticed this summer's monster dust storm fairly early on — but not in the way you might expect. The storm was first spotted from above by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on May 30 as a localized event near Perseverance Valley, a landform being explored by the agency's Opportunity rover. The dust storm grew quickly over the following days, as Curiosity's observations showed. Curiosity's home is the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, on the other side of the planet from Perseverance Valley, but it saw signs of the storm on June 5. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] ""All my charts showed the dust storm effect on the actuator because it's exposed; it's sitting out there on the rover deck,"" Benito Prats, an electromechanical engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement. ""All of a sudden, I saw the daytime temperature drop really quickly."" The nighttime temperature stayed abnormally high as well, as it does during big Martian dust storms: While all that dirt in the air blocks sunlight during the day, it also prevents infrared radiation from escaping to space at night, keeping things warmer than usual after the sun goes down. The storm continued to grow, eventually encircling the planet by June 20. Its intensity plunged Perseverance Valley into perpetual darkness, blocking so much sunlight that the solar-powered Opportunity couldn't recharge its batteries. The golf-cart-size rover, which has been exploring Mars since January 2004, hasn't made a peep since June 10. The motor's temperature measurements helped the Curiosity team keep tabs on the storm (which they also did using the rover's onboard weather station). And Prats combined the dust-storm data with historic readings from the motor, to predict when the storm might start clearing up. ""At sol 2,125 (July 28), I noticed a linear trend,"" Prats said, ""so I said, OK, I can predict that sol 2,180 (Sept. 23) is going to be when we're going to get out of the dust storm and the temperature will return back to normal, though I later updated that to sol 2,175 (Sept. 18)."" (A sol is a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day. The sol numbers referenced by Prats are the number of Martian days since Curiosity's touchdown on the Red Planet, which occurred on Aug. 5, 2012.) That forecast proved accurate: Dust levels in Gale Crater had returned to normal by Sept. 18, according to the motor measurements, NASA officials said. Curiosity was largely unaffected by the storm, because it runs on nuclear rather than solar power. (Curiosity is currently sidelined by an issue with its memory, however.) The skies over Perseverance Valley have cleared as well. Indeed, Opportunity's handlers began stepping up their attempts to hail the silent rover on Sept. 11, kicking off a 45-day ""active listening"" campaign. If this effort fails to rouse the rover, the team will assess its next steps, NASA officials have said. Opportunity mission leaders have said that they'll keep listening on a passive basis at least through the end of January, however. Scientists are eager to study all the data they can about the recent Mars dust storm, to get a better handle on these fairly regular, but poorly understood, events. For example, researchers can't accurately predict when a global dust storm will arise on Mars, and they don't know why some small storms balloon into planet-girding monsters, whereas others fade away. ""I can estimate, two years in advance, the temperature, air pressure, and whether there's going to be dust or clouds in the air during the non-dusty season anywhere on the planet,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Goddard who leads Curiosity's dust-storm investigation, said in the same statement.

Andrew Liptak,"Lionsgate films has released a pair of new trailers for its upcoming reboot of Mike Mignola’s classic comic, Hellboy. The new trailers — a red and green band spot — give us a good look at the film’s plot, and presents a much better feeling than the first trailer did. The film is a reboot of the film franchise, with The Descent and Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall helming the project, featuring Stranger Things ’ David Harbour as the movie’s titular demon. The new trailers outline what we can expect for the plot of the film, and covers some of the familiar beats of Hellboy’s origin story. During World War II, Hellboy was summoned from Hell by Nazis looking for an edge in the later days of the war. He was instead adopted by the US, and raised under the auspices of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, an agency designed to help fend off paranormal threats. It’s one of those threats Hellboy finds himself embroiled in: a sorceress, Nimue the Queen of Blood, has risen, and is threatening to Thanos London — turning everyone to dust to do something evil. The story draws from a broad arc of Hellboy comics — Darkness Calls, The Storm and the Fury, and The Wild Hunt. Along the way, she appeals to Hellboy’s demonic side, trying to get him to join her and to fulfill his destiny as a ruler of Hell. The first trailer for the film debuted in December, and didn’t instill a lot of confidence: set to Billy Idol’s song “Mony Mony,” it showed off Harbour’s take on Hellboy, as well as Professor Bruttenholm (played by Ian McShane) and BPRD agent Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim). But the trailer didn’t feel like it was really showing off a film that’s been billed as a hard-R film, let alone the Lovecraftian vibe that the original comic has. That first rough impression is not great for a franchise that already being skeptically viewed by Hellboy fans, who have long wanted a third installment of the series directed by Guillermo del Toro, featuring Ron Perlman as Hellboy. del Toro wanted to complete his trilogy, but as years passed between installments, interest shifted to other takes on the franchise, ultimately leading to this reboot. Earlier this week, Harbour spoke with Empire about the role, saying that he didn’t want to “imitate” Pearlman’s take on the character, and noted that in this film, “Hellboy’s younger. He’s rougher. He’s much more of a teenager. He’s really struggling with the idea of whether or not he’s a good person.” Both trailers, but especially the red-band trailer shows off quite a bit more blood and gore, as well as some of Hellboy’s sarcastic humor.

Elizabeth Howell Space.com Contributor,"Dust storms that take over the Martian globe play a key role in promoting gas escape from the Red Planet's atmosphere, according to a new study. Scientists know that water flowed on the surface of Mars in the ancient past; there's lots of evidence of this, from riverbeds and canyons to minerals soaked with water (such as hematite). Why Mars dried up, however, is still under investigation. The leading theory suggests that most of the Martian atmosphere was stripped by the solar wind shortly after the planet lost its global magnetic field, about 4 billion years ago. The Martian air became so wispy that the planet couldn't support running water on its surface anymore. [ Photos: Ancient Mars Lake Could Have Supported Life ] In the new study, researchers reanalyzed dust-storm observations made by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MRO saw water vapor increase in the middle atmosphere, about 30 to 60 miles (50 to 100 kilometers) up, during regional dust storms. It was during a global dust storm in 2007, however, that water vapor was really affected. The vapor moved to a higher altitude and increased in volume more than a hundredfold, the data showed. ""We found there's an increase in water vapor in the middle atmosphere in connection with dust storms,"" study lead author Nicholas Heavens, a geophysicist at Hampton University in Virginia, said in a statement. ""Water vapor is carried up with the same air mass rising with the dust."" Other observations, by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter, suggest there's a link between Mars' middle-atmosphere water volume and the escape of atmospheric hydrogen into space — at least during years without global dust storms. It's unclear what the relationship is during years with planetwide dust storms; they don't come along too often. ""It would be great to have a global dust storm we could observe with all the assets now at Mars, and that could happen this year,"" study co-author David Kass, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in the same statement. Regional Martian dust storms tend to occur during the planet's northern spring and summer, NASA officials said. ""In most Martian years, which are nearly twice as long as Earth years, all the regional storms dissipate, and none swells into a global dust storm,"" NASA officials wrote in the same statement. ""But such expansion happened in 1977, 1982, 1994, 2001 and 2007. The next Martian dust storm season is expected to begin this summer and last into early 2019."" Not everybody is keen on a pall of dust to settle over Mars. NASA's long-running Opportunity rover needs solar power to keep rolling along; it shuts down operations during dust storms. And the agency's InSight lander is scheduled to launch toward Mars in May and land there in November; if a dust storm happened before touchdown day, mission planners would likely need to adjust parameters for a safe entry, descent and landing, NASA officials said. And even Martian orbiters would be affected because they wouldn't be able to see as well. Whenever a dust storm happens, however, the robotic explorers at Mars will take advantage of the opportunity to learn more about its effects on the Red Planet's atmosphere. ""Before MAVEN reached Mars, many scientists expected to see loss of hydrogen from the top of the atmosphere occurring at a rather steady rate, with variation tied to changes in the solar wind's flow of charged particles from the sun,"" NASA officials wrote in the statement, referring to the agency's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter, which arrived at the Red Planet in September 2014. ""Data from MAVEN and Mars Express haven't fit that pattern, instead showing a pattern that appears more related to Martian seasons than to solar activity."" The new study was published online Monday (Jan. 22) in the journal Nature Astronomy.

Madeleine Rivera,"Hurricane season kicked off on June 1st, but so far there have no major calls for alarm in the Atlantic. “It’s very quiet right now in the tropical Atlantic. There’s no storms, there’s not even disturbances that look like they’ll become storms,” said Dan Reilly, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service Houston office. Those living in Texas, Oklahoma, and even New Mexico may have noticed hazy skies a couple of times this summer. It’s a large amount of dust, blown from the Sahara desert. The dust particles traversed thousands of miles across the Atlantic, and meteorologists say they may have temporarily stopped hurricanes from forming. Meteorologists say colder water temperatures are contributing to a less active hurricane season. (KRIV) “The dust tends to correspond with those stronger winds aloft,” said Reilly. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “the dust sits in a hot and dry layer of the atmosphere that is directly above cooler and more humid air above the Atlantic Ocean…The hot, dusty air puts a stop to any thunderstorms that may develop in the moist layer beneath it.” HURRICANE WARNING VS. WATCH: HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT? Saharan dust is not new. However, Reilly believes more advanced satellite technology has led to increased awareness. “You can see it a lot better with our new satellites … you can actually see the dust as it moves throughout the Atlantic, so I think that’s why we’re aware of it now,” he said. Other factors are contributing to a slower-than-normal season. Saharan dust clouded Gulf Coast communities this summer. Hot and dusty air from from Saharan dust can temporarily stop storms from forming. (KRIV) “We have cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures out in the Atlantic, where the storms form. We also have stronger winds aloft that tend to rip apart storms before they can get going,” said Reilly. So far, the season has seen five named storms, including two hurricanes. NOAA states, “an average six-month hurricane season produces 12 named storms.” Earlier this month, seasonal forecasters with NOAA increased the chances of a below-normal Atlantic hurricane season to 60 percent. That’s up 25 percent since May. HURRICANE LANE'S EYE SEEN IN DRAMATIC VIDEO AS STORM CHURNS TOWARD HAWAII Still, Reilly warned people not to let their guard down, reminding them that it only takes one bad storm to cause severe damage—a warning not taken lightly on the one-year-anniversary of Hurricane Harvey. “We provided about $13.8 billion to survivors for Hurricane Harvey. About $1.6 billion of that is for individuals that suffered damage,” said FEMA Regional Administrator Tony Robinson. Experts warn people to be cautious despite lack of storms, warning that it only takes one bad storm to cause severe damage. Communities like Rockport are still rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey. (Fox News) Robinson joined Vice President Mike Pence at First Baptist Church in Rockport on Wednesday. It marked a return for the vice president, who stopped at the church a year ago after Harvey damaged it. Pence said, “Your nation’s proud,” referring to the city’s recovery efforts. “I want to encourage you to continue on and know that we’ll continue to partner with you every single step of the way,” he added. Gulf Coast communities like Rockport face higher risks than those by the Atlantic coast. Conditions leading to a slower-than-normal season in the Atlantic aren’t always shared in the Gulf. “They’re not nearly as prevalent in the Gulf so we’re always vulnerable to a Gulf developing storm. The other thing is you don’t have a lot of time to prepare if it forms right in the Gulf. Harvey was a good example,” said Reilly. With the peak of hurricane season approaching mid-September, he cautioned, no one’s in the clear just yet. Madeleine Rivera is a multimedia reporter based in Houston, Texas.","The peak of hurricane season is only a few weeks away. However, so far, there have been no major storms in the tropical Atlantic.

Chris Ciaccia,"The massive dust storm on Mars that caused NASA to lose contact with the Opportunity rover is dissipating, giving new hope that the $400 million space vehicle may not be lost after all. In an Aug. 30 blog post, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) wrote that the skies are clearing, which means the batteries on the rover should start to charge. The rover went dark after a dust storm that started in mid-June enveloped the entire planet. ""The Sun is breaking through the haze over Perseverance Valley, and soon there will be enough sunlight present that Opportunity should be able to recharge its batteries,"" said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at JPL, in the statement. MARS OPPORTUNITY ROVER HAS IMAGE OF UNIDENTIFIED METALLIC OBJECT, PUTS INTERNET IN A FRENZY Callas added: ""When the tau level [a measure of the amount of particulate matter in the Martian sky] dips below 1.5, we will begin a period of actively attempting to communicate with the rover by sending it commands via the antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network. Assuming that we hear back from Opportunity, we will begin the process of discerning its status and bringing it back online."" Earlier this month, NASA, which is continuing to listen for signs and pinging the rover three times a week, admitted it may never hear back from the rover if its batteries were inactive for too long, discharging too much power. ""Even if engineers hear back from Opportunity, there's a real possibility the rover won't be the same,"" NASA JPL's Andrew Good wrote in an Aug. 16 blog post. ""The rover's batteries could have discharged so much power – and stayed inactive so long – that their capacity is reduced. If those batteries can't hold as much charge, it could affect the rover's continued operations."" This sentiment was echoed in the Aug. 30 post as well, with NASA writing ""there is no assurance the rover will be operational."" The impact of the storm on Opportunity's systems is still unknown and unforeseen but could make it ""difficult for the rover to fully return online."" Despite that, Good expressed optimism at the time, noting the batteries were in ""good health"" before the storm, so degradation was not likely to be an issue. Nor was the dust storm, with the dust either shed from the cameras or calibrated out. NASA'S MARS OPPORTUNITY ROVER, $400M SPACECRAFT, UNRESPONSIBE IN MARTIAN DUST STORM FOR 2 MONTHS That said, the clock is ticking for the Opportunity rover to make contact. ""If we do not hear back after 45 days, the team will be forced to conclude that the Sun-blocking dust and the Martian cold have conspired to cause some type of fault from which the rover will more than likely not recover,"" said Callas. Callas further added: ""At that point our active phase of reaching out to Opportunity will be at an end. However, in the unlikely chance that there is a large amount of dust sitting on the solar arrays that is blocking the Sun's energy, we will continue passive listening efforts for several months."" Assuming NASA does get a signal from Opportunity, Good cautioned earlier this month there could be a lag of several weeks after NASA hears back a second time, likening it to a patient coming out of a coma. ""It may take several communication sessions before engineers have enough information to take action,"" he wrote. MARS OPPORTUNITY ROVER HAS IMAGE OF UNIDENTIFIED METALLIC OBJECT, PUTS INTERNET IN A FRENZY Opportunity's history The Opportunity rover, which was initially meant to be on the Red Planet for a 90-day mission, has made several groundbreaking discoveries throughout its now roughly 15-year trip, initially leaving Earth on July 7, 2003. So far, it has detected signs of water, explored the insides of two craters and completed a marathon — the first vehicle to do so on another planet. But Opportunity's journey hasn't always been a smooth one. In 2005, the rover lost the use of one of its front wheels and got stuck in a thick pile of sand for about five weeks, according to Space.com. When it finally managed to move, it ran into a sand dune. In 2007, a dust storm hit and reportedly cut the spacecraft's power to ""dangerously low levels."" A month later, it turned back on and began exploring the Victoria Crater. Despite its obstacles, the Opportunity has always managed to pull through. But this time, researchers aren't sure what will happen. In the meantime, scientists are trying to stay positive, creating a Mars-themed Spotify playlist — featuring ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" by Wham!, ""Rocket Man"" by Elton John, among others — and an office pool to help pass the time. ""In a situation like this, you hope for the best but plan for all eventualities,"" Callas concluded. ""We are pulling for our tenacious rover to pull her feet from the fire one more time. And if she does, we will be there to hear her."" Fox News' Jennifer Earl contributed to this report.

""And because dust storms tend to warm the environment -- and the 2018 storm happened as Opportunity's location on Mars entered summer -- the rover should have stayed warm enough to survive."" Good added that the dust is less of a problem. Previous storms which ""plastered dust on the camera lenses,"" saw most of the dust eventually shed off. ""Any remaining dust can be calibrated out,"" he wrote. The dust storm started on June 10 and eventually covered the entire planet, according to Space.com. Still, it has been a sore spot for NASA that it has not been able to contact the Opportunity rover since the dust storm.

""It's like a patient coming out of a coma: It takes time to fully recover. It may take several communication sessions before engineers have enough information to take action."" Opportunity has three so-called ""fault modes"" when it experiences a problem: a low-power fault that causes it to go into hibernation until there is more sunlight to let it recharge; clock fault, which might happen if the rover doesn't know what time it is, causing disruptions in communication and uploss fault, which occurs when the rover hasn't heard from Earth in a long time, causing it to check its equipment and try alternate ways to communicate with Earth.

Samuel Chamberlain,"Fifteen years after NASA's Opportunity rover touched down on the surface of Mars, scientists fear they may never hear from the spacecraft again.
Opportunity hasn't been heard from since a dust storm on the Red Planet last June. There was so much dust in Mars' atmosphere that sunlight could not reach Opportunity's solar panels to generate power.
""I haven’t given up yet,"" Cornell University professor Steven Squyres, the mission's principal investigator, told The New York Times. ""This could be the end. Under the assumption that this is the end, it feels good. I mean that.""
He went on to say that if the storm knocked out the rover for good, ""That’s an honorable death.""
Opportunity and its twin craft, Spirit landed on Mars on Jan. 24, 2004. Each Rover was designed to last a few months and travel a few hundred yards. But they just kept on going.
The six-wheeled Opportunity logged more than 28 miles on Mars before falling silent. Spirit stopped transmitting in early 2010, a few months after it became ensnared in a Martian sand trap.

Flight controllers are still sending commands to the rover in hopes of a response. But project manager John Callas says the longer the blackout lasts, the less likely contact will be made.
""We’re now in January getting close to the end of the historic dust cleaning season,"" Callas told the Times, who added that the scientist had not been able to brief NASA on the situation due to the partial government shutdown.

Associated Press,"Alberto is a still-menacing depression after its Memorial Day landfall on the Gulf Coast, scattering heavy rains around the South and raising risks of flash floods. As the first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Subtropical Storm Alberto lumbered ashore Monday afternoon in the Florida Panhandle and then weakened overnight to a depression centered over Alabama. Now it's a vast, soggy system dumping the warm water it gathered over the Gulf of Mexico in bursts of rain across the southeast. Forecasters said that rain could still kill people caught in flash floods in the coming hours or days in Alabama and large areas of Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas. In North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed instantly on Monday while covering the weather, when a tree became uprooted from rain-soaked ground and toppled onto their SUV, authorities said. ""Two journalists working to keep the public informed about this storm have tragically lost their lives, and we mourn with their families, friends and colleagues,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement. ""North Carolina needs to take Alberto seriously. I urge everyone to keep a close eye on forecasts, warnings and road conditions, especially in western North Carolina where even heavier rain is predicted."" Between 2 and 8 inches (10-25 centimeters) of rain could soak Alabama and western Georgia on Tuesday, and isolated deluges of 12 inches (30 centimeters) also are possible as the system heads into the Tennessee Valley on its way to the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region. Alberto dumped between 2 and 5 inches (2 and 13 centimeters) of rain over parts of the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Weather Service. Double-red flags along the white sandy beaches kept most people out of the rough waters, and some low-lying areas experienced minor flooding, officials said. ""Most of the issues we're having right now are downed trees and downed limbs,"" Walton County spokesman Louis Svehla told the Northwest Florida Daily News. ""Our beaches did good. There was not a lot of erosion. The surge was not that large."" Santa Rosa County officials had put out many piles of sand several days ago in case people wanted to mitigate any flooding in their homes. People who took those supplies will be better prepared as the hurricane season gets its official start on Friday, said county spokeswoman Brandi Whitehurst. ""What Alberto has done for us is to have people dust off their hurricane plans and stock up on supplies,"" Whitehurst said. The pelting rain soaked the uniform and socks of Lt. Andy Husar with the Bay County Sheriff's Office, who watched surf get kicked up along Panama City Beach on Monday. ""It's not a good sign, getting hit by a storm before hurricane season,"" Husar told the Panama City News Herald. As a subtropical storm, Alberto had a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds were found farther from its center. The large tree that crushed the TV news vehicle Monday afternoon near Tryon, North Carolina, killed news anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer of WYFF-TV of Greenville, South Carolina, the station said. They had just interviewed Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant as they covered storms in North Carolina. ""Ten minutes later we get the call and it was them,"" Tennant said at a news conference, his voice cracking. Tennant said the roots of the large tree tore loose from ground saturated by a week's worth of rain.

Opportunity hasn't made a peep since June 10, when dust in the Red Planet's air got so thick that the solar-powered rover couldn't recharge its batteries. Opportunity's handlers think the six-wheeled robot has put itself into a sort of hibernation, and they still hope to get a ping once the dust storm has petered out. And there are good reasons for this optimism, NASA officials said. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: How It Grew &amp; What It Means for the Opportunity Rover ] ""Because the batteries were in relatively good health before the storm, there's not likely to be too much degradation,"" NASA officials wrote in an Opportunity update Thursday (Aug. 16). ""And because dust storms tend to warm the environment—and the 2018 storm happened as Opportunity's location on Mars entered summer—the rover should have stayed warm enough to survive."" The dust storm began on a regional scale in late May and had grown into a planet-encircling monster by June 20. The storm began dying down late last month, but there's still a lot of dust in the air—probably too much for Opportunity to start recharging its batteries. Scientists track the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere using a measurement of opacity called ""tau."" The lower the tau, the clearer the air. The air in Opportunity's neck of the woods—the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater—typically has a tau of about 0.5, NASA officials said. The rover's last recorded measurement, on June 10, tagged it at a whopping 10.8. The tau probably needs to be less than 2.0 for enough sunlight to get through to start charging the rover's batteries, mission team members said. Over the past week or so, the estimated tau in the Endeavour Crater region has ranged from around 2.1 to 2.5, they added. Engineers are trying to communicate with Opportunity several times a week using NASA's Deep Space Network, a system of big radio dishes around the globe. They hail the robot during scheduled ""wake-up times"" and then listen for a response. And team members are casting a wider net, too: Every day, they sift through all radio signals received from Mars, listening for any chirp from Opportunity, NASA officials said. Even if Opportunity does eventually wake up and re-establish contact, its long ordeal may end up taking a toll on the rover. ""The rover's batteries could have discharged so much power—and stayed inactive so long—that their capacity is reduced,"" NASA officials wrote in the update. ""If those batteries can't hold as much charge, it could affect the rover's continued operations. It could also mean that energy-draining behavior, like running its heaters during winter, could cause the batteries to brown out."" The golf-cart-size Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, three weeks after its twin, Spirit. Both robots embarked on three-month missions to search for signs of past water activity on the Red Planet. The duo found plenty of such evidence, and then kept exploring Mars for years after their warranties expired. Spirit finally got bogged down in a Martian sand trap in March 2010. The rover couldn't reorient itself to catch the sun, and it froze in the ensuing winter. NASA declared Spirit dead in 2011. NASA's other active Mars rover, the car-size Curiosity, is nuclear-powered and is therefore far less affected by the dust storm. If you'd like to send your well-wishes to Opportunity and the mission team, you can do so using the ""postcards"" at this mission site. Copyright 2018 SPACE.com, a Purch company. All rights reserved.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"The Opportunity rover's silent stretch on Mars has now reached four months. Opportunity hasn't made a peep since June 10. Around that time, a developing dust storm shrouded its environs in darkness, preventing the solar-powered rover from harvesting enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. The Martian dust storm grew to envelop the entire planet 10 days later. But by late July the maelstrom was abating, and the sky continued to clear over the following weeks. By Sept. 11, conditions near Opportunity's locale — a valley on the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater — were good enough that the rover team ramped up its hailing efforts, kicking off a 45-day ""active listening"" campaign. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] That campaign is now two-thirds over, and there's still been nothing from the six-wheeled robot. If the clock runs out on Opportunity, NASA will reassess its recovery plans and efforts, agency officials have said. But engineers and technicians will continue listening for a ping from Opportunity in a more passive mode at least through January, mission managers have said. The venerable rover may be dead, done in by a combination of the darkness and the bitter Martian cold. Without any power, after all, Opportunity cannot run its onboard heaters. But there is still hope, even at this relatively late date. ""It's possible that a layer of dust deposited on the rover's solar panels by the recent global dust storm is blocking sunlight that could recharge its batteries. No one can tell just how much dust has been deposited on its panels,"" NASA officials wrote in an update yesterday (Oct. 11). ""A windy period on Mars — known to Opportunity's team as ""dust-clearing season"" — occurs in the November-to-January time frame and has helped clean the rover's panels in the past,"" they added. ""The team remains hopeful that some dust clearing may result in hearing from the rover in this period."" Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, three weeks after its twin, Spirit, touched down in a different part of the Red Planet. Both robots found lots of evidence that liquid water flowed across the surface of ancient Mars. Spirit and Opportunity were designed to roam for three months, but both rovers ground that warranty into the red dust. Spirit wasn't declared dead until 2011, and Opportunity was getting along just fine until the dust storm hit. NASA's other active Mars rover, Curiosity, relies on nuclear power and was therefore relatively unaffected by the storm.

Alex Darus,"NASA proclaimed that Opportunity Mars rover was officially dead on Wednesday, and its last message to Earth was the most emo thing weve ever heard. 
Opportunity was slated to operate for just 90 days but spent 15 years sending data back to our planet. 
The rover went dark eight months ago and Nasa revealed the last message they received from it. 
My battery is low and its getting dark, the message basically states. Break our hearts already. 
It has been reported that the solar-powered rover ended its life after a dust storm knocked it out. 
There were many efforts to reach out to Opportunity throughout the past 8 months. NASA sent out one final series of recovery commands Tuesday. They also sent a final wake up song of Billie Holidays Ill Be Seeing You. Seriously, we are crying. 
The final message brought tears to many team members who had worked with the rover. The team received nothing but silence after the final attempt. 
Even though its a machine and were saying goodbye, its still very hard and very poignant, but we had to do that. We came to that point, project manager John Callas said to a group of people who worked with both Opportunity and its twin rover, Spirit. 
NASA often used different songs to wake up the rover, which they turned into a Spotify playlist that you can check out below. The playlist includes Queen, the Foo Fighters, David Bowie and more. 
R.I.P Opportunity, you will be missed.

"Tariq Malik, SPACE.com","NASA’s Opportunity rover on Mars did not return a call from Earth Tuesday (June 12) while enduring a massive dust storm that scientists have called “one of the most intense ever observed."" “The Martian dust storm that has blotted out the sun above Opportunity has continued to intensify,” NASA officials wrote in a mission update Tuesday. “The storm, which was first detected on May 30, now blankets 14 million square miles (35 million square kilometers) of Martian surface—a quarter of the planet.” That means Opportunity’s solar panels aren’t getting enough sunlight to phone home from its Perseverance Valley location on Mars. Opportunity’s failure to reply to a signal from its mission operations center at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a sign the rover has entered a “low power fault mode” in which all the rover’s systems shut down except for a mission clock. That clock is programmed to wake up the rover periodically and check its power levels to see if it can call home. “If the rover’s computer determines that its batteries don’t have enough charge, it will again put itself back to sleep,” NASA officials said. “Due to an extreme amount of dust over Perseverance Valley, mission engineers believe it is unlikely the rover has enough sunlight to charge back up for at least the next several days.” The dust storm was first spotted on May 30 by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and it has been growing ever since. NASA has continued to track the storm from orbit and the surface. In addition to Opportunity, the Mars rover Curiosity is monitoring dust levels from the storm. Scientists think the power level in Opportunity’s batteries is below 24 volts. If the rover loses power for an extended amount of time, there is a chance it won’t be able to power the heaters needed to keep its electronics alive. The extreme cold of Mars is thought to be what killed Opportunity’s twin, the Spirit rover, after it got stuck in Martian sand in 2010. Opportunity has seen its share of dust storms on Mars. In 2007, a planetwide dust storm blotted out the sun for two weeks. Opportunity went silent during that storm, too, but survived. The nearly 15-year-old rover launched in 2003 and has been exploring Mars since it landed in January 2004. Opportunity has lasted more than 50 times longer than its original 90-day mission plan, NASA officials have said. NASA will hold a teleconference today at 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT) to discuss the Martian dust storm, its impact on Opportunity and how scientists are tracking it with spacecraft in orbit.

Meghan Bartels Space.com Senior Writer,"The planet-enveloping dust storm on Mars has settled enough for NASA to start a 45-day active-listening period in which the agency hopes to make contact with the rover Opportunity after three months of silence, NASA announced yesterday (Sept. 11). So, for the next 45 days, NASA engineers will nudge the spacecraft several times a day, rather than the three times a week that had been the procedure. That schedule is based on the hope that the rover is now harvesting enough solar power to receive and respond to commands. In this ""active-listening"" procedure, NASA will send instructions that force the rover to create a signal at a specific frequency if it is powered up and not seriously damaged. If the rover has not yet made contact when those 45 days have ended, NASA will have to determine how to proceed. In a statement released Aug. 30, the agency said it would continue to listen passively for the rover until the end of January. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] The new stage of the recovery plan was triggered when NASA made two consecutive measurements of atmospheric opacity, called tau, of less than 1.5. When Opportunity first lost contact with Earth, that measurement was above 10. The agency hopes that now that the dust is settling out of the Martian skies, the rover's solar panels will be able to successfully charge so the can robot re-establish contact with Earth. When the plan was announced, some scientists affiliated with the mission expressed concern that pegging this active-listening period to the atmospheric opacity would start the clock on Opportunity too soon. That's because all that dust simply falls down, which means there's nothing to stop it from falling onto the rover's solar panels. And if the problem is dust blocking the solar panels from charging, it doesn't matter whether the dust is floating in the air or resting on the panels. Mars has seasonal weather patterns called dust devils that could clear that dust away, but those won't begin until November — by which point, the 45 days of active outreach will have ended. The rover has been exploring the surface of Mars since 2004, far outlasting its original mission timeline of 90 Martian days (a Martian day is about 40 minutes longer than a terrestrial one). But the engineers and scientists who control the rover haven't heard a peep from Opportunity since June 10. They hope the robot is merely hibernating, waiting for the dust to settle. Either way, the next 45 days may be the best chance Opportunity has left.

Jennifer Earl,"For over two months, there has been no sign of NASA's Mars Opportunity rover. The car-sized space machine, worth a whopping $400 million, signed offline as it disappeared inside a massive Martian dust storm on June 10. A team of scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. have been eagerly listening for signs of life from the rover. So far, all they've heard is silence. But as the dust starts to settle, the team is hopeful Opportunity will awaken. MARS CURIOSITY ROVER'S SURPRISING FINDS FROM THE RED PLANET THROUGH THE YEARS ""Since the last contact with the rover... Opportunity has likely experienced a low-power fault and perhaps, a mission clock fault and now an up-loss fault,"" NASA explained in a July 31 blog post. The Opportunity rover has made several ground-breaking discoveries throughout its roughly 15-year trip on the Red Planet. Since leaving Earth on July 7, 2003, the research vehicle has detected signs of water, explored the insides of two craters and completed a marathon — the first vehicle to do so on another planet. NASA/U. Cornell/JPL (NASA launched the Opportunity rover to the Red Planet on July 7, 2003.) But the Opportunity's journey hasn't always been a smooth one. In 2005, the rover lost the use of one of its front wheels and got stuck in a thick pile of sand for about five weeks, according to Space.com. When it finally managed to move, it ran into a sand dune. In 2007, a dust storm hit and reportedly cut the spacecraft's power to ""dangerously low levels."" A month later, it turned back on and began exploring the Victoria Crater. Despite its obstacles, the Opportunity has always managed to pull through. But this time, researchers aren't sure what will happen. MARS OPPORTUNITY ROVER HAS IMAGE OF UNIDENTIFIED METALLIC OBJECT, PUTS INTERNET IN A FRENZY ""The storm is one of the most intense ever observed on the Red Planet,"" NASA said in early June. ""As of June 10, it covered more than 15.8 million square miles (41 million square kilometers) – about the area of North America and Russia combined. It has blocked out so much sunlight, it has effectively turned day into night for Opportunity, which is located near the center of the storm, inside Mars' Perseverance Valley."" Now, researchers are playing the waiting game. The government space agency said those in charge of the Opportunity will attempt communication with the vehicle up to three times a week, hoping it will eventually exit sleep mode. However, NASA says researchers don't expect it to wake up ""until there has been a significant reduction in the atmospheric opacity over the rover site."" Michael Staab, an engineer at JPL, said Opportunity's silence is concerning, adding that there's still a lot of work to be done. ""Morale has been a little shaky,"" Staab told Space.com. ""This is the first time she [Opportunity] has stopped talking to us and not resumed communication when we expected."" In the meantime, researchers are trying to stay positive, creating a Mars-themed Spotify playlist — featuring ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" by Wham!, ""Rocket Man"" by Elton John, among others — and an office pool to help pass the time. ""It could take weeks — hopefully not months,"" Staab told the site. ""I wish we had something to share; I wish we had good news. But we keep listening every day."" NASA's $2.5 billion Curiosity rover is still in good shape, though. The vehicle celebrated its sixth anniversary on Mars on Aug. 5. Jennifer Earl is an SEO editor for Fox News.

PTI,"WASHINGTON: The record-breaking 15-year-long Mars mission of NASA's Opportunity rover was declared over after the US space agency failed to contact the robotic explorer for over eight months.
The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June last year.
After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, to no avail.
The solar-powered rover's final communication was received June 10.
Designed to last just 90 Martian days and travel 1,000 metres, Opportunity vastly surpassed all expectations in its endurance, scientific value and longevity.
In addition to exceeding its life expectancy by 60 times, the rover travelled more than 45 kilometres by the time it reached its most appropriate final resting spot on Mars -- Perseverance Valley.
""For more than a decade, Opportunity has been an icon in the field of planetary exploration, teaching us about Mars' ancient past as a wet, potentially habitable planet, and revealing uncharted Martian landscapes,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
""Whatever loss we feel now must be tempered with the knowledge that the legacy of Opportunity continues -- both on the surface of Mars with the Curiosity rover and InSight lander -- and in the clean rooms of JPL, where the upcoming Mars 2020 rover is taking shape,"" said Zurbuchen.
The final transmission, sent via the 70-metre Mars Station antenna at NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Complex in California, ended a multifaceted, eight-month recovery strategy in an attempt to compel the rover to communicate.
""We have made every reasonable engineering effort to try to recover Opportunity and have determined that the likelihood of receiving a signal is far too low to continue recovery efforts,"" said John Callas, manager of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project at JPL.
Opportunity landed in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars on January 24, 2004, seven months after its launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
Its twin rover, Spirit, landed 20 days earlier in the 166-kilometre-wide Gusev Crater on the other side of Mars.
Spirit logged almost eight kilometres before its mission wrapped up in May 2011.
From the day Opportunity landed, the mission team on Earth collaborated to overcome challenges and get the rover from one geologic site on Mars to the next.
They plotted workable avenues over rugged terrain so that the 174-kilogramme Martian explorer could manoeuvre around and, at times, over rocks and boulders, climb gravel-strewn slopes as steep as 32-degrees, probe crater floors, summit hills and traverse possible dry riverbeds.
Its final venture brought it to the western limb of Perseverance Valley.
""I cannot think of a more appropriate place for Opportunity to endure on the surface of Mars than one called Perseverance Valley,"" said Michael Watkins, director of JPL.
Mars exploration continues unabated.

Amanda Kooser,"The rough and rocky landscape of Mars continues to take a toll on the wheels of NASA's Curiosity rover. As part of a routine checkup, Curiosity snapped some new images of its wheels this week. 
Most of the photos don't look too alarming, but one in particular shows some dramatic holes and cracks in the aluminum. 
The Mars rocks are giving Curiosity's wheels a hard time.
NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS
NASA has been monitoring Curiosity's wheel damage for years, watching it increase from dents to holes to actual cracks in some of the raised treads. Images from early 2017 delivered the first evidence of the tread breakage, with the left-middle wheel showing the most stress.
The car-size Curiosity rolls around on six wheels. NASA has already implemented measures designed to protect them, including a software update that adjusts the speed of the rover's wheels to reduce pressure from rocks. 
NASA said in 2017 that it fully expects the wheels to last for the life of the mission. The rover has traversed over 12 miles (19 kilometers) across Mars since landing in 2012.
The Curiosity team is preparing to take another look at the wheels after the rover takes a short drive in Gale Crater as it continues its studies of the Mount Sharp area. It's currently observing a localized dust storm, which won't affect the rover's ability to do its work.",It's still business as usual on Mars for the plucky rover.,2019-01-17T19:25:52Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",NASA eyes gaping holes in Mars Curiosity wheel - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-eyes-gaping-holes-in-mars-curiosity-rover-wheel/,https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/SEMECtbRE-cJPF9zuc-XhGCSn1o=/724x407/2019/01/17/afd45836-af7a-4c7c-b2ae-7d8d8ec0b785/curiositywheel2019.jpg,,Cnet.com,dust storm,1
Amanda Kooser,"Curiosity is one charming rover.
NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS
After officially losing the Opportunity rover to a dust storm on Mars, fans of machines on the Red Planet were starting to get antsy about NASA's still-functioning Curiosity rover. The rover website hadn't received mission updates or new raw images for a week. 
Now we know why.
NASA announced Friday that Curiosity experienced a ""hiccup during boot-up"" the previous Friday. This triggered the rover to go into safe mode and interrupted its planned science activities.
Curiosity has since successfully booted up over 30 times with no sign of further problems, but the rover team is still receiving and looking through technical data to diagnose the mysterious issue. 
""We're currently working to take a snapshot of its memory to better understand what might have happened,"" said Steven Lee, Curiosity's deputy project manager. NASA is putting the rover's science operations on hold while it investigates.
The rover has run into some technical snafus in the past, including a memory glitch in late 2018. 
Curiosity is currently exploring an interesting new clay region of Mars nicknamed Glen Torridon. The team is eyeing a possible drilling location at a distance of 656 feet (200 meters) away. 
Hopefully, Curiosity will soon get the all-clear from NASA to resume its science duties.","Don't scare us like that, Curiosity.",2019-02-22T22:29:14Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","NASA Mars rover Curiosity hiccups, takes a break from science - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-mars-rover-curiosity-hiccups-takes-a-break-from-science/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/TlcFr03W6SSuHapx_LdilEvoCj0=/724x407/2018/01/24/2a96771e-3200-4c0e-9597-7b8af2cee2a4/curiosityroverselfie.jpg,,Cnet.com,dust storm,1
Catie Keck,"Space enthusiasts collectively mourned this week with the death of Opportunity, the Martian rover that chugged along making important scientific discoveries for far, far longer than it was expected to explore the Red Planet. In case you missed it, Gizmodo wrote about the incredible distance traveled by Opportunity during its time on Mars, as well as well as one of its most mystifying discoveries.
It wasnt all sad news this week, though. For one, Apples streaming service thats sounding increasingly similar to an Amazon Prime Video-like product got everyone buzzing ahead of its expected introduction at a March event (but dont expect an official releasetoo soon). Were also looking forward to some nifty right-click features in Gmail and soonas in starting this week.

Tom McKay,"Its April 2019and perhaps the month that will later be known as the dawn of the Age of Fungus. A concerning report in the New York Times this weekend detailed how multiple strains of Candida auris, a drug-resistant species of pathogenic fungus, have quietly spread across the globe. The Centers for Disease Control reports a fatality rate of nearly 50 percent within 90 days of infection and the agencys fungal branch chief, Dr. Tom Chiller, described it to the paper as a creature from the black lagoon that bubbled up and now it is everywhere. Theorized to have spread as widespread use of fungicides weakened the hold of less-resistant species, C. auris is not only deadly, but extremely difficult to eradicate.
In other words, another straw on the human species collective back! But were not quite in The Girl with All the Gifts territory yet, and plenty of other worthy news is competing for your attention. This week, Gizmodos reporters looked into leaked Microsoft emails that appear to show a nightmarish environment for female staff, the drugs that people like to use while having sex, Facebooks failure to change even after accusations of complicity in the Myanmar genocide, and a labor unions resistance to Amazons heavy-handed union-busting tactics. We also found the time to look into the discovery of an ancient, four-legged whale, a poop-sniffing dog mapping a wildlife sanctuary, and just who the heck Ultraman is.

Lulu Chang,"NASA It’s been a decade and a half since NASA’s Opportunity rover has been home on Earth. Over the course of the last 15 years, this trusty robot has been roaming the surface of the Red Planet, but now, we may have lost her — at least, temporarily. A massive dust storm that is about the size of our continent (that is to say, North America) has now shrouded Mars, and has covered Opportunity for the last several days. Not only is much of the planet in the dark, but so too is Earth about Opportunity’s whereabouts and her status — alas, because the robot’s solar panels have been unable to receive light, its battery status has dropped enough to put Opportunity to sleep, which means she’s no longer transmitting information to Earth. “It’s gotten so bad she’s not talking to us,” Bill Nelson, chief of the Opportunity mission’s engineering team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Mashable. “It’s a bit scary — we like to hear from our rover.” Well over a week ago on June 8, NASA announced that Opportunity had been covered by the veil of “perpetual night” thanks to the massive dust storm. And although Opportunity has weathered many a storm since it first touched down on the Red Planet’s surface in 2004, this one is particularly bad. Now, we’re all waiting with bated breath to see whether or not the rover will be able to re-power once the storm finally calms. “If they go completely dead, you’re usually in trouble,” Nelson noted. But Opportunity has beat the odds before. After all, the 400 pound rover was only meant to be operational for 90 days. It’s exceeded that expectation thus far by a factor of more than 56, and it’s possible that it’ll keep defying expectations. As Nelson said, “I’m fairly optimistic at this point. I’m hopeful that we may be able to recover.” That said, the dust storm that Opportunity is facing now is exactly what scientists initially thought would kill the rover. After all, with Martian dust and grime accumulation, it seemed like only a matter of time before the solar panels were obscured enough to make it impossible for Opportunity to keep on keepin’ on. However, Nelson explained, “We’ve been lucky that winds or dust devils have come and blown off the arrays. The wind blows off the bulk of the dust.” He added, “We’ve been fairly fortunate in missing the regional and global dust storms.” The same could not be said for Opportunity’s sister, Spirit, who met her end in 2010. That poor rover ended up getting stuck in a part of Mars that didn’t receive as much sunlight, and before engineers were able to move Spirit to a more advantageous location, time ran out. Apparently, Spirit “froze to death.” In any case, we’ll have to see if Opportunity can live up to her name and battle out this latest obstacle. We’re certainly keeping our fingers crossed.","A massive dust storm that is about the size of our continent (that is to say, North America) has now shrouded Mars, and has covered Opportunity for the last seven days or so.

"Mary Beth Griggs, Mary Beth Griggs","There's a particular agony that hollows out your heart, waiting on a call that's late, and might never come. It's worse when you know that on the other end of the line is danger, and you're too far away to offer any measure of protection beyond your watchful waiting, which is no safety at all. Are you OK? Let me know that you made it. Opportunity, the longest-running Mars rover, is currently in a bad spot. It's smack in the middle of an intensifying dust storm, where fine particles of dust as thin as talcum powder billow so thickly that they block out the Sun. NASA researchers put it in a power-saving mode last week, suspending science operations to prioritize Opportunity's survival. The rover was supposed to check in periodically until the storm passed, sleeping during the stretches of silence. It missed its scheduled call home on Tuesday, leaving its minders on the ground worried about its welfare—and with no way to check and see if it's OK. ""At this point we’re in a waiting mode. We’re listening every day for possible signals from the rover and are prepared to respond to that,"" John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at a press conference on Wednesday. Opportunity is solar powered, so the dark and dusty night it finds itself in could be a death sentence. If it uses up the energy in its batteries and can't get enough light on its solar panels to recharge them, Opportunity might be stranded. The power generation in sleep mode is so low that it might eventually lose the ability to power its internal clock. Recovery from a clock fault is still possible, but would take longer, requiring the awakened rover to set timers and enter a sleep-wake cycle until it registers that the Sun is up and it can communicate with Earth again. However, there is still hope that it won't succumb to bitter cold like its sister rover Spirit did in 2010. Opportunity is designed to exist in temperatures down to -67 degrees Fahrenheit during hibernation. Fortunately, thanks to the insulation of the dust and the fact that it's Martian summer near Opportunity, temperatures near the rover aren't expected to get below -33 degrees F. ""We should be able to ride out this storm,"" said Callas. ""When the skies clear and the rover powers up, it should be able to communicate with us."" The storm Opportunity finds itself in is startlingly intense—with enough dust to block out the bright midday Sun—and now covers 14 million square miles, a quarter of the planet. Mars has endured global dust storms before, which lasted for weeks or months, and it's possible that this storm might continue to grow and persist. NASA researchers plan to keep a close eye on the storm as it develops, using information from Opportunity (if available), the rover Curiosity on the other side of the planet, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey, and MAVEN. The hope is to gather data that could help forecast future tempests, and help understand what drives a regional storm to expand into a larger, planet-wide event. ""Of those regional storms that do occur [on Mars], only a dozen or so have ever in the historical or modern record expanded to cover the globe,"" said Rich Zurek, Mars Program Office chief scientist at JPL. ""The current storm is only days away from meeting that classification of a planet-encircling dust event."" Researchers on another mission, NASA’s InSight lander, are watching the developments of this storm closely. InSight is scheduled to land on Mars in November, which is still dust storm season on the planet. This storm isn't expected to last that long, but another one could crop up. The mission is prepared for the possibility of a global dust storm, but it does add an element of challenge to the landing attempt. For now, though, all attention is on Opportunity. Mission engineers think that it will be several days before the rover can get enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. Because they weren’t able to contact Opportunity on Tuesday, they think that the rover may have shifted into what’s called ‘low power fault mode,’ where all its systems except for a clock shut down. The clock will periodically wake the computer, which will check to see if the batteries have been charged. If they have, the rover will start back up. If not, it will remain asleep. ""We’re concerned, but we’re hopeful that the storm will clear and the rover will begin to communicate with us,"" Callas said. It’s getting bad out there, how are you holding up? Opportunity has already endured far more than it was ever expected to when it started its 90-day mission back on January 25, 2004. Instead of lasting three months, it's lasted 14 and a half years (and counting), traveling 28.06 miles and getting intelligence upgrades along the way. It even weathered another dust storm back in 2007. Even with all its accomplishments, the rover isn't immortal. For one thing, it isn't alive—and even the most durable machine has a limited lifetime. ""We're all pulling for Opportunity. As you all know, it's been a remarkably resilient rover,"" said Jim Watzin, director of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program. ""Regardless of how this turns out, this little rover has proven to be an invaluable investment that has increased our ability to explore the red planet."" For us, and the people at NASA who work most closely with the rover, there is nothing to do but wait. Callas described the mood as similar to watching over a loved one in a coma. “This team has a very strong bond with the rover, and we have a tight emotional connection with it,” Callas said. “By no means are we out of the woods here. This storm is threatening, and we don’t know how long it will last and what the environment will be like when it clears. We’re all concerned.” Hey Opportunity, it's Earth again. Call home when you get a chance, we're worried about you.","Space It's caught in a storm that now covers a quarter of the planet, and is still growing. It missed it's call home to Earth yesterday, leaving it's minders on the ground worried about its welfare, and with no way to check and see if it's OK.",2018-06-13T18:57:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Popsci.com'}","NASA lost contact with Opportunity Mars rover, but there's still hope",https://www.popsci.com/mars-rover-opportunity-dust-storm-sleep,https://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/2018/06/pia22521.jpg?itok=60va2TXg,,Popsci.com,dust storm,1

The Pueblo Chieftain reports the fire started east of the city on Tuesday afternoon and forced more than 200 families from their homes. No injuries were reported, and the fire had slowed by late afternoon. Pueblo County sheriff's deputies and other officers went door to door to warn residents to get out, and gusty winds were expected to continue into the night. Meanwhile, El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder tells The Gazette that another wildfire burned at least 10 buildings close to Interstate 25 near Colorado Springs.

Colin Dwyer,"Mourners pray for the victims of the Camp Fire during a vigil Sunday in Chico, Calif. The wildfire killed dozens of people and effectively wiped the entire town of Paradise off the map. Noah Berger/AP Just a week and a half after deadly wildfires erupted in California, devouring iconic landmarks in the state's south and effectively wiping out an entire town to the north, there's a ray of hope. The Woolsey Fire is nearing full containment around Malibu, while Butte County firefighters are steadily reining in the Camp Fire and may get help in the form of a rain-heavy forecast. Yet the precipitation, which could help one problem, threatens to cause still another. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for the regions battered by the Camp Fire from Wednesday through Friday. The agency warns that more than 4 inches of rain could fall by Sunday. With rain back in the forecast, previously burned areas will experience ash flow. If the rain becomes heavy over one of these burned areas, debris flow may be possible. Be prepared if you live near an affected area. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/ihRACDAp4a — NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) November 19, 2018 ""Properties impacted by the wildfires, and downstream of those areas, are at risk for flash flooding, mudflows and debris flows during periods of intense rainfall,"" Butte County officials explained in a statement released Monday night. ""Wildfires can alter the terrain and soil conditions reducing the capacity for the ground to absorb water creating conditions for these type of hazards."" That means new misery for the survivors of California's deadliest wildfire on record. The Camp Fire has killed at least 79 people, and with the missing still numbering near 700, the death toll may increase in the coming days. Many of those residents who survived are homeless and have been settled in makeshift tent communities outdoors in nearby Chico. ""I'm so at a loss as to what to do and where to go,"" Jason Young, one of more than 100 evacuees housed in tents beside a local Walmart, told the Chico Enterprise-Record on Tuesday. ""We're straight exiled from our homes, whether they're standing or not. It's still where many of us grew up."" Evacuees retire to their tents for the night in a Walmart parking lot over the weekend in Chico, Calif. The deadliest fire on record in the state has left the living scrambling for answers. Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images At least half of the six emergency shelters serving evacuees in the area are full, according to member station KQED. The coming storms also promise a mixed bag for recovery crews and forensics teams in the area, creating a ""muddy, mushy mess"" as one expert told Reuters but potentially easing search efforts in the long run, as well. ""You get rid of the dust, these dogs have a better chance at pinpointing and following their nose to where there may be remains,"" Shawn Boyd of the state's Office of Emergency Services told a local CNN affiliate. To the south, as much as an inch of rain also is in the forecast for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, where the Woolsey Fire has burned. And though rainfall totals are expected to be lower than in Northern California, the canyon roads along the Southern California coast have officials and residents just as concerned. One need not look far to understand why. When the deadly Thomas Fire ravaged Santa Barbara County late last year, consuming hundreds of thousands of acres north of Ventura, the ashy wastes it left behind gave way to mudslides at the first major rain. More people died in the ensuing mudslides than in the blaze itself, which at the time was California's largest wildfire in history. The Paramount Ranch, a national landmark, burned to the ground during the Woolsey Fire. Last week a photograph of the former property sat among its ashes. Jae C. Hong/AP It took residents months just to dig their homes out after the 30-square-mile debris flow overwhelmed the community of of Montecito. ""We want people to closely monitor social media and be careful as they re-enter the area, because we have extremely steep terrain that's been damaged by the fire,"" Capt. Tony Imbrenda of the Los Angeles County Fire Department told a local NBC affiliate. County officials are warning residents to start picking up sandbags now before the rains. Still, not all the news that has surfaced lately has been ominous. Authorities expect the Woolsey Fire to be fully contained by Thanksgiving, and thousands of evacuees have been allowed to return home in time for the holiday. ""Time for us to start putting it back together,"" Malibu Mayor Rick Mullen said in a recorded message to the community. ""Reach out to your neighbors who lost everything that was dear to them. It's time for us to count our blessings.""","Rain is in the forecast for California regions decimated by the Camp and Woolsey fires.

Tim Donnelly,"I am, to be clear, a believer in the power of putting arbitrary constraints on yourself in order to achieve something. It’s why I make to-do lists (and write “make to-do list” at the top of the list, for an immediate hit of accomplishment), why I demand deadline even when writing an evergreen story and why I agree self-improvement doesn’t just manifest itself out of thin air without a little bit of nudge from an app or a calendar or some sort of Black Mirror drone with axes for fingers that literally chases you out of bed to start your morning run. I am also, however, a complete skeptic of schemes that are doomed to fail: the friend who keeps getting back with that boyfriend they’ve already broken up with six times before, gimmick diets that don’t involve eating vegetables, seeing any more of the Alien sequels. I am an avowed hater of New Year’s resolutions for that reason: they are all doomed to fail and everyone knows it. This is in part because many of them are trendy, faux-wellness commitments people jump on board with because everyone is already doing it, and then give up on two weeks later when everyone else is giving up as well. But my anti-resolution stance also has to do with the timing. January is nature’s perfect resolution-killing machine. Last week, for instance, the bomb cyclone (or whatever hot #rebrand for the concept of “winter storm” you prefer), dumped a huge ol’ mess of snow and brought whipping winds to a lot of the East Coast, from Boston to Savannah. Let’s say you had resolved just four days earlier to go to the gym more, eat better and quit drinking for a month (the trend whose name is too monstrous of a portmanteau for me to even acknowledge here). Cyclone-snowbound, you would have found yourself with a big bag of fuck-all to do that day, and mounting guilt for not overpowering nature itself in order to forge ahead with your resolutions. January is the month for getting your house in order, and no aspect of one’s life gets quite so… Read more Read So consider this: if you still prefer the resolution model of self-improvement, in which you adhere to specific challenges that begin on a specific date, don’t start those resolutions in January. Start them on April 1st instead. Winter is the time your body craves sloth. You are evolutionarily predisposed to put on weight and store calories to avoid risk of starvation during the cold, fallow months. The outside is a slushy, gray, increasingly bleak landscape of growing garbage-bag snow mountains, as uninviting to human presence as a Kevin Spacey movie. Over the past two winters, America became obsessed with the Danish concept of Hygge, essentially extreme coziness. This is because winter is hell, and the only thing that makes it tolerable is leaning into the coziness it allows. Pour yourself a cup of mulled wine and invite your friends over to play Rocket League for hours at a time and watch all of Riverdale (I hear it’s weird!). Self-motivation will come soon, a few months down the road. Think about it like eating seasonally (something you should be doing anyway for the good of the environment). The earth gives you things you need according to the season: in the summer, we get juicy berries, watermelon, cucumbers and so forth to keep us cool and hydrated. The winter gives us hearty squashes, potatoes and beets to help store calories, and the spring brings leafy greens to help you detox after the hibernation months. January is the squash of months. You can fight the natural order of things, and ship in berries (a.k.a. “resolutions”) from far away, but they won’t taste right, and you’re fighting against biology and the earth itself. Develop your taste for berries when they are in season, however, and you’ll easily be hooked. Just as important as setting New Year’s resolutions is figuring out how we reach them, and not… Read more Read The point is, treat your body seasonally, too. If you must make a resolution, don’t waste it on January, when you almost certainly won’t succeed, and—since you have subscribed to the concept of an annual resolution—your whole year will then be considered a wash. Make your resolutions on April 1st, when you have a fighting chance of achieving them. Why April specifically? March drops a teaser trailer for spring ahead but it’s also a torrent of a month, full of late-season blizzards and brutal cold snaps. But April, friends, April is when the world turns around and the cobwebs clear. It’s time to shape up and shake off the winter doldrums. Nature comes back to life and so do you. April 1st is the perfect day to squeeze into some running tights (yes it will still be slightly chilly—you’re getting a jump on the spring, you go-getter!), dust off your bike and get moving again. The days are longer so your solar batteries get a natural boost (sunset Jan. 1: 4:39 p.m.; Sunset April 1: 7:21 p.m.!). And in the unlikely event that the gym is still full of January’s resolution-havers, too, you can also go running outdoors again. And if you wish to quit drinking for a month or quit smoking forever, April is the time to do it because there is simply much more to do once the world comes back to life. Instead of drinking, perhaps you join a kickball league like Brooklyn hipsters of yore, or become one of those people obsessed with photographing the cherry blossoms at your local botanic garden, or just go for long walks and take that kind of deep inhale to let that still-warming spring air fill your lungs as you recall the winter misery behind you and think: “This, this is the spring I turn myself around.” Relax this winter and wrap yourself in Hygge or whatever comforts you can find to get you through this most miserable month in one of the most miserable times in history. In April, let’s get to work.","I am, to be clear, a believer in the power of putting arbitrary constraints on yourself in order to achieve something.

The Conversation,"Metallic shrapnel flying faster than bullets; the Space Shuttle smashed to pieces; astronauts killed or ejected into space. The culprit? Space debris – remnants of a Russian satellite blown up by a Russian missile. The one survivor, Ryan Stone, has to find her way back to Earth with oxygen supplies failing and the nearest viable spacecraft hundreds of miles away. Over on Mars, 20 years in the future, an exploration mission from Earth is going wrong. An epic dust storm forces the crew to abandon the planet, leaving behind an astronaut, Mark Watney, who is presumed dead. He has to figure out how to grow food while awaiting rescue. Hollywood knows how to terrify and inspire us about outer space. Movies like Gravity (2013) and The Martian (2015), present space as hostile and unpredictable – spelling danger for any intrepid human who dares to venture outside Earth’s hospitable confines. Matt Damon is … Pe3k This is only part of the story, however – the bit with people center stage. Sure, no one wants to see astronauts killed or stranded in space. And we all want to enjoy the fruits of successful planetary science, like determining which planets could host human life or simply whether we’re alone in the universe. Valuing space But should we care about the universe beyond how it affects us as humans? That is the big question – call it question #1 of extraterrestrial environmental ethics, a field too many people have ignored for too long. I’m one of a group of researchers at the University of St Andrews trying to change that. How we ought to value the universe depends on two other intriguing philosophical questions: Question #2: the kind of life we are most likely to discover elsewhere is microbial – so how should we view this lifeform? Most people would accept that all humans have intrinsic value, and matter not only in relation to their usefulness to someone else. Accept this and it follows that ethics places limits on how we may treat them and their living spaces. People are starting to accept that the same is true of mammals, birds, and other animals. So what about microbial beings? Some philosophers like Albert Schweitzer and Paul Taylor have previously argued that all living things have a value in themselves, which would obviously include microbes. Philosophy as a whole has not reached a consensus, however, on whether it agrees with this so-called biocentrism. ‘What do we want, rights for microbes …’ Who is Danny Question #3: for planets and other places not hospitable to life, what value should we place on their environment? Arguably we care about our environment on Earth primarily because it supports the species that live here. If so, we might extend the same thinking to other planets and moons that can support life. But this doesn’t work for “dead” planets. Some have proposed an idea called aesthetic value, that certain things should be treasured not because they are useful but because they are aesthetically wonderful. They have applied this not only to great artistic works like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Beethoven’s Fifth but also to parts of the Earth’s environment, such as the Grand Canyon. Could that apply to other planets? Alien environments Supposing we could answer these theoretical questions, we could proceed to four important practical questions about space exploration: Yip yip. Keith Loh, CC BY-SA Question #4: is there a duty to protect the environment on other planets? When it comes to sending astronauts, instruments or robots to other worlds, there are clearly important scientific reasons for making sure they don’t take terrestrial organisms with them and wind up depositing them there. Otherwise, if we discovered life, we wouldn’t know whether it was indigenous – not to mention the risk of wiping it out entirely. But is scientific clarity all that matters, or do we need to start thinking about galactic environmental protection? Question #5: what, besides biological contamination, would count as violating such an obligation to treat that planet’s environment with respect? Drilling for core samples, perhaps, or leaving instruments behind, or putting tire tracks in the dirt? Question #6: what about asteroids? The race is well underway to develop technology to harvest the untold trillions of pounds of mineral wealth presumed to exist on asteroids, as already reported in The Conversation. It helps that no one seems to think of asteroids as environments we need to protect. Gold in them craters. Jan Kaliciak The same goes for empty space. The movie Gravity gave us some human-centered reasons to be worried about the buildup of debris in space, but might there be other reasons to object? If so, would our obligation be to merely create less debris, or something stronger – like not producing any new debris or even cleaning up what we’ve left already? Question #7: what considerations might offset arguments in favor of behaving ethically in space? Of the various reasons for going there – intellectual/scientific, utilitarian, profit-driven – are any strong enough to override our obligations? We also need to factor in the inevitable risks and uncertainties here. We can’t know what benefits space missions will have. We can’t be certain of not biologically contaminating the planets we visit. What risk/reward trade-offs should we be willing to undertake? Terra-ism Discussions about outer space have the advantage that we have very little attachment to anything out there. These ethical questions might, therefore, be some of the only ones humans can address with a large measure of emotional distance. For this reason, answering them might help us to make progress with Earth-bound issues like global warming, mass extinction, and nuclear waste disposal. Space exploration also directly raises questions about our relationship to Earth – once we overcome the technological puzzles preventing the terraforming of a planet like Mars, or find ways of reaching habitable exoplanets. I’ll leave you with one extremely important one for the future: Question #8: given that the Earth is not the only potential home for human beings, what reasons for protecting its environment would remain once we can realistically go somewhere else?

"USA TODAY, Joel Shannon, USA TODAY","NASAs longest-running rover on Mars, Opportunity, is no more. Officials declared the 15-year-old rover Opportunity dead Wednesday, eight months after by a ferocious dust storm in June. (Feb. 13)
 AP
On the same day that NASA declared the 15-year-old Mars rover Opportunity dead, the official Twitter account for the Curiosity Rover paid tribute to the older rover with a poem styled after Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind.""
Curiosity has been exploring Mars since 2012. Opportunity reached Mars with its identical twin Spirit in 2004. Opportunity far outperformed its initial mission: to operate as a geologist for just three months after reaching Mars.
Curiosity's Twitter account posted the tribute Wednesday:
It seems to me you lived your life
like a rover in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the dust set in.
Your tracks will always fall here,
among Mars' reddest hills;
your candle's burned out long before
your science ever will.
The tweet concluded: ""#ThanksOppy. I owe you so much.
Opportunity was declared dead after becoming caught in a massive dust storm in June. The storm lasted months, cutting off the rover's solar power and its contact with earth. It also was likely left vulnerable to bitter Martian cold. 
It seems to me you lived your life like a rover in the wind never fading with the sunset when the dust set in.

Scientists and engineers who work with the Mars rovers share a close bond with the machines. Some regard them almost like their own children.
The tweeted tribute was closely styled after Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind,"" a 1973 tribute to Marilyn Monroe that was famously revised and performed at Princess Diana's funeral, CNN reports.
Opportunity roamed the red planets surface for an unprecedented 28 miles. It outlived its identical twin, which was declared dead in 2011.

To celebrate Earth Day 2018, Seeed and hackster.io have launched an Earth Day contest to encourage the community to make &amp; share projects that benefit the planet! The contest will give away 15 awesome Seeed &amp; Hackster-powered prizes for the top submissions, including a trip to Shenzhen during Maker Faire Shenzhen. More info about the contest, please visit here. If you are still struggling about what to make, here are some cool environmental projects. Hope they could inspire you. As more and more litter ends up in oceans, marine lives are put in danger. In order to detect how litter enters the sea through storm drains and rivers, WWF -Hong Kong, in cooperation with MakerBay, has designed tracking devices to deploy a network of over 100 GPS trackers in the ocean in 2016. The data collected by the devices are transformed by leaflet-powered data visualization into Ocean Litter Real-time Map. Seeed participated and provided electronics parts and technical support for the project. And now, the project is still ongoing with more schools and makers involved. Learn more here. In 2014,engineer Mrutyunjay Mishra teamed up with German journalist Ulrike Reinhard to make the AirOwl Project happen. They placed sensor kits in different places within the city. The sensor kit contains 9 different sensors including temperature, humidity and air quality etc. And they monitored the environmental data of this city during Kumbh Mela (the largest carnival in India, with more than 20 million people participated), and shared the data on the web. In this way, people can learn about human activities’ influence on the environment. For this project, they used Seeed’s #Grove sensors to make the first prototype, and upgraded AirOwl into an affordable DIY personal air quality (Dust SPM 2.5 &amp; 10 micron) monitoring device. It generates real-time dust pollution data and shows it on this open data project website and a free mobile app (Android, iOS) that anyone can download. Learn more here. Data Canvas is a co-worked project by Lift, Gray Area, the Swissnex network and Seeed in 2014. By encouraging more people to participate in sensor setup, the project aims to build a 100-sensor DIY network around the world. It collected and visualized open data, measuring air quality, noise, pollution, light, and temperature in all six cities. The six cities include Rio de Janiero, San Francisco, Boston, Bangalore, Singapore, Shanghai, and Geneva. Learn more here. Reflecting The Stars Due to the serious light pollution, stars are invisible to the unassisted eye in cities like New York. In order to remind people of the seriousness of air and light pollution, artist Jon Morris created Reflecting the Stars, an art installation that re-creates constellations on the surface of Hudson River in Manhattan in 2011. The installation consists of a network of over 200 wireless sensors scattered throughout the river, connecting wirelessly with one master control panel on land. At night, a set of 201 LED lights twinkle in various patterns as the tides conceal and reveal the lights. Visitors on shore can press buttons, which highlight constellations within the lights that are no longer seen in urban centers because of air and light pollution. Learn more here.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","A meteor from the Leonids meteor shower, visible as a diagonal streak between the fingers of a cactus plant, is seen in this time exposure early Sunday, Nov. 18, 2001, in Tucson, Ariz. (Photo: James S. Wood, Associated Press) Be sure to keep an eye to the sky this weekend: The peak of the Leonid meteor shower— an annual mid-November treat — will be visible across the night sky late Friday night and early Saturday morning. The Leonids appear to be coming from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence their name) in the east, but they should be visible all the way across the sky. Some of the greatest meteor showers ever seen have been the Leonids. Some years, they've been a full-fledged meteor storm: The 1833 Leonid meteor storm included rates as high as an amazing 100,000 meteors per hour, Earthsky.org said. No such storm is forecast this year, though: Viewers should see an hourly rate of some 10 to 20 meteors. Also known as ""shooting stars,"" the meteors are actually leftover comet dust. They're tiny pea- and sand-sized bits of dust and debris crumbling off the Tempel-Tuttle comet as it swings by the Earth. (Earth’s orbit takes it straight through the debris trail.) The dust and debris ignite when it hits our atmosphere. As with most meteor showers, the best time to watch the Leonids is usually between the hours of midnight and dawn, according to Earthsky.org. David Samuhel, a meteorologist and astronomy blogger at AccuWeather, said people should dedicate at least an hour to viewing the meteor shower. ""Do not look at any light source during that hour like a phone, flashlight, or any type of screen,"" he said. ""Your eyes will gradually adjust by a half hour, then you will have perfect night vision. You also want to lay as flat as possible so you can see as much of the sky as possible.” The keys to good views of the shower are the phase of the moon and the weather. First, there's good news about the moon: This year, visibility will be excellent because the new moon will take place Nov. 18, providing a perfect view of the meteors, which will not be washed out by any lunar light, Space.com said. As for the weather Friday night and early Saturday morning, it's a mixed bag. The best viewing conditions should be in the Southwest, the Rockies and along the Southeast coast, AccuWeather said. But folks in the Midwest and Northeast won't be so lucky: ""A large storm system will be moving from the Plains into the Great Lakes, and cloudy skies are forecast to dominate much of the eastern half of the nation,"" said AccuWeather meteorologist Kyle Elliot. ""Rain and thunderstorms will put an even bigger damper on viewing conditions in many of these areas.""

Georgina Torbet,"Curiosity isn’t NASA’s only rover currently on Mars — the Opportunity rover has also been on the red planet since 2004. But last year the rover dropped out of communications when an enormous dust storm wracked the planet and it hasn’t been heard from since.
The Opportunity rover is solar-powered, and the storm kicked up so much dust that the sun’s rays were blocked from reaching the planet’s surface and recharging its batteries. The rover has not responded to contact from Earth, and over the last seven months has ignored over 600 calls, leading the NASA team to believe that it may no longer be able to continue its mission.
It was hoped that as the storm cleared, the wind would blow away the dust which covered the rover’s solar panels so the rover could recharge. But this has not happened, and the rover remains silent. NASA has been attempting to contact the rover through a strategy called “sweep and beep,” where rather than just listening for responses from Opportunity, they send commands to the rover to respond with a beep, but they have been unsuccessful so far.
Now NASA scientists are trying a last ditch attempt to contact the rover based on three unlikely but possible scenarios: that the rover’s primary X-band radio has failed, that both the primary and secondary X-band radios have failed, or that the rover’s internal clock has become offset. The team is commanding the rover to switch to its backup X-band radio and to reset its clock to counteract these possibilities.
“While we have not heard back from the rover and the probability that we ever will is decreasing each day, we plan to continue to pursue every logical solution that could put us back in touch,” John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, said in a statement.
These strategies are becoming urgent due to the seasonal changes on Mars. The season of high winds which could clear the dust from Opportunity’s solar panels is coming to an end and soon southern winter will be arriving, which means very low temperatures that are likely to cause irreparable damage to the rover’s systems. NASA will try sending the new commands for several weeks, but if Opportunity doesn’t respond this time, then it’s likely that the mission will have to be abandoned.","The Opportunity rover is solar-powered, and last year a dust storm blocked the sun's rays from recharging its batteries.

Eric Mack,"It's awful hazy here right now. NASA NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted a major dust storm on the Red Planet on June 1. Within a week, the storm had grown to cover an area larger than North America. Just a few days later, NASA says the storm has more than doubled in size again making it nearly the size of Asia and casting a very ominous shadow on the Opportunity Rover, which is caught in the storm. ""The storm is one of the most intense ever observed on the Red Planet, according to a NASA release dated Tuesday. ""It has blocked out so much sunlight, it has effectively turned day into night for Opportunity, which is located near the center of the storm, inside Mars' Perseverance Valley."" NASA estimates that the storm covered more than 15.8 million square miles (41 million square kilometers) -- about the area of North America and Russia combined -- as of Sunday. Science operations for Opportunity are temporarily suspended while it waits out a Martian dust storm. The dust in the atmosphere is impacting the amount of power generated by the rover’s solar panels. https://t.co/897LCuqMWX (Blue dot is approx location of rover.) pic.twitter.com/tY4aVfNyEz — Spirit and Oppy (@MarsRovers) June 9, 2018 Tanya Harrison, who has worked on the science teams for Opportunity and other projects, says the storm now covering a big chunk of Mars isn't like what you might have seen in the ""The Martian."" ""The atmosphere of Mars is so thin, there's not a lot of oomph behind the wind,"" she wrote on Medium Monday. ""It's not the wind that's the problem—it's the dust."" Martian dust storms send a layer of very fine dust into the atmosphere, blotting out the sun. This isn't good for a solar powered rover like Opportunity. The images below show just how much dust can create darkness on Mars. The first five are actual daylight photos from Opportunity during different degrees of dustiness. The final two images simulate how dark it would get during even more intense storms. Right now, it's even more intense then the darkest image below on the far right. What different values of atmospheric opacity, or tau, look like on Mars. Up through 4.7 are actual images from Opportunity; 6 and 8 are simulated. Current Tau is greater than 10, making it darker than any of these shots. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/ASU/Doug Ellison For now, Opportunity remains in hibernation, waiting for the storm to lift and the power-giving sun to return. This could be just the beginning, though, as this is nowhere near the biggest dust storm we've seen on Mars. Back in 2001, a monster dust devil kicked up so much haze that it covered the entire planet, save for the peak of 15 mile-tall (24 km) Olympus Mons. All that haze trapped so much heat that it actually raised the temperature by 30 degrees Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit). So yes, things can actually get much worse on Mars. Something to consider as we look at the likelihood of sending humans there in our lifetimes. NASA will hold a teleconference Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. PDT on the status of Opportunity, the storm and what it hopes to learn from watching the storm.

,"Malin space science systems, MGS, JPL, NASA By Shannon Hall Temperature differences spawned this storm at Mars’s north pole LARGE dust storms on Mars might have far-reaching effects. They can affect the entire atmosphere, possibly seeding new weather systems that can combine to form planet-wide storms unlike anything we see on Earth. Dust storms are not uncommon on Mars. Local ones are those that cover an area less than 100,000 square kilometres – roughly half the size of the UK – and these occur several hundred times every year, although they last less than a Martian day. Regional ones can be as large as 1 million square kilometres – roughly the size of Alaska – and happen a dozen times every year. They are also more persistent.

Until December 31, the museum is offering a $10 million reward for information that helps them recover the lost paintings. The trail has been cold for years. In 1990, a pair of thieves dressed as policemen walked out of a Boston museum with $500 million worth of art. No one has seen them since. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist is the biggest art theft of all time. And it remains unsolved. The museum is offering $10 million for information that can help recover the lost paintings. But the clock is running out. The museum's $10 million offer ends in December. It's a temporary increase, set in May, from the museum's longstanding $5 million offer. ""It’s conceivable that some criminal organization or people might be wishy-washy about the $5 million,"" Anthony Amore, the museum's director of security, told the New York Times. ""But it’s not conceivable that they're feeling the same way about the $10 million."" The empty frame that once held Rembrandt's ""Storm on the Sea of Galilee."" AP Photo/Josh Reynolds The heist is as famous for its brazenness as it is for its value. It was carried out over just 81 minutes, shortly after midnight on March 18, 1990. The two thieves handcuffed the museum's two security guards in the basement and walked out with 13 pieces of artwork. They include ""The Concert,"" one of Vermeer's 34 known works, and Rembrandt's only known seascape, ""The Storm on the Sea of Galilee,"" as well as two of his other paintings. Today, empty frames stand where those paintings once were. In 2013, the FBI announced it knew the identities of the two thieves — but that they were both dead. They're thought to have passed on the paintings to connections in Northeastern mob circles. There's no established reason for why the artwork was stolen — none of it seems to have appeared on the black market — but numerous theories have emerged over the years. One mob associate may have stolen it in order to collect reward money upon its return — but was caught by an unrelated FBI sting and left the artwork to gather dust. In another theory, mobsters connected with the IRA stole the painting to help fund the army's operations. But the museum is still hoping for their return.

Chris Ciaccia,"NASA'sMars Opportunity rover, which has not communicated with the government space agency since last June when it got swept up in a dust storm that covered the planet, is feared dead. However, NASA isn't giving up hope and is doing anything it can to salvage the craft, including sending new commands and pinging it with a ""sweep and beep"" in hopes of getting a response.
On Jan. 25, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) said that it has been sending new commands to the $400 million rover in an attempt to get it to contact Earth. The new orders, which are slated to hit the rover over the next several weeks, are in effect a last-ditch effort designed to ""address low-likelihood events"" that could prevent Opportunity from talking to Earth.
""We have and will continue to use multiple techniques in our attempts to contact the rover,"" said John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at JPL in a statement. ""These new command strategies are in addition to the 'sweep and beep' commands we have been transmitting up to the rover since September.""
CURIOSITY ROVER SPOTS 'SHINY' OBJECT ON MARS AND NASA ISN'T SURE WHAT IT IS
The new strategies include addressing three scenarios, NASA said in the statement: 1. the primary X-band radio has failed 2. Its primary and secondary X-band radios have failed 3. Its internal clock is offset.
In the event one of these scenarios, which NASA deemed ""unlikely,"" is the reason Opportunity has not communicated with Earth, the space agency would send a command to switch to its backup X-band radio or try and reset its clock and respond via UHF.
Callas added that JPL has attempted to contact Opportunity more than 600 times over the past seven months and the probability it will ever hear from the rover again is decreasing, but there is still hope, saying ""we plan to continue to pursue every logical solution that could put us back in touch.""
Time is critical, as the Red Planet is slated to go into southern winter, which will see extremely low temperatures that could cause ""irreparable harm to an unpowered rover's batteries, internal wiring and/or computer systems,"" NASA said.
In August, NASA admitted that the Opportunity could be lost ""forever.""
NASA PICKS LANDING SPOT FOR MARS 2020 ROVER IN HUNT FOR ALIEN LIFE
The Opportunity rover, which was initially meant to only be on the Red Planet for a 90-day mission, has made several groundbreaking discoveries throughout its now roughly 15-year trip, initially leaving Earth on July 7, 2003.
So far, it has detected signs of water, explored the insides of two craters and completed a marathon — the first vehicle to do so on another planet.
But Opportunity's journey hasn't always been a smooth one.
In 2005, the rover lost the use of one of its front wheels and got stuck in a thick pile of sand for about five weeks, according to Space.com. When it finally managed to move, it ran into a sand dune. In 2007, a dust storm hit and reportedly cut the spacecraft's power to ""dangerously low levels."" A month later, it turned back on and began exploring the Victoria Crater.
Cornell University professor Steven Squyres, the mission's principal investigator, told The New York Times, that if the rover is indeed dead, it would be an ""honorable death.""
The rover last communicated with NASA on June 10, 2018, prior to the planet-wide dust storm.

Al Jazeera,"A sandstorm has battered Senegal leaving livestock dead and damaging the newly-opened airport. A wall of dust swept across the capital, Dakar, reducing visibility and bringing winds gusting to 90 kilometres per hour. This type of dust storm is known as a haboob and is common in some parts of the world, such as the Arabian Peninsula, the Sahara and the desert southwest of the US. However, it is believed to be the first time that such a storm has churned over Senegal. The word haboob is thought to have originated from Sudan, and comes from the Arabic word for wind. The storms are formed when air blows strongly downwards, towards the ground, picking up vast amounts of dust. This usually happens as the result of a decaying thunderstorm. The strong winds led to the death of a number of livestock and caused damage to the airport. Planes were damaged, as was the terminal building, which only opened six months ago.

Mike Wall Space.com Senior Writer,"Don't worry: NASA's Mars rover Curiosity isn't falling apart. On Monday (Aug. 13), Curiosity photographed an odd, flat object that mission team members initially thought might have fallen off the car-size robot. Indeed, they dubbed the weirdly shaped target the ""Pettegrove Point Foreign Object Debris,"" or PPFOD in NASA-speak. (Pettegrove Point is a section of Vera Rubin Ridge, the landform Curiosity has been exploring for the last 11 months or so.) But Curiosity's observations soon revealed that the PPFOD isn't foreign at all. [ Mars Illusion Photos: Seeing Things on Mars ] ""In fact, it was found to be a very thin flake of rock, so we can all rest easy tonight — Curiosity has not begun to shed its skin!"" mission team member Brittney Cooper, an atmospheric scientist based at York University in Toronto, wrote in an update Thursday (Aug. 16). ""Perhaps the target should have been given a different name befitting the theme of the current quadrangle in which Curiosity resides: 'Rabhadh Ceàrr,' or 'False Alarm' in Scottish Gaelic,"" she added. Curiosity recently drilled a Pettegrove Point rock dubbed Stoer, and the rover has begun analyzing the snagged samples, Cooper wrote in the update. The 1-ton rover has also been measuring the opacity of the Martian atmosphere of late, helping researchers monitor the global dust storm that has been raging on the Red Planet for the past two months. The storm has begun dying down, but there's still apparently so much dust in the air that Curiosity's older, smaller, solar-powered cousin, Opportunity, cannot harvest enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. Opportunity has been silent since June 10, and NASA officials think the long-lived robot put itself in a sort of hibernation. Curiosity is nuclear powered, so it's not terribly bothered by dust storms and darkness. The $2.5 billion Curiosity mission, known formally as the Mars Science Laboratory, launched in November 2011 and landed inside the Red Planet's 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater in August 2012. Curiosity was tasked with determining if Gale has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. The rover quickly answered that question, finding that the crater's floor hosted a long-lasting lake-and-stream system billions of years ago. Since September 2014, the rover has been exploring the foothills of Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-high (5.5 km) massif that rises from Gale's Center. Curiosity is reading the rock layers as it climbs, hunting for clues about when and why Mars shifted from a relatively warm world to the frigid desert it is today.

"Mike Wall, SPACE.com","If NASA's Opportunity Mars rover is still alive, we should hear from it relatively soon. The solar-powered Opportunity hasn't made a peep since June 10, when a worsening dust storm plunged the rover's environs—a spot on the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater called Perseverance Valley—into deep darkness. That storm grew to encircle the planet by June 20. But it started dying down in late July, and Opportunity's handlers think a return to normal conditions is finally just around the corner. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] ""The sun is breaking through the haze over Perseverance Valley, and soon there will be enough sunlight present that Opportunity should be able to recharge its batteries,"" John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. Mission controllers are already trying to hail Opportunity three times a week, beaming beep-eliciting commands via the big radio dishes of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) during times when the rover might be awake. But as soon as a measurement of atmospheric opacity known as ""tau"" dips under 1.5, the DSN communication campaign will step up significantly, Callas said. (At the dust storm's height, tau got all the way up to 10.8. More recently, it's been down in the 2-to-2.5 range.) The clock will start ticking for Opportunity upon the initiation of this campaign. ""If we do not hear back after 45 days, the team will be forced to conclude that the sun-blocking dust and the Martian cold have conspired to cause some type of fault from which the rover will more than likely not recover,"" Callas said. ""At that point, our active phase of reaching out to Opportunity will be at an end,"" he added. ""However, in the unlikely chance that there is a large amount of dust sitting on the solar arrays that is blocking the sun's energy, we will continue passive listening efforts for several months."" Opportunity has been exploring the Martian surface for more than 14 years. The golf-cart-size rover and its twin, Spirit, touched down in different locales on the Red Planet three weeks apart in January 2004. Both rovers embarked on 90-Earth-day missions to hunt for signs of past water activity on Mars. And both found lots of such evidence, and then kept rolling along. Spirit last communicated with Earth in March 2010, but Opportunity remained healthy and productive until the dust storm forced it into a sort of hibernation. The biggest threat to the rover in its current state is cold weather, mission team members have said. Opportunity cannot operate its onboard heaters, so if temperatures drop too much, some of the robot's critical internal components could break. But there's a silver lining to the dust clouds: Dust traps heat, making the potentially dangerous Martian nights a little warmer than they otherwise would be. ""In a situation like this, you hope for the best but plan for all eventualities,"" Callas said. ""We are pulling for our tenacious rover to pull her feet from the fire one more time. And if she does, we will be there to hear her."" Copyright 2018 SPACE.com, a Purch company. All rights reserved.

Scott SutherlandMeteorologist/Science Writer
Tuesday, December 25, 2018, 3:20 PM -An ever-frozen 'winter wonderland' crater, a new science instrument deployed, and continued silence from a venerable explorer. Here's What's Up... on Mars!
For a barren, supposedly lifeless planet, Mars - the fourth planet from the Sun - is quite a beautiful and busy place.
MARTIAN WINTER WONDERLAND
The Red Planet has some truly amazing features. Rovers and landers send back images on a near daily basis, but the most exciting views often come from high above.
With six spacecraft currently orbiting the planet (three operated by NASA, two from the ESA and one from ISRO), there are a number of cameras snapping away, and recently, the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter captured this:
Mars' north polar region, courtesy Viking orbiter, with the location of Korolev crater.

This is Korolev crater, an 82-kilometre-wide impact feature, located to the south of Mars' north polar ice cap. The image is a colour composite, produced by combining images taken by Express on five different passes over the area (the last of which was taken in April of 2018).
According to the ESA:
It is an especially well-preserved example of a martian crater and is filled not by snow but ice, with its centre hosting a mound of water ice some 1.8 kilometres thick all year round.
This ever-icy presence is due to an interesting phenomenon known as a cold trap, which occurs as the name suggests. The craters floor is deep, lying some two kilometres vertically beneath its rim.
The very deepest parts of Korolev crater, those containing ice, act as a natural cold trap: the air moving over the deposit of ice cools down and sinks, creating a layer of cold air that sits directly above the ice itself.
Behaving as a shield, this layer helps the ice remain stable and stops it from heating up and disappearing. Air is a poor conductor of heat, exacerbating this effect and keeping Korolev crater permanently icy.
For a much better perspective on this immense crater, the ESA mission team took the data from Express' passes to produce a three-dimensional digital terrain model, resulting in this oblique view of Korolev:
This pristine view of Korolov crater definitely brings to mind a winter wonderland (and appropriately so, since Mars' northern hemisphere is currently in winter), and it is an amazing example of what can be done with the spacecraft's imagery and data, capping off an incredible 15 years in orbit for Mars Express!
MARS INSIGHT SET (DOWN) FOR SCIENCE
NASA's newest Mars lander touched down on the Red Planet roughly a month ago, and has been engaging us all with the images it has been sending back (along with letting us here the winds of Mars)! Taking things slow and steady, the lander has now lifted its sensitive seismometer off of its deck, and has set it down on the Martian surface in front of it.
This animation is comprised of a string of raw images snapped by InSight, starting with an Instrument Deployment Camera (IDC) view of the SEIS instrument, then its Instrument Context Camera (ICC), showing how the lander picked up SEIS and set it down on the ground. Some of the images captured near dawn or dusk have been altered to increase their brightness, to better see what the lander is doing. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Scott Sutherland
How slow and how steady? The above sequence, of lifting the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) off the lander and placing it on the surface, was imaged over a total of four (4) days, from December 19 to December 23, 2018 ('Sols' 22-26 of the InSight mission).
There was a very good reason for the slow pace of this deployment.
""Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,"" Bruce Banerdt, InSight Principal Investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a press release. ""The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.""
By resting on the surface (and once it is covered over by the protective weather and thermal shield (WTS) dome), SEIS will record vibrations in Mars' surface, caused by wind, pressure changes, and 'marsquakes'. The data from this instrument will give the mission scientists a detailed look at what the interior of Mars is like.
Next, the team will ensure that the instrument is level, for best results, then cover it with the WTS dome, and begin bringing in this valuable science data!
SILENCE FROM OPPORTUNITY
The Mars Opportunity rover has now been silent for nearly 200 days!
This venerable explorer fell silent on June 10, 2018, in the midst of one of the worst global dust storms we have ever seen on Mars. As of mid-September, however, the skies over Opportunity have cleared enough for the rover's solar panels to collect power, yet we still have heard nothing from it.
According to JPL's latest update:
No signal from Opportunity has been heard since Sol 5111 (June 10, 2018). Opportunity likely experienced a low-power fault, a mission clock fault and an up-loss timer fault. Since the loss of signal, the team has been listening for the rover over a broad range of times, frequencies and polarizations using the Deep Space Network (DSN) Radio Science Receiver.
They have been commanding ""sweep and beeps"" throughout each daily DSN pass with both right-hand and left-hand circular polarization to address a possible complexity with certain conditions within mission clock fault on the rover. The team has expanded the breath of sweep and beep commanding covering more times of day on Mars.
What do these 'faults' mean?
A low-power fault: Loss of power causes the rover to hibernate, and it should awaken when its solar panels gather enough power to top up its batteries.
A mission clock fault: As its batteries ran down during the dust storm, the loss of power likely caused the rover's clock to hibernate. So, even if it wakes up when the skies clear, it doesn't know what time it is, so it doesn't know when it should be trying to communicate with home.
An up-loss timer fault: the rover may think that its communication equipment is not functioning properly, due to the prolonged period of silence from Earth. The rover is programmed to attempt different ways of communicating, if it experiences this fault, however combined with the mission clock fault, it may not know when to make its attempts.
Combined, these three faults produce a variety of different scenarios for why Opportunity remains silent. It could still be receiving insufficient power from its solar arrays, due to a layer of dust that settled out of the storm. It may be receiving power from its arrays, but its attempts to communicate are always badly timed. There also could be other problems that have cropped up due to the lengthy dust storm and the long period of inactivity since.
The NASA team at JPL continues its attempts to contact Opportunity, however.
An animation of NASA's DSN Now website, on December 25, 2018.
As shown above, the Deep Space Network is still monitoring spacecraft operations throughout the solar system, even during the government shutdown. At the time this animation was captured, one of the Madrid antennas was listening to data from several Mars robots, including Mars Odyssey (M01O), Mars MAVEN (MVN), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and Mars Opportunity (MER1)!
Does this mean that 'Oppy' is finally phoning home?
Well, it's possible! This is certainly the hope, as that would be an incredible Christmas present for the mission team. The likely truth, however, is that this is simply a scheduled time for the DSN to be listening to see if Opportunity calls. We'll have to wait until the team is back to work before we can know for certain.
Two hundred days is a long time for this rover to be out of contact with Earth, especially when it's been roughly three months since the skies had cleared enough to make contact possible.
Still, there is hope for Opportunity. According to the team, we are now in the right time for what are known as 'dust clearing events'. These are usually 'strong' gusts of wind (strong at least by Martian standards), or the passage of a dust devil, which clears off the rover's solar panels.

So, keep Opportunity in your thoughts over the holidays, and maybe we'll hear from its soon!

Swapna Krishna,"The tau measures the amount of dust and particulate in the Martian atmosphere. The team hopes that, once the skies have cleared enough and the rover has recharged its batteries, Opportunity will be able to hear and respond to the signals that Earth is sending its way. If 45 days have passed without a response, the team will cease reaching its active efforts to recover the rover. ""If we do not hear back after 45 days, the team will be forced to conclude that the Sun-blocking dust and the Martian cold have conspired to cause some type of fault from which the rover will more than likely not recover,"" said John Callas, Opportunity's project manager, in a statement. That doesn't mean NASA will have fully given up on Opportunity, though. After all, the rover was originally tasked with a 90-day mission and is still working almost 15 years later. The team will continue ""passive listening efforts"" -- presumably stop sending the rover active signals through the Deep Space Network, but monitor in case Opportunity reaches out first -- for an additional several months. The issue here is that Opportunity's solar panels may be covered in dust, a real concern given the storm that the rover just weathered. If that's the case, it will take time for Mars's winds to clear off the solar panels enough for Opportunity to recharge and be open to receiving signals. It's quite possible that, by the time that happens, the 45-day window will have passed. However, it's also possible that other conditions during the dust storm damaged critical components of Opportunity, and the rover has, in fact, reached its final resting place. Only time will tell us for sure, but in the mean time, we'll keep hoping that Oppy pulls through this latest challenge.","As a planet-wide dust storm enveloped Mars, many were concerned about the fate of the Opportunity rover.

Aarian Marshall,"Everyone working in the autonomous vehicle space said it was inevitable. In America—and in the rest of the world—cars kill people, around 40,000 in the US and 1.25 million in the globe each year. High speeds, metal boxes. Self-driving cars would be better. But no one promised perfection. Eventually, they’d hurt someone. Still, the death of Elaine Herzberg, struck by a self-driving Uber in Tempe, Arizona, two weeks ago, felt like a shock. Even more so after the Tempe Police Department released a video of the incident, showing both the exterior view—a low-quality dash cam captured the victim suddenly emerging from darkness on the side of the road—and the interior view displaying Uber’s safety driver, the woman hired to watch and then take control of the vehicle if the technology failed, looking away from the road. But the shock cut in different ways. Most of the world say the video and thought, gee, that crash looked inevitable. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Tempe’s police chief even suggested as much. “It’s very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway,” Chief Sylvia Moir said. (The police department later said some of Moir’s comments were “taken out of context.”) But autonomous vehicle developers were disturbed. Many experts say the car should have picked up on a pedestrian in a wide-open roadway, after she had already crossed a wide-open lane. “I think the sensors on the vehicles should have seen the pedestrian well in advance,” Steven Shladover, a UC Berkeley research engineer, told WIRED. “This is one that should have been straightforward.” Something went wrong here. That divide—between a public used to the very particular foibles of human drivers, and the engineers building self-driving technology—is a really important one, because Uber’s self-driving crash will not be the last. As companies like General Motors, Ford, Aptiv, Zoox, and Waymo continue to test their vehicles on public roads, there will be more dust-ups, fender-benders, and yes, crashes that maim and kill. “The argument is that the rate of accidents is supposed to go down, when autonomy is matured to a certain level,” says Mike Wagner, co-founder and CEO of Edge Case Research, which helps robotics companies build more robust software. “But how we get from here to there is not always entirely clear, especially if it needs a lot of on-road testing.” As companies work out bugs and fiddle with their machine learning algorithms, expect these vehicles to mess up in peculiar ways. Crashes that look unavoidable will be the ones this tech is built to prevent. Maneuvers that seem easy to people will stump the robots. Someday soon, self-driving cars could be much, much safer than human drivers. But in the meantime, it’s helpful to understand how these vehicles work—and the strange ways in which they go wrong. Sensors Sensors are self-driving car's “eyes”—they help the vehicle understand what’s around them. Cameras are nice for picking up on lane lines and signs, but they capture data in 2-D. Radars are cheap, great over long distances, and can “see” around some barriers, but don't offer much detail. That’s where lidar comes in. The laser sensor uses pulses of light to paint a 3-D picture of the world around it. The lidar Uber used, from a company called Velodyne, is viewed by many as the best system on the market right now. (At around $80,000, it’s also one of the most expensive.) But even the best lidar works a bit like the game Battleship. The laser pulses have to land on enough parts of the object to provide a detailed understanding of its shape, and do it within a few seconds. Ideally, that gives the sensor an accurate reading of the world, the kind of well-informed, on target guess that might help one player sink (or in this case, avoid) another’s fleet. But it’s possible, especially if the vehicle is moving at high speed, that the lasers don’t land on the right things. This might be especially true, experts say, if an object is moving perpendicular to the vehicle, like Herzberg was. This will sound strange for human drivers, who are much more likely to see a person or a bicycle when their full forms are revealed in profile. But when there’s less consistent perspective—when an object is moving second by second—it’s harder for the system to interpret and classify what’s doing the moving. Classification And classification is key. These systems “learn” about the world via machine learning systems, which must be fed a gigantic dataset of road images—curbs, pedestrians, cyclists, lane lanes—before they can identify objects on their own. But the system can go wrong. It’s possible Uber engineers somehow flubbed the machine learning process, and that the self-driving car software interpreted a pedestrian and her bike as a plastic bag or piece of cardboard. Even little things have been observed to fool these systems, like a few patches of tape on a stop sign. Self-driving cars have also been known to see shimmering exhaust as solid objects. Wagner, who has studied this problem, discovered that one system that could not see through certain kinds of weather—even if objects were still totally visible to the human eye. “If there were the the tiniest amount of fog, the neural network lost them,” he says. If the classification is off, the system’s predictions might be off, too. These systems expect humans to move in specific ways, and plastic bags to move in another. Those sorts of predictions could have been botched, too. If classification is the problem, Uber might have to collect additional hundreds of thousands of images to retrain their system. The Software Or crashes like Uber's could be caused by bugs. Autonomous vehicles run off hundreds of thousands of lines of code. An engineer could have introduced some problem, somewhere. Or maybe the system erroneously discarded sensor data it should have used to ID and then evade the woman. Likely, this crash and future crashes will be combinations of many things. “My guess is this is the outcome of complex sequence of things that have never happened before,” says Raj Rajkumar, who studies autonomous systems at Carnegie Mellon University. In other words: a perfect storm. One system failed, then its backup failed, too. The final fail-safe, the system that’s supposed to kick in at the last moment to prevent any dangers, failed, too. That was the human safety driver. “One of the processes of building a robot that has to do real things is that real things are incredibly complicated and hard to understand,” says Wagner. Robots don’t understand eye contact or waves or nods. They might think random things are walls or bushes or paper bags. Their mistakes will seem mysterious to the human eye, and alarming. But those developing the tech persist—because getting drunk, sleepy, or distracted will seem mysterious to the robots.

Meghan Bartels,"The Opportunity rover on Mars is trying to survive a massive dust storm that could put the craft out of operation — but where does all the dust in that storm come from? Researchers now think they have identified the main source of Martian dust bunnies: a giant volcanic gash across the planet's surface called the Medusae Fossae, according to a new study. ""Mars wouldn't be nearly this dusty if it wasn't for this one enormous deposit that is gradually eroding over time and polluting the planet, essentially,"" study co-author Kevin Lewis, a planetary geophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, said in a statement. [ Thick Dust Clouds Spotted Near Martian Ice Cap ] And it's quite a lot of pollution. Scientists have calculated that about 3 million tons (3 trillion kilograms) of dust moves between the surface and atmosphere of Mars each year. That makes the phenomenon a crucially important characteristic of the Red Planet's surface. The sheer volume of dust encouraged scientists to track down the material's source. First, the scientists looked at the chemical fingerprint of dust analyzed at a variety of sites around the planet. Weirdly, that fingerprint looks much the same no matter where the sample comes from, with a very specific balance of chlorine and sulfur. So, the team behind the new research went looking for that same ratio in different rocks of Mars itself. Of the regions the scientists looked at, the best match for the dust came from Medusae Fossae, a giant gash near the Martian equator that scientists think was originally created by volcanic activity. The region stretches across almost 620 miles (1,000 kilometers), according to NASA. Previous researchers had suggested that volcanic activity produced the formation about 3 billion years ago and that the ridge-like shapes on its surface come from wind eating away at the surface. The research team estimated the amount of dust that such a process would produce, given how large they believe Medusae Fossae was at the beginning — about half the size of the continental U.S., according to previous research. That calculation suggests that the formation has lost enough dust to coat the planet in a layer from 6.5 to 40 feet (2 to 12 meters) deep. And that estimate matches pretty well with how much dust scientists see on the planet: about 10 feet (3 m), based on measurements of the poles and a few particularly dusty regions, the team wrote. The new research won't help Opportunity endure the dust storm threatening the rover's solar-power supply, but the finding does explain a hugely prominent characteristic of the Red Planet.

Nicole Gallucci,"It’s Viral Market Crash week on Mashable. Join us as we take stock of the viral economy and investigate how the internet morphed from a fun free-for-all to a bleak hellscape we just can’t quit. If we’ve learned anything from the Ken Bones and Chewbacca moms of the internet, or the graveyard of expired memes collecting virtual dust in an online database, it’s that viral fame is often fleeting. But every now and then, a weird little subculture starts trending and doesn't stop. Over the past decade or so, attention from the outside world has caused internet subcultures once considered niche — like the furry fandom and the Neopets and DIY communities — to transition from underground to mainstream. But when a community goes viral, what happens next? We talked to prominent members from these three resilient online communities to learn what it was like to be launched into the spotlight and how viral fame changed their subcultures. SEE ALSO: How one company reshaped — and kind of ruined — the viral video landscape First up? The furries, a fandom comprised of people who’ve taken an interest in anthropomorphic animals, or animals with human characteristics and personalities. Members of the community either identify with existing anthropomorphized characters or create personal alter egos for themselves, known as ""fursonas."" Since art and visual expression play a large role, many furry enthusiasts also have some form of costume or a mascot-like fursuit to help depict their fursonas. Though the fandom is thought to have originated in the early 1980's, furry influences like Kimba the White Lion and Fritz the Cat appeared in pop culture decades earlier, so the true start remains unknown. But after years of holding conventions and growing an online community, furries began getting more mainstream attention in 2010. Much to the dismay of the community, however, the coverage wasn't always kind, and in many cases, drastically misrepresented the majority of the fandom. The fortitude of furry Twitter Over the years, the furry community has periodically trended as a result of negative news about everything from a Connecticut councilman resigning after people learned he was a furry to a group of furries who showed alt-right support. But the sexual side of the furry community — which many members claim is a small or even nonexistent part of the subculture — has perhaps been the most controversial focal point for the outside world. Furries were often spotlighted as fetishists or misunderstood for their unconventional interests, while the community was trying to get its truth across, the narrow coverage took a toll on members. Though furries congregate on many online platforms — from popular sites like YouTube and Instagram to more tailored spaces like r/Furry, Furry Amino, Ferzu, and Furaffinity — Twitter remains the hub. ""Most of the furry fandom news is spread through Twitter — whether it's convention information, drama, fandom news, someone's new suit, art, or videos — it is all found there,"" Vix, a 24-year-old furry living in Pittsburgh said. Vix's two fursuits. Image: TWITTER/ @VixNdwnq Vix found out about furries in middle school, and while she was initially hesitant to join due to negative things she'd heard about the community, after getting two fursuits in 2011 she established her main fursonas: a calico cat-deer named Vix and a blue arctic fox named Rika, which has many alternate versions (including a male goat and a demonic jester). Since joining the furry fandom in 2014, Vix has seen it grow drastically, but remembers key moments of viral attention that really affected the community as a whole. In December 2014, for instance, a chlorine gas attack took place during a Midwest FurFest convention in Chicago, prompting a hotel evacuation and landing 19 people in the hospital. Though most coverage of the tragedy was straight, many members of the furry community were distressed by the on-air actions of MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski. When Brzezinski first learned about furries while reporting the convention news, she burst into uncontrollable laughter and physically ran off set to compose herself. ""This made the community extremely upset due to the fact that many people had to be rushed to the hospital and it was in no way a laughing matter,"" Vix said. Mark Smith, a 23-year-old furry who was in the Army at the time of the attack, also recalled how devastating it was. ""Ultimately we all really do get upset,"" he said, noting that since he joined the community in 2009, adopting the fursona of a white and blue husky. He's now thankful to see a growing sense of acceptance and positivity from the outside world. 'When it hit media coverage there was outrage in the community and many were upset over the negative impact.' Another memorable setback came after the Tony the Tiger incident of 2015, in which several furries began making sexual advances towards the official Tony the Tiger Twitter account. Vix admits the trend ""left furry Twitter split,"" saying some thought it was ""harmless and hilarious,"" but many saw it as an uncalled for and unhumorous violation. ""When it hit media coverage there was outrage in the community and many were upset over the negative impact."" Mark Smith's fursona, a white and blue husky. Image: @Marks_Barks Though there have have definitely been differences amongst community members over the years, ultimately, Furry Twitter has banded together in tough times to comfort and stand up for one another. ""A nine-year-old furry was bullied by a couple of people at a convention"" over her fursuit, Smith recalled. He explained that after finding out about the incident on Twitter a group of furries got together with the young girl, took group pictures in support, and let her try on their fursuits. ""Another time, a friend of mine, RainyChaos, had her YouTube channel featured on the homepage of YouTube when she was 16,"" Vix added. ""While she got horrible attention from hundreds of outsiders, the community got together and helped her get past all of the negativity."" Though outside attention has largely served as a unifying force for furries, a prolonged time in the spotlight has caused other subcultures, like the DIY community, to grow so popular that they've been driven apart. Do It Yourself drama DIY, or the act of creating something yourself rather than buying it, has always been around in some capacity. But over the years, the group that once consisted solely of resourceful people crafting passion projects has expanded to nearly every industry. Now media sites publish endless lists of DIY life hacks. YouTube is full of tutorials for everything from how to cook, how to make costumes, and how to create beauty products from scratch. HGTV provides an endless source of inspiration for aspiring builders, and NBC just premiered a DIY-themed show called Making It. In the ten years since the DIY subreddit was created it’s amassed nearly 14 million subscribers, growing at an especially accelerated pace over the past four years. And Reddittor Hareuhal, who’s been one of the lead moderators since 2016, has definitely noticed some changes. Image: screengrab/reddit ""They're not necessarily bad changes — they're just different,"" Hareuhal said, explaining that one of the major developments in the community since it’s gained outside attention has been an increase in ""big players."" ""We have more bloggers and YouTubers than we did two years ago and they have many more subscribers than they used to,"" Hareuhal explained. ""Two years ago we received a handful of videos per week, whereas currently we receive several per day… As the subreddit has grown the attitude towards videos has shifted."" ""As the subreddit has grown the attitude towards videos has shifted."" While you might assume established DIY YouTubers posting professional videos to the subreddit would be welcome, that's not always the case. Since many YouTubers monetize their videos — some even using their channels as a main source of income — the videos can sometimes be seen as self-promotion, which is usually frowned upon on Reddit. Johnny Brooke, a 30-year-old who started making DIY YouTube videos two and a half years ago, has noticed an explosion in both the number of people participating in DIY projects and the fan base, which he feels has led to some of the disagreements. ""Since I started there have been dozens and dozens of other channels who started doing pretty similar things, and a lot of us now are doing this for a living, which is pretty cool,"" he said, adding that he shares his videos regularly to the subreddit. ""But what I consider basic tools, somebody who’s really never done this stuff or just getting started might consider more advanced, so I think a lot of times there’s a disconnect between expectations of users and people like me,"" Brooke said. Chris Salamone, a 37-year-old DIY YouTuber living in Southern California, also noticed the experience level user divide on the subreddit, and is trying to be more aware of what he posts as a result. ""Now, I really only try to post there if I feel like this is true DIY that people are going to get value out of."" ""When I first started I was a little bit more likely to post… Now, I really only try to post there if I feel like this is true DIY that people are going to get value out of,"" he said. ""Even though I disagree with a lot of it I understand it. So I don’t want to spam the community, I want to respect it and try to only post things that are legit DIY projects that even if somebody doesn’t have my shop they can still get some value out of or adapt it to whatever their situation is."" But despite the difference in opinion, the DIY subreddit hasn't stopped growing. ""When I joined in 2016 we had 6.7 million members,"" Hareuhal said, explaining that since then the subreddit has had some standout moments — including hosting an AMA for the cast of home improvement show This Old House in 2017 and securing AMAs from other big names in DIY like Jimmy DiResta, Patrick DiJusto, and Travis Larson. Neopets nostalgia Luckily, not all viral subcultures have endured as much controversy as the furries or DIY community. The Neopets community, for example, which first took off after the virtual pet website’s creation in 1999 and ruled childhoods in the early 2000s, has recently made a fairly painless resurgence in our nostalgia-hungry society. Reddit user diceroll123, who goes by Steve, has been moderating the Neopets subreddit for six and a half years and watched it grow from around 800 subscribers to almost 24,000. He’s done his best to remain close to the community over the years, calling Neopets fans he’s observed on the subreddit ""so dang wholesome."" Image: screengrab/reddit ""Everyone's always helping each other achieve their goals, from things like completing their gallery, or getting that dream pet they've wanted for years, to web design and programming,"" Steve said. He also noted that so far, the majority of outside attention — whether positive or negative — has left the subreddit off on a higher subscriber plateau. This April, Neopets made headlines after The Outline surfaced news that the kid-friendly site was run by Scientologists. And though there was initially some uproar and confusion from fans reminiscing on the beloved site, the Neopets community itself was barely impacted. Reddit user oh__golly, who joined the community about nine years ago and started moderating the r/neopets subreddit a little more than a year ago, said the Scientology bomb ""wasn't huge news for a lot of the community,"" since Neopets creators Adam Powell and Donna Williams already discussed the topic in a 2014 AMA on the subreddit. However, when Chrissy Teigen got in on the action and confessed to being a former Neopets comment board moderator, the community quickly began trending again. I was a comment board moderator. I won multiple caption contests. I've basically been told to barely move and let my baby grow so fuck it, I'm going back on neopets — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 19, 2018 oh my god neopets has not changed a bit. the omelette...is still cooking — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 19, 2018 ""We mods generally buckle up when we see a celebrity mention Neopets,"" Steve said. ""So far it's never been a bad thing… When people see 'Neopets' they're like 'Wow! I remember that!' and then Google it and find the subreddit."" But Reddit isn’t the only online platform where Neopets fans converge — people are also forming Facebook groups to bond over the virtual world. The main Neopets Facebook page has 216,508 likes, but superfans looking for more frequent and intimate discussions are drawn to smaller Facebook groups like Neopets Nation. Melissa Forbes, a 26-year-old Neopets lover from South Australia serves as the group’s administrator with two of her friends, and together they provide a place for Neopets fans to chat, share information on events, site updates, and more. Since creating the group in 2015, the biggest change Forbes has noticed is an influx in returning Neopets players. Image: screengrab/neopets ""Over the past few years, the kids who used to play back when I first started seem to have found their way back and essentially taken over the site,"" she explained. ""Whenever Neopets appears on a popular site or in an article, we generally get an influx of users returning and trying to find their feet again. This is when Neopets Nation gets a bunch of new members looking for advice and also [they are] just generally surprised to see how many adult players are still around."" Neopets was bought and sold twice since 2005, so there’s been some changes to the site that tend to confuse returning users, but according to Forbes, Neopets is ""very much still a large, thriving community."" Can viral fame be everlasting? While the furry, DIY, and Neopets subcultures have all evolved in their own ways, as new communities rise to fame one can't help but wonder if they'll be able to beat the viral odds and stand the test of time. When it comes to the furry community, Nos Hyena, a 25-year-old furry who joined the community in July 2015, thinks the key to future growth lies in people outside the furry fandom making an active effort to better understand it. ""I’ve noticed furry has way more visibility and way more acceptance from the general population since I’ve joined,"" Nos Hyena, whose fursona is a brightly colored hyena with abs and a mohawk, said. ""Right now it's been cooler than ever to be a furry."" He went on to explain that furries used to be made fun of a lot more, but media outlets have attempted to cover positive aspects of the community and clear up common furry misconceptions. Influencers like Shane Dawson have also given furries a platform on which to express themselves, and moms of young furries even started a YouTube channel and Twitter account to help educate other parents. Ultimately, outside attention — positive and negative — has helped the community grow, and today more than 15,000 furries are registered on Furrymap.net. ""Right now it's been cooler than ever to be a furry!"" Nos Hyena said. As for the future of DIY, Bourke feels as long as technology continues to advance, DIY will thrive. It's not only being seen as an opportunity to cut down on costs but as a seriously rewarding hobby. ""I think that’s a big reason why it’s exploding,"" he said. ""A lot of us are looking for hobbies that will take us away from the screen, and this is sort of the best of both worlds."" From a moderator’s point of view, Hareuhal’s hopes the subreddit keeps growing and wants to try and coordinate some meetups amongst the group that take place offline. Going forward, if the main DIY subreddit gets too overwhelming, it’ll be interesting to see if more specific offsets of the main hub — such as woodworking, welding, and even the DIWhy subreddit — gain more popularity in the future. ""A lot of us are looking for hobbies that will take us away from the screen..."" Finally, Neopets — which is also seen by many as its own escape from the real world — recently announced at San Diego Comic-Con that a mobile site, app, and game called Legends and Letters are on the way. Despite the fact that a planned site redesign was shelved when JumpStart acquired the site in 2014, the community remains optimistic and hopes to keep drawing new and returning members. “Now's a great time to get back into the game,” subreddit moderator Steve said. Overall, members of these communities are positive about their futures, and though there may come a day when these subcultures dwindle down, for now they’ve withstood the storm that comes with viral attention, and they don’t seem to be fading into the background any time soon.",It’s Viral Market Crash week on Mashable.

Alice O'Connor,"“All microchips are,” prog rock band Kansas famously almost sang, “is dust in the wind.” Friend, we are gathered today to celebrate the retirement of another generation of hardware. Blizzard have removed support for 32-bit and DirectX 9 from Heroes Of The Storm, saying farewell to hardware that once powered PCs with such ha-ha-hilarious joke names as “Chipster”, “Siri”, “Crunch ALL The Frames”, and “Not Sure If Overclocked Or Just Loud”. Farewell, old friend. Enjoy your retirement in the cloud. Not that Heroes is free from nostalgia, as yesterday’s patch added Warcraft 3 wrong’un Mal’Ganis as a new character. When Blizzard first announced the retirement plan in April, they said that “the vast majority of players in the Heroes community are now running the 64-bit version of the game, along with DirectX11 or higher.” 64-bit CPUs and Windows have been mainstream for a decade so there aren’t many still-living PCs that still will be blocked by this change, especially since Blizzard removed Windows XP and Vista support from their current games in 2017, but it’s a non-zero number. A few weird PCs owned by a few players (yes, I’ve seen some) are now unable to play without upgrading. For a fair while, certain players preferred the 32-bit and DX9 clients because they found them more stable than the newer. Whether that’s fixed or not, I suppose the choice is gone now. Blizzard didn’t explain why they removed support for these older technologies, but it’s likely that it just makes it easier for them. Needing to support a 32-bit version, for example, means they must build the game to play nicely with small amounts of RAM (32-bit is limited to 2GB), limiting what they can do. Building for a DX9 minimum also nudges a game’s tech in a certain direction. This doesn’t mean Heroes instantly becomes fancier now those old options are gone, but it does theoretically open more possibilities. Though Blizzard are likely mostly glad they have fewer hardware and software combinations to support, test, and troubleshoot. As for Mal’Ganis, he’s a Warrior type with a passive lifesteal on attacks, a stunning slash, an AoE attack which armours him, a movement boost that can sleep enemies, and ultimate powers to turn into a swarm of hungry bats or swap his health percentages with an enemy. See the October 16th patch notes for more on the update, and this video for more on Mal:","“All microchips are,” prog rock band Kansas famously almost sang, “is dust in the wind.” Friend, we are gathered today to celebrate the retirement of another generation of hardware.

BEN BRANTLEY,"That moment might be more effective if it chilled us. Instead, we’re charmed. By now we’re accustomed to this Puckish lad looking out at us with his can-you-believe-this gaze when his friends and family behave as stupidly as he predicted they would. Photo Madeleine Potter as Gertrude and Mr. Urie as her son, Hamlet. Credit Scott Suchman That’s our Hamlet. What a cutup! Even when he pulls a pistol out of his chicly oversize cardigan, paired with skinnier-than-thou jeans (Jess Goldstein did the trendy costumes), and talks of being or not being, it’s hard to think of him as a threat — to himself or to anyone else. I greatly admire Mr. Urie, whose smart, calculatingly silly performances in both “Torch Song” and “The Government Inspector” were theater high points last year. And I’d love to be able to say that there’s sly, subversive method in his madcappery here. But if there is, he’s not sharing it. Mr. Kahn, the longtime artistic director of the Shakespeare Company Theater, makes an intelligent choice for the opening scene. He knows that most theatergoers will be familiar with Mr. Urie for his breezy television work (“Ugly Betty”). And rather than have us wait, judgmental minds at the ready, for Mr. Urie to show up in Scene II, Mr. Kahn throws him at us, in full monologue, before the play proper begins. Swathed in shadows and standing next to what appears to be an open grave, Mr. Urie delivers the “ too too solid flesh ” soliloquy (which usually comes toward the end of Scene II) as a prologue. It’s a gamble that pays off. This monologue offers a surprisingly cogent summing up of the state of Denmark we are about to enter. And it lets us see immediately whether Mr. Urie can, well, speak the speech. He can. In those initial moments, he paints a persuasive portrait of a terminally restless young man at odds with himself and the world, wrestling with doubts and losing. It’s a respectable, A-minus audition piece, and you hopefully await the fuller performance to come. But very little that follows — from Mr. Urie and from the production as a whole — is on that level. The Hamlet who steps into the court of Elsinore is clearly the same guy we just met. But it’s as if he had unleashed himself from some confining mental corset, and he’s grimacing and gesturing up a storm. (He can’t stop moving his hands even when they’re in his pockets.) Perhaps feeling that there’s no point in competing with a royal tornado, the rest of the cast turns in nigh-invisible performances that lean toward somnolence or stiffness. Even that old windbag Polonius, played by Robert Joy, is less a bombastic grandstander than a dry-as-dust martinet. As his doomed daughter (and Hamlet’s sometime girlfriend), Ophelia, Oyin Oladejo exudes such common-sense solidity that she seems shatterproof. Madeleine Potter, as Hamlet’s lusty mother, Gertrude, has a commandingly ripe presence, but her mind often seems to be elsewhere (maybe wondering where she left the crown jewels). Photo Oyin Oladejo as Ophelia and Mr. Urie as Hamlet. Credit Scott Suchman Alan Cox’s King Claudius (who murdered his brother, Hamlet’s father) projects very little menace. He’s soft around the edges, like some lazy fat cat who lucked into the throne by accident rather than regicide. And it’s hard to imagine his being in charge of the sinister, all-seeing state summoned by John Coyne’s set, with its walls of video monitors and hidden cameras and microphones. (The same visual motifs were deployed more effectively in Robert Icke’s production of “Hamlet” in London last year, starring Andrew Scott.) There are also smartphones galore. Hamlet and Ophelia text each other their messages of love. And a game Claudius photobombs a selfie being taken by Hamlet’s college chums, Rosencrantz (Ryan Spahn) and Guildenstern (Kelsey Rainwater). Hamlet uses his phone to make the occasional note-to-self (including that “one may smile, and smile, and be a villain”). If only those notes included the advice Hamlet later gives to the traveling company of players. “In the very torrent, tempest and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness,” he tells the actors as they prepare to stage a Hamlet-tweaked tragedy. Since Mr. Urie is delivering this counsel in full torrent-tempest-whirlwind mode, you can feel the other actors just itching to roll their eyes.

Chelsea Gohd,"As an intense dust storm rages on Mars, many are wondering — how bad can a Martian storm really be? Tuesday (June 12), NASA's Opportunity rover stopped communications amid a severe dust storm on the Red Planet. But while the storm hasn't killed the rover yet — Opportunity could still revive once the skies clear — how dangerous can storms on Mars get? For fans of ""The Martian"" novel by Andy Weir, or the film based on that book, the answer may be a disappointment. Storms on Mars aren't quite as dramatic as the book or the film adaptation portray them to be. While Martian winds at the planet's surface can reach up to about 60 mph (about 97 km/h), this is less than half the speed of some hurricane winds here on Earth and probably not strong enough to rip apart or tip any major equipment, NASA officials said in a statement. [ Surviving 'The Martian': How to Stay Alive on Mars (Infographic) ] This series of simulated Mars rover Opportunity images shows how conditions have changed around the NASA rover as a huge dust storm has intensified (from left to right) throughout June 2018. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/TAMU However, even when winds on the Red Planet reach their highest speeds, wind on Mars isn't quite as powerful as it is on Earth. ""Mars' atmospheric pressure is a lot less [than Earth's]. So, things get blown [around], but it's not with the same intensity,"" William Farrell, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in the statement. So, ""The Martian"" film accurately shows Mark Watney sweeping dust off of his solar panels every day, because Martian dust particles accumulate and stick easily because they're slightly electrostatic. But dust storms on Mars aren't as powerful as they might seem based on the movie. Still, Martian storms still could pose risks to humans. In a special NASA teleconference on June 13, researchers said that, while Mars' atmosphere is thin, there is still dust being raised. This could hypothetically complicate regular functioning and visibility for future crewed missions. Additionally, dust storms create ""sort of a greenhouse effect in which the radiation that otherwise would be lost to space is trapped,"" heating up the planet, Rich Zurek, Mars Program Office chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in the conference. Humans on the Martian surface will already have to contend with radiation, and this effect will only increase the risk. Plus, Martian storms can grow to epic scale: The researchers said the current storm is expanding and could potentially stretch across the entire planet, which humans have seen happen on Mars before. So, a Martian dust storm likely won't strand any future space colonists or rip any antennas off of equipment, like what happened in ""The Martian."" Instead, the dangers to humans would more likely range from radiation to dust accumulation (because of the static electricity), or possibly less-dramatic risks associated with winds, researchers said in the conference. Solar-powered tech will also continue to struggle against the dust that sticks to solar panels on rovers like Opportunity. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech NASA is already seriously considering these potential threats to future space explorers. ""We really need to understand these storms to the degree that we can have some level of forecasting ability,"" Jim Watzin, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., said in the conference. So, it turns out that dust storms on Mars aren't as cinematically dramatic as fans of ""The Martian"" may have thought. Still, NASA is working to protect future crewed missions from the dangers that may arise from Martian weather. Email Chelsea Gohd at cgohd@space.com or follow her @chelsea_gohd.

Kirsten Korosec,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s vision of an “entirely new system of transport,” which he unveiled Wednesday night at a splashy event in Hawthorne, California, wasn’t a reusable rocket like the ones he’s building at his nearby SpaceX headquarters. Nor is it an electric vehicle, like the Teslas he is producing at a factory in Fremont, California.
Tonight, Musk showed off a 1.14-mile test tunnel that snakes its way underneath 120th Street in the city of Hawthorne that his other business, the Boring Company, dug for about $10 million using a modified boring machine called Godot. (That $10 million figures includes the cost of building the tunnel, all internal infrastructure, lighting, communication and video, safety systems, ventilation, and track, according to the company.) For Musk, this is merely a demonstration of what could be: a network of low-cost tunnels used for transportation, utilities or water and built for millions of dollars, or even billions less than those constructed for subways or trains.
These tunnels, which at about 12-feet in diameter are smaller than a subway, are cheaper to build thanks to the company’s boring machines, Musk and Boring Company president Steve Davis contend.
The tunnels could be stacked Musk calls it a 3D network and operate like a giant underground highway with vehicles entering and exiting at strategic points along the way via ramp, spiral or elevator depending on available space. The main tunnel would allow vehicles, which are stabilized via a retractable tracking wheels, to travel up to 150 miles per hour. Once a vehicle leaves the main artery, speeds would be reduced. (The retractable tracking wheels are important, new development; Musk said they originally were going to place the vehicles on a skate, which would travel at high speeds, but ditched the idea because it was too “complex.”
These entry points could take as little room as two parking spaces for an elevator, Musk said, which TechCrunch was able to attest to, at least with the demonstration tunnel.
“You can weave these stations throughout the fabric of the city without changing the character of the city, Musk said during a press briefing.
There are some important caveats to this system. This is a concept; it currently doesn’t exist at the scale Musk envisions, although there are numerous cities and utilities interested. (Davis noted they get between 5 and 20 requests or inquires a day from municipalities and utilities).
And only autonomous, electric vehicles would be allowed in the Loop, as The Boring Company is calling the concept. A Tesla Model X was used in the demo Wednesday night, although Musk insisted during a press briefing that “this is not some walled garden or something only for Teslas.”
The Loop would also have dedicated vehicles for pedestrians and bicyclists that Musk speculated could cost about $1 a ride, if shared. The vehicles designated for public transport would run in a loop and get priority.
TechCrunch’s ride through the Hawthorne test tunnel began near 120th street and Prairie Avenue, next to a nondescript building “The Brick Store” stenciled discreetly on one side  that only stood out because of all the security surrounding it. The Model X had been outfitted with the  retractable wheels, which Musk said would be an aftermarket product that might cost between $200 and $300.
Once the vehicle descended, the test driver slowly accelerated to about 44 mph through the tunnel, back towards Crenshaw and 120th Street. The tunnel, hazy with dust from the construction, and lit by neon-like lighting, delivered a bumpy-ish ride on occasion. Musk later explained that this was because they had some trouble with the paving. A system for the public would be much smoother, he said.
The entry point, near the Brick Store, provides an important link to the Boring Company story and vision. Earlier this year, TechCrunch reported that Musk has started a company called The Brick Store LLC to produce and sell bricks, according to public documents. The new company, which was founded in July, will be managed by Davis, the ex-SpaceX engineer who is also running The Boring Company (TBC).
The plan, is for the Boring Company to use the dirt extracted during the boring process to produce bricks, which will cost $0.10 a brick, Musk said.
The next step for the Boring Company is to develop its next generation boring machine, the Line Storm (refernce to a Robert Frost poem) and eventually Prufrock, which will deliver a 15-fold cost savings to current technologies, Musk said.
And that’s just the beginning.
“The Loop is just a stepping stone to the hyperloop, Musk said, in reference to the high-speed futuristic mode of transport he first floated in a white paper several years ago. “the Loop will be transport within cities and the hyperloop will be transport between them.”","Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s vision of an “entirely new system of transport,” which he unveiled Wednesday night at a splashy event in Hawthorne, California, wasn’t a reusable rocket like the ones he’s building at his nearby SpaceX headquarters.

Leonard  David,"NASA's Opportunity Mars rover remains silent as a giant dust storm continues to swirl on the Red Planet. The storm began on May 30 and grew to encircle the entire planet a few weeks later. With so much dust in the air, the solar-powered Opportunity hasn't been able to recharge its batteries and has entered a sort of hibernation. ""We have not heard from the rover for a couple of weeks,"" said Ray Arvidson of Washington University in Saint Louis. Arvidson is deputy principal investigator for the Mars Exploration Rover mission, which originally consisted of Opportunity and its twin, Spirit. The duo touched down in different locations on Mars a few weeks apart in January 2004. Opportunity kept right on rolling, long after Spirit's death. But the dust storm has sidelined the golf-cart-size rover: Opportunity hasn't sent a photo back to Earth since June 10, NASA officials have said.Spirit has long been silent, becoming bogged down in sand late 2009. Its last communication with Earth was sent on March 22, 2010. Opportunity is now likely in a low-power mode, ""in which the rover wakes up, checks its power and, if too low, just goes back to sleep again,"" Arvidson told Inside Outer Space. This graphic shows how the energy available to NASA’s Opportunity rover on Mars (in watt-hours) depends on how clear or opaque the atmosphere is (measured in a value called tau). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/New Mexico Museum of Natural History ""At some point as the storm subsides, Opportunity should wake up, decide it has enough power to transmit a signal from its low-gain antenna saying, 'I am awake and OK, but I am going back to sleep again,'"" he added. ""This should happen every sol until it decides to go back to full operation."" (A sol is a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day.) ""We have been listening, but no low-gain antenna communications yet. And the storm continues in full force,"" Arvidson said. ""The storm has gone global and is still raging,"" said Jim Rice, Geology Team Leader for the Mars Exploration Rover Project at Arizona State University's Mars Space Flight Facility. But, he added, ""I'm still confident we make it through this."" Leonard David is author of ""Mars: Our Future on the Red Planet,"" published by National Geographic.

Mike Wall,"NASA's long-lived Opportunity Mars rover is weathering a monster dust storm that has plunged its environs into permanent darkness. That darkness has prevented the solar-powered Opportunity from charging its batteries sufficiently, and the rover has fallen silent as a result. Still, mission team members expressed optimism that the plucky robot, which has been exploring the Red Planet for more than 14 years, will pull through. ""We should be able to ride out this storm,"" John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said during a news conference today (June 13). ""We're concerned, but we're hopeful that the storm will clear and the rover will begin to communicate to us."" [ The Greatest Mars Discoveries by Opportunity &amp; Spirit ] The golf-cart-size Opportunity landed in January 2004, a few weeks after its twin, Spirit, touched down on a different part of the Red Planet. Both rovers embarked on 90-day missions to search for signs of past water activity. Spirit and Opportunity found lots of such evidence, and they kept roving long after their warranties expired. Spirit wasn't declared dead until 2011, and Opportunity is still going strong; since August 2011, it has been exploring the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater. Opportunity has seen a lot in its time on Mars — including another powerful dust storm, which the rover weathered in 2007. During that storm, Opportunity went silent for a four-day stretch, Callas said. But the mission team always had control of the rover, he added; the silence was a choice, an attempt to conserve power during the days of darkness. The current dust storm and Opportunity's present situation are different. The storm was first observed by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) on May 30, and it has been growing dramatically ever since. In just two or three days, it will likely encircle the entire planet — a milestone only about a dozen Martian dust storms have achieved in recorded history, NASA officials said. (NASA's Curiosity rover, which is exploring a different part of the Red Planet, is seeing increased dust levels now as well. But Curiosity is nuclear-powered, so such storms don't pose much of a threat to the vehicle.) And the dust is incredibly thick over Endeavour Crater — thicker than anything Opportunity has dealt with before, mission team members said. Opportunity is now enduring complete darkness 24 hours a day, and its power levels have dropped precipitously as a result — from 645 watt-hours on June 2 to about 22 watt-hours on Sunday (June 10), Callas said. That latter number is so low that Opportunity has apparently put itself into ""low power fault mode,"" turning off everything but its internal clock in an effort to conserve energy, he added. The rover will wake up again once it gets enough sunlight to charge its batteries, at which point it will automatically try to phone home. ""So, at this point, we're in a waiting mode,"" Callas said. ""We're listening every day for possible signals from the rover, and we'll be prepared to respond to that."" If Opportunity's power levels drop much lower, the rover may lose the ability to maintain its internal clock. That would complicate, but not doom, recovery efforts, Callas said; Opportunity would still try to communicate after coming back online, but the timing of its attempts would be far less predictable.

This series of simulated Mars rover Opportunity images shows how conditions have changed around the NASA rover as a huge dust storm has intensified (from left to right) throughout June 2018. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/TAMU There is ample reason to believe Opportunity will indeed wake up, NASA officials said. It's getting closer to summer in the rover's neck of the Martian woods, which means temperatures are rising. That's good news, because the chief threat to the rover in its current situation is death by freezing — the fate that befell Spirit after it got bogged down in thick sand during the Martian winter and couldn't reorient itself to catch enough sun. And Opportunity won't be able to fire up its main onboard heater until it can recharge its batteries. But calculations by the rover team suggest that Opportunity won't experience temperatures colder than minus 33 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 36 degrees Celsius) for the foreseeable future, Callas said. That's survivable for the rover, which was designed to tolerate temperatures as low as minus 67 degrees F (minus 55 degrees C). ""So, we think we can ride this out for a while,"" Callas said. Somewhat paradoxically, the dust actually mitigates the freezing threat, he added: The stuff traps heat, keeping Opportunity a bit warmer at night than it would be otherwise. It's unclear how much longer the dust storm will continue. Indeed, researchers don't know much about these dramatic events — why they occur during some Martian years and not others, and what drives some to encircle the planet and others to peter out early. NASA is using its stable of active Mars spacecraft — including Curiosity, MRO and the orbiters Mars Odyssey and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) — to address such basic questions. Opportunity's handlers will be sweating out the rover's slumber, no matter how long it lasts. ""The team has a very strong bond with the rover; you know, we have a very tight emotional connection with it,"" Callas said. ""It's like you have a loved one in a coma in the hospital,"" he added. ""The doctors are telling you that, 'OK, you've just got to give it time, and she'll wake up.' And all the vital signs are good, so it's just waiting it out. But if it's your 97-year-old grandmother, you're going to be very concerned. And so, we are."" Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook or Google+.

Leah Crane,"Opportunity’s loss leaves a long shadow on Mars
NASA/JPL
By Leah Crane
Opportunity is already buried – all thats left is to say goodbye. The ageing Mars rover became mired in a colossal dust storm in June 2018, and operators havent been able to reach it since then. NASA is expected to announce later today that Opportunitys mission is officially over.
In January 2004, two rovers – Spirit and Opportunity – touched down on the surface of the Red Planet. NASA hoped that one of the two rovers would last for 90 days, but this turned out to be a huge underestimate. Spirit roved the surface for nearly six years before getting stuck in a patch of soft dirt, while Opportunity has lasted well into its 15th year before joining its sibling.
During their time on the surface, the rovers gathered data that allowed us to construct our current vision of Mars past. We cared for them and watched over them and shepherded them through so much, and in return they gave us an entire planet, says former rover driver Scott Maxwell. Opportunity gave us an entirely new view of what that world must have been like.
Before Spirit and Opportunity landed, the accepted picture was that Mars was pretty much dry except for its polar ice caps, and may have always been that way. That was overturned when the rovers found evidence for ancient water on Mars – repeatedly.
There were minerals that are only created in salty water. There were clays formed in potentially drinkable water that may have once presented a habitable environment for microbes. There were veins that formed when water flowed through the cracked ground.
The water story just kept getting more and more interesting, says former Opportunity flight director Mike Seibert. Everything we take for granted about that planet basically changed in 2004.
Over the course of its mission, Opportunity drove about 45 kilometres, exploring more than 100 craters along its way and weathering bitter cold and numerous dust storms.
Mars has gone from this very distant, very poorly-understood place to a real world that humans can look into, says Steve Squyres, the lead scientist for Spirit and Opportunity. Weve climbed mountains, and weve descended into craters and looked across panoramic vistas, and I think thats transformed how people look at Mars.
Then, in June 2018, the big one came: a cloud of dust that quickly grew dense enough to blot out the sun from Mars surface and coat the rover – including the all-important solar panels that power it.
On 10 June, Opportunity sent its last signal to Earth. Since then, operators have frantically sent more than 600 wake-up calls to the rover instructing it to turn on and phone home, testing every kind of spacecraft error that they know how to correct.
Nothing worked. There was no call home. 5499 days into its 90-day mission, Opportunity is finished. Its the end of the first great Martian road trip, says Seibert.
Ultimately, the rovers will be remembered for their incredible longevity. I thought we might get 6 to 8 months on these things, maybe as much as a year says Squyres. If a spacecraft functions for 15 years and dies in one of the biggest dust storms Mars has seen in decades, thats an honourable death.

Mariella Moon,"[The images used for this video were taken by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager.] The smaller storm scientists spotted on May 30th turned into a planet-wide event by June 20th. It forced the solar-powered Opportunity rover to go on standby and conserve its energy, but the younger nuclear-powered Curiosity rover and NASA's orbiters are unaffected and can continue collecting data as the storm rages on. The Mars Color Imager aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been mapping the planet every afternoon to track the storm's evolution. MRO's Mars Climate Sounder instrument has also been measuring the atmosphere's temperature changes. Mars Odyssey spacecraft's THEMIS instrument has been tracking the planet's surface and atmospheric temperature, as well as the amount of dust in the atmosphere. The data it's gathering will help show scientists how the storm grew, changed and dissipated over time. NASA's MAVEN probe is also studying how the storm is affecting Mars' upper atmosphere, while Curiosity is keeping an eye on things from the ground, monitoring winds and measuring dust particles. It might take some time before we find out if Curiosity and the probes unravel any Martian secret, though. Scientists believe the storm could last for months, and that the haze might only clear up enough for Opportunity to start working again in September.","Martian dust storms can make nasty sand devils look cute, and every six to eight years, they can grow large enough to engulf the whole planet.

Alexandra Witze,"A top-down view of the solar panels that power NASA's Mars rover Opportunity. Credit: NASA/JPL NASA is waiting for a big dust storm on Mars to clear a little more before attempting to waken the sleeping Opportunity rover, the agency said on 30 August. The rover has been silent since 10 June, when the storm obscured the sunlight that the spacecraft needs to survive. When the dust abates, NASA will use the antennas of its global Deep Space Network to listen for signals from the spacecraft, and send messages to it, for at least 45 days. After that the agency will listen, possibly in a more passive mode that requires fewer staff hours, until at least January 2019. By that point, the Martian summer will have given way to autumn at Opportunity’s landing site. That change in seasons could kick up windstorms and clear any dust that might be coating the rover’s solar panels. The rover could be awoken by a NASA signal if it receives enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. It could also awaken itself, without a prompt, and attempt to communicate with Earth. The Martian dust storm of the past few months has been one of the most extensive ever seen on the red planet. Opportunity was designed to last for 90 Martian days, or about 13 Earth weeks. Yet it has survived for 14 years on the surface — rolling more than 45 kilometres from its landing site to its current resting place, in a spot called Perseverance Valley. Its discoveries include signs of an ancient habitable environment on Mars 4 billion years ago. “It’s been an enormously productive run, and the return on investment is just tremendous,” says Raymond Arvidson, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and the mission’s deputy principal investigator. “It’s a sad situation but not really unexpected.”","Space agency will soon begin listening for a signal from the spacecraft, which powered down in June during a dust storm.",2018-08-31T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",NASA's last-shot plan to revive silent Mars rover,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06143-4?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06143-4/d41586-018-06143-4_16088174.jpg,,Nature.com,dust storm,1
Mike Wall,"It's now been more than two months since NASA's long-lived Opportunity Mars rover last phoned home. Opportunity hasn't made a peep since June 10, when dust in the Red Planet's air got so thick that the solar-powered rover couldn't recharge its batteries. Opportunity's handlers think the six-wheeled robot has put itself into a sort of hibernation, and they still hope to get a ping once the dust storm has petered out. And there are good reasons for this optimism, NASA officials said. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: How It Grew &amp; What It Means for the Opportunity Rover ] ""Because the batteries were in relatively good health before the storm, there's not likely to be too much degradation,"" NASA officials wrote in an Opportunity update Thursday (Aug. 16). ""And because dust storms tend to warm the environment — and the 2018 storm happened as Opportunity's location on Mars entered summer — the rover should have stayed warm enough to survive."" The dust storm began on a regional scale in late May and had grown into a planet-encircling monster by June 20. The storm began dying down late last month, but there's still a lot of dust in the air — probably too much for Opportunity to start recharging its batteries. Scientists track the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere using a measurement of opacity called ""tau."" The lower the tau, the clearer the air. The air in Opportunity's neck of the woods — the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater — typically has a tau of about 0.5, NASA officials said. The rover's last recorded measurement, on June 10, tagged it at a whopping 10.8. The tau probably needs to be less than 2.0 for enough sunlight to get through to start charging the rover's batteries, mission team members said. Over the past week or so, the estimated tau in the Endeavour Crater region has ranged from around 2.1 to 2.5, they added. Engineers are trying to communicate with Opportunity several times a week using NASA's Deep Space Network, a system of big radio dishes around the globe. They hail the robot during scheduled ""wake-up times"" and then listen for a response. And team members are casting a wider net, too: Every day, they sift through all radio signals received from Mars, listening for any chirp from Opportunity, NASA officials said. Even if Opportunity does eventually wake up and re-establish contact, its long ordeal may end up taking a toll on the rover. ""The rover's batteries could have discharged so much power — and stayed inactive so long — that their capacity is reduced,"" NASA officials wrote in the update. ""If those batteries can't hold as much charge, it could affect the rover's continued operations. It could also mean that energy-draining behavior, like running its heaters during winter, could cause the batteries to brown out."" The golf-cart-size Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, three weeks after its twin, Spirit. Both robots embarked on three-month missions to search for signs of past water activity on the Red Planet. The duo found plenty of such evidence, and then kept exploring Mars for years after their warranties expired. Spirit finally got bogged down in a Martian sand trap in March 2010. The rover couldn't reorient itself to catch the sun, and it froze in the ensuing winter. NASA declared Spirit dead in 2011. NASA's other active Mars rover, the car-size Curiosity, is nuclear-powered and is therefore far less affected by the dust storm.

Joe Palca,"An artist's concept portrays a NASA rover exploring the surface of Mars. Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech NASA's Mars rover known as Opportunity has been on Mars nearly 15 years, a wee bit longer than the 90 days it was originally designed for. It has traveled 28 miles on the surface, taken thousands of images, and improved scientists' understanding of the red planet. But NASA hasn't heard from the plucky rover since June. ""I have to admit I'm beginning to be a little bit worried,"" says Bill Nelson, engineering manager for the rover. ""I thought about now was when I would have expected to hear from the vehicle."" Nelson says an intense dust storm that started back in May almost completely blotted out the sun. The rover's solar panels couldn't generate the power the rover needs to operate. When that happens, the rover is designed to put itself to sleep. When the sun comes back, the rover should wake up and transmit a signal to Earth, but it hasn't. ""It needs to have a certain minimum threshold of energy, and we believe it's not getting to that,"" Nelson says. It may be the storm covered the solar array with so much dust that ""it's not able to really recharge up to a level that would allow it to operate."" For the past few weeks, mission managers have been trying a different tactic. Instead of passively waiting for the rover to wake up on its own, they're pinging the rover with commands. The idea is that it might be waking up, but going back to sleep before it can transmit a signal. It takes about six minutes for a radio signal to travel to Mars, and another six minutes to come back. The sign over the console at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the first signal from the rover will be heard--if it comes. Ashton Vaughs / NASA/JPL-Caltech ""Around 12 minutes from the time we sent the command is when we would expect to hear back from the rover,"" says Ashton Vaughs, Opportunity Ace. The ""Ace"" is the one who actually presses the button that sends commands to the rover via the Deep Space Network, a collection of large radio antennas around the world. If the rover does send back a signal, Vaughs would be the first to hear it. ""We trust that he would share that information rapidly,"" Nelson says. Not hearing anything has been unsettling for the scientists and engineers working on Opportunity. ""Right now we're in this state of limbo, says Abigail Fraeman, deputy project scientist. ""What's going to happen next, we don't know."" Fraeman has a long history with the rover. In 2004, when she was 16, she was in a Jet Propulsion Laboratory control room when Opportunity landed. JPL is where the mission is managed. She was there as part of an outreach program called Red Rover Goes to Mars run by the Planetary Society. She says even if the rover is never heard from again, it's important to remember it was only expected to last 90 days. ""It's accomplished so much more than we even could have imagined,"" says Fraeman. ""I mean the fact that I was able to be in the room when it landed when I was in high school, and now I got my PhD, I'm at JPL and I'm the deputy project scientist just tells you how long this has been running, and how much has happened, and so it's sad, but it's not terribly sad. It's terribly happy how wonderful the mission has been."" The team working on Opportunity is treating the rover's silence not as a problem, but as an opportunity. Ashley Stroupe is a rover driver. She designs the commands for moving the rover's robotic arm on Mars. She's part of a team that was building new software packages for the rover when it went silent. ""We're at least taking advantage of the downtime to finish all that up, so that when, we'll say 'when,' Opportunity talks to us again we'll be ready to go,"" she says. You can call that Opportunity optimism.",NASA mission managers haven't heard from the Martian rover Opportunity since June.

Byline Manual,"The Gravity Assist Podcast is hosted by NASA's Chief Scientist, Jim Green, who talks to some of the greatest planetary scientists on the planet, giving a guided tour through the Solar System and beyond in the process. This week, he's joined by Melinda Kahre, who manages the Mars Climate Modeling Center at NASA's Ames Research Center and is an expert in Martian dust storms. You can listen to the full podcast here, or read the abridged transcript below. [ See How Huge the Monster Dust Storm on Mars Is in This Stunning Image ] Jim Green : What is the Mars Climate Modeling Center and how does it work? Melinda Kahre : The Mars Climate Modeling Center is a group here at NASA Ames that develops global climate codes to simulate the weather and climate on Mars. We need large computing power to be able to run our simulations, so we need the supercomputer at NASA Ames. Jim Green : To accurately see what's happening on Mars using your codes, you need input data. We have data from several orbiters and of course we've got weather stations on our rovers and landers on Mars. What's the most important datasets that you have to ingest into the models? Melinda Kahre : We use data in a variety of ways for numerical modeling. Some datasets we use directly in the model — the observed topography of Mars is a good example of that — and some datasets we use to compare with model results, to understand how realistic our datasets are. One really good example of that is the maps of atmospheric dust that are coming back from the orbiters. Jim Green : What are some of the parameters that are important in making these models work? Melinda Kahre : [The parameters are] everything that makes the climate of Mars run — so there are dynamical processes and physical processes. On the dynamical side we have winds, temperatures, pressures and densities, and on the physical side we represent processes like dust lifting, cloud formation, radiative transfer, how radiation affects the temperatures in the atmosphere and things like that. Jim Green : How do you make all that work? Melinda Kahre : We really do it piecemeal. We look at one little bit at a time and develop each little section individually. Jim Green : This summer there's been a huge dust storm in Mars. How often do dust storms go global like that? Melinda Kahre : Not that often. The last global dust storm was in 2007, so 11 years ago on Earth but six Martian years ago. Generally we see global storms on Mars one out of every three years, but it's been a while since we've seen one this big. Jim Green : In 2007 Curiosity [rover] hadn't landed, but Spirit and Opportunity were going strong and managed to survive that global dust storm. Melinda Kahre : Yes they did, both of them, and they observed the amount of dust in the atmosphere throughout that storm. As the global dust storm of summer 2018 took hold, NASA's Opportunity rover watched as the sky darkened with dust until it blocked out the Sun. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/TAMU Jim Green : What's the composition of the dust? Melinda Kahre : The dust grains are mostly silicates, so plagioclase, feldspars, zeolite, and they also have some iron oxides, which is why they look a little bit red. Jim Green : How big are they? Are they like grains of sand on a beach? Melinda Kahre : They're smaller than sand. We're talking one and a half microns, two microns, so think of them as like really fine ash in size. Jim Green : The dust is really small and then can be lofted [into the atmosphere] but there's also dust that's slightly larger and gets lofted a little bit but then comes down, so there's a certain way that dust moves over the planet. Can you describe a little bit how that happens? Melinda Kahre : There are a few different ways that particles move depending on their size. If a particle is really fine like a dust grain that can be lofted directly into the atmosphere then it can enter into suspension, which means that it can blow around without coming back down to the ground too quickly. If the particles are a bit bigger than that, you start talking about sand-sized particles, 100 microns or so, and those particles will leave the ground but they won't get very far before in the air before they fall back down due to gravity. When those particles come back they can then hit the ground and splash other, smaller particles into the air and into suspension. The final process is called 'creep', which involves large particles that don't really leave the ground but which can roll and bump along the surface a little bit. We think that saltation actually is the most likely mechanism for injecting dust into the atmosphere. Jim Green : That's when they leave the ground and come back and and throw more particles up, sort of like a cascade. Melinda Kahre : Yes, it focusses on sand-sized particles because it turns out that those are the easiest particles to move. If particles are too big they don't leave the ground because of gravity, but if they're too small then they stick together on the ground and they're hard to get off the ground. So sand moves most easily and then it can come back down and splash small particles up [into the atmosphere]. [ Wake Up, Opportunity! Engineers Have an Awesome Playlist for NASA's Sleeping Mars Rover ] An artist's impression of a dust storm approaching a lander on Mars. In this portrayal, the dust storm is crackling with static electricity, resulting in lightning. Credit: NASA Jim Green : How high can these dust storms get? Melinda Kahre : We see direct evidence of dust getting up to 60 kilometers or more. Jim Green : Once the dust particles get lofted into the atmosphere, the dynamics in the atmosphere change, too. What's the biggest thing that happens to the atmosphere during a dust storm? Melinda Kahre : When you put these small dust particles into the atmosphere they absorb solar radiation and warm the atmosphere. They then radiate in the infrared so the atmosphere actually warms up. The middle of the atmosphere warms, and that warming causes changes to the dynamics, to the wind fields, and the circulation is generally ramped up when you put a lot of dust into the atmosphere. The diurnal cycle [i.e. the day/night temperature difference] is suppressed because when you put dust into the atmosphere it absorbs solar radiation during the daytime, so not as much sunlight comes down to the ground to warm the surface. So the daytime temperatures are cooler with dust in the atmosphere, but then at night those dust particles are radiating in the infrared down to the surface and the surface is actually warmed during the night. Jim Green : Where is the dust coming from on Mars ? Are there specific places where they start? Melinda Kahre : Dust storms are observed to start in a lot of different locations on Mars. Not every global storm starts in the same place, although a lot of them start in the southern hemisphere. This current dust storm started in the north and traveled across the equator. We don't actually have a great handle on where the surface dust actually is on Mars. We have good indications that there are dusty locations near the equator that have thick dust deposits. We also know that there's a fair amount of dust in the polar regions. Jim Green : Mars has a fairly elliptical orbit, and my understanding is that the dust storms start when the Sun and Mars are the closest. Melinda Kahre : That's right, Mars is closest to the Sun near the southern summer solstice, and that tends to be when the circulation is the strongest to begin with. Jim Green : So that's kind of the season Mars is entering into right now in the southern hemisphere. Melinda Kahre : That's right. Jim Green : How long do these global dust storms last? What can we expect to happen next? Melinda Kahre : They last months. It takes a while for them to get going but once they reach their peak and dust is literally enshrouding the whole planet, we seem to see the lifting centers [i.e. primary deposits of dust that is lifted into the atmosphere] stop operating and then dust falls out slowly over time, and it can take months for that dust to come back down. [ What Would It Be Like to Live on Mars? ] A Martian dust storm creeps across the red planet's surface, as seen by the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft. Credit: ESA/DLR/FU Berlin Jim Green : This particular dust storm has reached its peak and is maybe waning, so we are still going to have several more weeks of this dust. Melinda Kahre : Yes, it's going to be up there for a while. The large particles will fall first, and then the small particles will fall out more slowly. Jim Green : Some people have noticed that Mars looks a little more yellow at night when they look up from Earth and see it — it's not as red at it used to be. Is that because of the dust storm? Melinda Kahre : Yes, you can't really see the surface of Mars right now when you look at it through a telescope. The whole atmosphere is full of dust that does change the color a little bit. Jim Green : Does anything like this happen on Earth? I don't know that we expect global dust storms, but some of the physics must be the same. Melinda Kahre : We don't experience global dust storms here on Earth, but we do have dust storms on Earth and dust devils on Earth, and the physics is the same. We use what we learn from Earth and apply it to other places and that's exactly how we attempt to understand how these things operate on Mars. Jim Green : One of the things that I always do, because I'm fascinated about how each and every one of us got into the field of science that we're doing, is ask about what event happened in our life that really propelled us forward to become the scientist that we are today. And I call that a 'Gravity Assist'. So, Melinda, what was your gravity assist? Melinda Kahre : It's actually hard for me to identify just one because I feel I've had lots over the years. I got hooked on science in school when I was pretty young, probably in sixth or seventh grade. I took Earth science and physics and I loved science, I liked the process of science. Then I started taking an astronomy class in college and got hooked on astronomy and then I moved on into planetary science when I went to grad school. Actually the 2001 global storm happened during the summer that I started grad school, and that, among other reasons, was a why I got interested in studying Mars.

https://business.facebook.com/NetNewsledger/,"HOUSTON – TECH – One of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration, NASA’s Opportunity rover mission is at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars and helping lay the groundwork for NASAs return to the Red Planet.
The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, to no avail. The solar-powered rover’s final communication was received June 10.
One of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration, our @MarsRovers Opportunity is at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars. Designed to last just 90 Martian days, here’s a look at this record-setting mission: https://t.co/erVYRlyIOmpic.twitter.com/VEY0KbLxyz
 NASA (@NASA) February 13, 2019
“It is because of trailblazing missions such as Opportunity that there will come a day when our brave astronauts walk on the surface of Mars,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “And when that day arrives, some portion of that first footprint will be owned by the men and women of Opportunity, and a little rover that defied the odds and did so much in the name of exploration.”
Designed to last just 90 Martian days and travel 1,100 yards (1,000 meters), Opportunity vastly surpassed all expectations in its endurance, scientific value and longevity. In addition to exceeding its life expectancy by 60 times, the rover traveled more than 28 miles (45 kilometers) by the time it reached its most appropriate final resting spot on Mars Perseverance Valley.
“For more than a decade, Opportunity has been an icon in the field of planetary exploration, teaching us about Mars’ ancient past as a wet, potentially habitable planet, and revealing uncharted Martian landscapes,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Whatever loss we feel now must be tempered with the knowledge that the legacy of Opportunity continues both on the surface of Mars with the Curiosity rover and InSight lander and in the clean rooms of JPL, where the upcoming Mars 2020 rover is taking shape.”
The final transmission, sent via the 70-meter Mars Station antenna at NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Complex in California, ended a multifaceted, eight-month recovery strategy in an attempt to compel the rover to communicate.
We have made every reasonable engineering effort to try to recover Opportunity and have determined that the likelihood of receiving a signal is far too low to continue recovery efforts,” said John Callas, manager of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project at JPL.
Opportunity landed in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars on Jan. 24, 2004, seven months after its launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Its twin rover, Spirit, landed 20 days earlier in the 103-mile-wide (166-kilometer-wide) Gusev Crater on the other side of Mars. Spirit logged almost 5 miles (8 kilometers) before its mission wrapped up in May 2011.
From the day Opportunity landed, a team of mission engineers, rover drivers and scientists on Earth collaborated to overcome challenges and get the rover from one geologic site on Mars to the next. They plotted workable avenues over rugged terrain so that the 384-pound (174-kilogram) Martian explorer could maneuver around and, at times, over rocks and boulders, climb gravel-strewn slopes as steep as 32-degrees (an off-Earth record), probe crater floors, summit hills and traverse possible dry riverbeds. Its final venture brought it to the western limb of Perseverance Valley.
“I cannot think of a more appropriate place for Opportunity to endure on the surface of Mars than one called Perseverance Valley,” said Michael Watkins, director of JPL. “The records, discoveries and sheer tenacity of this intrepid little rover is testament to the ingenuity, dedication, and perseverance of the people who built and guided her.”
More Opportunity Achievements
Set a one-day Mars driving record March 20, 2005, when it traveled 721 feet (220 meters).
Returned more than 217,000 images, including 15 360-degree color panoramas.
Exposed the surfaces of 52 rocks to reveal fresh mineral surfaces for analysis and cleared 72 additional targets with a brush to prepare them for inspection with spectrometers and a microscopic imager.
Found hematite, a mineral that forms in water, at its landing site.
Discovered strong indications at Endeavour Crater of the action of ancient water similar to the drinkable water of a pond or lake on Earth.
All of the off-roading and on-location scientific analyses were in service of the Mars Exploration Rovers primary objective: To seek out historical evidence of the Red Planet’s climate and water at sites where conditions may once have been favorable for life. Because liquid water is required for life, as we know it, Opportunity’s discoveries implied that conditions at Meridiani Planum may have been habitable for some period of time in Martian history.
“From the get-go, Opportunity delivered on our search for evidence regarding water,” said Steve Squyres, principal investigator of the rovers’ science payload at Cornell University. “And when you combine the discoveries of Opportunity and Spirit, they showed us that ancient Mars was a very different place from Mars today, which is a cold, dry, desolate world. But if you look to its ancient past, you find compelling evidence for liquid water below the surface and liquid water at the surface.”
All those accomplishments were not without the occasional extraterrestrial impediment. In 2005 alone, Opportunity lost steering to one of its front wheels, a stuck heater threatened to severely limit the rover’s available power, and a Martian sand ripple almost trapped it for good. Two years later, a two-month dust storm imperiled the rover before relenting. In 2015, Opportunity lost use of its 256-megabyte flash memory and, in 2017, it lost steering to its other front wheel.
Each time the rover faced an obstacle, Opportunity’s team on Earth found and implemented a solution that enabled the rover to bounce back. However, the massive dust storm that took shape in the summer of 2018 proved too much for history’s most senior Mars explorer.
“When I think of Opportunity, I will recall that place on Mars where our intrepid rover far exceeded everyone’s expectations,” Callas said. “But what I suppose I’ll cherish most is the impact Opportunity had on us here on Earth. It’s the accomplished exploration and phenomenal discoveries. Its the generation of young scientists and engineers who became space explorers with this mission. It’s the public that followed along with our every step. And it’s the technical legacy of the Mars Exploration Rovers, which is carried aboard Curiosity and the upcoming Mars 2020 mission. Farewell, Opportunity, and well done.”
Mars exploration continues unabated. NASA’s InSight lander, which touched down on Nov. 26, is just beginning its scientific investigations. The Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale Crater for more than six years. And, NASA’s Mars 2020 rover and the European Space Agencys ExoMars rover both will launch in July 2020, becoming the first rover missions designed to seek signs of past microbial life on the Red Planet.

Gusts maxing out at 55 mph whipped dust into the air and caused the weather service to issue a dust storm warning that expired at 11:30 a.m. The storm, as have others in the past couple of days, hit Henderson and eastern parts of the valley. “It’s not their week,” meteorologist Todd Lericos said.

As cloud cover thickens and winds pick up Saturday, temperatures in the valley will drop. The high on Saturday is forecast at 103. A slight chance for more showers and thunderstorms after the “big storm” will linger Saturday afternoon through Sunday before slowly tapering out that evening, the weather service said. Then, meteorologist John Adair warned, a heat wave. Sunday’s high will reach 106, but temperatures will begin to climb Monday, when the valley is expected to see a 110-degree high, according to the weather service. An excessive heat warning will go into effect 10 a.m. Tuesday through 9 p.m. Thursday, although the warning could be either extended or shortened “depending on if we get more moisture,” Adair said. Tuesday’s high is 113, followed by respective highs of 114 and 112 on Wednesday and Thursday. Because temperatures will increase, the humidity index in the valley will be bumped down to near 12 percent. “It will be a little sticky but very hot,” Adair said.

Six people have been arrested in connection with what Venezuelan officials call an assassination attempt on President Nicolas Maduro. The attack happened over the weekend as Maduro was giving a speech during a military parade. A pair of drones loaded with explosives flew right toward him. Live footage of the event showed Maduro suddenly looking up startled midspeech, while beside him his wife, Cilia Flores, winced after a loud bang and dozens of soldiers were seen scattering. Authorities were able to knock the drones off course and caused them to detonate away from Maduro. Appearing on TV a few hours later, Maduro blamed the attack on the far right in Venezuela and Colombia, outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Venezuelans living in the US.

Chelsea Gohd,"Thanks to the massive ongoing dust storm on Mars, the Red Planet looks pretty eerie and shadowless right now. Last week, NASA released a photo of the Martian surface that shows the Curiosity rover's Duluth drill site in Gale Crater both before and after the start of the dust storm, which now covers the entire planet. In the photo below, the planet's surface appears bright, cherry red and totally shadowless. The eerie sight hardly seems real … but it is. On June 12, the dust storm on Mars proved to be serious when NASA lost contact with its Opportunity rover, which is powered by solar panels and can't store enough energy to call home. (Curiosity is nuclear-powered.) The storm expanded and, by June 20, became a global weather event, NASA officials said. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for the Opportunity Rover ] These two images were taken by the Mast Camera, or Mastcam, aboard NASA's Curiosity rover. The photo on the left was taken on Sol 2058 (May 21) and shows the rover's drill site before the dust storm. The photo on the right, taken on Sol 2084 (June 17) after the dust storm had begun, shows the dramatic difference as Mars appears red and shadowless. Two images show the ""Duluth"" drill site on Mars both before and after the dust storm that grew to cover the entire planet. The left image, taken before the storm on Sol 2058 (May 21) is drastically different from the image taken on Sol 2084 (June 17) that appears bright red and shadowless. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS So why aren't there shadows in the image? Because the dust in Mars' atmosphere has completely covered the sky when viewedfrom the planet's surface, Mike Malin, principal investigator for the Mastcam instrument, told Space.com in an email. Big rover on a little planet - @MarsCuriosity on Sol 2082 during the global dust storm - https://t.co/BqvEpxxrgJ pic.twitter.com/Pssx1aW0JE — Kevin M. Gill (@kevinmgill) June 20, 2018 The effect is ""like an overcast day on Earth,"" Malin said. Even though, if you were standing on Mars, you wouldn't be able to see the sun, the sky is bright ""almost uniformly everywhere (uniform to the eye; photometric instruments can tell roughly where the sun is)."" Because the sky is illuminating the planet's surface so uniformly, it decreases shadowing, Malin said. It looks darker on Mars than it might on a cloudy day on Earth, however, because clouds of dust obscure much more light than clouds of water droplets, and sunlight on Mars is only half as bright as that on Earth to start with, because of the planet's distance, he added. So, for now, because the Martian atmosphere is chock-full of dust, the planet's surface lacks shadows. The bright red color in the image of the Duluth drill site from June 17 has a different explanation, however. The dust on Curiosity reduces the light that the Mastcam can use, thus requiring the camera to use a longer exposure, according to a statement from NASA. The dust storm caused the exposure time on the camera to be nine times longer than usual, leading to a distortion in color. But aside from the exposure time, the main reason the image appears so red is that very little green, and almost no blue, light can make it through the dust, according to the statement. Therefore, red light is what primarily makes it through the dust. In the statement, NASA officials compared the effect to ""a red stage light"" that ""filters the other colors out."" Mars' dusty, red, shadowless appearance may have an explanation, but it doesn't make it look any less creepy. Email Chelsea Gohd at cgohd@space.com or follow her @chelsea_gohd.

"Neel V. Patel, Neel V. Patel","NASA has begun what is very likely its final attempt to re-establish contact with the Opportunity rover, after a massive Martian dust storm forced the agency to put the 15-year-old robot to sleep. If unsuccessful, this effort will make for a sad finale to the rover, but also cap off one of the greatest Mars missions ever conductedpropelled by technology thats punched way above its weight.
To recap: a gargantuan dust storm swelled over the red planet last summer, effectively blotting out the sun. NASA chose to move Opportunity, a solar powered rover, into an energy-saving mode, keeping it technically on, but shutting down its scientific operations and most of its instruments. This way, the rover could run enough power to keep its heaters on and protect itself from cold temperatures that could do irreparable harm to its parts. Once the storm abated, the rover could use sunlight to recharge its batteries and come back to life once again.
It didnt exactly work out this way. The skies cleared up, but Oppy stayed asleep. NASA hasnt been able to communicate with the rover since June 10 of last year, and the reason isnt totally clear. John Callas, the project manager for the Opportunity mission at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained in a press release that the team planned to conduct a sweep and beep strategy for contacting the rover, transmitting new commands to Opportunity instead of simply putting an ear out and listening.
There are dozens of potential explanations for Opportunitys silence. The rovers solar panels might simply be caked in too much dust to function, or the storm might have broken something vital. Less likely, NASA suspects the primary and secondary X-band radios Opportunity uses to communicate have failed, or that the rovers internal clock (which orients its computer brain) is down. The sweep and beep commands could help to reset some of the rovers internal software and force it to switch to a backup X-band radio or reset the clock.
Unfortunately, the window on re-establishing contact with the rover is almost surely about to close. Heres the thing: Opportunity has lasted long outlived its initial 90-day mission (its been going for 14 years) because Martian winds have periodically cleaned dust off the rovers solar panels and allowed it to recharge. This was an unexpected boon, but its allowed Oppy to survive 55-times its planned lifespan.
Mars is currently in the midst of one of its windy seasons that helps clean the dust out, but thats quickly coming to an end, and will be followed by a southern winter thats sure to bring temperatures low enough to cause catastrophic damage to the rovers unpowered batteries, as well as other internal circuitry. The Martian winter is what killed the Spirit Rover back in 2010.
Even if this is the end of Opportunity, there is no question the mission has been a phenomenal success. Besides the rovers storied body of observations and scientific data, its been a terrific example of the sorts of planetary exploration technologies capable of lasting years and able to withstand extreme environments and climates found on other worlds. The rovers battery and power system in particular has been a tremendous success story, inspiring the power systems developed for the Curiosity rover and the Mars 2020 rover later on.
We all hope that Opportunity can muster up the willpower to go for another 15 years, but even its down for the count, it will have already done more for Mars exploration than we ever anticipated.","Space The window of Opportunity is closing. NASA hasn't given up on Opportunity just yet, but this could be the agency's last effort to reestablish contact with the rover—here's why.",2019-01-29T20:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Popsci.com'}",NASA's latest effort to revive Opportunity will likely be the last,https://www.popsci.com/opportunity-rover-last-chance,https://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/2018/02/mer_2003_opportunity.gif?itok=2c5ReSSr,,Popsci.com,dust storm,1
Mike Wall,"The huge dust storm raging on Mars is a curse for NASA's Opportunity rover but something of a blessing for the space agency's other Red Planet missions. The solar-powered Opportunity has been silent for weeks, unable to recharge its batteries because of all the light-blocking dust in the air. Mission team members think the six-wheeled rover, which has been exploring Mars since January 2004, has put itself into a sort of hibernation, and they're cautiously optimistic that Opportunity will wake up when the dust clears. Unfortunately, that may take a while. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: How It Grew &amp; What It Means for the Opportunity Rover ] ""Based on the longevity of a 2001 global storm, NASA scientists estimate it may be early September before the haze has cleared enough for Opportunity to power up and call home,"" NASA officials wrote in a statement Wednesday (July 18). But other agency missions are taking advantage of a rare opportunity — global dust storms engulf the Red Planet just once every six or eight Earth years — to learn more about the Martian atmosphere and climate. For example, Opportunity's bigger, younger cousin Curiosity is studying the size and distribution of dust particles in the Red Planet's air using a variety of instruments, including its onboard weather station. (Curiosity is nuclear powered and is therefore largely unbothered by the dust.) Curiosity's weather data could also shed light on how dust storms affect Martian ""atmospheric tides,"" which are pressure waves that travel widely throughout the planet's air, mission team members said. ""We're working double-duty right now,"" Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, said in the same statement. ""Our newly recommissioned drill is acquiring a fresh rock sample. But we are also using instruments to study how the dust storm evolves."" Then there's the view from above. Three different NASA orbiters are intently eyeing the storm, which began on a localized scale in late May and had gone global by June 20. Researchers are using the THEMIS (Thermal Emission Imaging System) instrument aboard NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to monitor surface and atmospheric temperatures, as well as dust loads in the air. ""This is one of the largest weather events that we've seen on Mars"" since up-close spacecraft observations began in the 1960s, THEMIS team member Michael Smith, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the same statement. ""Having another example of a dust storm really helps us to understand what's going on."" The THEMIS team has increased the pace of the instrument's global-atmosphere measurements from once every 10 days before the dust storm to twice per week now, Smith added. NASA's workhorse Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which first spotted the storm on May 30, is using two instruments to track its evolution and effect on atmospheric temperatures. This effect can be self-reinforcing, NASA officials said: As dust high in the atmosphere absorbs solar energy and heats up, wind patterns can change, lifting more dust off the planet's surface. These side-by-side animations, courtesy of the Mars Color Imager camera onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, show how dust has enveloped the Red Planet from May 2018 (left) to July 2018 (right). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS A better understanding of these details, provided by Odyssey and MRO data, could help researchers learn why some Martian dust storms peter out as localized affairs and others go global, NASA officials said. The agency's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter, or MAVEN, is focused on dust-storm effects higher up, where the Red Planet's air meets the vacuum of space. MAVEN's main mission goal involves better understanding how Mars lost its once-thick atmosphere, a pivotal event that caused the planet's climate to shift from relatively warm and wet to cold and dry. MAVEN's observations have already revealed that Mars' air was stripped by charged particles streaming from the sun, and that the damage began occurring around 4.2 billion years ago, when the Red Planet lost its global magnetic field. The current situation provides an opportunity to better understand what role, if any, big dust storms play in the atmosphere-stripping process, MAVEN team members said. For example, does the associated heating of the atmosphere cause more air molecules to escape into space? Ever since MAVEN arrived at Mars in September 2014, ""one of the things we've been waiting for is a global dust storm,"" said MAVEN principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder.

Mike Wall,"If you have a hard time visualizing a planet-wide dust storm on Mars, take a look at this. Astrophotographer Damian Peach created an animation showing the dramatic effects of the global dust storm that has plunged the Martian surface deep into darkness. ""The animation was created using my image from June 28th taken from Chile using a 1-meter telescope and the MGS basemap of the exact same longitude,"" Peach told Space.com via email. (MGS is NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which studied the Red Planet from orbit from 1997 to 2006.) [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: How It Grew So Large ] ""I carefully matched them together to show a gradual change of the normal clear view of this hemisphere to how it appears now,"" Peach added. ""It shows the large scale-obscuration due to airborne dust."" Peach posted the image online via Twitter. The dust storm began as a localized phenomenon in late May, but it grew incredibly quickly. By the third week of June, the storm had become a planet-circling event, and it continues to rage today. That's a shame for amateur astronomers who had hoped to get a good look at Mars through their telescopes late this month, when the planet makes its closest approach to Earth since 2003. Currently, the Red Planet's features are ""largely lost beneath the dust,"" Peach said. ""It will take at least a couple of months from now for Mars to start to return to a normal appearance — provided further local dust storms do not develop (quite possible as we are now well into the season on Mars where dust events are common)."" Astrophotographer Damian Peach created this animation, which shows how the global dust storm currently raging on Mars has obscured the planet's surface features. Credit: Damian Peach The dust storm is also creating issues for NASA's solar-powered Opportunity rover, which has been silent for weeks, unable to recharge its batteries. Opportunity has apparently put itself into a sort of hibernation, turning off everything but its internal clock to conserve energy, mission team members have said. The rover's handlers have expressed optimism that Opportunity will be able to ride out the dust storm, but their anxiety won't clear until the six-wheeled robot finally phones home once again.

WIRED Staff,"As classes got underway this week, something was missing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Something weird. The sidewalks of Cambridge were jammed with students and their boxes, as they always are during the first week of September. There was nowhere to park. Moving vans blocked traffic on every street. Freshmen walked the “infinite corridor” of the main building as their parents took photos and consulted maps, mortifying their children. Tanned professors returning from vacation unlocked their labs. Tour guides pointed out the nuclear reactor in the center of campus. (It’s easier to miss than it sounds.) But about the weirdness: Across the street from the Media Lab, a grand neoclassical building rises at 70 Amherst Street, an L-shaped stone structure with a courtyard at its crook, over which look two ornate balconies held up by Doric columns. A large oak tree grows in the courtyard, a tire swing that for decades was tied to a sturdy branch is gone. All is quiet. You can hear the plink on stone each time an acorn drops. This was Senior House, the oldest dormitory on campus, built in 1916 by the architect William Welles Bosworth. For 101 years it welcomed freshman and returning students. Since the ’60s it was a proudly anarchic community of creative misfits and self-described outcasts—the special kind of brilliant oddballs who couldn’t or didn’t want to fit in with the mainstream eggheads at MIT. Some did drugs and dropped out. Some did drugs and graduated. Others were proudly “straight edge,” eschewing drugs and regarding their bodies and minds as pristine temples. Many went on to create startups, join huge tech firms, and change the technological world as we know it. Senior House holds an annual Steer Roast. This was the invitation to the 1985 event. Senior House was the gravitational center of alternative culture at MIT, characterized by extremes. For example, since 1963 its courtyard was the site for an annual Dionysian festival that began with a whole steer being hauled atop a pit and roasted on an open flame. The bacchanal ended three days later when there was no more mud left to wrestle in or drinks to gulp. By the time the third dawn came, friendships had been forged, tire swings had been swung, meat had been devoured, some drugs had probably been snorted or smoked, jobs had been offered, and lives had been changed. On campus, the reputation of Senior House preceded it. “When I became housemaster, the dormitory was functioning as a storm drain for the other MIT living groups,” wrote professor Jay Keyser of his time living in the house in the 1980s. “All the difficult students were funneled there.” Its motto was “Sport death, only life can kill you,” which sounds … scary. (The house symbol is a human skull.) Campus lore has it that Senior House residents used to burn kittens in the house furnace. There’s a rumor the first Steer Roast happened because a cow was brought upstairs, and when the students couldn’t get it back down they slaughtered it, threw the meat into the courtyard, and roasted it. “Or there’s the one that students in Senior House carry towels with them because at any point in time if they want to have an orgy they can just throw it down and have sex on the towel,” says class of 1996 alumnus Mark Feldmeier, who was a graduate adviser living in Senior House in the early 2000s and now teaches at MIT’s Media Lab, embodying the punk rock ethos of Senior House in his floppy mohawk. In the early 2000s residents embraced that ridiculous legend, printing up Senior House towels. “That’s the double-edged sword of Senior House,” Feldmeier says. “Rather than suffer these rumors as an indignity, they play it up.” But Steer Roast is no more. And neither is Senior House, which this year, for the first time in its history, is closed to undergraduates and is being referred to by the administration simply as 70 Amherst Street. Those students who called it home last year, and the year before that, and the year before that, are now spread out among the returning students, moving into unfamiliar rooms, separated from each other by happenstance and lottery. New freshman and parents on tours might not notice the change. But for returning students, professors, staff, alumni, and neighbors of the university, the sudden calm feels like a party after the music has been turned off. Which raises a question: Why did the school close down Senior House? The void left in its wake will be felt not just across campus but throughout the technology industry that has for so long depended on the minds in this dorm for inspiration. The demise of Senior House is emblematic of a larger shift on campuses across the US. Last year my own alma mater, Wesleyan University, closed down its countercultural house Eclectic, which had existed for a century. A few years ago Caltech kicked students out of its countercultural dorm Ricketts. “If it were just Senior House I would be upset and sad,” says alumna Christine Corbett Moran, an astrophysicist and engineer who, after graduation, helped write the code for the encrypted chat app Signal. “But I really see it as a harbinger of MIT and other colleges homogenizing and corporatizing.” Senior House is quiet. Here’s what happened. Skirmante Survilaite chose MIT largely because she wanted to live in Senior House. This year she has moved to Tau Epsilon Phi, a co-ed fraternity off campus. Students No one feels Senior House’s closure more acutely than Skirmante Survilaite, an MIT senior majoring in biotechnology. She came to Cambridge not for the famous professors but to live in Senior House. After a lifetime of not fitting in, of paying the bills and cooking the family meals because her single mother worked three jobs, of missing out on the normal parts of adolescence because she had to be responsible for her younger sister and “be the spouse of the family,” as she says, the people at Senior House made her feel like she was home. A superb student who emigrated from Lithuania with her family when she was 5, Survilaite was offered full rides to Harvard, MIT, Case Western Reserve University, and the University of Chicago. With a special traveling scholarship, she visited Cambridge to check out MIT and Harvard. Unlike most universities, MIT asks incoming freshman to pick a dormitory in which they will live for all four years of study. No wonder visiting dorms on campus is the single most important thing prospective students do. And the dorms lay it on thick, with parties and fliers and videos. Though Survilaite says she was a “goodie-two-shoes” in high school, she found herself drawn to the free-thinking dorms on MIT’s east side: East Campus and Senior House. At both dorms, murals adorned the walls. Students working on difficult theoretical math problems sat beside students strumming banjos. She loved the mix of people, the way they seemed driven by passion rather than pressure. At first the two dorms appeared to be pretty much indistinguishable to Survilaite, but East Campus had one problem: cockroaches. She’s thankful for those bugs now. They helped her find a family on campus—family like her friend and classmate Cory Johnson, who found in the dorm a refuge he’d never known he needed. But after leaving his strict religious home in Texas and living in a different MIT dorm his freshman year where he was nervous to come out as gay, he transferred to Senior House and found a community that celebrated him for who he was. Unlike the fancier dorms on campus, at Senior House students said it was OK to be smart and driven and also unsure about exactly what you wanted out of life. More than OK; it was great. It was great to come from a working-class family. It was great to be gay or trans or a race other than white or to be into art and theater. It was great to be anything and everything you wanted to be. In that first visit to Senior House, students told Survilaite how the privacy browser Tor had been invented by an undergrad named Roger Dingledine right here. Nirvana had played in this room on their first US tour in 1990. They showed her where Corbett had lived and where a student had once dumped hundreds of bags of sand in her room and made a beach for people to relax on when they were stressed. Survilaite could soon meet all of them, and more, when house alumni returned for Steer Roast to offer advice about life and career. In this way, the residents explained to her, Senior House was more than just a place she could live for four years; it would be a permanent home she could return to forever, a network of people who would always be connected by their shared values and love of this place. She wanted in. It wasn’t an upsell. When Steer Roast rolled around that spring, Survilaite found herself chatting with Dingledine, the creator of Tor. “Steer Roast is the way I stay connected to the MIT community,” he says. He goes to meet people like Survilaite. “I hang out at the fire pit at 6 am and tell them stories,” he says. He tells them how all good ideas start in a counterculture. He tells them how he and his Senior House friends stayed up night after night in the late ’90s trying to make a way for people to communicate anonymously to protect dissent. Survilaite was a convert. “It was the first time in my life that I felt like I could actually belong anywhere,” she says. MIT senior Cory Johnson says Senior House was the first place he was allowed to be himself. The Fight In June 2016—just as the school year was coming to a close—Survilaite, along with her friend Johnson and the other residents of Senior House, began to understand that their dorm was in the university’s crosshairs. On June 10, MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart sent them an email explaining that there was troubling evidence that the residents of Senior House were struggling on several fronts. Registrar data showed that the hall’s graduation rate was lower than any dorm on campus—21.1 percent of Senior House students were failing to graduate, versus the campus average of 7.7 percent. In addition, the email cited data that suggested higher-than-average drug use in the house. The email to students was part of what appeared to be a coordinated public relations attack on the century-old dorm. “They sent the students who lived in Senior House the email at, let’s say, 11 am, and simultaneously they posted a news article on the MIT news site and then five minutes later they started emailing our parents—and then all undergraduate parents,” Johnson says. For many Senior House students, this was the first email their parents had ever received from the school, and it was alarming. “Imagine, a lot of these kids live in fear of their parents. They don’t fit in with their families, and now this letter is the only piece of correspondence they ever receive from the university?” Feldmeier says. The reaction among parents was predictable: Many told their kids to move out of Senior House. Chancellor Barnhart says that parents, who were in many cases paying the bills, deserved to know what was going on with their children. At this point, Barnhart says, the intention was not to shut down the dorm. Instead, over that summer, Senior House student leaders, faculty advisers, alumni, and the administration began working together on what Barnhart called a turnaround project. The administration was committed to a long-term effort. “This is not even just a one-year effort,” Barnhart remembers believing and expressing at the time. “It’s a multiyear effort because it’s about changing culture and dynamics.” The chancellor created a committee of 47 people—faculty, staff, and students, including some who lived at Senior House—to run the turnaround. Looking toward the start of the 2016–17 academic year, Barnhart said that the house would be closed to incoming freshman, but that those already slated to live in the dorm could return. Throughout the fall, working groups of the committee made progress, writing a report in January 2017 about positive changes they had made, including placing a mental health professional within Senior House for students in need of counseling. This was especially helpful for Survilaite, who was having a hard time during this period. She’d been in an abusive relationship, and her partner had moved into her room at Senior House. With the help of her friends and this mental health professional, she was able to end the relationship and kick him out. The committee also focused on improving tutoring, addiction services, campus outreach, and making the house a safer place for residents and visitors. But then something happened. Turnaround meetings, which had consumed the student leadership the previous semester, stopped. Citing privacy concerns, the administration refused to disclose what precisely had happened, but Barnhart told the student newspaper The Tech that “we received highly credible reports of unsafe and illegal behavior in Senior House.” In an interview with WIRED, she says “because of what happened in the spring we just felt that we didn’t have that [turnaround] option anymore. We felt that we needed to do what we needed to do.” At that point the administration began what it called a formal review, including one-on-one interviews with all house residents. Barnhart announced this process at 10 pm in a hastily called meeting with all house residents. In that meeting, the students asked Barnhart if they could have a lawyer present in the one-on-one interviews and were told they could not. Students in the house say these mandatory interviews felt like interrogations, with questions centering on whether drugs were sold or used in the house. “This was Lord of the Flies,” Johnson says. “They wanted us to turn on each other.” After the review, the turnaround was deemed a failure and five sophomore Senior House students were referred to the disciplinary committee. The unconfirmed story around the house was that these students had, using a group chat application, arranged to buy cocaine for a party. When asked if this was the incident that halted the turnaround and prompted the review, Barnhart declined to comment on the specifics and said no single event would have led to her decision to halt the turnaround or kick the undergraduates out of the house. Then she added, “This happening—especially as we were working so hard to address exactly these issues—led us to the idea that this was unworkable.” That spring Steer Roast was cancelled and Senior House students and alumni went on red alert. Thousands of alumni signed open letters to the administration, which they published in The Tech, urging Steer Roast to be reinstated and the house to be protected. The whole Senior House network had a feeling that, after years of the house and the administration being increasingly at odds, its days might now be numbered. As the school year drew to a close, students staged sit-ins. Senior House supporters started websites as part of the campaign to save the dorm. Meanwhile, professors who thought the house should be closed wrote op-eds in The Tech arguing that the house was a negatively self-reinforcing environment that was putting its residents at risk. In July 2017, Barnhart announced that the dorm known as Senior House would effectively cease to exist. She’d decided that, starting this fall, the building would be used as graduate student housing. Over the summer, former Senior House residents were put in a housing lottery to find new accommodations. The administration painted over murals and covered others up with whiteboards. Feldmeier watched from his office as the story of Senior House written onto its walls was whitewashed. One way to kill a culture, he says: “With lots of white paint.” Senior House alum Michael Potash (at the wheel) and peers during a Steer Roast celebration in the early ’70s. The Senior House courtyard in 1985. Cultural Shift MIT’s dismantling of Senior House is part of a nationwide trend on college campuses, a shift that places a premium on safety, orderliness, and minimal bad publicity above all. Experts trace the roots of this shift to the 1980s. Since then, college tuition has skyrocketed and with it the competition for students who can afford it. Parents footing the bill are paying a lot more attention. The world has become more litigious and more corporate. All of this has led to an atmosphere in which university administrations have little margin for error when it comes to student safety or even bad publicity. And in this risk-averse atmosphere, places like Senior House, Eclectic, and Ricketts are increasingly viewed as unacceptable liabilities. “I first noticed this paternalistic ethos when I was doing some lectures at Vanderbilt University,” says sociologist Frank Furedi of the University of Kent and author of the book What’s Happened to the University? “There were all these campaigns being organized across America against drinking beer,” he says. “And I remembered that when I was in college the whole point was to get drunk.” The shift on campus parallels larger cultural changes. “The horizon of adulthood is getting extended,” says Princeton sociologist Dalton Conley, who contends that the knowledge economy means people need more and more schooling, which in turn extends the length of adolescence. This has led to a trend of administrations attempting to control every aspect of students’ lives. They employ risk officers to assess liability; they increasingly punish students for things that happen off campus or even over the summer. Take Harvard, for instance, which this year rescinded offers of admission to students based on comments they made on Facebook. At MIT, since students live on campus all four years, this overreach is especially robust. “Your social life, your meals, almost every aspect of your life operates within that campus,” Conley says. “It becomes more and more of a total institution. Like a prison.” This sets up a naturally combative relationship, especially in an environment as academically difficult as MIT. “It’s you, the student, against the institute,” Dingledine says. “It’s, How do we all get through this?” One way they get through it is by depending on their dorm families. “I can’t tell you how many times I heard that Senior House saved a student’s life,” Feldmeier says. He points out that despite MIT’s high suicide rates—12.6 per 100,000 students in the years between 2010 and 2015 (the national collegiate average is 7.5)—Senior House hasn’t had a suicide in more than 20 years. This isn’t surprising. People from marginalized groups do better when they find each other, according to psychological research. “Belonging to groups has really positive consequences, especially for mental and physical health,” says Dominic Packer, associate professor of psychology at Lehigh University, who studies group dynamics and the effects of ostracism. But groups like Senior House, which define themselves by being different, also run the risk of becoming highly conformist, Packer says. The punk rock movement is a particularly vivid example of this phenomenon. “They self-describe as being different, but from the outside they all look the same,” he says. Barnhart and the administration allege that those norms were exactly the problem in Senior House—that the strong culture in the dorm, far from being welcoming and supportive as the students contend, had become toxic, a negatively reinforcing environment. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Undergraduates and graduates who lived in the house in the past 15 years say drug use there was no more prevalent than in other dorms or colleges. That’s in sharp contrast to the experience of current MIT professor Mike Short, who lived in the house one summer and wrote to the student newspaper in defense of the administration’s decision. “In my brief three months living at Haus back in 2002, I was simultaneously drawn in by the culture, and strongly repelled by the rampant use of hard drugs and their effects on the people around me,” he wrote. Others say that if that was ever the case in the past, it no longer is today. “In my experience, there were fewer drugs at Senior House in the last three years than other places,” says a graduate student resident adviser who asked to be quoted anonymously for fear of administrative retribution. “Plus you have to remember they may have artists and different kinds of people, but we’re still talking about MIT kids here. These are nerds who mostly play video games and study and watch live streams of Alpha Go,” the resident adviser says. A knit chair cover adorned with the house's signature symbol, the skull. Holding Out Hope These nerds did not go quietly. Beyond the letter-writing campaigns, the calls, and the sit-ins, students and alumni held out hope throughout the summer that the administration would reverse its decision. One reason they thought they had a chance was that some of the data purportedly showing that drugs were a problem in the house had been obtained by ethically questionable means—even according to Barnhart. In her original correspondence with the Senior House community, and in subsequent in-person meetings with the house, Barnhart emphasized that the conclusion that Senior House needed a turnaround was based on rigorous data—both the graduation rate data from the registrar’s office and a campus-wide survey students had taken in 2015. The questionnaire, the Healthy Minds Survey, was administered by the University of Michigan. Many schools around the country give it to students as a way to pinpoint problems on campus and decide how best to allocate resources. When MIT administered it in 2015, they told students that it was a confidential survey intended to help them. One of the chancellor’s assistants who had lived in Senior House when she was an undergraduate went to Senior House and specifically requested that the residents take it. They did, in large numbers. What they didn’t know—and what they couldn’t have known from reading the consent form that accompanied it—was that MIT had embedded metadata that allowed the administration to pinpoint the location of those filling out the questionnaire, enabling them to segment the results by dorm. The only question about dorm type in the survey was vague—“What kind of dorm do you live in? Small, large, off campus?”—but by tracking the metadata, Barnhart and the administration were able to see exactly where respondents lived. It was this data that enabled Barnhart to see what she called a troubling hot spot of drug use. “If it wasn’t a direct violation, it was at least a violation of the spirit of informed consent,” Johnson says. Senior House defenders tried to use this issue to attack the administration’s closure of the dorm. “I am extremely angry that MIT used data obtained in a questionable manner to inform their policies with regards to any of their students, regardless of their residence,” wrote MIT parent Elizabeth Glaser in an op-ed in The Tech. Though her son was not part of Senior House, he took the survey and was upset about how it had been used. Glaser, herself an expert in research ethics, took it upon herself to contact the creators of the survey and review its methodology. It was she who discovered the metadata. Murals were an important part of Senior House's identity. Critics of the administration also took issue with the data purportedly showing Senior House had a relatively low graduation rate. Some worry it was based only on where students lived their freshman year, not taking into account that some people do switch dorms. Barnhart says the data accounted for this. When WIRED asked for access to the data to analyze the methods, the administration declined. More troubling to critics is that, based on the way the data was presented to the student body, it doesn’t appear to take into account that the students in Senior House tended to be marginalized in one way or another—and that those students tend to have a lower graduation rate. Barnhart says that the school took that into account as well, looking at marginalized groups in other houses. Again, it’s hard to judge who is correct without access to the raw data or detailed information about who and how it was analyzed. As school began again last week, Senior House was gone. It’s just 70 Amherst Street now. Was Senior House a toxic environment full of drug dealers and drunks? A respite in an intellectual gauntlet? An artistic outlet? A nihilistic void? It depends on whom you ask. Alumni and current students describe a community that helped each other, that made people feel safe enough to talk about their real problems. Over and over again people say Senior House was the first place they’d ever not felt judged. What they are describing is, in many ways, a safe place. And yet it was the claim that the dorm was dangerous that led the administration to shut it down. Johnson got lucky. He’s moving into the student residence next door, East Campus, with a few other Senior House expats. Survilaite had hoped to live there too—cockroaches and all—but there was no room. She’s moving into a co-ed fraternity off campus instead. As Senior House students spread out across campus this year, former advisers worry that they’ll be at even greater risk. They can reach out to MIT’s mental health services if they need it, the chancellor says. Survilaite plans to. Others won’t be so easy to track, like the former president of the house, who has opted to take a year off after the struggles of the past year. That’s not an option for Survilaite or Johnson. They are going to get their degrees, and even without a courtyard to roast a steer, they are going to hold on to each other. “I’m never going to let go of these people. They are my family. We belong together,” Johnson says. When school ends, they’ll head out into the big wide world, where building a nurturing community sometimes feels hard. Maybe the invisible threads of the internet will help bind them. Maybe Senior House alums will meet up in different cities to drink beer and trade stories of Steer Roasts past or find themselves across from each other at tech company boardroom tables, the memory of that shared place a secret tie between them. Maybe, just maybe, their weird community will persist, away from the place that once rooted it. But it’ll be something else. Something different.

Jennifer Nguyen,"If you're willing to brave some chilly early morning temperatures, you'll have the opportunity to marvel at the bright strokes of cosmic debris from November's Leonid meteor shower, which is at its peak this weekend. The best time to see this year's Leonids peak is between 12 AM and 6 AM in all time zones throughout the US) on November 17th and 18th. The best viewing times are after moonset (in the early morning when the moon sets into the Earth's horizon) and right before dawn. If you meteor-gaze after moonset, there will be be less light to interfere with your viewing. And with this weekend's moon shining at a nearly full waxing gibbous phase, it's better to look out for the Leonids with no moon in the sky at all. Meteor showers occur when the Earth moves through a dense cloud of comet debris during its orbital journey. What you see are the trails of dust remnants collected over the years. The Leonids are usually visible in mid-November, when the Comet Tempel-Tuttle sprinkles Earth's path with rocks and ice. Read more: A weird, cigar-shaped object flew through the solar system last year. Now astronomers may know where it came from. A meteor streaks across the night sky (upper R) over Rio de Janeiro early November 17, 1998. Reuters The Leonids are known for being prolific, bright meteor storms with up to 100,000 meteors that whiz through the sky at every hour. Although this year's shower won't be as immense, experts estimate that people will see up to 20 meteors per hour — a little more than the average of 10 to 15 meteors usually seen per hour during the Leonids. Accuweather reported there may also be a few ""stragglers"" from the Taurids meteor shower from last month, so you could even see a few more meteors than anticipated. Along with moonlight, any light pollution should be avoided in order to really see the Leonids. For the best views, EarthSky suggests going to the countryside or an open field where there are few lights or trees. Stargazers in Amman prepare to watch the Leonid meteor shower. Ali Jarekji/Reuters Viewers in the western US (from Nevada up through Minnesota) and states in the Southeast are predicted to have the best viewing conditions. Areas in the Southwest and southern Plains will likely be covered in clouds, which would make seeing the Leonids more difficult. Parts of the country between Colorado and Illinois could also have trouble seeing the shower, since snow is expected to fall across that region this weekend. The Northeast will also get some clouds, and brisk winds could make it unpleasant to be outside in the middle of the night, according to Kristina Pydynowski, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather. This meteor shower got its name from the Leo the Lion star constellation, from which the dust particles disperse and radiate. The next major Leonid meteor storm isn't expected to occur until the early 2030s.

Tariq Malik,"On Mars, the sky is dust. A massive dust storm on Mars that covered one-fourth of planet just a week ago has grown into a global weather event, NASA officials said Wednesday (June 20). The dust storm has knocked NASA's Opportunity rover offline for want of sunlight. The agency's nuclear-powered Curiosity, meanwhile, is snapping photos of the ever-darkening Martian sky. The two rovers are on opposite sides of Mars. ""The Martian dust storm has grown in size and is now officially a 'planet-encircling' (or 'global') dust event,"" NASA officials said in a statement. [ The Mars Dust Storm of 2018 Explained ] The last dust storm on Mars to go global occurred in 2007, five years before the Curiosity rover landed at its Gale Crater site, according officials with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Opportunity rover has been exploring the plains of Meridiani Planum on the opposite side of Mars since 2004. During that 2007 Martian dust storm, NASA also lost contact with Opportunity for days due to low power levels from the lack of sunlight. NASA lost contact with Opportunity last week when it missed a check-in call on June 12. NASA engineers think the rover is in a low-power mode, waking up only periodically to check if its batteries have recharged enough to phone home. All science operations by the rover are suspended while it waits out the storm. The Martian dust storm was first detected May 30 by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Once it was clear the storm would impact Opportunity, the rover was ordered into a sort of survival mode. A series of photos by Opportunity before it went silent show the Martian sky darkening until the sun itself disappears. Scientists measure the amount of sunlight-blocking haze in the Martian atmosphere as ""tau,"" with the current tau at Curiosity's Gale Crater site reaching above 8.0, JPL officials said the NASA statement. The last tau for Opportunity's site was over 11. The atmosphere is so thick with dust, ""accurate measurements are no longer possible for Mars' oldest active rover."" This series of simulated Mars rover Opportunity images shows how conditions have changed around the NASA rover as a huge dust storm has intensified (from left to right) throughout June 2018. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/TAMU In a press conference last week, NASA officials said they expect Opportunity will survive the dust storm. Without a steady supply of sunlight, the biggest risk for Opportunity would be freezing in the Martian cold. But it's almost Martian summer at Opportunity's location, and temperatures are not expected to dip below the danger level, NASA officials have said. That means Opportunity's handlers can only wait until the sky clears enough for the rover's batteries to recharge, allowing it to power up its radio to phone home. In the meantime, NASA scientists are maintaining a full-court press the Martian dust storm. In addition to Curiosity's weather observations on the surface, NASA has several other spacecraft tracking the storm from orbit: the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN orbiter studying the Martian atmosphere. The European Space Agency also has two spacecraft in orbit ( Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ). India's Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft is also in orbit. A key question for scientists is why some dust storms on Mars become planet-enshrouding events and last months, while others fade away in a week. ""We don’t have any good idea,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the statement. Guzewich is leading the Curiosity rover's dust storm work. These two images from NASA's Mars rover Curiosity show how lighting conditions have changed during a massive dust storm on the Red Planet. At left is an image from Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) taken on May 21, 2018, before the storm. On the right, an image from June 17, with the cherry red color caused by both the amount of dust in the air and the long-exposure time Curiosity now needs to snap photos in low-light conditions. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS New photos from Curiosity show a wall of haze over Gale Crater that is up to eight times thicker than normal for this time on Mars, NASA officials said. One photo also shows a curious lack of shadows. That's because the entire sky on Mars is red and illuminating the rocks from all sides, NASA officials explained. While the dust storm won't affect Curiosity's power levels, the low-light conditions are forcing the rover to take longer exposures when it snaps photographs, NASA officials said. When Curiosity is not taking pictures, the rover rotates its mast-mounted Mastcam camera to face the ground to protect it from blowing dust, they added.

Meghan Bartels Space.com Senior Writer,"After suffering a couple technical glitches that have put NASA's Curiosity rover off its duties on Mars this year, the robotic explorer seems to be back in full health, having driven to a new site and drilled a sampling hole, according to NASA statements. That hole is its 18th successful drilling assignment, according to NASA. It targeted a type of rock geologists with the mission have been eyeing for more than a month, but failed to successfully drill at a previous site. The drill was out of commission between late 2016 and this May as engineers addressed a problem with the instrument. But the rover had better luck at the new site, nicknamed Highfield. Curiosity is now analyzing the powder it was able to produce, which should tell scientists more about the rock at the site. The rover will also be watching how the little pile moves over time, which essentially creates weather observations by tracking wind movement, according to NASA. It's a particularly interesting time for weather observations on Mars because Curiosity's robotic companion, Opportunity, remains silent on the opposite side of the planet after a global dust storm earlier this year. Scientists hope that a seasonal weather phenomenon known as dust devils will be able to clear any lingering dust off Opportunity's solar panels and help it return to normal operations. In order to reach the new science site, Curiosity had to drive about 197 feet (60 meters), according to NASA. The journey comes a month after engineers running the rover were forced to switch Curiosity to its back-up brain after a computer glitch occurred on Sept. 15. Engineers are still trying to figure out what went wrong on the computer the rover had been relying on before the switch. Although the rover doesn't need both computers operating at once, they do want to repair the problem and switch back because the offline computer has more memory.

Chelsea Gohd,"A thick cloud of dust moves over the surface of Mars near the planet's north polar ice cap in a stunning photograph. This June, a massive dust storm hit Mars, and before long, the storm had encapsulated the entire planet. But dust clouds are a common occurrence on Mars; before that storm, a smaller-scale tempest kicked up the impressive plumes in this new photo, taken in April by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Mars Express. The photoshows just how immense these clouds can get, with a thick dust cloud near the planet's north polar ice cap. Dust storms happen on Mars most often during the southern summer season. At this time, the planet is closer to the sun along the elliptical Martian orbit, and the brightness increases the differences in temperature on Mars, which affect air movement on the planet. These temperature differences allow the Martian air to more easily lift dust particles on the surface, according to a statement from ESA. However, while a planet-covering dust storm sounds terrifying, things aren't that chaotic on the surface. This is because storm wind speeds on Mars are usually less than half as fast as hurricane wind speeds on Earth. Additionally, because atmospheric pressure is so low on the Red Planet, even high-speed winds wouldn't do much damage to anyone on the planet. ""You would probably feel a breeze, but it wouldn't be knocking you over,"" Michael Smith, who works at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, previously said to Space.com. Mars Express captured this cloud using a high-resolution stereo camera on board. The dust storm that continues to rage on Mars is being imaged and monitored by five ESA and NASA orbiters, while NASA's Curiosity rover continues to collect data on the red, dusty surface.

Travis Fedschun,"The Atlantic hurricane season is now expected to be ""less active"" as it enters its peak months due a combination of conditions in the ocean and atmosphere helping to limit storm development, government forecasters announced Thursday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its updated forecast that El Niño is ""much more"" likely to develop with enough strength to suppress storm development during the latter part of the season. A combination of cooler sea surface temperatures across the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, as well as stronger wind shear with drier air have helped to suppress storm development so far this summer. The updated 2018 Atlantic hurricane season outlook. (NOAA) WHAT IS THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON HURRICANE WIND SCALE? NOAA forecasters are now calling for 9 to 13 named storms with winds of 39 mph or higher, of which 4 to 7 will strengthen into hurricanes. Of those storms, there may be up to 2 major hurricanes, which are classified as Category 3, 4 and 5 with winds of 111 mph or higher. “There are still more storms to come – the hurricane season is far from being over. We urge continued preparedness and vigilance,” said Gerry Bell, Ph.D., lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. If an El Niño does indeed develop, that could suppress storm development during the season's peak months from August through October. El Niño is the natural warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide and tends to reduce hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Chris is seen off the coast of the Carolina's while the remnants of former Hurricane Beryl swirl in the Caribbean Sea, as Saharan dust wraps around the storm on July 9, 2018. (NOAA) Warm waters feed a hurricane's strength, while strong wind shear can pull it apart. If El Niño does not develop and water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea warm up, that could fuel more storm development, according to Bell. In May, forecasters believed there would be 10 to 16 named storms, with 5 to 9 strengthening into hurricanes. So far this year, there have been four named storms, including two hurricanes. The NOAA says that an average hurricane season contains 12 named storms, including six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. AS ATLANTIC PREPARES FOR 'NEAR NORMAL' HURRICANE SEASON, REGION STILL REELING FROM LAST YEAR'S DEVASTATION This year the hurricane season includes the names : Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gordon, Helene, Isaac, Joyce, Kirk, Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sara, Tony, Valerie and William. The list of names for the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season (NOAA) Forecasters stress that the updated outlook is for overall season activity, and does not predict where storms reach land. With the busy part of the season now here, officials stress that residents in coastal areas should be prepared for any storm. “Today’s updated outlook is a reminder that we are entering the height of hurricane season and everyone needs to know their true vulnerabilities to storms and storm surge,” FEMA Administrator Brock Long said in a statement. “Now is the time to know who issues evacuation orders in their community, heed the warnings, update your insurance and have a preparedness plan.

ABC News,"A series of late winter storms will continue on the first day of spring in the East as snow and rain pelt the region on Tuesday and Wednesday. The weather models are mostly in agreement as it gets closer that the storm won't be a major one. The European model has been the most consistent at keeping the low offshore. The American, or GFS model, is also in agreement with this track, but with slightly less precipitation. Some snow could be seen Tuesday morning into the afternoon ahead of the approaching low from Virginia to New Jersey. This may transition back to rain as the low begins to pull offshore. The European model is showing the low remaining offshore on Tuesday. The changeover back to snow for the Appalachian Mountains and Mid-Atlantic begins early Wednesday, but the storm quickly moves offshore and out to sea by Wednesday night. The storm will bring snow to parts of Virginia and West Virginia, especially in higher elevations. Any chance of accumulating snow will likely be elevation driven in places such as Roanoke and Harrisonburg, Virginia. The low appears likely to stay offshore and avoid hitting the major Northeast cities with much snow. Stay tuned for updates as we get more information and a better indication of who will be seeing what in terms of precipitation types.

Mike Wall,"The Opportunity Mars rover's silent stretch has now reached four months. Opportunity hasn't made a peep since June 10. Around that time, a developing dust storm shrouded its environs in darkness, preventing the solar-powered rover from harvesting enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. The Martian dust storm grew to envelop the entire planet 10 days later. But by late July the maelstrom was abating, and the sky continued to clear over the following weeks. By Sept. 11, conditions near Opportunity's locale — a valley on the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 kilometers) Endeavour Crater — were good enough that the rover team ramped up its hailing efforts, kicking off a 45-day ""active listening"" campaign. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] That campaign is now two-thirds over, and there's still been nothing from the six-wheeled robot. If the clock runs out on Opportunity, NASA will reassess its recovery plans and efforts, agency officials have said. But engineers and technicians will continue listening for a ping from Opportunity in a more passive mode at least through January, mission managers have said. The venerable rover may be dead, done in by a combination of the darkness and the bitter Martian cold. Without any power, after all, Opportunity cannot run its onboard heaters. But there is still hope, even at this relatively late date. ""It's possible that a layer of dust deposited on the rover's solar panels by the recent global dust storm is blocking sunlight that could recharge its batteries. No one can tell just how much dust has been deposited on its panels,"" NASA officials wrote in an update yesterday (Oct. 11). ""A windy period on Mars — known to Opportunity's team as ""dust-clearing season"" — occurs in the November-to-January time frame and has helped clean the rover's panels in the past,"" they added. ""The team remains hopeful that some dust clearing may result in hearing from the rover in this period."" Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, three weeks after its twin, Spirit, touched down in a different part of the Red Planet. Both robots found lots of evidence that liquid water flowed across the surface of ancient Mars. Spirit and Opportunity were designed to roam for three months, but both rovers ground that warranty into the red dust. Spirit wasn't declared dead until 2011, and Opportunity was getting along just fine until the dust storm hit.

Tariq Malik,"As the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter tracked the dust storm from orbit, Opportunity was busy studying the terrain of its current science spot, a region called ""Perseverance Valley"" on the plains of Mars' Meridiani Planum. (This photo shows a ""selfie"" by Opportunity from earlier in the mission.) When Opportunity scientists got word of the impending dust storm, they took action quickly. The rover stopped all science work to conserve power as the dust storm blocked out the vital sunlight needed for the rover's solar arrays. Opportunity would have to ride out the storm in a low-power mode. A note here on Opportunity: The rover is no spring chicken. It landed on Mars just after its twin Spirit in January 2004 and 15 years old (it launched in 2003). Opportunity and Spirit were only expected to last 90 days on Mars. Spirit died of the Martian cold in 2010. Opportunity is well beyond day 5,000.

Jason Kottke,"Using a combination of satellite data and mathematical weather models, scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center made this simulation that shows how aerosols like dust, smoke, and salt were circulated in the atmosphere during the 2017 hurricane season. It’s amazing to see how far some of these things spread. During the 2017 hurricane season, the storms are visible because of the sea salt that is captured by the storms. Strong winds at the surface lift the sea salt into the atmosphere and the particles are incorporated into the storm. Hurricane Irma is the first big storm that spawns off the coast of Africa. As the storm spins up, the Saharan dust is absorbed in cloud droplets and washed out of the storm as rain. This process happens with most of the storms, except for Hurricane Ophelia. Forming more northward than most storms, Ophelia traveled to the east picking up dust from the Sahara and smoke from large fires in Portugal. Retaining its tropical storm state farther northward than any system in the Atlantic, Ophelia carried the smoke and dust into Ireland and the UK. I watched this several times to pick up on different things…the hurricanes of course, but also how smoke from the forest fires in the Pacific Northwest makes it all the way to Scotland (!!!) and dust from the Sahara desert makes it to the Caribbean (also !!!).

Nola Taylor Redd,"The global dust storm currently raging on Mars shouldn't disrupt the touchdown of NASA's InSight lander this fall, agency officials said. The planet-encircling storm is expected to subside by the time InSight arrives in November. But it won't be a disaster for the new lander if the storm still swirls or if another one takes its place, officials said. Rob Grover, leader of Insight's Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, told Space.com. [ NASA's InSight Mars Lander: Here's 10 Surprising Facts ] Even if the storm subsides as expected, a dusty haze will likely still hang in the Martian atmosphere when InSight arrives, said Richard Zurek, chief scientist of the Mars Program Office at JPL. That haze could affect how InSight's science instruments function, because it will prevent some sunlight from reaching the solar-powered lander. But touchdown should be fine, Zurek added. Martian dust storms can pop up suddenly and last for weeks or even months. The current tempest contains several smaller, active dust storms and appears to have been triggered by a single local storm first observed at the end of May. Previous NASA Mars missions have dealt with such storms or observed them up close. When NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft reached Mars in November 1971, for example, it caught sight of a global dust storm that had been raging for several weeks. This was the second major storm of the year, researchers knew, because they had observed the first from Earth before the spacecraft's Red Planet arrival. The Mariner 9 storm was huge and dramatic; it covered the entire Martian surface in dust, except the peaks of the tallest volcanoes. Another major dust storm, comparable in size to the current one, raged across Mars when NASA's Viking mission arrived in 1976. That, too, was the second global storm that year. [ Viking 1: The Historic First Mars Landing in Pictures ] NASA's Mars rover Curiosity captures an image of the global dust storm in June 2018. Remnants of the massive storm may still be in the atmosphere when NASA's InSight mission lands in November. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS If the storm lasts for its maximum estimated duration, it should falL off just before InSight arrives, NASA officials have said. But it will likely leave traces in the Red Planet's air regardless. From an EDL standpoint, the biggest impact of the storm will be the way air is distributed in the Martian atmosphere, Grover said. During storms, dust heats the upper atmosphere, while the shaded lower atmosphere gets cooler. From the beginning of the InSight project, atmospheric modelers have provided a range of conditions that the lander might fly through during its critical EDL sequence, including dust storms, Grover said. InSight will deploy a big parachute to slow down in the Martian atmosphere, then wrap up its descent by firing retro-rockets when close to the ground. A dusty atmosphere might require the parachute to be deployed as much as 0.9 miles (1.5 kilometers) lower than it would be in clear skies, Grover said. That would shave about 20 seconds off the 6.5-minute entry-to-landing timeline, he added. When the parachute deploys, the suddenly slowed spacecraft will jerk backward, feeling what Grover called a ""snatch force."" The goal is to keep that force under 15,000 lbs. (6,800 kilograms), he said. The amount of force is related to atmospheric density, which changes during or after a dust storm. ""We can tune how we're actually going to fly on landing day,"" Grover said. Minor changes could be sent to the spacecraft as soon as 2 hours before the landing, allowing the team to make adjustments based on the weather closer to the planet. InSight also boasts an extra 0.2 inches (0.5 centimeters) of thermal protection on its heat shield, because a dust-thickened atmosphere generates more heat than clear skies do. Like previous NASA Mars missions, InSight — which launched in early May — will use radar to assist with its landing. Ten minutes before it enters the atmosphere, the spacecraft will link with Earth to update its position and velocity based on radar observations. As it plunges into the (likely dusty) Martian atmosphere, InSight will rely on an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which uses an accelerometer and gyros to figure out the craft's position as it flies through the atmosphere. The radar will then provide critical updates on the spacecraft's altitude so that the lander knows where it is in relation to the ground. ""We can't land successfully without the radar,"" Grover said. This radar is capable of seeing through dust, allowing the mission to land safely even in a storm, he stressed. Things will be different, by the way, for NASA's Mars 2020 rover mission, which will rely on Terrain-Relative Navigation. Mars 2020 will use a camera to create a map of the landing site, comparing the landmarks in the images to those found on the craft's onboard map. This new technology will allow the spacecraft to shift its direction to avoid landing on dangerous objects. Grover said that a dust storm would impede the device, making a safe landing a challenge. But, unlike InSight, Mars 2020 won't arrive during dust-storm season.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/TAMU InSight — which is short forU —robot in depthThe stationary lander will help researchers map out the Red Planet's interior by precisely measuring heat flow and analyzing tiny ""marsquakes."" Dust could affect InSight's scientific work, because the lander relies on solar panels to power its instruments. A new dust storm could affect ""the deployment of instruments from this solar-powered platform,"" Zurek said. The dust could also cover the panels after the instruments have been deployed. ""That's the main worry, that the dust storm is going to cover your solar panels,"" said Matt Siegler, a research scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona who works on InSight's heat-probe instrument. The problem is similar to the one NASA's solar-powered Opportunity rover currently faces. The nearly 15-year old Opportunity has hunkered down during the global storm, likely entering a ""low-power fault mode,"" in which all subsystems other than the mission clock turn off. The mission clock is programmed to wake the computer to check its power levels. The massive dust storm has blotted out the sun, keeping Opportunity from charging its batteries. The batteries don't just run the instruments; they also keep the rover warm during the cold Martian nights. Without such heat, big problems can arise. ""Some soldered joint will get too cold and split, and then your computer dies,"" Siegler said. The dust storm itself could help keep Opportunity warm, because dust can trap heat close to the planet's surface. Indeed, calculations by the Opportunity team suggest that temperatures won't get cold enough in the immediate future to freeze that rover out, NASA officials said last month. When InSight lands, it should have enough power to keep its instruments warm for some time, Zurek said. Once the storm passes and the skies clear somewhat, the spacecraft will be able to begin its mission exploring the Martian interior. In the meantime, scientists will keep their eyes on the enormous weather event. ""The current storm is still developing, and atmospheric scientists here at JPL are continuing to observe it,"" Grover said. Follow Nola Taylor Redd at @NolaTRedd, Facebook or Google+.

Mike Wall,"The dust is finally beginning to clear on Mars, but it'll probably still be a while before NASA's sidelined Opportunity rover can phone home. A global dust storm has enshrouded Mars for more than a month, plunging the planet's surface into perpetual darkness. That's complicated life significantly for the solar-powered Opportunity, which has apparently put itself into a sort of hibernation; the rover hasn't contacted its controllers since June 10. A long-awaited dawn seems to be on the horizon, however. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: How It Grew &amp; What It Means for the Opportunity Rover ] ""It's the beginning of the end for the planet-encircling dust storm on Mars,"" NASA officials wrote in an Opportunity mission update yesterday (July 26). Scientists studying the storm ""say that, as of Monday, July 23, more dust is falling out than is being raised into the planet's thin air,"" agency officials added. ""That means the event has reached its decay phase, when dust-raising occurs in ever smaller areas, while others stop raising dust altogether."" Other data points support this conclusion. For example, measurements by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show that temperatures in the middle atmosphere have stopped rising, indicating less absorption of solar heat by dust particles. In addition, NASA's Curiosity rover — which is nuclear-powered and can therefore work through the storm — has observed a decline in overhead dust at its location, the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, agency officials said. Some Martian landforms previously hidden beneath the dust can now be spotted from orbit again, they added, and may even be visible using Earth-based telescopes by early next week, when Mars will make its closest approach to our planet since 2003. But don't hold your breath waiting to hear from Opportunity, which has been exploring Mars since 2004. According to yesterday's mission update, ""it could still be weeks, or even months, before skies are clear enough"" for Opportunity to recharge its batteries and ping its handlers. The storm is a serious threat to the six-wheeled robot, but mission team members have expressed cautious optimism that Opportunity will survive. Their calculations suggest that temperatures at Opportunity's location — the rim of the 14-mile-wide (22 km) Endeavour Crater — won't get cold enough to freeze the rover to death. That fate befell Opportunity's twin, Spirit, after it got bogged down in sand in 2010 and couldn't reorient itself to catch the sun. Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

Al Jazeera,"NASA experts have expressed concern over an unprecedented ""massive Martian dust storm"" that has engulfed the Opportunity rover mission. The storm covers an area as large as North America and Russia combined - a quarter of the surface of Mars - and has left the golf-cart-sized rover temporarily unable to conduct science operations. The US space agency's rover runs on solar power and has entered low power mode to conserve energy. Mission engineers believe it is unlikely the rover has enough sunlight to charge back up for at least the next several days, NASA said in a statement earlier this week. A massive Mars dust storm is turning day-to-night, causing the solar-powered @MarsRovers Opportunity to have likely entered a low-power mode where all subsystems are off, except a mission clock that can wake the computer to check power levels. Info: https://t.co/lSOHSsu1Oc pic.twitter.com/jjjr6qs4cK — NASA (@NASA) June 13, 2018 The first indicators of the storm were reported on May 30 and it is nearly circling the planet, NASA scientist Rich Zurek said on Wednesday in a conference call. The storm's density was estimated at a record opacity level, of 10.8, said John Callas, project manager at NASA. This reading is about twice as dense as any other storm that Opportunity has endured since landing on Mars in 2004. It could also pose a threat to the Curiosity rover, which is monitoring the storm from the periphery. Engineers are also concerned that freezing temperatures caused by the storm could damage the rover, as cold is thought to be what led to the breakdown of NASA's Spirit rover - Opportunity's twin - in 2010. Opportunity is also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover-B), and it was the second of the rovers launched on 2003, landing on January 25, 2004, three weeks after Spirit landed on the other side of the planet. Spirit kept functioning until it got stuck in 2009 and stopped communications the next year. Each rover was designed to only last 90 days, yet Opportunity has exceeded its operating plan by 14 years and 48 days. According to NASA since landing in Mars, the rover has made a number of discoveries about the Red Planet including showing evidence that long ago at least one area of Mars stayed wet for an extended period suggesting that conditions could have been favourable for sustaining microbial life. The NASA team has used the rover more than 50 times longer than originally planned and it survived such a storm before in 2007.

Al Jazeera,"A massive dust storm with winds gusting up to 70 kilometres per hour has battered northern India. The storm was caught on camera over Bikaner in the northern state of Rajasthan. This type of dust storm, triggered by a collapsing thunderstorm, is known as a haboob. Haboobs can be highly dangerous, as the visibility drop dramatically in a matter of seconds. Within the cloud of dust, the winds can be gusting over 150kph and the temperature usually drops by a couple of degrees. The storm ripped down trees and power lines, as it tore across the northern cities of New Delhi, Rohtak, Bhiwani, Jhajjar, Meerut and Ghaziabad. Many of the locations were hit by the storm after dark, meaning early morning commuters had a testing drive to work on Tuesday as they struggled to navigate fallen trees and branches.

"USA TODAY, Ashley May, USA TODAY","Everyone calls Mars the ""Red Planet,"" but apparently, it’s ready to rebrand. Buzz60 NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) shows a turquoise blue dune on Mars. (Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Arizon) NASA recently released a photo of a large blue sand dune on Mars showing ""a more complex structure"" than dunes surrounding it. The striking image of the turquoise blue dune on the Red Planet was captured on Jan. 24 by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's camera, managed by the University of Arizona, Tucson. The dune was spotted on Mars' Lyot Crater region. Researchers suspect it might be made of finer material than nearby dunes, according to a news release. MRO, which blasted into space in 2005, is studying the history of water on Mars. NASA's Curiosity Mars rover has previously shown Mars is home to sand dunes the size of football fields as well as small sand ripples. The planet is currently battling a massive sandstorm that has silenced NASA's solar-powered Opportunity rover.

Mike Wall,"Following a comet around the sun is no picnic, as a newly released photo dramatically shows. The image, taken by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosetta spacecraft, depicts hundreds of dust particles barreling away from Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which the probe orbited from August 2014 to September 2016. The dust grains look like streaks against the deep-space backdrop, because the 146-second-long exposure captured the movement of these frigid motes. [ Photos: Europe's Rosetta Comet Mission in Pictures ] Rosetta took the picture on Jan. 21, 2016 — five months after Comet 67P made its closest pass by the sun over the course of its orbit, which lasts 6.45 Earth years. The dust blizzard was doubtless much worse around the comet's closest approach to the sun, when solar energy heated the object up even more. So Rosetta's handlers backed the probe away during that time. They didn't do this to keep Rosetta nice and shiny, though. ""Excessive dust in Rosetta's field of view presented a continual risk for navigation: The craft's startrackers used a star-pattern-recognition function to know its orientation with respect to the sun and Earth,"" ESA officials wrote in a description of the photo, which was released Sunday (Jan. 21). ""On some occasions, flying much closer to the comet, and therefore through denser regions of outflowing gas and dust, the startrackers locked on to dust grains instead of stars, creating pointing errors and in some cases putting the spacecraft in a temporary safe mode,"" the officials added. But the dust was a blessing as well as a curse; Rosetta studied the material intently during its two years at 67P, gathering information about comet structure and composition. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and arrived at 67P in August 2014, in the process becoming the first probe ever to orbit a comet. In November of that year, Rosetta pulled off another first, dropping a small piggyback lander called Philae onto the icy wanderer's surface. The groundbreaking mission came to an end on Sept. 30, 2016, when Rosetta team members guided the orbiter to a controlled, slow-motion impact on its longtime travel companion. The time had come, ESA officials said at the time: Rosetta was getting up there in years, and the sunlight that was needed to power the probe was getting much harder to come by. Rosetta, and the comet, were more than 356 million miles (573 million kilometers) from the sun on that fateful day (far beyond the orbit of Mars), and the duo were only going to get more and more distant.

Dyllan Furness,"For the past 28 years, the Hubble Space Telescope has captured some of the most iconic images of outer space. Now, as Mars and Saturn swing by Earth this summer, the legendary telescope has snapped a handful of beautiful images to add to the collection. Although millions of miles away from Earth, the orbits of Mars and Saturn brought the planets relatively close this summer. Known as “opposition” — because we see the planets rise in the east as the sun sets in the west — this event gave astronomers a unique chance to capture detailed images of the planets, thanks to their proximity and full illumination from the sun. Saturn orbited some 870 million miles away, while in opposition to Earth on June 27. A few weeks earlier, Hubble captured images of the planet’s six moons — Dione, Enceladus, Tethys, Janus, Epimetheus, and Mimas — appearing like specs in the sky. At the ringed-planet’s north pole, Hubble identified a hexagonal pattern first spotted 37 years ago during a flyby from Voyager 1. NASA, ESA, and STScI Just under two weeks before Mars reaches it’s closest approach to Earth in 15 years (around 36 million miles on July 27), Hubble captured a dense and massive dust storm enshrouding the red planet. The persistent storm has lasted for more than four months, which has caused trouble for the solar-powered Mars Opportunity rover. During the storm, NASA has been unable to connect with the rover. The image above shows just how dense the storm is. “Since the NASA/European Space Agancy Hubble Space Telescope was launched, its goal has always been to study not only distant astronomical objects, but also the planets within our solar system,” the space agencies wrote in a statement. “Hubble’s high-resolution images of our planetary neighbors can only be surpassed by pictures taken from spacecraft that actually visit these bodies. However, Hubble has one advantage over space probes: It can look at these objects periodically and observe them over much longer periods than any passing probe could.” Hubble has proven to be a workhorse during it’s nearly three decades in operation, while it’s successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is fraught with delays and carries a hefty $9.66 billion price tag. NASA recently announced the telescope won’t be ready until at least March 30, 2021.","For the past 28 years, the Hubble Space Telescope has captured some of the most iconic images of outer space.

Mike Wall,"NASA's Curiosity rover is keeping tabs on the huge Martian dust storm that has sidelined its older cousin on the other side of the planet. That storm, which covered more area than the North American continent as of Friday (June 8), has engulfed the golf-cart-size Opportunity rover, plunging its environs into perpetual darkness. The solar-powered Opportunity has therefore temporarily ceased science operations. A recent photo by Curiosity suggests that dust may be encroaching a bit on its locale, the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater. But Curiosity is nuclear-powered, so a drop in sunlight isn't nearly as concerning to its handlers. [ Curiosity Rover's 10 Biggest Mars Moments of Its 1st 5 Years ] Still, the Curiosity team is trying to monitor the storm. ""To measure dust in the atmosphere, we'll first point Mastcam towards the sun and take a tau measurement, which lets us determine the optical depth vertically,"" mission team member Rachel Kronyak wrote in an update on Friday. (Mastcam, short for ""Mast Camera,"" is the two-camera system on Curiosity's head-like mast. The cameras capture color photos and video of the Red Planet landscape and soil for a variety of purposes.) ""Then we'll take a Mastcam image of the crater rim to determine line-of-sight extinction, which is directly related to the amount of dust present. ENV will also take a few movies with Navcam to assess clouds, wind direction, and to look for dust devils,"" Kronyak added. (""ENV"" refers to the mission's environmental-science team. Navcam is Curiosity's black-and-white navigation-camera system, whose images help the rover team plan routes.) This is not the first major dust storm weathered by Opportunity, which landed on the Red Planet in January 2004: An even larger storm forced the rover to stand down for two weeks in 2007. But the dust surrounding Opportunity now is much thicker than it was during that previous storm, mission team members have said. Opportunity beamed a message to its handlers on Sunday (June 10), which is a good sign; it shows the rover still has a decent amount of battery power left. Mission team members have a delicate balancing act ahead if the dust storm persists; they'll need to run Opportunity's heaters enough to keep the rover from freezing, but not so much that they run out its batteries. And Martian cold can kill. Opportunity's twin, Spirit, which also touched down on the Red Planet in January 2004, apparently froze to death after getting stuck in thick sand in 2010. Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater since August 2012. The car-size rover started its Mars mission on the crater floor, but it's currently climbing through the foothills of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles (5.5 km) into the Martian sky from Gale's center.

A social media campaign is also under way support the embattled rover. A violent dust storm has been tormenting the Red Planet since late May. What started as a localized phenomenon quickly grew into a massive storm, developing into a planet-wide event by the third week of June. As the storm intensified, dust filled the Martian atmosphere, growing so thick that Opportunity couldn't harvest enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. As a result, the rover fell silent on June 10, likely putting itself in a sort of hibernation mode.

Meghan Bartels,"Engineers with NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program have been left hanging on like a yo-yo for 61 days now, after the space agency's Opportunity rover lost power during a Martian dust storm — but they've started greeting each new Martian day the rover may call with a themed song. On Aug. 4 — Opportunity's 5,165th day on Mars — the rover was still asleep. But mission staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, hoped to inspire the robot to turn back on by playing Wham!'s ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" in the control room, beginning of a new tradition to wait out the storm. ""Morale has been a little shaky,"" Michael Staab, an engineer for the program at JPL who helped initiate the themed daily wake-up song for the humans waiting for Opportunity's long and nerve-wracking nap to end, told Space.com. ""This is the first time she [Opportunity] has stopped talking to us and not resumed communication when we expected."" [ The Epic Mars Dust Storm of 2018 Explained ] The musical initiative in the control room isn't entirely new: Mission team members celebrated a daily wake-up song when Opportunity first landed on Mars nearly 15 years ago, in January 2004, Staab said. The rover's mission was originally planned to last just 90 days, but once it became clear that Opportunity would be staying in business on the Red Planet, the tradition faded. Then, in May, came a dust storm to end all dust storms, which roiled around the entire planet and blotted out the sun — an awfully hazardous situation for a solar-powered robot. Opportunity hasn't produced so much as a chord, much less more substantive data, since June 10, according to NASA. (NASA's Curiosity Mars rover, by contrast, is nuclear-powered and thus has not suffered the same ill effects from the dust storm as the Opportunity rover.) ""That's a long time to not hear from your rover, and we don't know what it's doing,"" Staab said. And the engineers are feeling the change. ""We still have things to do; we still have work to get done. But it's definitely slowed down a bit."" So mission team members have seized a few opportunities to keep their spirits up, Staab said. An informal betting pool is tracking guesses of when the rover will finally call home — dates range from early July to mid-September. And they've started building a themed playlist to mark each new Martian day in the control room. For instance, Opportunity didn't respond as the team listened to Kansas' ""Dust in the Wind"" — although the band itself did. ""The band actually reached out and was really excited that we were using one of their songs to wake up a Mars rover,"" Staab said. (We've gathered all the songs the team has already listened to while waiting for the rover, plus future options they're considering, in a Spotify playlist in case you'd like to listen along.) Opportunity didn't chime in as its controllers listened to The Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" or Elton John's ""Rocket Man,"" either, but the engineers aren't out of songs yet. ""We'll just keep playing until she decides to talk to us,"" Staab said. Maybe in the coming days the opening line ""Hello, I've waited here for you everlong"" will be the magic charm that revives (robotic) ""Life on Mars,"" music fans on the team hope. Although the dust storm has been clearing for about two weeks, NASA can't tell how long it might take Opportunity's batteries to charge up enough for the rover to finally call its humans — or whether Opportunity will sleep forever, for that matter. ""It could take weeks — hopefully not months,"" Staab said. ""I wish we had something to share; I wish we had good news. But we keep listening every day."" And, fingers crossed, the rover will take to heart another upcoming suggestion: Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive."" Email Meghan Bartels at mbartels@space.com or follow her @meghanbartels.

Taylor Kubota-Stanford,"When I was NASA’s Mars program director, the slogan was “follow the water” because liquid water is necessary for all life as we know it. Water shapes planets, it determines the climate—past and present—and, of course, if people are planning to live there, you need water. In 2012 the European mission Mars Express started getting data on this discovery and continued collecting it for three years. The instrument it used is a ground-penetrating radar called MARSIS, which is a technology we use to locate underground fluids—oil, water—on Earth, too. What they found was a reflection that was very strong, such that the only interpretation that this group could find that fit with the data was liquid water. So, there is a liquid water lake, roughly 20 kilometers in diameter about 1 kilometer below the surface. They’ve made guesstimates of the volume and it would be in the millions and millions of gallons of water. This is the first-ever really solid detection of liquid water. In the past, it’s been ice, it’s been glaciers, it’s been past water that dried up or turned into ice. This is a huge, huge discovery. At this point, it’s not certain what else might be mixed in with the water. From a detailed analysis, they believe it’s probably very, very salty water. And probably very cold, too. People who want to speculate about life would say very salty water means life probably couldn’t live there. But if you’ve ever flown into San Francisco airport and looked out at the salt flats, you see this reddish color out there. What you’re looking at are halophiles, organisms that evolved to be perfectly happy in extremely salty water. So, if there was life on Mars and it followed the water underground, could it have evolved to live in a very salty environment?

Mike Wall,"NASA's Curiosity Mars rover noticed this summer's monster dust storm fairly early on — but not in the way you might expect. The storm was first spotted from above by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on May 30 as a localized event near Perseverance Valley, a landform being explored by the agency's Opportunity rover. The dust storm grew quickly over the following days, as Curiosity's observations showed. Curiosity's home is the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, on the other side of the planet from Perseverance Valley, but it saw signs of the storm on June 5. [ Mars Dust Storm 2018: What It Means for Opportunity Rover ] Those signs were temperature readings, made by sensors on a motor on the car-size rover's deck, mission team members said. That motor powers the lid on a funnel that directs powdered rock samples from Curiosity's drill into its onboard chemistry-lab instrument, which is known as Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM). ""All my charts showed the dust storm effect on the actuator because it's exposed; it's sitting out there on the rover deck,"" Benito Prats, an electromechanical engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement. ""All of a sudden, I saw the daytime temperature drop really quickly."" A look at the temperature-measuring motor (or actuator) on Curiosity's deck, which operates the lid to a funnel that helps direct samples from the rover's drill to its onboard Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument. This is a still image from a short video taken in January 2011 in the clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, by SAM lead mechanical engineer Oren Sheinman before Curiosity was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch. Credit: Benito Prats/Molly Wasser/NASA The nighttime temperature stayed abnormally high as well, as it does during big Martian dust storms: While all that dirt in the air blocks sunlight during the day, it also prevents infrared radiation from escaping to space at night, keeping things warmer than usual after the sun goes down. The storm continued to grow, eventually encircling the planet by June 20. Its intensity plunged Perseverance Valley into perpetual darkness, blocking so much sunlight that the solar-powered Opportunity couldn't recharge its batteries. The golf-cart-size rover, which has been exploring Mars since January 2004, hasn't made a peep since June 10. The motor's temperature measurements helped the Curiosity team keep tabs on the storm (which they also did using the rover's onboard weather station). And Prats combined the dust-storm data with historic readings from the motor, to predict when the storm might start clearing up. ""At sol 2,125 (July 28), I noticed a linear trend,"" Prats said, ""so I said, OK, I can predict that sol 2,180 (Sept. 23) is going to be when we're going to get out of the dust storm and the temperature will return back to normal, though I later updated that to sol 2,175 (Sept. 18)."" (A sol is a Martian day, which is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day. The sol numbers referenced by Prats are the number of Martian days since Curiosity's touchdown on the Red Planet, which occurred on Aug. 5, 2012.) That forecast proved accurate: Dust levels in Gale Crater had returned to normal by Sept. 18, according to the motor measurements, NASA officials said. Curiosity was largely unaffected by the storm, because yit runs on nuclear rather than solar power. (Curiosity is currently sidelined by an issue with its memory, however.) The skies over Perseverance Valley have cleared as well. Indeed, Opportunity's handlers began stepping up their attempts to hail the silent rover on Sept. 11, kicking off a 45-day ""active listening"" campaign. If this effort fails to rouse the rover, the team will assess its next steps, NASA officials have said. Opportunity mission leaders have said that they'll keep listening on a passive basis at least through the end of January, however. Scientists are eager to study all the data they can about the recent Mars dust storm, to get a better handle on these fairly regular, but poorly understood, events. For example, researchers can't accurately predict when a global dust storm will arise on Mars, and they don't know why some small storms balloon into planet-girding monsters, whereas others fade away. ""I can estimate, two years in advance, the temperature, air pressure, and whether there's going to be dust or clouds in the air during the non-dusty season anywhere on the planet,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Goddard who leads Curiosity's dust-storm investigation, said in the same statement. ""But during the dusty season, in locations that have dust storms, I can't give you any prediction at all that there will be a dust storm on one day and not another.""

azfamily.com News Staff,"MARICOPA COUNTY, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) - A monsoon storm hit the Valley hard Thursday evening, bringing high winds, low visibility and a massive wall of rolling dust coming from the south. ""It is a huge one,"" said our reporter in the chopper, Jerry Ferguson. ""This is a classic Arizona dust storm barreling across the southeast Valley."" [SPECIAL SECTION: Arizona Monsoon 2018 ] [PHOTOS: Monsoon storm wreaks havoc on Phoenix area with high winds, rain ] Right around rush hour, we watched as the huge wall of dust made its way, stretching from the Estrella Mountains and into Queen Creek and beyond. National Weather Service meteorologists said blowing dust in the Phoenix area brought near-zero visibility for drivers. ""This is one where we can't really see through it. It's pretty thick,"" said Ferguson. [MORE: Monsoon storm rips through Rainbow Valley home ] By 6:30 p.m., the wall of dust was headed directly toward the ASU Tempe campus and toward the airport. We saw planes attempting to land, and it must have been a scary sight for pilots as they tried to navigate the dust. Officials at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport said flights were delayed or held until visibility improved.

""There goes that plane into the wall of dust. We'll say that pilot has a lot of courage."" Here's an amazing photo sent to us by a viewer whose plane was landing at Sky Harbor Airport just as the dust was rolling in. [MOBILE USERS: Click HERE for photo] A severe thunderstorm warning was issued for areas including Maricopa and the Ak-Chin Indian Community south of Phoenix. The dust then kept rolling toward downtown Phoenix. ""It is absolutely massive. Stretches from horizon to horizon."" [RELATED: Video of monsoon storm snapping palm tree in Litchfield Park goes viral ] Looking down, we saw lots of brake lights on the freeways as the dust rolled in, and also saw drivers practicing the safe method of ""Pull aside. Stay alive."" ""I think this is the biggest dust storm of the season,"" said Ferguson. One Arizona native emailed us this comment about Thursday's dust cloud: ""I have never seen anything like this in 50 years."" This comes just days after a major monsoon storm hit many parts of the Valley on Monday. [RELATED: Monsoon storm brings strong winds &amp; dust, power knocked out to thousands ] In Goodyear Thursday evening, the storm caused the roof of a home to collapse. Luckily, the occupants of the home were able to make it out of the home unharmed. Other parts of the state got hit by monsoon storms as well. In Mayer, Arizona, heavy rains led to flooded washes. The flooding prompted evacuations in low-lying areas near Big Bug Creek. The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said: ""There is a significant danger to you; gather necessary items and go. Get to higher ground and avoid low water crossings."" A shelter was set up at Mayer High School.

Michael Zhang,"The 2018 monsoon season has arrived in the American Southwest, and on July 9th, photographer Jesse Watson drove out into the desert to capture some time-lapse stills of an approaching storm. While out, he was met by the largest dust storm he had ever seen. Watson managed to capture some breathtaking views of the approaching haboob, which he later turned into the beautiful 30-second video above. “I checked my radar late in the afternoon and saw that storms were blowing up and heading my from Gila Bend,” Watson writes. “My girlfriend was cooking dinner, I ran into the kitchen and said let’s go shoot, there’s a haboob coming our way! So put the food on hold and jumped in my truck. Drove about an hour east of Yuma until we caught up with the massive wall of dust that was racing towards us. “Once we were upon the haboob, I grabbed my cameras and tripods to roll timelapse until the dust hit us. Then I jumped in my truck and raced ahead of the haboob to repeat the process, leapfrogging all of the way back to Yuma, AZ.” In all, Watson captured 800 photos and drove 200 miles in the course of shooting the photos seen in the video. You can find more of his work on his Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

Shaunacy Ferro,"Since launching in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has captured some magnificent images of our corner of the universe, from neighboring planets to distant nebulae. An updated picture released by the European Space Agency shows two galaxies colliding 350 million light-years away, a process the ESA has been tracking for 52 years, Gizmodo reports. Galaxies are constantly changing shape and creeping through space. When two of these massive networks cross paths, their stellar material begins to intermingle, and they eventually merge into one entity under the force of gravity. In this image depicting two barred spiral galaxies in the Cetus constellation, the two nuclei are still separate, but the explosive merging process has already been set in motion. Long tidal tails—streams of gas, dust, and stars—feather out from the top of the cluster. The bright blue patches indicate ""stellar nurseries"" where gas and dust stirred together by gravity are producing new stars. The photograph was first released in 2008, but this latest version has been updated using Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). According to an ESA statement, the galaxies ""are like a natural experiment played out on a cosmic scale, and by cataloguing them, astronomers can better understand the physical processes that warp spiral and elliptical galaxies into new shapes."" Galactic mergers are a vital part of the evolution of the universe: Even the Milky Way is on course to crash into a neighboring galaxy 4 billion years down the road. But the process, though violent, is slow-moving. It will be millions of years before these two galaxies in Cetus settle down into one.

Johnny Simon,"While no where close to the planet-sized storm that’s been kicking up dust across Mars this last month, the sand and dust storms—sometimes known by their Arabic name, “haboobs”—that have occured in recent years on Earth are still terrifying. They can create swirling, gurgling walls of sand, creeping across the desert, making it impossible to see 20 feet in front of you. From space, they look a bit less menacing. Though they blanket huge swaths of land, making invisible normal features and landmarks, they often appear in images taken from space as almost gentle, just wisps of sand lightly floating off the ground. Unless otherwise indicated, these images were taken by satellites: A massive Sahara sand seen from the International Space Station in 2014. A swirling dust storm over China in 2001. A dust storm blowing off the coast of Morocco in 2003. An Afghanistan dust storm seen from the space shuttle Atlantis in 2000. A dust storm over the Red Sea in 2016. Saharan dust storms in March of 2018. Dust blowing across Colorado in 2014. A plume of dust blowing away from White Sands National Park in New Mexico. Dust blowing off the coast of Australia in 2009. A dust storm over the Gulf of Oman in 2003. A 2014 dust cloud over the Caspian Sea. A dust storm in Alaska in 2017, caused by winds picking up the dust created when glaciers grind against rocks.","While no where close to the planet-sized storm that’s been kicking up dust across Mars this last month, the sand and dust storms—sometimes known by…",2018-08-08T18:34:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Qz.com'}","Earth’s fiercest dust storms, as seen from space",https://qz.com/1351553/photos-of-earths-fiercest-dust-storms-as-seen-from-space/,https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/china_tmo_2001097_lrg1-e1533747424482.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400,,Qz.com,dust storm,1
