(Finlands summer temperatures rarely get above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and around this time of year the weather tends to be wet.) Logging roads crisscross Finlands forests, slowing down fires while giving firefighters easy access. Aviation clubs are paid to do fire surveillance, looking for fires from the air. Finnish forest managers remove some of the dead trees (not, uh, leaves) to remove a small percentage of the flammable material. Perhaps we could learn from Finlands strategies, but no amount of raking will make California wetter or slow down the Santa Ana winds that fan the flames, nor will it eliminate forest fires in places that are, like Malibu, not actually made of forests.","Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images) Our President, garbling something the Finnish president said about forest management, believes that the snowy country has fewer wildfires than California because they rake up leaves in the wilderness.

Matt Simon,"Nestled in the foothills of Californias Sierra Nevada Mountains is the quaint Gold Rush town of Nevada City. Surrounded by unkempt brush, the old, highly flammable city is in danger: with Californias wildfires raging with unprecedented ferocity in recent years, one spark could doom Nevada City to the same fate that neighboring Paradise met in November.
But not if the goats get there first. Realizing its predicament, Nevada City has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay goats (or, more accurately, their herders) to clear brush at the edges of town. Its called, yes, Goat Fund Me. And its part of an ungulate awakening: All across the state, business is booming for herders as panicked homeowners and towns reckon with the wildfire menace.
There is no single explanation for why Californias wildfire problem has gotten so bad. Climate change is oneless rain in the fall means dryer brush, which in turn coincides with seasonal winds that fan massive blazes. More cities encroaching on wildlands is another.
Yet a third factorthe one most pertinent to the interests of goatsis the fact that California has been really, really bad about clearing the brush that turns into tinder. For comparison, the southeastern US, an area only five times bigger than California, did prescribed burns on 5.5 million acres last year, 100 times more than the Golden State. Prescribed burns are expensive, and a huge chunk of Californias fire money goes to battling ever-larger blazes.
Goats, though? A herd's work is relatively cheap, around $1,000 an acre (200 goats can tear through an acre a day). I realized money was an issue, says Nevada City vice mayor Reinette Senum, who launched Goat Fund Me. We can go out and pursue grants but that takes months, and we don't have months. The best time for the goats to do their thing is in the winter, before new growth blooms during the rains of spring. That and the ranchers already have their goats rented out for the rest of the year.
The first step is to identify the most prone areas with the help of the fire chief, then reach out to residents there to tell them that there might soon be a special scent in the air. You've got to let neighbors know: for a couple days you might get a smell, says Senum. Your dogs might be disturbed because they're smelling goats and may want to go after them.
To be clear, the goats dont work alone. They have human handlers and their own muscle in the form of a big white dog. They're fiercely protective, says Brad Fowler, owner of the vegetation management company The Goat Works, which is working with the city. In California we've got mountain lions and coyotes and recently wolves. The dogs, just by their presence and their bark, discourage predators to go somewhere else.
The operation doesnt simply amount to letting goats loose on a property. Basically we have a mobile ranch, says Fowler. We're taking a ranch essentially with all the infrastructure that's included in that to every place we go. The team sets up solar-powered electric fences to keep the goats penned in a particular area. If possible they hunt down local creeks or ponds, but they may also truck in their own water.
But for the most part, once theyre in place, the goats are self-starters. Theyre highly efficient vegetation managers, since they convert a plants solar energy into protein and poop, which nourishes the ecosystem, whereas human crews have to cart off what they clear. Theyll eat most plants from the shoulder up, so dead grasses and such. (If you want to really clear grass, sheep are your best bet.) Nevada City has a particular problem with out-of-control blackberry bushes, whose thorns are no problem for the goats. They've got really nimble lips, says Fowler. It's funny to watch them. They'll hold the branch with their lips and reach in and bite it off with their back teeth.
Being goats, though, they dont necessarily abide by human notions of containment. A bad day would be, you get a call that all your animals are two miles away from where they're supposed to be, says Fowler. The good news is when that happens, people don't get as upset about it as they would if, say, your bulldozer got loose and ran over a bunch of houses. As long as they stay out of traffic, Im OK.
On their own, goats only do part of the job; theyre more of an advance party. They get in there and strip out the brush enough for human crews to come in with chainsaws to cart away the bigger branches and such. Of particular convenience is the fact that goats will happily eat poison oak. They're cute little things, but it's only one little piece, says Senum. Who doesn't love a goat?
Still, the firefighting ruminant business is booming in California, beyond Nevada City. It seems like everybody kind of woke up with these big fires, says Fowler. And I tell you what, there's a huge opportunity. If somebody wants to get into the business, now would be a good time.

CARL ZIMMER,"For early studies of fire refugia, ecologists hiked through forests and grasslands, inspecting islands that withstood surrounding flames. Now researchers are scrutinizing fire refugia from space. With nearly 50 years of satellite data, theyre starting to piece together the recent history of these sanctuaries. After a fire wipes out a forest, fire refugia stand out as green jewels scattered across the blackened land. Depending on the forest, up to 25 percent of it may survive in refugia, Dr. Krawchuk estimated. Sometimes a forest refugium survives a particular blaze thanks to luck. We might have a change of wind, it cools down at night, and the fire might not grab that patch of forest, said Arjan Meddens, a fire ecologist at the University of Idaho and lead author of the BioScience review. But when researchers look at satellite images from other years, they see that some refugia are different. There are some places in the landscape that seem to avoid fire time and time again, said Dr. Krawchuk. The most interesting thing is why, she added. What makes that green spot stay that way? There are probably many factors at work. In the Northern Hemisphere, the north sides of mountains favor refugia. The plants there get less sunlight that their south-facing counterparts. They often hold more water in their trunks and roots, and they grow in moister soil that can tamp down fires. Fire refugia dont have to endure for centuries to be ecologically important. Even a fleeting shelter can be important for local biodiversity.","The Delta Fire burning in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California last month.

Beth Skwarecki,"The Camp Fire in northern California has just become the deadliest in the states history; the Woolsey fire in the south is engulfing Malibu; and our president is tweeting obliquely about the logging industry. Welcome to 2018. Everyone from firefighters to the CNN weather guy knows this is wrong, wrong, wrong, so lets break it down: These arent all forest fires The Camp fire did start in a forested area, but the southern California fires did not. As the Pasadena Fire Association replied, these are better described as urban interface firesin other words, ones that start in places where homes are built among flammable vegetation. Wildland fire is a more accurate term, which encompasses brush fires, rangeland fires, and more. So if you imagine nothing but trees burning, youve got the wrong image in your head to start with. There is one big reason for these massive, deadly and costly wildland fires Climate change. We really have to go over this again? Of Californias 10 most destructive fires, nine have been in the last 15 years. Five are from 2017 and 2018. The recipe for these fires requires a few common ingredients : Houses very close to flammable vegetation Dry weather making that vegetation extra flammable High-pressure winds from the jet stream, which occur around this time of year. The hotter California gets, the drier it gets. And the extreme dryness makes the vegetationnot just trees, but also brush and grassesburn more easily. The drier the land, the smaller a spark it takes to catch fire. Then, hot, dry gusts of wind suck up even more moisture, and they push fires forward, throwing embers onto houses and other fuel in their path. Watch this exasperated meteorologist explain it better than I can. President Donald Trump tweeted some incredibly ignorant things over the weekend about the wildfires Read more Read Forest management may be a dog whistle for the logging industry Politicians including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have been advocating for fuels reduction management. The thinking seems to be: remove the forest, and you cant have forest fires. In effect, this means opening up lands to logging. But, as Outside explains here, logging isnt effective at removing the kinds of fuel that wildfires thrive on. Loggers want to take the biggest, most commercially valuable trees, and leave the saplings and brush. Guess what catches fire really well? Yeah. Saplings and brush. Funding is necessary for preventing fires and helping affected communities Its not clear what federal funding you could remove from the picture and make fire management better. Much of the area thats burning is federal land anyway. And until 2020, the US Forest Service still has to cannibalize its own fire prevention budget to find the money to put out fires that are already burning. (The practice, called fire borrowing, was finally ended with a bill that Congress passed earlier this year.) Putting out wildfires costs more every year, as fires get worse.

Matt Simon,"Actions have consequences, as our parents likely told us as kids. But inaction has consequences, too. Life or death consequences, in the case of Californias new normal of massive, climate-change-driven wildfires.
After a series of devastating fires over the last few years, critics have turned their ire toward PG&amp;E, a utility that brings electricity to 5.4 million households and businesses in Northern California. Its equipment has been blamed for 17 of 21 major fires in 2017 alone. Facing the prospect that itll be officially implicated in last Novembers Camp Fire, which virtually destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86, the utility has announced that its seeking bankruptcy protection.
What happens to PG&amp;E nextwhether it sells off bits of the business to survive, or the state forces the company to split up, or its turned into a public utilityisnt clear. But safety will haunt the utility no matter what. They have a failed track record, says California State Senator Jerry Hill. They have no safety culture today.
Preventing electrical equipment from sparking fires is not some arcane art. But it does have its complications, and forcing a utility to get its act together might require forceful regulation of the kind typically reserved for a railroad baron.
The biggest threat to the electric grid is wind. In California this becomes particularly problematic in the fall, when seasonal winds tear in from the east. These winds are hot and dry, and desiccate the vegetation, making ignition all but certain.
High wind not only makes the fire spread very fast, but it also knocks all those power lines and knocks all the equipment, which can generate explosions of sparks, whether that's arcing between lines or transformers exploding, says Michael Gollner, a fire protection engineer at the University of Maryland. It's almost always due to either collapse of power utility poles or contact between different lines.
Those complications arent necessarily a problem if the equipment is surrounded by pavement. But miles upon miles of power lines are strung through the wildlands of California, where they are surrounded by unkempt brush.
Even before these seasonal winds arrive, the lines are a major liability. We hit these really, really dry periods throughout the west in the summertime, says fire ecologist Robert Gray. That means a whole lot of air conditioners running. There's more juice running through the line and it sags closer to lower vegetation.
One fix is to bury the lines, but that doesnt work in much of California, where a lot of rock sits at the surface. You could do it, but it would be enormously expensive. Even if lines were buried where theres dirt, digging them up to do repairs is still pricey.
Then why dont utilities just cut power to lines when they know strong winds are coming? They do, actually, but that call is far from simple. You also cut off certain communities from vital services, says Gollner. You can turn off medical equipmentthere's all sorts of things to consider when you make those decisions. They have to weigh both liabilities, which is bizarre.
The best thing to do now, experts say, is to take a page from the era of railroad barons and rein in the utilities. From the 19th century well into the 1920s, America had a serious problem with railway fires. Burning coal or wood threw sparks out of the engine, which easily ignited vegetation around the tracks. It was like dragging a flare across the countryside.
Then regulators said: Yeah, thats going to have to stop. They made the railroads adopt spark arrestors. They required inspections for brakes, says wildfire historian Stephen Pyne. There were laws passed.
Regulators dragged the railroads into court if they didnt comply. A century ago, this was a huge industry, big money, big political clout, says Pyne. That's not unlike the power line situation.
First and foremost: lines simply have to be kept away from brush. That means a whole lot of money spent in fuel management, which California has been historically terrible at. In California, utilities are legally liable for any fire their equipment starts, even if they arent deemed to be negligent, so they better be damn sure that that equipment is clear of brush. That costs money, but its a tiny investment compared to paying for the ravages of wildfiresPG&amp;E says its facing a liability of $30 billion from just two years worth of conflagrations. Hence bankruptcy.
(PG&amp;E declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a press release that says it will make investments in system safety as it works with regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to consider a range of alternatives to provide for the safe delivery of natural gas and electric service for the long-term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.)
Utilities know full well how to manage their risk. Both Pyne and Hill point to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which regulators found liable for the Witch Fire of 2007, as a model of current safety practices. For instance, it created a weather center that monitors for fire conditions. They created a new industry standard that has been ignored by PG&amp;E almost in every regard,"" says Hill. ""Ignoring those basic practices I believe resulted in the fires of 2017 and 2018.
In the long term, though, the solution may be for communities to become more independent about their power. Its not hard to foresee a future (however far off) in which electricity is much more decentralized: Instead of power coming from massive plants dotted throughout California, neighborhoods could establish their own hubs, using solar or wind power to charge large batteries throughout town. Outfitting your home with solar panels still aint exactly cheap, sure, but that price will continue to drop as the technology evolves. And decentralization in California very much depends on PG&amp;Es fate: If the state ends up breaking the utility into smaller entities, that might make things easier.
It's burying lines where we can, where it's feasible and appropriate,"" says Gray. ""It's decentralizing the hub so if you do have a power outage it doesn't impact huge areas. But it's also a system that uses a multitude of different sources of energy.
This is scary new era of climate-change-driven wildfires. But by reining in the utilities, just as we reined in the once-almighty railroads, perhaps we can help avoid catastrophes like Paradise.

TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Experts also worry that not enough attention is given to all the ways people have made the problem of wildfires worse. Population growth in California means there are more people on the roads — cars are a prime culprit in wildfires — and more homes built in wilderness areas. “It would be easy to throw our hands in the air and say it’s just climate change, and we can’t do anything about it,” said Jennifer K. Balch, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder and an expert on wildfires. “But actually we are starting the majority of wildfires, and we can do something about it.” Another factor, many experts say, are policies in California that protect forests from timber harvesting and a reluctance to set off controlled fires to burn vegetation. William Stewart, an expert on forestry at the University of California at Berkeley, said that part of the California dream was keeping “nature as it is,” with minimal management of forests. With so many fires burning so often, Stephen Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University, worries the public has become accustomed to disaster, unwilling to have difficult conversations about where houses are being built and whether controlled burns are a good idea.","Thursday: How people start or exacerbate blazes, a sudden opportunity for Duncan Hunter’s challenger, and a teetotaler’s guide to Sonoma County.",2018-08-23T13:00:46Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Human Element in California’s Wildfires,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/california-today-fires-humans.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22caltoday/22caltoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","California is burning. The state’s wild-ass wildfires are becoming the norm, but this change is something many communities in California can’t afford. These wildfires degrade the air quality—and towns near and far are feeling it. Right now, nearly 20 fires are ablaze in the state. The Mendocino Complex Fire has quickly risen to the state’s second-largest wildfire in modern history. The still-raging Carr Fire, meanwhile, is the state’s sixth most destructive. Hell, even Yosemite National Park is on fire due to the Ferguson Fire, which has been burning for 24 days and counting. “If you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” The smoke billowing out of these fires has been on the move, posing health threats to communities that might’ve not been worried about the fires at all. Smoke from the Ferguson Fire has traveled about 100 miles to Reno, Nevada, where air quality advisories are on. The smoke created when flames ignite trees and organic matter is nasty stuff full of particulate matter that can lodge itself in people’s lungs and eventually make its way to the heart. Once in our bodies, it can cause lung disease, lung cancer, and heart disease. And the toxic compounds in these particles are worse than the smoke spewing out of cars, said Greg Huey, the chair of Georgia Tech University’s Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department who’s researched the topic. “Car ignitions have a lot of emissions controls on them,” he told Earther. “Even a coal-fired power plant, which we might normally think of as dirty has quite a bit of emission control compared to wildfires. You have a lot of smoldering fires. You can see a lot of brown and black smoke, so you can see quite a range of products that come out of fires. It’s just a much dirtier combustion.” That smoke moves quickly as winds shift, and the people who lie in its path bear the consequence, said Tom Flannigan, a spokesperson with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. “Our mountains and our microclimates are such that some areas might not be feeling any of the impact at all while others are disproportionately impacted,” he told Earther, “That is very well due to the topography of our state, but most of what we see is that if you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” Much of the air throughout the state, as well as neighboring states like Nevada and Oregon, is currently in the “unhealthy for sensitive groups” range. Where the fires have concentrated, southeast of Sacramento near the Nevada state border, the air quality is straight up unhealthy and even hazardous in some areas—for everyone. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have.” California cities already deal with some of the highest levels of air pollution in the country, especially in the state’s Central Valley, where many of its oil refineries are located. The people poised to suffer the most are the low-income families and communities of color that already deal with poor air quality on the daily due to their vicinity to industry. These fires aren’t helping. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have, so we work to let people know that they should do what they can to limit their exposure,” Flannigan said. A study published last month found that extreme air pollution days have gotten worse in the last 30 years for states from Nevada to Montana, and wildfires are largely to blame. And the situation will continue to get worse in the face of climate change. While California used to have a distinct fire season, today it’s more of a year-round thing, Flannigan said. That’s bad news for human health, Huey at Georgia Tech emphasized. “The more fires you have, the more acreages burned, the more emissions you have,” Huey said. “You’re going to raise the levels [of particulate matter] that people can be exposed to.”","California is burning. The state’s wild-ass wildfires are becoming the norm, but this change is something many communities in California can’t afford.

LISA FRIEDMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. So did the president capture the causes of the California wildfires accurately? Lisa: The president’s tweet said that the California wildfires were worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Virtually every scientist and forest management expert agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweet was scientifically and factually inaccurate. Mr. Trump’s other admonition that California “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” raised fewer objections. But, state officials pointed out, California devoted more than $250 million in state funds this year alone on efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires. How about the president’s point about water policy? How is that related to wildfire management and firefighting? Is there any connection, as the president suggested?","Wednesday: Hazardous air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, accusations of slogan-stealing in the 10th district, and LeBron James excites bike activists.",2018-08-08T13:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Your Questions About Fires and Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/california-today-fires-and-climate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/us/07CALTODAY-01/merlin_142056570_ff8f2de5-3943-43a0-894e-84c0995be321-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Californias 2018 is officially the worst year for wildfires in recorded state history, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday, citing the National Interagency Coordination Centers year-end statistical analysis. The 1.8 million acres of California land that burned last year was more than any other state in 2018, and it far surpassed 2017's tally of 1.3 million acres in California. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean confirmed to the Times that the wildfires were unprecedented.
The Times wrote:
More than 100 people were killed and 17,000 homes and 700 businesses were destroyed in a state where fires are considered one of the annual seasons. Crews responded to more than 8,000 fires last year.
Its a surprise its that amount, but in a sense because of what Ive seen over the last year, no its not, McLean said. Its what weve been living through.
... Firefighters said the most devastating blazes had the most extreme behaviorwind-driven ember storms that created spot fires far beyond defensive lines and, in the case of the Carr fire, a fire tornado that ignited objects lifted into the air.
Many of the recorded deaths happened during the Camp Fire, which rampaged across Butte County and killed some 86 people, mainly as it rolled through the town of Paradise and burned most of it to the ground. The Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, both in November, burned more than 250,000 acres alone, the Times noted.
After a seven-year drought from 2010 to 2017, much of California remains a tinderbox with estimates that there are over 147 million dead trees throughout the state. The end of the drought poses its own problems, as fast-growing grasses and other small plants can dry out and catch flame themselves, carrying blazes right to other sources of fuel. Californias rapidly growing population (which has almost doubled since the 1970s) has also brought many more communities into areas at high risk of fires.
Recent research has also indicated that the historical distinction between the December-February wet season and the fire season has largely disappeared, in part due to climate change.
Last year, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told the AP that the state government should consider a ban on building homes in potentially fire-prone areas, saying: Firefighters are living climate change, its staring them in the face everyday. He added that officials owe it to residents and emergency personnel alike to make such decisions, so that they dont have to keep going through what were going through.
California fire officials are planning a major effort to thin forests throughout the state in an effort to stave off future wildfires, but per the San Francisco Chronicle, some experts are questioning whether it will really be enough. Thinning forests reduces available fuel but can also dry out the forest floor or promote growth of less fire-resistant plants, the paper wrote. Denser forests may burn longer, but they may also burn less intensely.
University of California, Santa Barbara UC Cooperative Extension wildfire researcher Max Moritiz told the Chronicle, Its not fair to say that fuel treatments wont do any good. It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you cant just do this and (expect to) make much headway.
McLean told the paper the efforts may not stop the catastrophic scale of wildfires in recent years, but It gives the folks in those areas time to evacuate and it also give the firefighters a chance to get in there and mitigate the fire.
According to the LA Times, fire officials are bracing for the worst. McLean said that the recent wet winter has promoted even more growth in fuel, saying that its fire management programs have to continue forever. Its an ongoing process from here on out.

ADAM NAGOURNEY and INYOUNG KANG,"Punk has a storied history in Los Angeles. Detachment from mainstream life and culture prompted generations to adopt new attitudes in the late 1970s. At the time, the scene was mostly white, teenage and male. These days, L.A.s punk culture is largely Latino, reflecting population shifts on both the state and county level. The new music scene is being defined by young Latinos on the outlying areas of the city who are bound by a shared sense of place and disaffection with mainstream culture. When I first heard punk, I heard the Germs, I was blown away, and I knew I could bring what I learned on the guitar into writing punk songs, said Martin Castro, 17, the guitarist in a band called Diversity. Its a reiteration of the story that punk has told for decades: Alienation breeds creativity breeds community. And through music, young people are finding an honest way to communicate and a place where they are heard. Read the full article and view the photos here.

ADAM NAGOURNEY,"This was the sixth time that Mr. Garcetti had given one of this briefings and once again, he was flanked by two men who have been key in coordinating this response: the fire chief, Ralph M. Terrazas, and the police chief, Charlie Beck. Mr. Terrazas, who Mr. Garcetti promoted to what in this city is a particularly important job, has been briefing Mr. Garcetti before his news conferences, reporting to the mayor every few hours on the latest development. On Monday, at the mayor’s weekly cabinet meeting, Mr. Terrazas warned the mayor about extreme conditions that could lead to disastrous fires later that week. He was proved right the next day, though he was not ready on Thursday to declare game over. “This has been a long week and we are not done yet,” Mr. Terrazas said, wearing a protective yellow jacket and an L.A.F.D. cap. “Tomorrow morning will be Day 5 of a multiday Santa Ana event.” “You can see some improvement,” Mr. Terrazas said, referring to fire conditions. “But it’s still in extreme range.” More Coverage From The Times of the California Fires: Follow live updates today here.

Jonathan Shieber,"As crews across California battle more than a dozen wildfires—including the largest in state history—the blazes are spewing enough carbon into theair to undo some of the good done by the state’s climate policies. What’s even worse: Climate-warming compounds that will be released by the charred forests long after the fires are extinguished may do more to warm up the planet than the immediate harm from smoky air. Scientists say that only about 15 percent of a forest’s store of carbon is expelled during burns. The remainder is released slowly over the coming years and decades, as trees decay.That second hit of carbon, experts say, contains compounds that do more to accelerate climate change than those from the original fire. And future fires over previously burned ground could make climate prospects even more bleak. “The worst possible situation is the fire that comes through and kills everything,” said Nic Enstice, regional science coordinator for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. “Then, ten or fifteen years later, another fire comes through and releases all the carbon left in the trees on the ground. That’s really bad.” It’s a scenario that could explode at any time. Enstice cited a research paper published this year that laid out a chilling tableau: California has more than a 120 million dead trees strewn around its mountain ranges, with the southern Sierra hardest hit. When fires hit those downed trees, the state will begin to experience “mass fires” spewing plumes of carbon. The resulting conflagrations, according to the researcher, will be almost unimaginable. “The emissions from those fires will be unlike anything we will have ever seen,” Enstice said. “And you won’t be able put it out.” Computing the carbon released from the the fires so far this year will not happen soon. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration flies planes through smoke plumes, gathering data, but air traffic over wildfires is tightly restricted. Scientific research is not a top priority when fires are threatening towns. But some preliminary data is available now. One method uses inventories of existing forests—surveying how many trees and which type. Those records are updated every 10 years. Researchers then overlay infrared images captured from satellites that show what’s burning and at what intensity. From that, predictions can be made about carbon emissions on any given day. Scientists say that emissions from burned forests are one of the most virulent types, called black carbon. According to the most recent accounting from the state Air Resources Board, California’s annual black carbon discharge—excluding wildfires—are equal to emissions from about 8 million passenger vehicles driven for one year. Not a small number. But when the state calculates the same annual average of black carbon coming solely from wildfires, it’s the equivalent of nearly 19 million additional cars on the road. With year-round fire seasons and fire intensity off the charts, state officials admit that wildfires could set backCalifornia’s myriad policies to offset the impacts of climate change. “It’s significant,” Enstice said. “We don’t have a lot of data to measure yet, we’re still using primitive tools. But everyone is gearing up to study this.” This article is republished courtesy of CALMatters.","Julie Cart Contributor Share on Twitter Julie Cart is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who writes for CALmatters, a nonprofit, non-partisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In California, a wet winter no longer protects landscapes from the kind of intense wildfires the states been experiencing lately. 
A new study published Monday analyzed the historical relationship between wet winters and extreme wildfires. Over the past 400 years, the two rarely overlapped, but thats all changing now.
The paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses climate models and weather records to piece together this relationship. The international team of researchersfrom places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Germanys Institute of Coastal Researchfound that the North Pacific jet stream, which is usually responsible for Californias rain, determined whether the state would suffer an awful fire season between 1600 and 1903. A lot of rain from December to Februarytypically meant a low-key wildfire season.
However, that link weakened after 1903. Fast forward to 1977 and the link between the jet stream-induced rainfall and wildfires is pretty much gone.
Thats for two reasons, said lead author Eugene Wahl, a paleoclimate researcher with NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. First, federalfire suppression policies, which began following the removal of Native Americans from their lands. Native Americans practiced subsistence burning,which reduced fuel for wildfires.Their removal (and genocide, combined with the new fire suppression policies, led to the build up of massive amounts of fire fuel.
This helped uncouple the winter Jet Stream activity from the following fire season conditions, Wahl told Earther in an email.
On top of that physical alteration to the environment, now theres climate change. Our carbon emissions are causing temperatures to rise, which is resulting in a longer, hotter fire season. This allows wildfires to thrive despite the increased wet-season moisture the team expects California will see in our changing world. In fact, increased wet-season moisture could increase fuel loads in the same way that fire suppression used to.
Just look at 2017. That year saw a very wet winter, per the study, yet it still experienced extreme events like the Thomas Fire and Tubbs Fire, which were responsible fora combined 24 deaths and 318,7000 acres burned.
The fact that such extreme wildfires happened in a year with extreme rain is a major shift. The researchers couldnt find a single such instance between 1600 and 1903, before fire suppression techniques began to infiltrate western forests. 
The end of the connection between high water seasons and low-impact wildfire seasons in 2017 could mark a new era. California officials now know fire suppression is bad policy and support prescribed burns, but that doesnt mean the fuel build-up from that policy will just disappear (say nothing of the effects of climate change).
This is bad news for California communities, especially the low income communities of color who are most vulnerable to wildfires. Heavy rains might not be enough to keep them safe anymore.","In California, a wet winter no longer protects landscapes from the kind of intense wildfires the state’s been experiencing lately.

Emily Dreyfuss,"From where Trina Hill is stationed at the corner of 16th and Illinois streets, she can see the future of San Francisco rising all around her. This is the Mission Bay neighborhood, the new hotbed for science, tech, and medicine. Warriors Stadium is right across 16th. Behind her stands the building she and her coworkers are finishing, future research laboratories for the University of California at San Franciscoone of the leading medical research institutions in the world. To the east, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. To the north, the windows of Ubers glistening new headquarters glimmer a strange smokey orange. Under normal conditions, Hill would be able to see across the bay to Oakland and Berkeley. But on Tuesday, smoke from the faraway Camp Fire, which left at least 48 dead and 103 more missing, had blanketed the city and the whole Bay Area. The US Environmental Protection Agency considers an Air Quality Index score of 150 or higher to be ""unhealthy for everyone,"" due to the density of particulates in the air. On Tuesday in San Francisco, the AQI was 164. The smoke caused headaches, stung eyes, and obscured skylines with tiny, dangerous particles that left soot on the windshields of Lyfts navigating all the busy construction. When breathed in, those particles can embed in the alveoli of the lungs, causing or exacerbating respiratory distress and potentially leading to future cardiac and respiratory ailments. Hill suffers from respiratory issues already, and though she was wearing a bright yellow jacket and a hard hat to protect her on Tuesday morning, she had no respirator to shield her lungs. They gave us masks but Im not wearing mine because it fogs up my glasses. And I should, she said. A&amp;B gave everyone on her crew an N95 mask on Monday, when it was clear the city was going to again be stifled by smoke from the fire that caught the previous Friday. Hills was unopened in her pocket. When WIRED explained the risks to her lungs, she took it out and put it on. Ill be out here all day, she said. I should know better. Ive been in the field a lot of years. She wore it the rest of the day. The innovations that come out of this neighborhood change the worldfrom new pharmaceuticals and basic research on the brain to startups hoping to elongate human life and change the future of work. Yet the people building it are at risk. All over the neighborhood, construction workers were going up outdoor elevators into buildings, hanging off the sides of lifts, hammering and working and taking breaks with no respiratory masks on. When the tech workers, doctors, nurses, and researchers briefly emerged from their buildings at lunchtime with their face masks strapped on, most of the construction workers on break beside them wore no pulmonary protection. Californias Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent out a warning on November 9, the day the Camp Fire broke out, that all employers in the state who have workers affected by wildfire smoke need to modify work conditions and schedules to minimize exposure, or hand out appropriate respirators, like disposable N95 masks, to protect workers. Special precautions must be taken to protect workers from hazards from wildfire smoke, the warning reads. The greatest hazard comes from breathing fine particles in the air, which can reduce lung function, worsen asthma and other existing heart and lung conditions, and cause coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Hills employer, Berkeley-based A&amp;B Construction, complied. So did Bratton Masonry, an outfit in Fresno, which has some 30-odd workers in town to help build the new Warriors Stadium. At the safety meeting Monday, they warned us about the smoke and handed out respirators, said a Bratton mason who declined to give his name. McCarthy Building, the tenth most lucrative construction company in the state, according to the Engineering News Record, went a step further. McCarthy halted all outdoor construction work on its Northern California projects in areas with an air quality index higher than 150. It completely shut down construction on pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences new headquarters south of Mission Bay, in Foster City, because the air was so bad. ""If you take any project where the purpose of the building is to save lives or create medicines or to treat people, it doesn't make sense to be building these buildings and hurting people at the same time,"" said Paul Erb, Executive Vice President of McCarthy Construction, who couched his comments as referring to the firm's projects in general. The smoke has affected the majority of our projects in Northern California, Erb said. This haze, its unprecedented in modern construction times. In those moments you have to take a pause and think about what the effect is and sometimes it makes sense to shut the job down for the day. Erb was speaking from a cell phone in Nevada, where he had just arrived, but he said his throat still hurt from breathing in the air in the Bay Area over the weekend and earlier this week. WIRED spoke to two subcontractors who had been working for McCarthy on that Gilead project. When it was closed down, they moved to a job on the roof of UCSFs new Cancer Medical Building in Mission Bay. We couldnt see anything driving over the bridge to Gilead, said a machine metal welder on a smoke break from the cancer building. He declined to give his name and wasnt wearing a mask, though he said he had a respirator on the roof where he was working for the day. Other men working on that cancer research building said that the inside was fitted with HEPA filters and those working outside had been given masks by their team. Most were not wearing masks when WIRED spoke to them. Near the sign announcing the future of cancer research, one man in a hardhat could be seen three- or four-stories up on a lift working without a respirator, as air thick with smoke constricted this reporters throat, and hospital employees nearby walked around with masks on their faces. Though most workers WIRED spoke said they had been given respirators or the option to leave work for the day without repercussions, some had different experiences. A lift director for Bigge Crane and Rigging said that he and his crew had been told they could go home but hadnt been given respirators. I have one in my car thats mine, but Im not wearing it because Ill only be out here a second, the man who declined to be named, said. I think everyone should have one. He stood watching one of his crane operators work on the Warriors Stadium. The operator, he said, didnt have a mask but was enclosed in the cab with air conditioning so he wasnt worried. A man Ill call Dade, who works for Conco doing concrete work on a building on 15th street, said his company didnt give him a mask at all and he was worried because he has asthma. No one is talking about it, he said of the atmosphere on his job-site. WIRED observed no workers laboring outside on Clark Construction's massive $1-billion Warriors Stadium project site wearing appropriate masks on Tuesday. One man who works for Clark on that job, who declined to give his name, said that no masks had been handed out and that no one had mentioned in any meetings hed attended that there was increased risk from the air. He asked if he should worry about the risks to his infant daughter in air like this. (Yes.) Hes been outside for hours every workday since the fires broke out. Clark did not respond to numerous requests for comment. WIRED reached out to all the companies listed as running jobs in the neighborhood, and mentioned by workers in interviews. None but McCarthy responded to a request to learn their policy regarding air safety on the job. Down the street, workers on a Webcor job site building UCSFs new Center for Vision Neuroscience were observed not wearing any protective masks. Webcor is the third largest contractor in the state. When WIRED inquired in the project office whether any respirators had been given out, the safety officer replied, I dont like reporters, and refused to give any information, before giving a nonworking number to the companys press office. By press time the company had not responded to repeated requests for information about OSHA compliance. Just because workers werent wearing their masks, though, doesnt mean they didnt have them available. Respiratory risk is a tricky thing to get people to care about. Many of the workers outside without masks in Mission Bay on Tuesday told WIRED they had masks in their pockets, or had been offered them, but werent wearing them. A man on his lunch break from working on the new Uber headquarters shrugged. Its definitely terrible, but what are we going to do? he said. His sister had to evacuate Chico on Friday, and hed spent the weekend driving as far from the city as he could to find clear skies. He came back to the city to go to work. His friend, who was smoking a cigarette next to him, added, Were already killing ourselves. That same nihilism was a common theme among workers WIRED spoke to Tuesday. In 35 years this is the worst Ive ever seen, said ironworker Christopher Hayes, a subcontractor on the new Uber building. The company offered respirators to us, or they said we could go home, he added. As is standard in the industry, anyone leaving would forgo pay. Neither he nor his three coworkers on break outside the job site wore masks and told WIRED they still wouldnt wear them when they went back up to work either. We work 30, 40 feet in the air hanging off a side of a building, so were probably going to die way before cancer, Hayes friend and fellow union member (Iron Workers local 377) Jackie Winslow said, sitting atop an orange box housing tools to measure lead particles in the air (since this neighborhood used to be shipyards, the risk of lead contamination during new construction is high). The younger guys on break with them agreed. Many people told WIRED that since they couldnt smell the smoke Tuesday, they assumed it wasnt that bad anymoredespite how visible it was. Others said that theyre exposed to all sorts of hazards in their daily jobs, so whats one more thing? A vast majority of workers also said wearing the N95 masks was annoying and made work hard. I would advise them to wear a mask, but then I know that it's harder to wear a mask when you're working hard, said UCSF's John Balmes, a doctor specializing in respiratory exposure. If they are doing heavy work to increase their rate of breathing, they're going to have a greater effective dose of the smoke particles. And if they are really working hard and breathing through their mouth, then they bypass the filtering mechanism of the nose. So you should not be training for a marathon like this. You might not want to be doing heavy lifting in that case, either. Balmes runs UCSFs state-of-the-art research laboratory focused on respiratory illness caused by wildfire smoke. That lab, over the hill in the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, is nicknamed HEL (short for Human Exposure Laboratory), which felt fitting on Tuesday. Balmes emphasizes that research into the long-term effects of wildfire exposure is inconclusive. Its especially hard to know whether short-term exposure can lead to future illness like cancer. How can you say for sure many years into the future that it was definitely that one week of smoke inhalation that caused the lung cancer? There are carcinogens in wildland fire smoke, he says, but even studies of the risk to firefighters who breathe that smoke chronically are in their early phases. Breathing this air quality for a week like we're probably going to do here is not going to appreciably increase our cancer risk, he said. But it might not just be one week anymore. As climate change warms the Earth, fires of this magnitude are growing increasingly common in the west. Some professors at UC Davis called on their school to declare smoke dayslike snow days, but for the problem of smoke on campus. On Wednesday, UC Davis did cancel classes, owing to the bad air, which was at an Air Quality Index of 152. In San Francisco, where UCSF, USF and City College of San Francisco were still in session, the air was at 179. Berkeley and schools in the East Bay also remained in session despite an AQI rating of 168. Maybe one more day, or one more week, working in these conditions wont hurt someone who is otherwise healthy. But as it becomes a seasonal norm, the risks to people working outside are much greater, as are the losses to business. These risks are not limited to construction workers, of course. The United Farm Workers of California noted on Twitter that laborers have been in the fields since Nov 9, working in dangerous conditions to pick the food that feeds the nation. WIRED witnessed farm workers in artichoke fields near Salinas picking vegetables with no respirators over the weekend, as SF city residents drove past to the South, fleeing the area for better air. The vegetables grown in California feed the nation, just as the science and technology developed here feeds innovation all over the world. Though the firesand the safety of those working in wildfire-affected communitiesmay seem like a local California problem, the haze settling over Mission Bay and all of the state, working its way into the lungs of thousands of people just trying to do their jobs, affects us all.

CONOR DOUGHERTY and ADAM NAGOURNEY,"The proposed law is the latest twist in a long and contentious fight over rent increases in Santa Rosa. The Sonoma County city, like much of California, is struggling with a difficult housing shortage and rising rents. The City Council passed a rent control and just cause eviction measure in 2016, only to see it repealed by a landlord-backed ballot initiative during a June special election this year. After the fires, community groups continued to organize renters, holding clinics and renewing their push for expanded rights. “The fires are clarifying the deep need that our region has for tenant protections,” said Davin Cardenas, a director of the North Bay Organizing Project.

THOMAS FULLER,"Why do the researcher says we’ve never seen this before in California? Mark A. Finney, an expert in fire behavior for the U.S. Forest Service and an author of the study, says California forests are much more vulnerable now because, paradoxically, they have been better protected. In their natural state, forests were regularly thinned by fire but the billions of dollars that the state spends aggressively fighting wildfires and restrictions on logging have allowed forests to accumulate an overload of vegetation. “We had forests that were very resilient to weather variations and insect disturbances in the past — maintained by frequent fire on the order of every year, or every few years at the most,” Mr. Finney said. By putting out fires, “we’ve changed completely the fire component of these ecosystems,” he said. How might the dead-tree forests affect California? One of the most striking concerns is the damage the fires might do to watersheds. Intense, hot-burning fires could disrupt forests’ ability to channel water into the Sierra reservoirs that provide cities like San Francisco with drinking water. That’s a scenario that could nudge the state into rethinking its forest management.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"California is entering its sixth day battling dangerous wildfires. They have been driven by extreme weather conditions: low humidity, high winds and parched ground. Authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"". Fanned by high winds, six large fires, and other smaller blazes, swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, with many drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County is the largest, and has destroyed more than 430 buildings. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated from their homes, with many forced to flee in the middle of the night as the flames rapidly spread. Three firefighters have been injured and hundreds of buildings destroyed. One death was reported after a 70-year-old woman was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast. US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in response to the fires. There are fears the blaze will hurt California's vast agricultural industry. Much of the state's avocado crop has been destroyed. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California and the industry is worth millions to the economy. The fires have destroyed homes and scorched residential areas.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California. The Monday morning update from CAL FIRE shows that 966 structures have been destroyed, making the Carr Fire the eighth-most destructive wildfire to hit the state. At only 20 percent contained, the fire still poses a risk to 5,012 more structures, according to CAL FIRE, meaning that amount of property lost (and its ranking on the list) could rise, especially as assessment crews are able to access more areas that were hit by the fire. At least six people are dead and more are missing, numbers that could sadly also rise. The majority of the losses have occurred in neighborhoods on the north and western side of Redding, a city of 90,000 located on Interstate 5 about two and a half hours north of Sacramento. The Carr Fire rushed into town on Thursday night, jumping the Sacramento River and continued its rampant growth on the backs of gusty winds and 110-degree-Fahrenheit heat. The fire continued to grow over the weekend, doubling in size from day to day before it slowed down on Sunday night. As of Monday, the fire has burned 98,724 acres. The heat in particular has led to near-record-low vegetation moisture, leaving trees, shrubs, and grassland primed to go up in smoke. Vegetation has burned so intensely that the fire has sparked a vortex of smoke and flames, twisting fire tornadoes, and towering pyrocumulus clouds. Smoke has blanketed much of Northern California, spiking air quality to unhealthy levels. Four of the 10 most destructive fires in state history have occurred in the past year, and eight of them have happened since 2000. Three of them occurred last year alone as part of the conflagration in Wine Country and the Thomas Fire that hit Southern California. This wildfire season has proven to be catastrophic as well. Beyond the Carr Fire, wildfires have burned 410,000 acres, more than double the average for this point in the year, according to statistics compiled by Steven Bowen, a meteorologist at insurance company Aon Benfield. The dangerous Ferguson Fire caused Yosemite Valley to be evacuated as a safety precaution last week. And earlier this month, the County Fire ripped through Yolo County, eating up 1,000 acres of land per hour at its peak as onlookers watched its advance from a casino parking garage. The stories of this fire season and last reflect two troubling realities: climate change is increasing the risk of conditions that lead to explosive fires, and a growing number of people are living at what scientists call the urban-wildland fire interface. It’s a dangerous combination that could further rewrite the record books.",The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California.

AJ Dellinger,"Record-setting heat plagued much of southern California Friday, with temperatures touching as high as 117 degrees during the day. The unseasonably hot weather sparked a number of brush fires that swept across hundreds of acres of land and destroyed several homes. The National Weather Service reported that at several locations in California saw new, all-time record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service said the weekend will likely be slightly less intolerably hot for residents of the region, but most of the southern part of the state will remain under an excessive heat warning well into the evening. According to the Los Angeles Times, new record highs were set at the Van Nuys Airport (117 degrees) and Burbank Airport (114), as well as in the cities of Santa Ana (114) and Ramona (115). Daily records were also topped in downtown Los Angeles (95 degrees) and Woodland Hills (115). Coastal cities of Camarillo (92 degrees) and Oxnard (86) also experienced new daily record high temperatures. Those unwieldy conditions weren’t just tough on the citizens of the region, but also for the environment. Per the LA Times, a brush fire broke out in the San Bernardino National Forest that quickly spread and forced residents of the Forest Falls area to flee from their homes. The fire encompassed more than 200 acres and was “out of control” near Interstate 8, burning traffic medians alongside the stretch of road. The roaring fires forced “hundreds” of people from their homes, according to the Los Angeles Times, and at least one dozen buildings were destroyed in its blaze. It is believed that several of those structures were homes, but officials did not have an official tally on what was lost. Firefighters also worked to stomp out several smaller fires that sparked in Angeles National Forest, Montecito Heights, Sylmar, and Pacoima. It seems likely those won’t be the last to occur from the current heat wave. KABC-TV in Los Angeles reported the National Weather Service has issued “red flag” warnings for the Los Angeles County Mountains, Angeles National Forest, Ventura County mountains, and Los Padres National Forest until 6pm local time Saturday. The alerts signify an increased risk of fire danger in the regions, some of which are also under wind advisories until Saturday morning. The heat-induced brush fires are just the latest incidents in California’s seemingly endless state of being on fire. Even before the record-breaking temperatures started bearing down on SoCal, wildfires were doing a number to the northern part of the state. Late last year, raging wildfires wreaked havoc on southern California, forcing the evacuation of more than 230,000 people while destroying hundreds of homes and torching more than 80,000 acres of land in its path. Brush fires in the Los Angeles area two years ago destroyed more than 22,000 acres of land and gave the city sky an apocalyptic look, while sand fires the same year pushed thousands from their homes. If the last few years—and what we know about likely effects of climate change—are any indication, things are likely only going to get worse from here.

Tom McKay,"Wildfires in California have continued to ravage large portions of the state, with the Thomas fire in southern California now entering its 13th day and claiming over 267,500 acres of land, CNN reported. The wildfire is now the third-largest in California history and is just 40 percent contained, with over 8,400 firefighters and $110 million in resources deployed to fight it. Now-familiar scenes posted by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department and others this weekend showed Ventura and Santa Barbara counties descending into a nightmarish state, just as with a prior spate of wildfires elsewhere in California earlier this year. Ventura resident Patricia Rye told KEYT she had woken up in the middle of the night after her son-in-law arrived and did not have time to grab anything before the fire approached her building. “I didn’t have time to take anything,” Rye said. “My wallet, or any of my personal things. I literally left with the clothes on my back. If I had been thinking I would have got into my car, but I wasn’t thinking so my car was there.” Elsewhere, CNN reported, thousands of people were evacuated and animals at the Santa Barbara Zoo were loaded into cages in anticipation of a possible emergency. The Thomas fire could be on track to become the largest fire in recorded California history, the L.A. Times reported, potentially surpassing both the 2003 Cedar fire (273,000 acres) and the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire (300,000 acres). UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the paper that half of the largest wildfires in the state since 1861 have occurred in the last 15 years, with humans primarily to blame—both as a result of arson or accidental fires being started by them or due to persistent regional drought, which is linked to climate change. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” Keeley said. “... What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Associate director of the Center for Environmental Journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder Michael Kodas wrote in the L.A. Times that prior to 1995, the U.S. averaged one “mega-fire” of more than 100,000 acres a year. California now experiences one such fire a year on its own, while the U.S. averages nearly 10. Elsewhere in the paper, concerned readers urged fellow residents to stop building homes or developments in the wildland-urban border zones where the fires spread. [ CNN / L.A.

TRIP GABRIEL,"The League of Conservation Voters is spending $60 million on races this year, twice as much as in 2014. Gene Karpinski, president of the group, said it would target up to 20 tossup House districts by seeking to motivate suburban women and independents to vote Democratic. Its ads attack Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado for voting faithfully with Mr. Trump, the worst polluter of all, and Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, with video of him claiming global warming is a fraud. Around the country, there are exceptions to the rule that cautious candidates downplay climate change. Sean Casten, a scientist and clean-energy businessman challenging Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, calls out Mr. Trump in an ad for labeling climate change a hoax. Mike Levin, an environmental lawyer running in coastal Southern California, launched his candidacy by pressing a book, Climate Change for Beginners on Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican, at a town hall. Mr. Issa decided to retire and Mr. Levin is in a contest with a Republican, Diane Harkey, who argues Californias aggressive pollution regulations go too far. Mr. Levin said that climate change is no longer an abstraction in California after record droughts, year-round wildfires and extreme weather have become familiar. In Florida, which is also seeing the quickening tempo of climate disruption, Representative Carlos Curbelo, whose district includes the Everglades and Florida Keys, is a rare Republican who makes climate an issue.

George Dvorsky,"With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting as high as 80 miles per hour, firefighters are bracing themselves for another challenging day in Southern California. Over the course of the week, destructive wildfires in the state have forced the evacuation of more than 230,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and torched over 80,000 acres of land. Since the wildfires began on Monday evening, at least 14 different blazes have swept through a region extending from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley. The fires are being fueled by unusually strong Santa Ana winds and large amounts of dry vegetation—ironically caused by heavy rainfall earlier this year—which are now parched and dried out. The fires have caused severe traffic disruptions, closed schools and museums, and triggered power outages. The largest of the fires, the Thomas Fire, encompasses an area measuring 115,000 acres, and it’s just five percent contained. States of emergency have been declared in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, including the city of LA itself. To date, some 230,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. No deaths have been reported, but several firefighters have sustained injuries. Flying above California aboard the ISS, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky took these photos of the wildfires. Earlier this week, California’s Office of Emergency Services sent a broadcast text alert to 12 million people across seven different counties warning of the wildfires. It’s the largest alert the office has ever sent. The state is hoping to avoid a repeat of early October 2017 when wildfires killed 44 people in the state. The text didn’t ask people to evacuate, but instead advised of dangerous conditions. Meteorologists have had to adjust to the severe conditions. A color-coded system used to convey wind strength reached uncharted levels, going past the red “high” level, moving into the purple zone, which indicates “extreme” winds. Incredibly, at 80 mph (130 km/h), the winds reached hurricane-force levels. “The forecast for tomorrow is purple,” said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection. “We’ve never used purple before.” These winds are fueling existing fires, turning small brush fires into raging infernos in a matter of minutes, and blowing hot embers into adjoining areas, potentially starting new fires. These high winds are also making it difficult—if not impossible—for firefighters to do their work. On Thursday, the wildfires swept through northern San Diego county, moving toward Oceanside and other coastal communities. The Lilac fire, which extends for 4,100 acres and is zero percent contained, made its way through the Bonsall area, torching areas along State Route 76 corridor and destroying 20 buildings. Earlier this week, 29 horses— including elite thoroughbred race horses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—were killed when the fire reached the San Luis Rey Training Center. Those rescued endured severe burns, and were treated for smoke inhalation, dehydration, and stress. In Bonsall, around 500 horses had to be rescued when the Lilac Fire began to threaten the region some 45 miles north of San Diego, according to CNN. “There was so much smoke it was difficult to see,” Dan Durhan, a horse trainer, told the Associated Press. “Some of the horses were turned loose so they could be safe. They were scattered around.” Despite these losses, firefighters are making some progress. Of the 14 wildfires, five are now classified as contained (the Oak, Riverdale, Little Mountain, Meyers, and Paper fires). In Bel-Air on Thursday, the 475-acre Skirball Fire failed to get any bigger, largely the result of firefighting crews who worked along its western and northern edges near the 405 freeway and several luxurious, multi-million-dollar homes. Fire crews are also testing new technology. On Thursday, the LAFD tested a drone that used thermal imaging to sniff out hot spots, directing firefighters to areas in need of attention. Sadly, southern Californians will have to stay alert, as high winds are projected to persist until Sunday. This year’s wildfire season can’t end soon enough.

Andrew Freedman,"Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes. The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, expanded from nothing to 31,000 acres in just a few hours thanks to fierce Santa Ana winds. The strong winds also caused power outages, plunging thousands of residents of Santa Barbara and Ventura into the dark as flames rushed in. SEE ALSO: 'We're just existing': What it was like to survive the deadly Northern California wildfires The fire has come close to downtown Ventura, a city of more than 100,000 people about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Social media images taken by evacuating residents show nightmarish scenes of onrushing flames. According to the Ventura County Fire Department, 27,000 people have evacuated. One of the structures that succumbed to the fast-moving flames was a large apartment complex. Santa Ana winds blow offshore, from east to west, tapping into warm and dry conditions inland. Close to the coast, these winds compress the air coming off the hills and mountains to the east, further warming and drying out the air mass, and helping to dry out already combustible vegetation. The fire threat had been anticipated, as the National Weather Service issued a rare ""critical"" fire outlook for Southern California on Tuesday due to the Santa Ana wind event. High wind warnings and red flag warnings were in effect for much of Southern California. The Thomas Fire was visible from space, via the Suomi-NPP satellite as well as other observing platforms. Heat signature from the Thomas Fire depicted from the Suomi-NPP satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: NOAA. Typically, the fire season in Southern California peaks in October, but it can occasionally flare up again in November and December. In this case, a strong area of high pressure has built in across the West, and the clockwise air circulation around that high pressure is responsible for triggering the Santa Ana wind event. The Storm Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service, issued a forecast discussion on Tuesday morning warning that fire weather conditions will further deteriorate during the day, as winds increase, humidity drops, and temperatures climb. The Weather Service has designated parts of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino, and Riverside counties as being in ""extremely critical"" fire weather risk, which is the highest category. These areas could see sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the Storm Prediction Center said, with gusts up to 80 miles per hour in hills and mountains. Relative humidity levels could drop to as low as 4 percent in these areas, the center stated. The immediate Los Angeles metropolitan area is included in the slightly less serious zone of ""critical"" fire danger. The October wildfires that killed more than 40 people and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in northern California also occurred during a period when strong, dry offshore winds were present. Such winds can allow a fire to spread quickly and erratically, including by spreading burning embers far out in front of the main blaze.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"Thanks to its mild climate and rich soil, Ventura County produces a variety of crops all year. In the plains around Oxnard, Calif., the vast strawberry fields have been spared from the fires. But thousands of immigrants toiling in the fields initially lacked masks to protect them from the thick, acrid smoke that wafted across the county. Volunteers have descended on the fields to hand out masks since last week. “We have been moving mask distributors up and down the coast,” said Lucas Zucker, policy director of the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, known as Cause. The California Strawberry Commission has urged workers to wear masks, and some growers have distributed them. One 44-year-old farmworker from Mexico who gave his name as Alfonzo said he worked without a proper mask before Cause gave him one. “My throat was aching, but I have my family to support and the rent to pay,” said Alfonzo, who earns $10.50 an hour in the fields. Ventura County growers are used to Santa Ana winds, and many have lost crops before, mainly to frost. But they said they were surprised to see wildfires so close to the ocean and so late in the year, which highlights the severity of a yearslong drought. “This is a complete game-changer for a lot of us,” said Leslie Leavens, a fourth-generation farmer whose family grows avocados and lemons on 800 acres in Ventura Country. As for Ms. Brokaw, she said she was confident that the majority of her trees would survive, even if there are barely any avocados for her to sell this year. “The orchard can be rejuvenated,” she said. “We are committed to this, long-term.” Continue reading the main story",The largest of the fires has damaged a portion of the harvest in the country’s most productive region for both crops.,2017-12-14T00:10:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",More Victims of the California Wildfires: Avocados and Lemons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/california-fires-avocados.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/14/us/14avocados-promo/14avocados-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
JENNIFER MEDINA and SARAH MERVOSH,"The fires are fueled by extreme heat and parched vegetation from years of drought. And firefighters have repeatedly been vexed by the soaring temperatures and rugged terrain of the current fires. Scientists say climate change is a central factor in creating the atmospheric ingredients that make wildfires like California’s more extreme. Warmer global temperatures, driven by the greenhouse gases emitted from man-made activity like burning coal and driving cars, has led to droughts as well as more intense heat waves that last longer. The result: increasingly intense fire seasons that start earlier and last longer. “You combine drought and heat, you get record wildfires. It’s not rocket science,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it is still not possible to quantify the role that climate change plays versus other factors from more housing developments to the way forests are managed. But, Mr. Wehner said, “It’s fair to say that there is a human influence, and it’s not small.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday. It has so far destroyed 143 structures, including 75 residences. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said. Of the top 20 largest wildfires in California, about half have come in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. “That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,” Ms. Tolmachoff said.","Two fires have combined in Northern California to form the largest wildfire in state history.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“A good analogy is a clogged bathtub. You’re just putting more and more pollution into a limited space and it’s getting more concentrated, more concentrated, more concentrated,” said Jamie Holt of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. “We don’t create more pollution than other parts of the country, we actually create a lot less pollution,” she added. “But because we have this topography and meteorology, we have less ability to clear the pollution out.” It’s not just the inland San Joaquin Valley that is getting hit. An air quality advisory has also gone out for the Bay Area, which has been affected by smoke from the nearby Mendocino Complex Fire. A “spare the air” alert was even issued by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District — which oversees nine counties around the bay — asking people in the area to reduce their driving to minimize smog; those alerts are issued when air quality has reached levels that are potentially unhealthy. The Sacramento Valley has received less bad air than the San Joaquin Valley, but a “spare the air” advisory was released there as well. “It doesn’t really matter which way the wind blows because you’ll get smoke from some fire or another,” said Jamie Arno of the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.",A man wears a mask while fishing from his boat on Wednesday as smoke from the Mendocino Complex Fire covers Clear Lake in Clearlake Oaks.,2018-08-09T12:00:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","California Today: California Today: Amid Wildfires, Bad Air Becomes a Threat, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/california-today-wildfires-air-conditions.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/world/o9-california-today-1/o9-california-today-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Local officials have hit back at President Trump's claims that firefighters don't have enough water Twin wildfires in California, known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, have grown to become the largest active wildfire in state history, officials said on Monday. The fires have spread rapidly in recent days to burn 283,800 acres of land - an area almost the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters are tackling 16 major blazes across the state amid hot weather, strong winds and low humidity. At least seven people have been killed in the Carr fire in the state's north. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump has reiterated social media comments that the fires' spread is being ""made so much worse"" by California's environmental laws. Local officials and experts have criticised and dismissed his tweets. Where are the fires burning? More than 14,000 firefighters and hundreds of US army personnel are trying to contain the more than a dozen major fires burning throughout the state. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Officials say the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two nearby fires being treated as the same incident, has surpassed last year's Thomas Fire to become the largest in state history. Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) described the wildfires as ""extremely fast, extremely aggressive, extremely dangerous,"" ""Look how big it got, just in a matter of days... Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen,"" he said on Monday. It is only 30% contained so far, with authorities warning it could take another week to get the blaze under control. Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". What is the row with Mr Trump? The US president has criticised Governor Jerry Brown and California's environmental laws on social media in recent days. He tweeted on Monday that the wildfires were being ""magnified &amp; made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean.

The death toll rose from 63 on Friday, eight days after the Camp Fire broke out in northern California. However, the sharp increase in the missing list - from 631 to 1,011 in 24 hours - may not be accurate. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said it was possible it contained duplications. ""I want you to understand that this is a dynamic list,"" he told reporters. ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names."" Authorities have also warned that some of those on the list may be fine but unaware people are trying to find them, or unable to call. However, there could also be people among the dead who no-one has yet realised are missing. The fire - the deadliest in the state's history - has destroyed 142,000 acres (57,000 ha), including most of the town of Paradise, home to 27,000 people. Rescue workers, aided by cadaver dogs, were continuing to comb what little remained of the town on Friday. In total, some 47,000 people have been told to evacuate, with those who have fled the fire being houses in emergency shelters, as well as with friends and family, while others are camping. President Donald Trump is due to travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. What's the latest on the firefighting operation? The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 45% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze until the end of the month. Media caption California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son They are also battling several other fires, including the Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles and the smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire. The worst-hit area is Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Why are the fires burning? Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Californias largest utility is in a death spiral in wake of the deadly Camp Fire last fall. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. (PG&amp;E) announced Monday itd be filing for bankruptcy on January 29.
This news comes after CEO Geisha Williams stepped down from her position Sunday and just days after Moodys downgraded PG&amp;Es credit rating to junk status. So yeah, things arent looking too bright for the company, which may be responsible for the devastating Camp Fire that devoured the city of Paradise back in November. The wildfire killed some 86 people and injured countless others (including two incarcerated firefighters), making it the deadliest blaze in Californias history.
A federal judge announced last week hes planning to order the utility to inspect its electrical grid and clean up the trees near and around its lines. If ordered, the utility must meet these demands by summer when the states wildfire season officially begins.
This is hardly PG&amp;Es first rodeo with wildfires. In fact, its infrastructure has sparked at least 1,500, per Wall Street Journal reports, including a dozen Northern California fires in October 2017. Together, wildfires from 2017 and 2018 have resulted in some $30 billion in potential liability costs for the company. PG&amp;E could even face murder charges for lives lost during these deadly events.
Following PG&amp;Es bankruptcy announcement, its already-shit stock crashed nearly 50 percent this morning. Its hoping that filing for bankruptcy can help it bounce back. So far, the company doesnt expect this move to impact its 15 million customers.
The people affected by the devastating Northern California wildfires are our customers, our neighbors, and our friends, and we understand the profound impact the fires have had on our communities and the need for PG&amp;E to continue enhancing our wildfire mitigation efforts, said interim CEO John Simon in a press release. We remain committed to helping them through the recovery and rebuilding process.
But the company may be nearing its end. The state is considering whether to break PG&amp;E up into smaller pieces, or even take it public. No matter what happens, customers shouldnt face significant power outages, per the San Francisco Chronicles analysis.
Whatever happens to PG&amp;E, California is set to become drier and warmer in the face of climate change, further increasing the risk of wildfires.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year. At the time, the decision seemed like a no brainer, leaving behind a landscape dominated by humans for one where homes mingled with the forest and rolling chaparral hills of Northern California. But the dream of moving home turned into a nightmare on an early October night. Whipped by gusty winds and tinderbox conditions, the Tubbs Fire roared into town, melting cars, consuming homes, and leaving nearly two dozen dead en route to becoming California’s most destructive fire in history. By the time the flames were contained on Halloween, the fire had claimed 5,636 structures, including Wentz’s parent’s home where she had grown up. “I’m definitely reconsidering my whole perspective of where I want to live and how I want to live and how I want to raise a family,” Wentz, a staff attorney at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Earther. “It’s hard to explain that, to feel like I can’t return to that place.” Millions of Americans may soon be forced to confront similar feelings. California has been at the epicenter of a fiery crisis over the past year as everything from iconic locales like Wine Country to interstate towns like Redding burn. More generally, across the West towns small and large have been decimated by wildfires in recent years thanks to rising temperatures, more human-sparked fires, and more humans living in harms way. It raises an uncomfortable question that coastal residents, policymakers, and insurance underwriters have been forced to grapple with in recent years: Is it worth it to build (or rebuild) in a landscape primed for explosive fires? The answer—for now—is yes, but that calculus could change as rising temperatures and more frequent droughts conspire to make the forest a riskier place to live. And it’s an open question of who will foot the bill as that risk increases—and what happens when the risk becomes too high. “Increasing wildfire risk is a top concern of many insurers,” Chris Folkman, a senior director at catastrophe modeling firm RMS, told Earther. 2017 was the costliest wildfire season in American history. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimates that were $18.4 billion in wildfire-related damages, including three separate California fires that topped $1 billion. The losses were an eye opener for insurers. Folkman said the previous standard for issuing policies in fire prone areas relied on surcharges in high risk areas based on what insurers viewed as “frequent but manageable outbreaks of claims.” “As we’ve learned from recent events, this approach will no longer cut it,” he said. Indeed, this year has seen fire-lated damages continue to mount, with the Carr Fire currently sitting as the sixth-most destructive fire in California history and the Ranch Fire taking the claim as the largest. Across the West, more than 5.9 million acres have burned for the year-to-date, upwards of a million acres more than than the 10-year average. Rising temperatures are in part responsible for more dramatic wildfire. But humans are making fires worse in other ways as well. The vast majority of fires are started by us, and decades of fire suppression have increased fuel loads for incendiary fires. Perhaps most importantly, there’s more people living at the so-called wildland-urban interface or WUI, than ever before. A paper published earlier this year found that from 1990 to 2010, the WUI grew from 224,325 square miles to nearly 297,300 as 13.4 million new homes were built there. “This area is larger than the state of Wisconsin, and made the WUI the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States,” Miranda Mockrin, a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who co-authored the paper, told Earther. All of this means more property and people in harm’s way, upping the risk of catastrophic fires. There are a few ways that risk is currently being mitigated. The most obvious is firefighting to either tamp down fires or control them in ways that can help clear some of that heavy fuel load. But fighting fires is a costly endeavor. Last year, the federal government spent $2 billion fighting wildfires with state agencies chipping in billions more to combat blazes. “A lot of that money is spent on protecting homes,” Judd Boomhower, an economist at the University of California, San Diego studying fires, told Earther. That creates what economists call a moral hazard, essentially encouraging risky behavior. In the case of wildfires, firefighting incentivizes people to either move to fire-prone areas or rebuild after disaster strikes. This means insurance rates don’t reflect the true risks. What’s more, a number of states have something called the FAIR Plan, which offers individuals insurance in areas deemed too disaster prone by private insurers. That includes a number of fire prone states, such as California, New Mexico, and Oregon. Those policies often have high premiums and are only viewed as a last resort. But California law also prohibits insurers from cancelling a homeowner’s policy while they’re rebuilding after a fire or other natural disaster. Moreover, companies have to renew a policy at least once after that, making rebuilding a much more attractive option. “I think we’re on a threshold.” Boomhower said (while stressing he was not advocating for it) that the most market-based solution would be to charge communities a fee for firefighting services. While private wildland firefighting might be a libertarian wet dream, it’s definitely not politically palatable. It’s also unfeasible to let insurers cancel policies in the wake of wildfire damage, since kicking people while they’re down is a surefire way to lose an election. But taking the two most obvious fixes off the table doesn’t mean the problem is totally intractable in the short-term. In her work looking at the wildland-urban interface, Mockrin found some communities were already adapting to our hotter, more flammable present in the wake of fires. Their solutions ran the gauntlet from voluntary programs and education about risks to more stringent building codes. But nearly all the solutions have focused on new builds, leaving older homes facing higher risks. “It’s very rare to see regulations that require retrofitting,” she said. “The only thing I’ve seen for that is if your roof needs to be replaced, it has to be fire resistant.” Folkman said RMS is working on a new wildfire model that will help capture some of the risk in more actionable terms. The idea is that quantifying the biggest risks—say rising temperatures, drier fuels, or housing density—will allow state agencies or even local communities can take more preventative actions that keep houses safer. It could also help insurers set rates that are more in line with the risks while also rewarding good behaviors. That’s something already happening in some places. In Colorado, for example, a number of insurers require some fire mitigation for homeowners to get a policy. Beyond these fixes, there’s even bigger picture stuff, like prescribed burns to reduce fuel loads, fixing the firefighting budget or, you know, reducing carbon emissions so the climate doesn’t get even hotter and more fire-prone. But eventually, the rising tide of risk and repeated losses could be too much, forcing individuals and communities to confront some hard truths. Wentz wasn’t ready to leave California so soon after moving back home. Instead, she settled on buying a place in what she described as “the center of town.” It’s a compromise much like managed retreat somewhat inland from the increasing rising ocean to a place where risk is lower but still present. “Over half the acreage in Lake County has burned over the past five years,” Wentz said. “You’re seeing fires come through multiple times. Once you have two fires in the area over a couple decades, that’s a sign to insurance companies. I think we’re on a threshold.” We could find out what’s on the other side sooner than later, and it’s unlikely to be pretty.","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding Californias Camp Fire was the worlds costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that poor forest management is to blame for Californias wildfires woes. He also again threatened to cut off FEMA aid to the state.
The news was announced this morning on Trumps communication platform of choice, in a typo-laden tweet that has since been taken down and rewritten with the standard English spelling of forest.
Heres the original:
The confusing wording of the tweet has led some outlets to report that the president already ordered FEMA to cut off funding to the state of California. But as we should all be well aware at this point, Trump has a habit of sounding off about matters of national importance without bothering to inform the parties involved, whether hes firing the secretary of state via Tweet or attempting to kick transgender people out of the military.
FEMA told Earther that a statement was being prepared in response to Trumps supposed order, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details. The spokesperson did say that FEMA has continued to pay for disaster recovery despite the government shutdown. There are no disaster projects on hold presently and we are not aware of any that will have to be put on hold in the near future, FEMA said.
The California Governors Office of Emergency Services and state fire agency CalFire, which coordinate with FEMA on wildfire responses, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Trumps tweet.
Its not the first time Trump has at least threatened to pull federal aid to California as fires in the state spiral out of control. He issued a similar ultimatum back in November as firefighters were in still battling the Camp Fire. Its also hardly the first time Trump has pointed a finger at state environmental policies or forest management as the cause of Californias fire woes. Hes been doing so months, although Trumps fallacious fire culprit seems to have evolved over time from environmentalists who are wasting the rivers by diverting them into the ocean to state forest managers who cant be bothered to rake enough. 
Every version of these wild-ass claims has been thoroughly debunked by everyone from state firefighters who say they have plenty of water to fight the blazes, to Republican voters in Malibu who have correctly observed that better forest management wouldnt have prevented wildfires in their forest-free backyards to the president of Finland who said he never told Trump good forest management is the result of raking.
A charitable read on Trumps thought-salad about forest management is that hes heard about how the antiquated Forest Service practice of stamping out small brush fires has caused fuel loads to increase on forests throughout the West, priming them for larger fires.
But as University of New Mexico fire scientist Matthew Hurteau explained in a Guardian article in November, this is not the predominant cause of the recent fires that have scorched California.
Rather, human development at the wildlife urban interface has upped the number of fires being sparked, whether due to poorly-maintained power lines or an errant cigarette butt, in addition to putting more people and property in harms way. And climate change has primed landscapes to burn more frequently and more intensely, with hot weather and persistent drought turning landscapes into tinderboxes and causing fire season to start earlier in the spring and extend later into the fall.
Whats more, as Axios notes, more than half of Californias forests are federally-managed, and more fires burned on federal land than state land last year.
Hopefully, this latest threat to cut off FEMA aid will turn out to be as empty as the last one. 2018's wildfires took a devastating toll on California, and the state needs all the help it can get. Since President Trump issued disaster declarations for Ventura, Los Angeles, and Butte counties, FEMA has approved nearly 49 million in federal aid, according to a data tracker on the agency website. On Tuesday, newly-elected Governor Newson, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington state sent a letter to the federal government asking for more collaboration on managing the unprecedented fires the West faces.
We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives, Newsom tweeted in response to Trumps threat.","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding California’s Camp Fire was the world’s costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that “poor forest management” is to bla…",2019-01-09T19:24:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","Trump Threatens to Cut off Federal Wildfire Aid to California in Ill-Informed, Typo-Laden Tweet",https://earther.gizmodo.com/trump-threatens-to-cut-off-federal-wildfire-aid-to-cali-1831610415,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--w9hzFmmX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/yyyonpdq0czaryx3ybex.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,California wildfires,1

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Photo Gloria Andruskewicz evacuated her home in Ventura, Calif., on Thursday, as wildfires closed in. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times For the latest news on the wildfires, read our Thursday live updates here. Dangerous wildfires burning around Los Angeles have forced the authorities to tell nearly 200,000 people to flee their homes, some with little time to prepare. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you’re not in an area immediately affected by the flames. Wildfires can quickly travel great distances and move erratically — especially when driven by the wind, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman, Amy Bastman, said. “I know it can be a scary time, but when it’s time to go, we want to make sure people have all the things they need, all the essentials,” she said. “You don’t know how long you might be away, or whether there will be a home for you to come back to.” Here’s are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Before the fire Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they are not all together at the time of evacuation. Someone should be responsible for grabbing the emergency kit from home. Designate an out-of-area friend or contact, and let that person know that the family is evacuating, and to where. If family members are separated, or phone systems are overloaded, sending a text message to the contact might be the only way to let others know you are safe. Map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water, Ms. Bastman said. “It’s like imagining you’re going on a camping trip for a week,” she said. “What things would you have to take with you?” Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications, and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. “In the Northern California fires, a lot of people didn’t have a pack all ready,” said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Having those basic things that we discussed in a bag that you can just take with you really quickly is important.” Identify irreplaceable family photos, jewelry or heirlooms, and make room for them in the evacuation kit as well. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims with insurers or FEMA after the fire. Keeping a digital copy of the files, either on a hard drive in the emergency kit or available online, is also wise. Families that have time to plan might consider sending older photos and videos to an outside company to scan and transfer to a DVD, suggested Julie Sanchez, a New York Times reader who lives in Santa Maria, on California’s Central Coast. The DVD can then be stored in a bank safety-deposit box. “We’ve been doing that in my family for a while,” Ms. Sanchez, 56, said. “That usually seems to be the major thing that people want to save. Those are the irreplaceables.” When the fire approaches Prepare your home. If you have time, remove flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Patio furniture and umbrellas should also be placed at the same distance. Attach garden hoses to spigots to give firefighters a water source if they need it, but don’t turn the water on. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, Ms. Richard said. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media,” she said. She recommended following the emergency management agencies for Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Once you decide to evacuate You don’t need to wait for an order. If your home is threatened by fire and you’re able to leave, “there’s no need to wait for warnings,” Ms. Bastman said. “History shows us that those who leave the earliest often fare the best,” she said. That is especially true in densely populated Los Angeles, she added, where roads are jammed and firefighters have little space to move. When you decide to leave, dress in pants, long sleeves and sturdy shoes. A bandanna can help shield your face from smoke. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes, or follow those identified by the California Department of Transportation or Los Angeles Department of Transportation.

Rebecca Ruiz,"The fires consuming parts of Southern California have moved rapidly since breaking out a few days ago. The Thomas Fire, a blaze in Ventura County, has already claimed 90,000 acres. The fires have collectively led to the evacuation of more than 200,000 residents, according to news reports. There are numerous efforts underway to aid survivors, who may have fled wearing only the clothes on their backs and may not know the fate of their homes for days. By Wednesday, the Red Cross had opened seven shelters to provide refuge for survivors in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties.

NASA satellite shows smoke plumes and heat signatures (red dots) from the wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area on Dec. 5, 2017 Image: NASA WorldView The fires have spread so quickly and grown so large thanks to the California weather phenomenon known as the Santa Ana winds. The east-to-west blowing winds come from the Pacific and tap into warm and dry conditions inland. The winds push against the air coming from the LA basin's eastern mountains, which compresses the wind and heat between the ocean and the mountains, further drying out vegetation that has dried out over the summer. The phenomenon makes for dangerous fire conditions, which is now affecting residents across Southern California, from Ventura County to the north, and Santa Clarita and Santa Ana to the east. The Los Angeles Fire Department has ordered the evacuation of the 20.5 square miles including and surrounding the Creek Fire, which jumped the 210 Freeway and is threatening Santa Ana's Sylmar and Lake View Terrace neighborhoods.

Andrew Freedman,"The wildfires raging across Southern California have scorched tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and disrupted countless lives. While the scenes of flames screaming up hillsides, and smoke trailing hundreds of miles out over the Pacific are dramatic, they're not unprecedented. In fact, they're not even that rare. However, they are likely to be more damaging in the future, and more common in certain parts of California and the American West in general, thanks to climate change and other factors. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Wildfires, particularly during the fall, are endemic to California. In Southern California, the biggest blazes tend to flare up when the dry, warm Santa Ana winds blow, sometimes unceasingly for days on end. This week, for example, the Santa Ana wind event began on Monday, and is not forecast to stop until Friday night. Flames from a wildfire leap above traffic on Highway 101 north of Ventura, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2017. Image: Noah Berger/AP/REX/Shutterstock Much of the time during these events Southern California gets lucky, and there are no major blazes to speak of. It's not one of those years. This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. Known as ""El Diablo"" winds in this area, the offshore airflow was instrumental in propelling the wildfires faster than people could get out of the way, let alone allow firefighters to squelch the flames. Santa Ana winds result from a particular weather pattern featuring a high pressure area anchored over the Great Basin, and a low pressure area southwest of California, over the Pacific Ocean. The air pressure contrast between these two systems results in a funneling of air from east to west. As the air descends from the higher elevations toward the coast, it warms and dries, leading to extremely low humidity. These background conditions set the scene for a major fire, provided there's a spark. This year, there's been added fire risk from repeated heat waves that have sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, further drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. “It’s the coincidence of an ignition,"" that determines whether a Santa Ana event will lead to major fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, in an interview. ""And the two big causes of ignitions during Santa Ana wind events are power lines that blow down from the strong winds and arson."" The winds themselves can initiate a fire by downing power lines, something suspected in the fires that affected Northern California in October. Power outages preceded the Thomas Fire in Ventura on Tuesday, as well. Upper level winds showing the huge area of high pressure, or ""ridge,"" in the jet stream across the West, highlighted with the blue box. Image: earth.nullschool.net Importantly, the winds also make the fires nearly impossible to contain, blowing hot embers well ahead of the fire line, allowing blazes to hop across 10-lane highways with unsettling ease. The National Weather Service has been warning of the likelihood for ""extreme fire behavior"" with any fire that starts during this long-lasting wind event, going as far as designating the fire danger as ""extremely critical"" in the Los Angeles area. Once the fires get going, they can create their own weather, sucking in air from surrounding areas and lofting it upwards, promoting further fire growth and unpredictable behavior. Longer term trends This week, the high pressure area, or ""ridge"" in the jet stream, is extremely pronounced, part of a tendency toward more extreme weather patterns across the country. Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change. Last summer was the state's hottest on record, following a wet winter, which in turn followed the worst drought in modern California history. These episodes of weather whiplash have left the Golden State's trees stressed, making them more susceptible to toppling over from strong winds. Multiple studies have found that long-term climate change, which is mainly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, is raising the risk of large wildfires in the Western U.S. However, according to the USGS' Keeley, this doesn't apply to the lower elevations of southern California. His research has shown that the warming climate is leading to more frequent and larger fires in Northern California, particularly in high elevation forests, he said. There are broader, non-climate forces at work, too. Population growth is placing more people in harms' way, including by building in areas at the so-called wildland-urban interface, or WUI, where areas that traditionally burn as part of their natural ecology butt up against homes and businesses. In short, urban sprawl is not helping solve our wildfire problem. Keeley emphasized this point, saying that it's not just climate change, but global change that will alter wildfire severity and risk going forward. Wildfires are likely to have more catastrophic human impacts due to population growth along with climate change, he said. California statewide average temperatures for June through Nov. 2017. Image: noaa/ncei. For example, he cited a 1964 wildfire that burned almost the exact same area as the deadly Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. However, back then, the blaze caused no fatalities and only destroyed about two-dozen homes. Since that fire, though, he said the population in that area grew fivefold. “We need to be thinking about all the global changes that are taking place,” Keeley said. In the near-term, though, the Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday night, and may hit 70 miles per hour in some spots of Southern California on Thursday. In other words, this latest round of fires, which is a sign of the state's heritage and future challenge in a warming world, may yet grow worse.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""These fires may be a glimpse into SoCal's future under climate change."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-UjmGCjSM8A3WRuM-dU4wz3FFDc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F12%2F2c93672f-2bfe-c7a0%2Fthumb%2…",2017-12-06T22:40:04Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires,http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/causes-of-southern-california-terrifying-wildfires-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/44W3cplqc12pcASZtA9Xo3fYuNs=/1200x630/2017%2F12%2F06%2F0c%2Ff6cdf617cb964daf939a45ff2bdc5e85.b9168.jpg,mashable,Mashable,California wildfires,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list? Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

JILL COWAN,"Good morning.
(Heres the sign-up, if you dont already get California Today by email.)
Its been a difficult year for California. Deadly wildfires devastated communities up and down the state. And yet another mass shooting punctured a place that felt like a refuge. My colleague Jennifer Medina wrote about a young man who survived the shootings in Las Vegas and the Borderline Bar &amp; Grill in Thousand Oaks and is now preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. 
Ill let her tell you more about meeting the young man, Brendan Kelly: 
Before the shooting last month, Thousand Oaks was perhaps best known for its reputation as one of the safest cities in America. So I was hardly surprised when Brendan Kelly described his childhood as idyllic.
But now, at 22, Mr. Kelly has experienced more mass violence than anyone should face in a lifetime. First, he was in Las Vegas last year, when 58 people were killed at a country music festival. As he recovered, he spent countless nights at Borderline. Just as things were really feeling back to normal for him, a gunman entered Borderline and killed 12 people there.
He seems to approach danger and even death in the most matter-of-fact way. To memorialize two of his closest friends who were killed last month, he tattooed their names on his back, along with something a friend told him as they left Las Vegas: In this game of life, no one makes it out alive.","Thursday: How surviving the Borderline and Las Vegas shootings shaped a young man, the definition of a wall and 36 hours in underappreciated cities",2018-12-27T14:11:38Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","California Today: California Today: Surviving Two Mass Shootings, and Then Deploying",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/california-today-thousand-oaks-mass-shooting-afghanistan.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/27/us/27survivorcatoday/00survivor-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
Elena Saavedra Buckley,"This story originally appeared on High Country News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. At the end of July, Twitter user Alicia Santana posted a photo of a man sitting in a plastic folding chair in his yard. He’s looking away from the camera, towards a monstrous, orange cloud of smoke filling the sky beyond a wire fence. “My dad not wanting to leave his home,” Santana wrote, ending it with #MendocinoComplexFire. As wildfires spark, parts of the internet glow with them. The #CarrFire, #FergusonFire, #RanchFire and other hashtags spread quickly this summer on Twitter. If past seasons are any indication, there will be thousands more tweets like this, and they will continue as smoke—the insidious second wave of wildfires—spreads across the West. They can also be used for data. In a recently published study, US Forest Service researchers Sonya Sachdeva and Sarah McCaffrey found that, when analyzed in large numbers, tweets about wildfires can accurately model the way smoke moves. In their study, published by the International Conference on Social Media &amp; Society, Sachdeva and McCaffrey analyzed close to 39,000 tweets posted between May and September 2015 in California. They stripped the tweets to reveal their core subjects: smoke in the air, fallen ash, haziness, smell. By tagging the tweets with the location in which they were posted, the researchers created a verbatim map: a landscape of fire based on the people who experienced it. Their modeling proved accurate when compared to figures from air quality monitors. Their results show that what we write online could fill the gaps that traditional data collection leave behind. While still nascent, using social media to study environmental events is a growing field. Images from Flickr can help researchers understand tourism rates in natural areas, and social media often acts as a crucial tool in disaster relief. “Social media is everywhere people are,” Sachdeva said. “Physical monitors of any kind, by virtue of them being physical, can’t do that.” The 2015 wildfire season, including the Rough and Butte fires, burned nearly 900,000 acres in California alone. The smoke-related tweets Sachdeva and McCaffrey used reflect the air pollution’s wide impact. “Abandoned my 2015 #johnmuirtrail attempt… due to Rough Fire smoke. Poor visibility and headache the culprit,” one Twitter user wrote. Another simply read: “#airquality #cantbreathe #roughfire #California.” If someone #cantbreathe due to smoke, they’re inhaling small particles known as as PM 2.5, which measure under five percent the width of human hair. The particles can lodge into the lung tissue and bloodstream and cause health issues, particularly for people with respiratory issues, pregnant women, and children. In extreme conditions, though, the long-term effects can impact others. During the summer of 2017, Montana saw smoke conditions so dense that they maxed out air quality monitoring capacity. Dan Inouye manages the Washoe County air quality management district in Nevada, home to Reno, which has seven air quality monitors. Smoke is rolling downwind from California and into the county. Inouye’s eyes have been watering for weeks, and the air quality index has registered unhealthy pollution levels. “As long as the fires are active, there’s always that chance that smoke’s going to come our way,” he said. Near cities like Reno, air pollution monitoring stations are plentiful. But they’re absent in many rural areas like central Nevada, leaving small communities with less information about the air they breathe. Using alternative modeling techniques, such as Twitter, could help round out those blank spots. How tweeters’ location affected people’s experience of wildfires also factored into Sachdeva and McCaffrey’s research. By analyzing the topics people tweeted about, they could dig into what people cared about based on distance from the flames. The farther away the tweet from the fire, the more people were interested in concrete information: how the blaze started, say, or what NASA images indicated. The closer the tweets got to the blazes, the more people asked for and offered help. Rather than fleeing, McCaffrey learned, victims often stay put—“people are actually going into the fire.” McCaffrey, who has studied responses to wildfires for 25 years, sees them as a high-stakes—and revealing—event in the human-nature relationship. “There’s that narrative that the people in the immediate path are going to freak out,” McCaffrey said, “but the tweets are a clear demonstration that what people are really thinking about is what we should do and how people want to help each other.""",Social media could help monitor air pollution that physical monitors miss.,2018-08-15T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Your Tweets Can Help Map the Spread of Wildfire Smoke,https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-wildfire-model/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b735809be99ce7dfa36496c/191:100/pass/wildfire-1014049338.jpg,wired,Wired,California wildfires,1
Laura Vitto,"Destructive wildfires have torn across thousands of acres in Southern California since Monday night, destroying homes, forcing evacuations, and displacing thousands of residents as a result. In the days since, nightmarish photos and videos of three massive wildfires in the Los Angeles area have been widely circulated.

SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The man in the clip from RMG News (shared on Twitter by ABC News) reportedly declined to share his story on camera. (It should go without saying that getting this close to a wildfire is extremely dangerous and not recommended.) Per CNN, more than 110,000 Southern California residents have been forced to evacuate their homes as the fires spread. Thursday in particular looks to be a potentially devastating day for the area, with exceptionally strong winds and extreme dry air. The Storm Prediction Center estimates that Thursday's conditions will affect 9.5 million people. As Mashable reported, powerful Santa Ana winds have enabled wildfire to move quickly across hundreds of thousands of acres of land, and may continue to do so into Saturday.","Destructive wildfires have torn across thousands of acres in Southern California since Monday night, destroying homes, forcing evacuations, and displacing thousands of residents as a result.

IVAN PENN and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California has been a leader in trying to counter the forces contributing to climate change, from its stringent standards for auto emissions to its mandate that 50 percent of the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2030. Now, with climate concerns magnified by extreme summer temperatures and catastrophic wildfires, lawmakers are considering a move that would go further: a proposal to mandate 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045. The bill’s sponsor, State Senator Kevin de León, says that with the Trump administration’s efforts to bolster electricity generated from fossil fuels, California and other states must chart their own course on energy policy. And, partly owing to recent events, he thinks the bill can pass within three weeks. “Because of the fires, because of the extreme drought, because of the anti-environmental edicts coming from this president, there’s a huge ground swell of support,” Mr. de León said of his proposal, designated Senate Bill 100.",Wind turbines lined the Altamont Pass near Livermore in 2013.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' The death toll in the wildfires raging through California has risen to 25, according to officials. This comes after 14 more bodies were discovered in or near the decimated town of Paradise in the state's north, bringing the number of confirmed dead there to 23. Two more people were killed in the south, near Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. The Camp Fire began spreading through Butte County on Thursday, and firefighters were powerless to stop it destroying the town of Paradise. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and has now doubled in size. That fire, known as the Woolsey, now covers an area of 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares). Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, where a gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. Meteorologists have warned that dangerous conditions may continue well into next week, but firefighters say they are hoping to take advantage of a temporary lull in the wind fanning the flames. Where is the Camp Fire? The 20,000-acre (8,100-hectare) fire north of Sacramento started in the Plumas National Forest on Thursday and quickly engulfed the town of Paradise. Residents fled for their lives as more than 6,700 homes and businesses were destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in the state's history. The flames moved so fast that some had to abandon their cars and escape the town on foot. Rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out of the way in order to reach a hospital and evacuate patients as the fire engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter said. ""There's nothing left standing,"" said Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman. The fire has now been partially contained. Media caption The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest Driving through walls of flame By the BBC's James Cook, Paradise in California Paradise is hell. A smouldering, sepia world in ruins. The air is acrid. Burning chemicals leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Walking among the ashes of people's lives is eerie and awful. There is a profound sadness here. We pass a child's charred swing, a swimming pool filled with filth, and worst of all, a pet dog which did not survive. Such was the intensity of the blaze that much of the debris is hard to recognise. Wafers of ash are drifting down like enormous snowflakes, smothering sound. But it is not quite silent here. A sooty squirrel scrambles up a blackened tree in a panic. There are booms and creaks from burning trees and telegraph poles. And soon, going from ruin to ruin, there will be the sound of those with the hardest job of all, checking to see if anyone was left behind. Fire officials have also issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. Where is the Woolsey Fire? The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks. Media caption 'How much more can this town endure?' - deadly wildfire hits Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting On Friday, the flames jumped Highway 101 and headed into coastal areas.

Malibu and nearby Calabasas are home to many celebrities. The actor Martin Sheen was briefly reported missing but he later reported that he was on the beach, unharmed.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Edgar Sanchez/Kern County Fire Image caption Firefighters sleep outside after a long shift tackling a California wildfire - in 2017 As the deadliest wildfires in California's history have spread, so too have misinformation and pictures wrongly attributed to the current blaze. At least 42 people have died and 228 more are missing, officials say, while 300,000 others have been forced to flee their homes. Online, social media users have coordinated missing person appeals, organised assistance for the displaced and shared information. But in the scrabble for details, photographs of previous fires in California and elsewhere have been unwittingly muddled in with legitimate images of the ongoing fires. Here are some of the most widely-shared - and the real stories behind them. Thomas Fire, California - 2017 It's easy to see why this image struck such a chord. California firefighters of the Tehachapi Wildland Fire Crew 11 grab some well-earned sleep after an exhausting 24-hour shift. The photograph encapsulates the commitment and dedication of the emergency services. A single tweet of the image has attracted thousands of shares and tens of thousands of likes, in the context of the ongoing fires in California. Undoubtedly evocative, the image dates, however, from 2017 - and the California Thomas fire which was then the largest in the state's history. An area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined was burned. Michele Newell posted the image to Facebook on 19 December last year. Her son, Dylan, was among the resting firefighters. ""A little over two weeks ago Dylan texted me that Venture had a 100-acre fire,"" she wrote at the time. ""That fire erupted into something that took the homes of many friends and displaced hundreds of families. ""It's been heart-wrenching."" Malibu, California - 2007 Flames dwarf a trailer in the foreground as a fire in Malibu rages. Actor James Woods was among the social media users to share the image - but it actually dates from October 2007. According to the LA Times, close to 4,000 acres of land were burned and dozens of structures and vehicles destroyed when electricity pylons toppled over in high winds. Mr Woods has played a prominent role in coordinating help and assistance for fire victims online, through his use of the hashtags #SoCalFiresJamesWoods and #CampFireJamesWoods. The actor, who has developed a large online following in part through his vocal support of conservative causes, enlisted his 1.85 million Twitter followers in efforts to amplify missing person appeals, solicit donations and attract volunteers. Sula, Montana - 2000 It's been described as "" the most famous wildfire photograph ever taken "" and has been featured in Time magazine's year in pictures. But nonetheless, some social media users mistakenly attributed the fire to California in 2018. Thousands shared and liked posts featuring the image online. The photograph was taken in Sula, Montana, in 2000 by John McColgan, who worked with the Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Fire Service. Sparked by lightning strikes, the fire was one of 86 which raged across America's western states in August that year, according to Time.","As California's deadliest wildfires have spread, so too have photos misattributed to the current blaze.",2018-11-13T13:30:24Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","No, these photos are not from the California wildfires",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-46194019,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A37A/production/_104305814_edgar_sanchez.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,California wildfires,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The wildfires have devastated parts of southern California Much of California's avocado crop has been destroyed by wildfires that have ripped through the southern part of the state, industry experts say. ""We've lost at least several hundred acres of avocados, probably more,"" the California Avocado Commission told agriculture news site AgNet West. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California, and the industry is worth millions to the economy. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, officials say. One death has been confirmed - that of a 70-year-old woman found in her car on Wednesday. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. There are now fears the fires will have serious implications for California's vast agricultural industry. Last season's avocado harvest produced a crop worth more than $400m (£300m), according to the California Avocado Commission. Much of this was grown on family-owned farms in the south of the state. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Avocado trees grow near Valley Center in southern California Ventura County, which is California's largest growing region for avocados, has seen the worst of the fires with 180 square miles (466 sq km) consumed, according to officials. John Krist, chief executive of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, told Reuters news agency: ""A lot of that fruit everybody was looking forward to harvesting next year is lying on the ground."" Food safety regulations mean the crop cannot be sold once it falls from the tree. Media caption In California, entire neighbourhoods are fleeing The fires mean the upcoming harvest, which usually takes place in February or March, is likely to be smaller than usual. However experts say it too soon to assess the full extent of the damage. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"".

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People across northern California are snapping up masks to try to handle the smoke Northern California's air quality has become the worst in the world, according to monitoring groups, as the state battles devastating fires. Air quality network Purple Air said on Thursday the air is now worse than smoggy cities in India and China. Schools have cancelled classes, flights have been delayed, and internet searches for smoke masks are soaring. At least 63 people have died in the Camp Fire - the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze. The number of missing people has jumped to more than 600, local authorities said, doubling the size of the list in a day. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. How bad is the air? The AirNow website ranks the air around San Francisco and Oakland as ""very unhealthy"", meaning everyone in the area could experience more serious health effects. Around Elk Grove and Sacramento, it is classed as ""hazardous"" - the whole population is likely to be affected, their website states. A San Francisco Chronicle reporter tweeted that breathing in San Francisco was equivalent to smoking nearly a dozen cigarettes. In Paradise, which was destroyed by the wildfire, it is closer to smoking 22 cigarettes. Internet searches for smoke masks have reportedly skyrocketed, while schools and universities have cancelled classes and held recesses for students inside. Flights have also been affected. Health officials warned people to stay indoors rather than risk the smoke. ""Wearing a mask may encourage outdoor activity when staying indoors is the best way to minimize exposure to smoke,"" the Sacramento County Public Health Office said Butte County released advice for residents about how to handle the poor air quality. What's the latest on the firefighting operation? The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 45% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. Media caption California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son They are also battling several other fires, including the Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles and the smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County. The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Why are the fires burning? Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. What about climate change? Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, told the BBC there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he said. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" As fire seasons worsen worldwide, all the carbon released as smoke into the atmosphere could have a serious impact on climate change, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Massive, ravaging wildfires are now the norm on the West Coast, with the state of California now regularly breaking fire records, Canada’s British Columbia experiencing the third-worst fire season in recorded history, and all the smoke from those fires spreading across much of the continent and even further. But don’t worry, an area man has a plan, according to Global News, and that plan is blowing all the smoke from Canadian wildfires back up across the border with box fans. Per Global News’ report, Spokane, Washington resident Caleb Moon formed a Facebook event titled “ Blow Spokane’s Smoke Away to Canada.” It is impossible to believe that the August 24th event, which asks each of the city’s 550,000 to place “at least 5 box fans on their roof” to accomplish this, is anything but a joke. But Moon at least played it earnest in an interview with the network: The event may sound like a joke, but Moon said he’s serious about this. “We figure a small box fan can move smoke about six feet, so if you put 500,000 of them together, you can do the math on that, we can probably get it pretty far into Canada,” he said. British Columbia Centre for Disease Control senior environmental health specialist Sarah Henderson told Global News the idea was “very ridiculous,” noting that a fan does not magically clean air but “pulls air through it.” So even if it did work—which, again, it would not—the fans would probably just pull in fresh smoke from California. In any case, dumb plans for how to deal with the wildfires are kind of in vogue in the U.S. right now. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has spent much of the past few weeks rambling about how the fires are caused by anything from poor forest management to “environmental terrorists” and definitely not climate change, as is agreed to be a major factor by experts. Donald Trump has blamed the fires on “ bad environmental laws ” preventing firefighters from just spraying them with water, which is complete nonsense but nonetheless served as a pretext for the White House to seize control of protected California waterways and open up more federal lands to logging.

TIM ARANGO,"Every fire is investigated, and as wildfire seasons have grown worse, California has been more aggressive in holding people accountable — either with criminal charges for arson or negligence, as with Mr. Martinez, or, if there is a deep-pocketed culprit, with a lawsuit to recoup costs from fighting the fires. In the summer of 2013, a wildfire broke out in Riverside County and grew to threaten the desert resort town of Palm Springs. No one was killed, but it took thousands of firefighters, and almost $26 million, to put it out. Investigators found the blaze started with a faulty electrical box on a private property. Lawsuits in both state and federal court against the owner, a wealthy Saudi businessman, are still pending, although the state case may be resolved soon by mediation, according to the Idyllwild Town Crier, a newspaper in the area where the fire occurred. “Our civil cost recovery is definitely something we do on a regular basis,” Ms. Tolmachoff said. “Ninety-five percent of these fires are caused by humans and they could have been prevented somehow.” Last year the state saw what was then its biggest wildfire in recorded history — the Thomas Fire, in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties — and its most destructive, the Tubbs Fire in Northern California’s wine country. The causes of both fires are still under investigation, but some lawsuits point the finger at the power companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. And in several other Northern California fires last year, Cal Fire determined that faulty power lines were the cause. In the aftermath of those fires, California’s power companies have received close scrutiny from the State Legislature. “They talk about climate change,” said Steve Campora, a Sacramento lawyer who has made a career of suing utility companies on behalf of fire victims. “And climate change makes it more difficult to control the fire. But climate change does not cause ignition.” Edward Struzik, a fellow at the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy in Ontario and the author of “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” said he believes fires will continue to get worse, year by year, through a combination of climate change and human activity. “There is no end in sight for this fire activity,” he said. Referring to the human causes of wildfire, he added that “education is still a really big problem. There are many people who are oblivious to the dangers and volatility of forests.”","Firefighters battled the Mendocino Complex Fire this month.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Los Angeles PD Image caption Burned out areas from wildfires are more susceptible to flooding and mudflow At least two people are dead amid mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off, US media report. ""Waist-deep"" mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal highway, officials say. Emergency crews are working to rescue multiple people trapped in vehicles and homes, a Santa Barbara official said. At least eight people were injured and thousands have fled ahead of the rain. Heavy rain run-off caused waist-deep mudflow in the Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Huber told the newspaper two people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months. Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion (£226 billion) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9 inches (23 cm) in select areas.

Morgan Sung,"When two bears suffered painful burns while escaping Southern California's wildfires, veterinarians used an unconventional bandage to treat the animals' paws: fish skin. The bears, along with a young mountain lion with less severe burns, were treated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife after the Thomas Fire burned through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The wildfires that swept through California in late 2017 were the worst in the state's history. The Thomas Fire was the largest ever recorded, burning through 273,400 acres. According to a statement by the CDFW, the bears' injuries were severe, with ""oozing wounds, and, in some cases, paw pads that were completely burned off."" SEE ALSO: Californians band together to save horses from wildfires Deana Clifford, senior wildlife veterinarian at the CDFW, and Jamie Peyton, chief of integrative medicine at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis treated the animals by using fresh tilapia skin instead of traditional bandages. Peyton sutured tilapia skin directly onto the bears' paws. Image: California department of fish and wildlife They opted to use fish skin because its collagen levels and moisture retention abilities are similar to human skin. Researchers in Brazil have used fish skin, in favor of human skin grafts, to bandage burn victims, but the practice hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans in the United States. After applying a homemade salve to speed up healing, Peyton and Clifford cut grafts of sterilized tilapia skin and sutured them directly onto the animals' paws while they were under anesthesia. To prevent them from eating the fish skin, they wrapped the animals' paws in corn husks and rice paper. (The mountain lion ended up eating his, anyway.) SEE ALSO: How to help victims of the Southern California wildfires “One of the first things that the bear did was stand up after we applied them,” Peyton said in a statement released by UC Davis. “She was more mobile, which in my mind is a huge success for pain control.” Veterinarians wrapped the animals' paws in corn husks and rice paper to prevent them from eating the fish skin grafts. Image: california department of fish and wildlife Although the animals received three treatments over the course of a month, Peyton told Mashable that the path to recovery was ""fraught with more challenges."" Unlike with treating domestic pets, it wasn't possible to clean, care, and bandage wounds on a daily basis. She said it was also more difficult to manage their pain with medications, and that they had to deal with ""a time crunch to get them back to the wild as soon as possible."" ""Despite these challenges our therapies helped these animals recover faster than we have noted in some companion animals,"" Peyton said, ""The use of the tilapia skin bandages made a remarkable difference in their pain control and healing ability."" The bears also received acupuncture, which has been administered to pets for years. Peyton said the treatment was similar to that given to dogs and cats. ""The principles of pain management and wound healing are similar across many species,"" she said. One of the bears shortly before she was released back into the wild. Image: California department of fish and wildlife To complicate recovery even more, the doctors discovered that one of the bears was pregnant during a routine ultrasound. “That was a game changer for us, because we knew it wouldn’t be ideal for her to give birth in confinement,” Clifford said in CDFW's statement. “We aren’t really set up to have a birth at the lab holding facilities, and we knew there was a high probability that she could reject the cub, due to all the stress she was under. We needed to get her back into the wild as quickly as possible.” The CDFW team built winter dens so the bears could wake up in safety. Image: california department of fish and wildlife Since the bears' natural habitats were destroyed during the fire, officials from the CDFW built winter dens for each of the animals to sleep in and be protected from danger. The team released them into the wild on Wednesday and plan on monitoring the rest of their recovery via satellite. Peyton doesn't see fish skin becoming a standard treatment for human burn victims in the United States because there are multiple skin graft banks that have the resources to treat patients. However, she does believe there may be more demand for alternatives like tilapia skin in countries with fewer banks and less readily available resources. ""I think we definitely need more research in this area to determine if it will be used more extensively in people,"" Peyton said. ""Based on what we have seen in these animals, there is potential for this to be a more commonly used therapy in the future.""","When two bears suffered painful burns while escaping Southern California's wildfires, veterinarians used an unconventional bandage to treat the animals' paws: fish skin.

Mark Kaufman,"Newly-born fires torched bone-dry Northern and Southern California throughout the night of November 8. One deadly blaze in particular, the Camp Fire, ripped through 70,000 acres in just 24 hours. ""It's incredible,"" Michael Gollner, a fire scientist at the University of Maryland, said of the uncontrollable Northern California wildfire. ""I dont know if I want to say unprecedented but it's getting close to that. It's incredibly rare."" ""That blows your mind,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, said in an interview. "" That impresses us in the industry."" While the Camp Fire nearly burned the entire town of Paradise to the ground, residents in heavily-populated Southern California documented their nighttime escapes from falling embers and glowing hillsides. The Woolsey and Hill fires have now burned through 14,000 acres, with thousands of residents receiving urgent nighttime evacuation messages via text. In both the north and south of the parched Golden State, the rapidly-evolving circumstances are similar: profoundly dried-out land with the arrival of persistently dry, gusty winds. ""Then all you need is a spark,"" said Belongie. Clouds of smoke seen from Hermosa Beach, California. Image: susan kaufman Although fires are complex environmental phenomena driven (and exacerbated) by weather, U.S. fires in the last couple decades have been burning at least twice as much land than in the early 1980s, and they've been burning for weeks not days longer. A warmer climate means more dry, flame-susceptible vegetation. ""These fires are going to be happening more often,"" noted Gollner. ""That blows your mind"" The California fire season should be nearing its end. Typically, by mid-October the season dies down as the first rains will make the grasses and forests less likely to burn particularly in Northern California. But not this year. ""We are still very much in fire season,"" said Belongie. ""It's just one fire after another."" The Camp Fire, barely contained as of Friday morning, is the continuation of a historic fire season in the heavily-forested northern part of the state. In July, the Carr Fire after jumping the Sacramento River grew into a towering, spinning vortex of flame. SEE ALSO: The EPA completely axed its climate change websites. But why are NASA's still live? Northern California has now seen a record number of acres burned during a fire season, Belongie said. That's around 150 percent of the previous record, she noted. The now-raging Camp Fire has exploited exceptionally dried-out forests and grasses. In some portions of Northern California, forests are now as dry as they were during the peak summer fire season, when temperatures were in the triple digits. It's now well into November, and parched forests are at their seasonal records for dryness, with some setting new records. ""This is a huge deal,"" said Belongie. For a few weeks now, California forests have been increasingly dried-out by strong, dry winds, blowing from the north and east so fire experts expected flames. And through the night, east-blowing winds blew persistent gusts through much of the state. The dry stage was set. ""Unfortunately, it's not unexpected,"" said Gollner. And Westerners can expect similar circumstances in the future. Once these large fires start, there's little that can be done to stop them even our massive fire-retardant dropping aircraft have little effect. ""The airplanes arent going to do very much once the fire grows to this enormous size,"" said Gollner. With this modern reality, society needs to prepare, emphasized Gollner. For instance, it's now imperative that flame-vulnerable communities reduce vegetation near their homes, so communities aren't met with 100-foot tall walls of flame. We can't stop the flames but we can make them manageable. ""It's not about making it a black-top all around,"" said Gollner. ""It's about reducing the fuel over the land so we dont have this really high risk next to our homes."" But for now, fire managers just want this particular season to just end. ""This is an endless fire season,"" said Belongie.","Newly-born fires torched bone-dry Northern and Southern California throughout the night of November 8.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Humboldt marten was once a denizen of vast swaths of old growth forests in Northern California and Southern Oregon. But rampant logging has shrunken its habitat, pushing the objectively adorable little predator into small isolated populations and amplifying other threats, like cannabis growth and wildfires. On Tuesday, conservation groups petitioned Oregon for both state and federal protections for the furry mammals under the Endangered Species Act in the hopes that they’ll have a fighting chance. The roughly 400-strong subspecies has already been flirting with extinction for quite some time. “Small isolated populations are at really high risks of becoming extinct,” Tiarra Curry, senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity, which submitted the petition, told Earther. “To save them, we have to create habitat corridors of appropriate forest habitats to reconnect the population.” The picture is looking pretty dismal: Only four remote populations of the kitten-sized creature remain—two in the state of California and two in Oregon—each pocket with fewer than 100 animals. Currently, neither state has regulations in place to protect it save a trapping ban in California. Today’s remaining Humboldt martens face numerous threats. The cannabis industry has already been known to contribute to deforestation and habitat loss in California. But as the Guardian noted in a recent article, illegal marijuana cultivation also poses a threat to the small weasel-like animals, destroying their homes and introducing rodenticides into forest food webs. Now that the marten is trapped in small patches of habitat, populations are increasingly at risk from wildfires, too. According to Curry, this wouldn’t have been a problem historically. But a a 2017 wildfire tore down dense forests separating the northernmost population in California from the southernmost population in Oregon. Other threats abound in Oregon. The state’s highly localized populations are susceptible to any environmental or man-made threat, including cars speeding down the highway that runs by the coastal dunes where they live. “Anything that affects this little strip of habitat could wipe them out,” Curry said. Incredibly, the Guardian reports it is still legal to trap Humboldt martens in Oregon where the animal’s glossy mink-like pelt sells for about $20 each. This is not the first time conservation groups have pushed for the marten to be granted threatened species protections in Oregon state. A 2010 petition to list the subspecies was denied by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, leading to a lawsuit against the agency in 2015 and an overturning of the decision. While it’s unclear what Oregon will decide this time around, in California, the Humboldt marten’s prospects are looking a bit brighter this week. According to the Guardian, the state has already announced its intention to list the animal as an endangered species. We’re reached out to the California Fish and Game Department for confirmation and will update if we hear back.

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The huge wildfires across California in recent weeks have underlined what fire experts describe as the new normal for the state. But firefighters say it’s more than just the scale and the timing of the fires that is different. Chris Anthony, a division chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says fire behavior appears to be changing on a more micro level. One example: In mountainous terrain, fires typically run much faster uphill as the fire heats the fuels above it, making them more readily combustible. But Mr. Anthony says his firefighters are seeing more examples of fires running fast downhill, too. Another example: Firefighters for decades were accustomed to seeing fires slow down considerably at night, said Scott L. Stephens, a professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley. But a number of recent fires have continued to advance rapidly through the night. “Many times now in the evening fires are burning at night almost as active as they are in the day,” Professor Stephens said. “Things are happening here in California that 10 years ago I never heard about.”","Friday: Changes in fire behavior and what they mean for us, “Game of Thrones” gets 22 Emmy nods, and Boltman is up for auction on eBay.",2018-07-13T12:34:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Here’s What’s Been Different About Fires This Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/california-today-wildfires-emmys.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/world/13caltoday1/13caltoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
"Anna Merlan on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","This month, California has been gripped by three devastating wildfires: Northern Californias Camp Fire, which recently became the deadliest in the states history, and, in Southern California, the Woolsey and Hill Fires. An emerging, deeply weird conspiracy theory holds that those fires arent caused by wind patterns, brutally dry conditions, the worsening effects of climate change, or possible downed power lines, but by a sinister scheme directed by nefarious elements within the government. The claim, being taken up by an increasing number of people in QAnon circles, is that the fires are caused by directed energy weaponsthat is, government-directed lasers bent on destroying homes, property, and lives. And if recent history is any judge, theres a chance the countrys biggest conspiracy-peddlers, up to and including the one who lives in the White House, will take up the cause. Directed energy weapons, or DEWs, have an interesting place in conspiratorial circles. DEWs are, to begin with, a real technology, but one still in its infancy: a report produced for Congress describes that term as an umbrella to refer to technologies that produce concentrated electromagnetic energy and atomic or subatomic particles. The consensus is that there are a number of logistical issues to work out before that the U.S. government will be able to build a laser system that would actually be workable on a battlefield, but that the Department of Defense and private contractors are eager to leverage laser power towards killing people and/or destroying enemy missiles, aircrafts, or satellites. If you ask people in the deep end of the conspiracy theory pool, though, DEWs are here already. Theres a small body of people who believe themselves to be targeted individualsstalked, harassed, and attacked by the government or other shadowy groupsand at least some of them believe those attacks are being carried out by DEWs. Now, through a strange confluence of forces, the paranoia over DEWs is making its way into the discussion about natural disasters. What were seeing is a convergence of longstanding American fears about government mind control and manipulation of the weather merging with climate change skepticism, as climate science becomes ever-more-politicized. Like many conspiracy theories, its not entirely possible to trace where the DEW theories came from. As best I can tell, one of the earliest promoters of that claim was a flat-earth YouTuber going by the name ODD Reality (real name Matt Procella), who started talking about DEWs during the devastating wildfires that raged across California in October 2017. Youll notice here that stores and restaurants are wiped out, while other things are still in perfect shape, Procella intones, over still images of fire damage, some of them sourced, he says, from a Serbian conspiracy site (and some of which appear to be computer-generated). Other buildings are fine, trees are untouched, but specific structures are just devastated. You gotta ask yourself, whats up with that... Is this the result of direct energy weapons? Ranged weapons that inflict damage on a target by emitting highly-focused energy? The answer is most likely yes. Theres actually a fair amount of research to explain why some structures are destroyed and some are spared during a wildfire that has nothing to do with laser weapons. But the broader point Procella is trying to make is about intent: Someone is deliberately destroying certain buildings. That point, though, gets a little mushy. He speculates that all these things are a distraction from the Vegas incident, by which he means the mass shooting in Las Vegas that month that killed 58 people. Elsewhere, the question of why the government would spend its time pointing lasers at peoples houses and Burger Kings has been made somewhat clearer. The left-leaning March Against Monsanto site, which often engages in conspiracy theorizing about GMOs, ran a speculative article about DEW s, reasoning that they could be just another form of government manipulation. People who believe in chemtrails are also concerned about DEWs, and have a more fully fleshed-out explanation for what theyre meant to do. (Chemtrails are harmless condensation trails left by aircrafts, but since the late 1990s, a conspiratorial community has been raising concerns that theyre actually toxic, potentially mind-controlling chemicals.) On one chemtrail-oriented site, Chemtrail Planet, an unnamed author speculates that last years fires were part of a joint plan by FEMA and the United Nations to institute more centralized global control, what they called Agenda 30. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is actually a resolution passed in 2015 by the General Assembly, promising to do a host of things to make the world better by 2030, including taking urgent action on climate change. Like every UN action, conspiracy theorists claim its mean to institute a centralized one-world government, and like always, that is not true. Theres also evidence that DEWs are becoming part of the cosmology of the QAnon crowd, a remarkably pliant group who have proven that theyre able to incorporate just about anything into their belief system. (QAnon, for the uninitiated, is the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is secretly doing a really good job, and is this close to uncovering and disarming various evil forces working against him within the government.) The hashtag #DEW has begun to show up in QAnon-oriented Twitter conversations, with several much-retweeted Tweets imploring Trump to take action. Yet another version of the DEWs story claims that the wildfires were directed in such a way to destroy structures in order to make way for a high-speed rail system, part of a Democrat plot. Thats right: the government is destroying vast swaths of trees, houses and infrastructure to force people to ride the train. That tweeted idea is also tagged with several QAnon-related hashtags. Inevitably, the conspiracy theory is migrating to bigger and bigger accounts. On Thursday, a far-right internet personality and QAnon booster named Mike Tokes, who has 170,000 Twitter followers, aggressively took up the cause, using the same line of argument: some homes burned, others didnt, thus lasers must be at work. The DEW theory is inextricably tied to skepticism about the very idea of climate change, a sense that global warming is just the cover explanation for the various sinister plots at work against us. Its also, of course, tied to longstanding conspiracy theories about the government controlling the weather, such as the idea that the government already has a weather control tool called HAARP, which it also uses for electromagnetic warfare. (HAARP is actually a much less exciting research program that studies the uppermost levels of our atmosphere and was years run by the Air Force and University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since 2015, UAF has run it alone, albeit on Air Force land, and has produced a very patient FAQ explaining that HAARP does not exert mind control over people.) Weather and climate conspiracists are, though, not a big group of people, says John Cook, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University who also runs a site called Skeptical Science that outlines the shoddy science and arguments behind global warming skepticism. Climate change conspiracy theories may seem more popular but theyre still very marginal, Cook told Earther. The proportion of the US public who are dismissive about climate change is about nine percent. You dont want to overstate their importance because that can have a negative effect. That said, there may well be a broader swath of the public that is open to conspiracy theories and denialism, if not hardcore about them. For instance, a survey on chemtrails from last year that found up to 30 percent of people polled thought they may be somewhat real. And recent polls show most U.S. Republicans still believe global warming concerns are exaggerated, and that the partisan divide on the issue is growing. Climate change skepticism and other, more out-there forms of conspiracy theorizing about the weather have a few things in common, Cook said. There is a similarity in that its trying to make sense of disturbing events by imaging these patterns. But theres also an important distinction. Climate conspiracy theories tend to be an attempt to explain why theres a scientific consensus on climate change, usually by invoking a vast conspiracy among the worlds climate scientists. Whereas space laser wildfires arekind of Cook paused for a moment, politely. Theyre an isolated single event thing, he finished. As opposed to a more systematic, holistic explanation of the whole climate. Social media, particularly Twitter, has inarguably helped the spread of conspiracy theories about the climate, Cook said. He and his colleagues have studied how to inoculate people against misinformation (and even made a handy video about it), but he admits its an uphill battle. Its difficult, he said. Conspiracy theories are the hardest thing to counter. Theyre so nihilistic, and any attempt to rebut them is seen as more evidence of the conspiracy theory. But the general rule is the way to counter the myth is to replace it with a stickier fact. One issue, Cook said, is that conspiracy theories can cause people to shut down and stop looking for whats true: Theres a danger that theyll disengage and just stop believing in facts. And the facts are plenty terrifying on their own: These fires have already been hellaciously destructive, the deadliest in a century or more, with at least 63 people dead in the Camp Fire alone, three more killed in the Woolsey fire, more than 600 missing, thousands of acres burned, homes destroyed and lives devastated. The president is already engaged in smears and misinformation, bizarrely claiming that forest management was to blame for fires that didnt even originate in forests. Though the causes of the fires are still under investigation, theres evidence that a downed PG&amp;E power line could have potentially sparked the Camp Fire. Theres evidence that public policy and regulation simply arent working, given that PG&amp;E electrical equipment was found responsible for 17 of 21 wildfires in Northern California last fall, and that climate change is only making the situation worse. And theres deep inequality at work, given that working-class communities like Paradise are all but destroyed, while wealthier areas are able to hire their own firefighters to battle the blazes.

And if those facts arent deemed worthy of engagementif people instead retreat into fantasy and rumor and innuendotheres the fact that the next fire isnt far away.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“We want people to remain vigilant. It’s still an active fire but we have a lot of firefighters working on the ground,” Ms. Wilkolak said. “But yes, we’re optimistic that we’re making progress.” Although some evacuations were being lifted near Redding on Monday, the city remained covered in a thick smog that largely obscured the sun. Thin layers of ash accumulated on vehicles overnight, and flecks continued to fall throughout the day, as far as at least 60 miles away. Ms. Catalani, 69, evacuated on Thursday night after police officers informed her and her neighbors that their homes, in an area just outside Redding, were in a high risk zone. She left with her landlord, Dan Markham, 83, and two other roommates; the four spent their first night sleeping in a gas station parking lot. Mr. Markham said that after so many days in the shelter, he was growing a bit anxious and eager to go home. Ms. Catalani was concerned about several of her pets, whom she was unable to evacuate. They both said that they were grateful the ash had subsided, and that the heat was tamer on Monday, giving them an opportunity to spend a little time outside. The soot on the table from the fires was piled high. To keep their spirits up. they doted on a pug named Winston, who they said had become the shelter’s “unofficial mascot.” Ms. Catalani and Mr. Markham praised various aid organizations, and lauded the generosity of their fellow Redding neighbors, who have helped with food and clothing donations. “They’ve been awesome. They’ve just been awesome to us,” Ms. Catalani said.","Roughly 37,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in recent days as wildfires raged, many of them finding temporary refuge in one of five shelters in Redding.",2018-07-30T23:13:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘All That Matters Is We’re Alive’: California Fire Evacuees Crowd Into Shelters,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/us/carr-fires-california.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/31/us/31fire1-print/31fire1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Carr fire has burned through an area larger than the city of San Francisco California's deadliest current wildfire is getting larger, officials warn, despite thousands of firefighters battling it. ""Erratic winds"" and dry conditions have caused the Carr fire to grow early on Sunday, firefighters said. It is one of eight major wildfires currently burning in the state. The fire, in the Shasta County in northern California, has killed six people so far, including two children and their great-grandmother. Melody Bledsoe, 70, Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died when they were caught in its path as they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, about 150 miles (240km) north of Sacramento, on Thursday. A fourth body was found on Sunday. Two firefighters also lost their lives on Thursday. A third firefighter died battling the Ferguson fire, near Yosemite, earlier this month. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years The Carr fire, which doubled in size overnight on Friday, was only 5% contained by Sunday morning. It has already burnt more than 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land and destroyed at least 500 structures. It began on Monday. On Thursday it became a firestorm, jumping across the Sacramento River, according to news agency Reuters. California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters they were ""seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 12,000 firefighters working to contain blazes across California ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways"". A total of 38,000 people have been evacuated from Shasta County. California's Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in the area, as well as three others. US President Donald Trump has approved federal aid for the counties. The Carr is the largest of eight big fires burning in California, and 90 across the country, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There are currently 12,000 firefighters battling the flames across the state. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However, experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Los Angeles Times much of the state's vegetation had reached ""explosively dry"" levels. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

MATT STEVENS,"On Wednesday morning, at a time when many in the sports world have been outspoken in opposition to him, Mr. Trump asked on Twitter whether credit would be given where it seemed to be due: Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 15, 2017 As it turned out, yes. At a news conference Wednesday, the players in separate statements thanked the president and expressed contrition. They took no questions. Coach Steve Alford announced that they were suspended from the team indefinitely, and Mr. Guerrero disclosed that they had in fact shoplifted from three stores during 90 minutes of what Mr. Guerrero called “free time, if you will.” Writing a few days ago in The Daily Bruin, columnist Hanson Wang predicted the leniency with which China’s criminal justice system treated the players, noting that the drunken driver who had killed his own grandfather in China six years ago had received a prison sentence of four months. Mr. Wang demanded that U.C.L.A. suspend the players for at least the entire season, in order to “send the message that no player — or players — can be let off the hook for violating foreign laws and making a fool out of the school, the Pac-12 and the U.S.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

And in a city that continues to serve as a national naval hub, the perk remains popular as ever. More than 100,000 active duty members of the military visited the world-renowned zoo in 2016 alone. But seeing the elephants is more expensive these days. An adult ticket costs $52, and as the zoo’s chief development officer said, “no one can predict the future” — or guarantee that the zoo’s revenue will always be steady. So, last weekend, officials were happy to announce what the development officer, Mark Stuart, called a “transformational” gift from an army veteran and his wife. The donation, the exact size of which officials did not disclose, will guarantee that active duty armed forces personnel can go to the San Diego Zoo and its safari park for free — forever.

Back Story “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” the first Hollywood film to portray a kiss between a black man and a white woman, was released 50 years ago this week. It came out only six months after Loving v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court case that struck down laws against mixed marriages in 16 states. Photo Their kiss was a milestone: Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.” Set against the backdrop of the civil rights era, the film — in which a white woman introduces her black fiancé to her parents — didn’t strike hard enough against racism, some critics said. The star, Sidney Poitier, was already a hit with white audiences, and he played a charming, Yale-educated doctor. Our review noted that “in a burst of incisive recognition that might also characterize the blue-chip film,” one character says, “Civil rights is one thing but this here is something else.” Even so, the film was a milestone for race relations in America, and it embodies how times have changed. The same year, the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, offered to resign if his daughter’s marriage to a black man caused embarrassment to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Their wedding photo later appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Charles McDermid contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

Tim Chester,"The rains have finally come to Southern California after months of bone dry weather and multiple wildfires, but they're not helping the previously parched state. In fact, the deluge has created treacherous conditions in several regions, sparking evacuation orders in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties and leaving at least five people dead. SEE ALSO: Thomas Fire becomes largest blaze in California history, during state's worst fire year A combination of heavy rain and scarred vegetation after last fall's huge blazes have created mudslides in a number of places. Montecito was one of the worst hit regions, with many homes simply washed away. The 101 freeway, which leads north from LA into Santa Barbara County, was closed north of Ventura — an area hit hard by last year's Thomas Fire. Some lanes on the infamous 405 near the Getty Center in LA were also closed due to a mud and rock slide. Cars in the region were seen caked up to their rims in sludge. Firefighters, meanwhile, shared images of dramatic rescues, including the safe removal of a 14-year-old girl from a collapsed home and another young person from a wide mudslide. Radar images posted by the Los Angeles National Weather Service on Tuesday morning showed more rain showers organizing on the coast near the Thomas Fire area, which could exacerbate an already tough situation. The National Weather Service outpost in Los Angeles says more showers will hit the Santa Barbara area throughout Tuesday.","The rains have finally come to Southern California after months of bone dry weather and multiple wildfires, but they're not helping the previously parched state.

Mark Kaufman,"Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast. They're escaping the smoke. Davis, California, sits amid a layer of wildfire smoke in Northern California. To the northwest, the largest fire in state history, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn. To the southeast, the Ferguson Fire has closed down smoke-choked Yosemite National Park indefinitely. And to the North, the Carr Fire, infamous for its towering fire tornado, still burns. SEE ALSO: California just had its hottest month on record, and that means more wildfires The air quality in the region around the fires — whose spread has been enhanced by extreme heat parching the land — is some of the worst in the world. ""I decided to go out to the coast for a couple days because it was so ridiculous,"" Wexler said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service illustrated how winds have lifted bounties of smoke across the entire U.S., bringing pollution even beyond the East Coast. Smoke from the western fires is making it all the way to the East Coast and beyond (at least aloft—mostly above a mile above the surface). Here's the vertically integrated smoke (HRRR model from last night). Another map showed some smoke near the surface even in New England. pic.twitter.com/0Jl6WDAFjg — NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) August 8, 2018 That said, it's not as if these smoke particles are harmful to those on the East Coast. By the time that smoke arrives in Boston and New York, the particles have been diluted with fresh air, and certainly can't be seen, nor are concentrations unhealthy. It's normal for pollution to waft from west to east across the country, just like pollution from China is regularly transported over the Pacific Ocean into the U.S. That's how air generally moves over the Northern Hemisphere, said Wexler. But it's much rarer for even low concentrations of smoke to find their way across the nation. ""It doesn’t happen every day,"" Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab, said in an interview. ""But, it can happen."" ""Normally, the pollution isn’t so great that it’s noticeable when it gets east,"" added Wexler. But just how bad is the air pollution in large regions of the West? ""It's been like a reasonably decent day in Beijing,"" said Wexler. ""That's really telling. It’s really awful there."" ""It’s unbelievable,"" said Pfister. She noted that planes flying over the area, as part of a National Science Foundation-funded wildfire study, have picked up some alarming pollution numbers. It's expected that particulate matter — tiny fragments of pollution 30 times thinner than a human hair — would be bad. But the flights even picked up abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be dangerous to human health in enclosed spaces, and at worse, lethal. However, some of the measured values around the fires are about 5 parts per million, or ppm, which are not considered nearly dangerous — but it's still telling. ""These are values you don’t typically find near the surface in the U.S.,"" said Pfister. ""Maybe you’ll find that if you stick your head into the exhaust of a car."" It's not carbon monoxide, however, that people in burning regions need to be concerned about. One of the main factors that's figured into air quality ratings is particulate matter. Both U.S. government and university researchers have repeatedly shown that breathing this stuff is bad for your heart, as it accelerates plaque build-up in blood vessels. In some areas of Oregon, the Air Quality Index currently registers as ""Hazardous."" In Redding, California, where a fire tornado spun for 80 minutes last week, the air quality is rated as ""Unhealthy."" But out near the windswept coast, like in San Francisco, the air quality is ""Good."" It's likely that the West will be intermittently blanketed in unhealthy to hazardous air for months ahead, as the fire season is not nearly over. Rains aren't expected for months, and more temperature and fire records might be broken. Many Westerners aren't near the fires themselves. But it's harder to outrun the smoke. ""In my experience, it's never been this bad,"" said Wexler.","Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast.

Back Story Many Americans awoke last week to news that most Britons, several time zones ahead, had heard first: Prince Harry and his American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, were engaged. But when King Edward VIII gave up the throne in December 1936 to marry an American, England was seemingly the last to know. Photo The former King Edward VIII, then the Duke of Windsor, and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in France in June 1937. Credit Associated Press The British news media largely blacked out coverage of Edward’s yearslong affair with the American socialite Wallis Simpson, who by that time was divorcing her second husband. Pages were reportedly even torn from foreign magazines, which were writing freely about the couple. The average Briton was unprepared for the looming constitutional crisis when the affair was publicly revealed and Parliament refused to allow the marriage. As The Times wrote, “Public in London Is Bewildered.” In a changed world, the royal family has struggled against the intrusive media attention, particularly in the marriage and divorce of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and in Diana’s death. But Harry and his brother, William, have tried to establish a respectful relationship with the news media ( despite the occasional warning ). Ultimately, the news of Harry and Ms. Markle’s engagement received a far warmer reception than that of Edward, the brother of Harry’s great-grandfather.

THOMAS FULLER,"“The whole idea was that the city was being controlled by developers,” Mr. Duskin said. “We said, ‘Is this the future you want? Is this where you want to raise your kids?’” Both initiatives failed, but Mr. Duskin says the threat of further votes against skyscrapers led city officials to impose height limits in residential areas. Mr. Duskin continued his career as an activist, campaigning against nuclear power and promoting wind energy. Today he speaks longingly of the days when rents were cheap and people came from all over the country to pursue careers as poets, authors and artists in San Francisco. He reminisces about ample parking and whiling away afternoons at cafes where friends like Lenny Bruce or Dick Gregory would stop by to chat. He rarely travels into San Francisco any more. “It’s lost its livability for people who aren’t devoted just to making money, its livability for people who want to do creative things in the arts,” he said. “It’s over for me.

"THOMAS FULLER, KIRK JOHNSON and CONOR DOUGHERTY","One possible solution, she said, would be for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide trailers that people could live in while their homes were being rebuilt.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Both ends of California are on fire. While firefighters battle the Camp Fire in Northern California, their compatriots in Southern California are facing an equally harrowing situation. Spurred by the Santa Ana winds, the Woolsey and Hill fires are wreaking havoc just north of Los Angeles with an estimated 75,000 homes under evacuation orders. The number is likely to rise as winds conditions pick up again on Friday. The twin blazes began in Ventura County on Thursday, forcing widespread evacuations in a region reeling from a deadly mass shooting earlier this week. As of late Thursday night, the Woolsey Fire had burned 7,500 acres and the Hill Fire was up to 10,000 acres. Both are running completely wild with zero percent containment as flames race up and down the steep hillsides. Powerful Santa Ana winds blasting up to 60 mph have made conditions even worse. The winds are annual occurrence in Southern California. As they flow from east to west, rolling down the mountains and into valleys, the air they move becomes compressed. That heats it up and dries it out, which in turn can create dangerous fire conditions. Pile that on top of a severe drought thats gripped the region for months, creating loads of fire fuel, and you have a recipe for the disaster currently unfolding. Mandatory evacuations went up overnight in large parts of Ventura County. The countys fire department reported that there were 30,000 people under evacuation orders, many forced to flee in the dead of night. The evacuation orders have spread to Los Angeles County as firefighters have been unable to keep pace with the fires racing across the landscape. The Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway on Friday morning and began to descend on the multi-million dollar homes of Malibu. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted that it posed an [i]mminent threat! Fire season is changing in Southern California in a variety of ways that are not good. That includes the global warming rigamarole every corner of the planet is dealing with to bizarre local impacts like the region losing its cooling cloud cover. Add in densely populated areas like Malibu and, well, you have a trappings of a very, very bad situation. Update November 9, 12:31 p.m. ET: Local officials held a press conference to update reporters on the state of the Woolsey and Hill fires. Los Angeles County Chief Deputy David Richardson said there are more than 2,000 firefighters currently battling the blazes in Southern California and that up to 60,000 homes could see mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders over the course of the day. If you have a mandatory evacuation order, leave., Linda Parks, a Ventura County Supervisor, said. We dont want any tragedies, any deaths, any injuries. In addition to the challenging conditions, theres also a resource challenge. Firefighters are being stretched thin between these fires and the Camp Fire, making it tough to set a proper fire line. Thats in part why the Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway and Malibu is being evacuated. The perimeter now is the Pacific Ocean, Richardson said.","Both ends of California are on fire.

TIM ARANGO,"The Camp Fire, which tore through Paradise and its surroundings last week, has become the deadliest wildfire in modern California history, with at least 48 people confirmed dead so far. Another three people were killed in the Woolsey Fire, which raced through the mountains of Southern California near Malibu. With so many still unaccounted for and investigators scouring the ruins of Paradise and collecting DNA samples from relatives of the missing, the identities of many more victims are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. On Tuesday night, the Butte County sheriff, Kory Honea, said the number of missing was in the hundreds. The department has released a list with 103 names on it, which in no way is a list of everybody, said a spokesman for the department, Megan McCann. Among those unaccounted for, although not on the list, is Mr. Burt, Ms. Loos stepbrother. I dont have confirmation, she said. What I do have confirmation of is that he was last seen trying to help, or get help, for my dad to get him into their van, and failing at it. They just didnt make it. I cant imagine that he is alive, but we have not stopped looking. We are still calling the shelters every day. We are calling the hospitals every day. Mr. Foss is among a handful of the victims whose names have been released, as authorities slowly add to the roster of the dead.

JILLIAN RAYFIELD,"Why it matters: The surprise decision threatens to derail Mrs. Mays exit plan, which cabinet ministers had reluctantly approved on Wednesday. If the discontent spreads, her leadership position could be in danger. Investigators are trying to piece together the origins of the deadly Camp Fire, which has killed at least 56 people. Experts usually begin looking for the source of such blazes with the premise that humans are responsible, but their efforts will be severely hampered in a town like Paradise, which has been mostly destroyed. As the current fires rage, officials have determined that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company was responsible for at least 17 of 21 major fires in Northern California last fall. The utility, one of the states biggest, revealed that it could face crippling liability bills, potentially leaving customers on the hook for billions. A continuing search: Local officials released a list of those they cant find. The victims: Ernie Foss, a musician from San Francisco, was among those confirmed dead. As Florida recounts votes county by county, one major issue of contention is unclear signatures on ballots, particularly those that were mailed in. Thousands were rejected because the signature on the ballot did not exactly match whats on file. Democrats have argued that the rejections are disenfranchisement, and lawsuits have followed. Young peoples ballots are the ones most often thrown out, with some speculating that they dont use their own handwriting enough to develop a consistent signature. Some research has also shown that signatures change as people age or become ill, or if they are in a rush.","Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the Camp Fire, which mostly destroyed the town of Paradise, Calif.",2018-11-15T10:48:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Facebook, California Wildfires, Michael Avenatti: Your Thursday Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/briefing/facebook-california-wildfires-michael-avenatti.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/world/15USBriefing-Amcore/15USBriefing-Fire-new-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1

Paul Hockenos,"Paul Hockenos is the author of ""Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin."" The opinions in this article belong solely to the author. (CNN) This summer's sizzling temperatures, savage droughts, raging wildfires, floods and acute water shortages -- from Japan to the Arctic Circle, California to Greece -- are surely evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that the climate crisis is upon us now. This is the new normal -- until it gets worse. We, the entire global community, the residents of this planet, must finally grasp the urgency at hand and undertake dramatic, meaningful measures -- initiatives beyond the modest goals of 2015 Paris climate accord -- to stave off nothing less than the destruction of civilization as we know it. This may sound hyperbolic, but it's mainstream opinion among serious scientists worldwide: Climate change, unchecked, will eventually wipe out our race -- and man-made greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. An open letter signed by 15,000 international scientists last year read in part: ""Soon it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out. We must recognize, in our day-to-day lives and in our governing institutions, that Earth with all its life is our only home,"" the letter warns. ""Since 1992, carbon emissions have increased 62 percent,"" said William Ripple of Oregon State University's College of Forestry, who initiated the letter. ""And the global average temperature change has paralleled that. Also since 1992, we have two billion more people on Earth, which is a 35 percent increase."" In his epic tome ""Collapse,"" the American physicist Jared Diamond attributes the decline and extinction of several historical civilizations, among them the Maya and the Inca, to climate change, overpopulation and incompetent resource management. The book's telling subtitle is ""How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed."" It was resolute stubbornness and bad management that killed off the great Latin American peoples, Diamond argued. Today, though, an entire world civilization, not just a regional people, has neglected and defiled the very resource base from which it sustains itself. We've got to move past the false, stubborn debate about whether global warming is happening or not. Obviously it is, plentiful research has underscored this for years, and with the natural disasters everywhere we're feeling it now. Those who still don't get it may have stuck their heads in the sand -- or perhaps they're lying to themselves. But either way we can't lose more time trying to convince them. And those who are slowly coming around -- including US Republicans, notorious former skeptics -- have to catch up on the learning curve very quickly. Resignation or fatalism -- that it's a tragedy, the destruction of life as we know it, but alas we can't affect it -- is as self-defeating as denial, and lazy too. I've seen one too many dystopian, post-apocalyptic thrillers recently based on worst-case, extreme-weather scenarios, but too few about saving mankind from these fates. In the 1980s, the international community's response to the ozone's thinning and the scourge of acid rain illustrate what mankind can do when it puts its mind to changing human and above all industrial behavior. In the form of the 1987 Montreal Protocol and 1985 Helsinki Protocol respectively, treaties were put in place that halted the destructive menace of the pollutants responsible for those blights. They're success stories. Admittedly, these afflictions were more contained than the entire planet's warming, but they show that human beings can at least constrain the folly that they've set in motion. So the battle against climate change is in our hands. Despite the meager political action to date, we're not starting at square one. Our scientists, in a feat of global cooperation orchestrated through the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have enabled us to understand climate change as the consequence of two centuries' intensive burning of petroleum-based fuel, and what it portends -- namely a future in which human beings and other inhabitants of the planet will find it increasingly difficult, and eventually impossible, to live as we have. Another product of science is the technology that can replace fossil fuels. It's already there, and in use in small quantities almost everywhere in the world. The clean tech that we have today -- solar power, wind energy, battery-propelled transportation, smart grids, and more -- is enough for us to go completely green in the near future. Advances are made and costs come down on this technology every six months, but we don't have to wait. Germany, for example, turned 40% of its electricity renewable in just 15 years. Today that could happen twice as fast. A number of diverse, evidence-based studies show that a global transition to 100% renewable electricity, or close to that, isn't utopian dreaming at all but feasible, and in the near future. A massive roll out of renewables, not including nuclear energy, could cover the globe's energy needs by 2050, even with the world's population growing. All investment in fossil fuel production would have to be switched to renewables. One recent study, the product of a Finnish university and German think tank, envisions a global renewable energy mix comprising 69% solar power, 18% wind energy, 8% hydropower, and 2% bioenergy. A full decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050 is possible based on available technology, according to Christian Breyer, a renewable energy expert and lead author of the study. ""Energy transition is no longer a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but of political will,"" says Breyer -- and he's not alone in asserting this. A 2017 study from Stanford University came to similar conclusions. But just as global warming today is something we can feel, so too can we see renewable energy at work. In Europe, Germany is the most commonly cited example because it is home to one of the world's most advanced industrial economies, which has prospered with the renewables surge. Yet Norway and Iceland already run almost completely on renewable energy, namely hydroelectric and geothermal power respectively. Denmark plans to convert fully to renewable energy by 2050 by scaling back on energy use and exploiting wind power to meet demand. By 2020, extensive reductions in energy consumption will make it possible for wind power to cover half of the country's electricity consumption. Danish power plants relying on coal will be phased out by 2030. And by 2035, all electricity and heating will be generated using renewable sources. As individuals, of course we can curb our consumption and make our lifestyles as sustainable as possible. But as citizens we have to mobilize too and force our elected leaders (and unelected leaders in China and elsewhere) to tackle the industrial giants whose fortunes are tied up in petrochemical generation. Until this summer, many in the developed world probably assumed that global warming would only affect the undeveloped and the far-away. But global warming has hit home for all of us in 2018. If empathy for others or future generations can't inspire concern, then let pure self-interest dictate action. Whatever the motive, the time for half measures is past.","This summer's sizzling temperatures, savage droughts, raging wildfires, floods and acute water shortages -- from Japan to the Arctic Circle, California to Greece -- are surely evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that the climate crisis is upon us now.",2018-07-31T14:34:31Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Clearly, the climate crisis is upon us",https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/opinions/climate-crisis-is-upon-us-opinion-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710065324-california-firefighters-us-flag-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,California wildfires,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors in southern California after a series of mudslides killed 17 people and swept away more than 100 homes. Run-off from heavy rain caused devastation in Santa Barbara County, with officials saying mud was waist-deep in some areas. In the upmarket neighbourhood of Montecito, some homes were swept from their foundations. The area is home to a number of celebrities, including actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and TV personality and actor Oprah Winfrey. Parts of the major north-south highway Route 101 were closed in both directions and not expected to reopen until next week. Read more: California mudslides death toll rises In pictures: Mudslides cause chaos 'Like a World War I battlefield' Why did the mudslides happen? Heavy downpours hit ground that had been burned by wildfires that took hold in December. Burned vegetation and charred soil create a repellent layer which prevents this rainwater from being absorbed. Together with the loss of vegetation, this can increase the risk of mudslides and floods. Where was affected? Santa Barbara County has been badly affected, with thousands forced to leave their homes. For many this was the second time in two months after fires ravaged the area last month. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Helicopters have also been transporting people out of the Romero Canyon neighborhood, where about 300 people were cut off after a massive debris flow blocked the road into the area.","Aerial imagery and maps showing the destruction caused by mudslides in southern California, as teams continue to search for survivors.",2018-01-11T14:26:19Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",California mudslides: Before and after,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42647131,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A81B/production/_99553034_101_google_976.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,California wildfires,1
JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Millions of people from across the world visit Yosemite National Park each year for an opportunity to take in the sweeping vistas at one of America’s most treasured natural preserves. But hundreds of visitors were ordered to evacuate the park Wednesday as firefighters struggled to contain the encroaching 38,000-acre Ferguson Fire, which has roared for nearly two weeks and remains just 25 percent contained. Dry conditions have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the flames. “The conditions are incredibly strenuous, and we’re seeing triple-digit temperatures in places,” said Dan McKeague, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. “Some sections are extremely remote. Access is limited because there aren’t a ton of existing roads.” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., said that long-term drying caused by rising global temperatures has exacerbated the risk of wildfires in the western United States. “Over decades there has been a trend toward less moisture in the soil and forest, and that is affecting how dry the vegetation is becoming in summer,” he said.","Thursday: Residents are forced to evacuate, Facebook loses more than $120 billion in market value, and a hooded figure takes hold of the Golden Gate Bridge in a viral video.",2018-07-26T13:07:51Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Ferguson Fire Forces Largest Closing of Yosemite in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/california-today-ferguson-fire-yosemite.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/26/us/26caltoday-yosemite/26yosemite2_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The town of Paradise has been all but destroyed by the wildfires The death toll in wildfires sweeping California has risen to 31, with more than 200 people still unaccounted, officials have said. Six more people were confirmed killed in the Camp Fire in the north of the state, taking the toll there to 29. It is now equals the deadliest wildfire on record in California - the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it threatens beach resorts including Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. With strengthening winds threatening to spread the flames, state Governor Jerry Brown has urged President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster, a move that would harness more federal emergency funds. The appeal came a day after Mr Trump threatened to cut funding for California, blaming the fires on poor forest management. What is the latest on the Camp Fire? Emergency teams have been sifting through the remains of more than 6,700 homes and businesses burned down in the town of Paradise. The town and surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Residents of Paradise are in shock from the scale of the destruction Media caption Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' At a news conference late on Sunday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the bodies of five people had been found in their burned-out homes and a sixth was found inside a vehicle. He said that more than 200 people were still unaccounted for. The fire is the most destructive in the state's history and the joint deadliest. It has burned more than 109,000 acres (44,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. What about the Woolsey Fire? The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. By Sunday it had consumed 83,000 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Some looting was reported in the southern fire area over the weekend and police said arrests had been made. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among properties that have fallen victim to the flames. Firefighters used a respite from strong winds on Saturday to drop fire retardants to strengthen fire lines. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Fire retardant is dropped on to the Woolsey Fire near Malibu Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Woolsey Fire is only 10% contained Image copyright AFP Image caption Luxury beachfront homes in Malibu have been claimed by the fire But officials warned against complacency, with winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) expected over the coming days. They said fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly. ""Winds are already blowing. They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back,"" said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby. Meteorologist David Gomberg told the Los Angeles Times newspaper that fire tornadoes were possible. What do the politicians say? Governor Brown's request to President Trump was aimed at bolstering the emergency response to what he called the ""catastrophic"" nature of the wildfires. ""We're putting everything we've got into the fight against these fires and this request ensures communities on the front lines get additional federal aid,"" Mr Brown's letter said. Mr Trump's response to the fires has been criticised as unsympathetic and ill-informed. On Sunday, during a trip to France, he tweeted that: ""With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!"" He has previously blamed Californian officials for wildfires and threatened to withhold federal funding. In a tweet on Saturday, he accused state authorities of ""gross mismanagement"" of forests. Mr Brown's spokesman, Evan Westrub, called Mr Trump's comments ""inane and uninformed"".","Six more bodies are found in the north of the state, taking the death toll to 31 with 200 missing.",2018-11-12T04:36:03Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",California wildfires: Death toll rises to 31 with 200 missing,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46175339,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0EF3/production/_104272830_050558292.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,California wildfires,1

THOMAS FULLER,"Fueled by Santa Ana winds, the intensity of this week’s fires made it very hard for firefighters to do anything to stop them. On Tuesday evening there were seven active fires in Southern California, according to Calfire. The Thomas fire, the largest, burned 35,000 acres in the first 12 hours alone. By Tuesday night it had spread to more than 50,000 acres. The winds are forecast to continue into the weekend and will not peak until Thursday, according to Chief Berlant. Chief Berlant, who is the head of Calfire’s prevention efforts, says it is crucial for the state to consider fire safety when planning roads and housing developments. As one example, building codes were changed a decade ago to make roofs more likely to withstand embers falling on them. “We know we have a changing climate and we have to adapt to it,” Chief Berlant said. “Our homes and our communities need to be more resilient to wildfires.” Were you evacuated because of the fires?

Workers combing through homes and cars will struggle in the mud, and scorched landscapes may see land and mudslides, state wildfire officials warn. Wildfires across the state have so far claimed a total of 80 lives.

The colossal fire altogether has destroyed 75 residences, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Cal Fire estimated that full containment could take until September 1. The Mendocino Complex Fire ignited on July 27. Last year's Thomas Fire, which is the second-largest fire in California history, took more than six months to extinguish after burning 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Firefighters in the state are currently battling 17 large fires. Trump weighs in on wildfires This week, President Donald Trump appeared to blame California's environmental protection laws for the cataclysmic fires. Administration officials declined to offer any clarity on Trump's series of tweets. Trump claimed in his tweet that the fires were being ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized."" He also added that water in the state was ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" in a tweet that named California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""This does not merit a response,"" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman. Environmental scientists, California water experts and local officials have disputed Trump's claims. ""It is climate change that is causing this,"" says Michael Mohler, spokesman for Cal Fire. ""There is no other way to explain explosive fuel conditions, that come with increased winds and higher temperatures."" California's multiyear drought ended last year, but it also left a lot of dried and weakened plants and trees. ""You don't recover from six years of drought overnight,"" Mohler said. California has approximately more than 100 million dead trees in the state due to drought and infestation from bark beetles. Dead trees pose a major hazard as they allow wildfires to spread rapidly in hot, dry conditions. Cal Fire's vegetation management crews are out year-round to thin and remove such trees, while also doing prescribed burns. Experts cite hotter temperatures causing lengthier fire seasons, that burn up dry, dead vegetation as factors for more wildfires. Other fires in the state continue Cal Fire reported that warm temperatures, with highs in the 90s and triple digits, are expected in most areas of the state -- which isn't good news for firefighters. But a slight cooling is in the forecast for the weekend. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling the wildfires across the state. The second biggest fire in California is the Carr Fire, located in Shasta County in the northern part of the state. The deadly fire has been burning for more than two weeks and consumed 172,055 acres, as of Tuesday evening. It has killed seven people and destroyed more than 1,100 homes. The next largest fire is the Ferguson Fire, near Yosemite National Park, with 94,992 acres. That fire which has lasted more than three week, has killed two people.

Mark Kaufman,"It should come as no surprise that California is burning. On Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that July was California's hottest month since record keeping began in 1895. Those scorching temperatures withered the land, creating profoundly parched forests primed to catch fire with just a spark. SEE ALSO: Engineering Earth's climate might quell global warming, but it could come with a cost Major wildfires are propelled by weather, notably strong winds, but they're also enhanced by overall rising global temperatures due to human-caused climate change, say scientists. This is a particularly stark reality in California, where even in early July, fire scientists noted that the state's vegetation reached near-record dryness. On Monday, the Mendocino Complex Fire became the largest blaze in state history, easily outpacing the Thomas Fire, which broke the record just this past winter. Nearly the entire Golden State experienced either record heat or temperatures ""much above average"" in July, said NOAA. However, California wasn't alone in experiencing scorching temperatures and multiple heat waves. Most of the West was abnormally warm, and in the contiguous U.S., May through July temperatures were also the warmest on record, eclipsing the previous record set in 1934. Image: noaa As climate and environmental scientists are quick to point out, individual temperature records are not too meaningful — it's the long-term trends that matter. And California's summer heat is certainly a continuation of accelerating warming trends in both the U.S. and around the globe. Heat waves and longer warming spells will certainly happen, regardless of what the climate is doing, as big blobs of warm air can settle over areas, like California or Europe, for extended periods of time. But the climate is simply warmer that it was a half century ago, giving hot temperatures an extra boost — which can mean vast swathes of land are turned to fire-ready tinder. Yet another heat wave continues this week in portions of California, like Los Angeles. As might be expected, this doesn't bode well for the already dry vegetation in the region. Southern California's Holly Fire is now actively growing near suburban neighborhoods. Relieving rains aren't expected in much of the state for months. California, like recently scorched Greece, experiences the dry, warm summers defined by the Mediterranean climate. Historically, fires happen during this time of year. But now — just like heat waves around the world — they're getting worse. And the consequences are plainly visible.","It should come as no surprise that California is burning.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"The program has increasingly drawn scrutiny from criminal justice reform advocates, who have called it one of the most striking examples of undercompensated prison labor. It also illustrates how convictions can have lasting impacts on peoples lives, said Angela Hanks, the director of the Center for Postsecondary and Economic Success at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a Washington-based nonprofit group that promotes policies that help low-income Americans. Ms. Hanks said that incentives given to prisoners to join the fire camps, such as reduced sentences, might draw some who would otherwise not want to join the program. It is such a dangerous job, she said. At a minimum, people should be paid a fair wage. Once they are released from prison, inmates find it difficult to join the ranks of professional firefighters, said Katherine Katcher, the founder and executive director of Root and Rebound, a nonprofit group that helps people with criminal histories re-enter society. Some former inmates, like Ms. Mota, dont bother applying, Ms. Katcher said. Some fire departments also bar people with certain criminal backgrounds from becoming firefighters, she said. For example, the fire department in Bakersfield, a city of more than 380,000 people in Southern California, said it disqualified applicants who have been convicted of a felony. In the Los Angeles County Fire Department, felonies and some misdemeanors are grounds for disqualification, said Capt. Tony Imbrenda, a department spokesman. I can tell you that someone who has been incarcerated and part of an inmate hand crew has no chance of employment with this agency, he said. Various counties also have restrictions on who can get a license to be an emergency medical technician, which is required by many fire departments in California, Ms. Katcher said. State law directs local E.M.S. agencies to deny an E.M.T. certification if the person has been convicted of two or more felonies, or has been convicted of any theft-related misdemeanor in the preceding five years, among other possible factors.","About 1,500 inmates in California prisons are helping the state fight wildfires, including the Camp Fire, for several dollars a day.

CHARLES McDERMID,"Mr. Witwer was referring to what many are calling the “new normal,” a term now commonly applied to the state’s drastically worsening fire seasons as a result of cyclical drought, climate change and the ceaseless drive to populate fire-prone areas. Last year was the most destructive fire season in California history: more than $10 billion in damage and 44 dead. The ominous question is what comes next. “There is a new normal in California,” Toni Atkins, the State Senate president pro tem, said by email. “Massive wildland fires are now a part of our life — and one of biggest challenges facing the Legislature and governor this year. These fires are every bit the same kind of disaster as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters that confront states across the country.” Fear has translated into policy: California will spend as much as $1 billion in the coming year to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Mr. McLean said that through Sunday, Cal Fire had this year responded to 1,200 fires that had burned 8,000 acres. Last year at this time, they’d responded to 1,049 fires that burned 2,200 acres. For some, “new normal” is already passé. Scott McLean, the deputy chief of Cal Fire, drives from Chico to Sacramento every day. He’s already watched fire conditions change this year, the grass turning from green to brown.","Wednesday: A battle for second place in the governor’s race, a death in Yosemite and Golden State comes up short.",2018-05-23T13:02:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: Experts on Fire Season 2018: Dealing With the ‘New Normal’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/california-today-fire-season-2018.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/world/12CALtoday-1/12CALtoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/EPA Image caption Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast A deadly wildfire which has destroyed more than 700 homes in California is now the largest blaze in the state's recorded history. The Thomas fire has burned more than 1000sq km - an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined. The blaze broke out in Santa Paula in early December and has moved west towards the coast, one of several major fires in California in recent months. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to bring it under control. Most of California's largest wildfires have been recorded this century. Scientists say the warming climate and spread of buildings into wilderness areas have contributed. The Thomas fire slowly eclipsed previous record-setting blazes, finally overtaking the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County, which burned 273,246 acres. It follows a series of deadly fires in the state's wine country in October that burned more than 10,000 homes and killed more than 40 people. The Thomas fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and claimed the life of one firefighter - Cory Iverson, a father of one from San Diego whose wife was expecting another child. The blaze is now moving slower because of rain and less wind.

As we left, embers were falling from the sky and helicopters were flying low overhead spraying water. A completely surreal experience. We just bought our house in April. It’s our dream home. And as I type this, a house right next door to our neighbor’s is in flames. I’m not sure if our house will make it, but thankfully we are all safe.” — Lisa Goh “I got the emergency alert on my phone of fire at 5 something in the morning. I saw an alert of a six-acre fire near Mulholland Drive, east of the 405. That’s just a couple of miles away. By 6:15 the fire had reached 50 acres and I was already packing bags and calling my husband who is on business in Boston. By 6:30 I knew for sure we had to get out of there. I told our two nannies to wake up immediately and get their bags packed as well as the kids bags packed. I told them to pack as if we would never see this house again.” — Gwen Gottlieb “After dinner in Westlake, we were driving home down the grade and saw the red glow of the fires. It was awful and we just prayed for all in its path. Thirty minutes later we arrived in Ventura and the streetlights flickered. Then the entire city went dark. At that point we figured it was from the fires and headed inside. Not 20 minutes later I looked out my bedroom window and saw the red glow extremely close. I told my daughters we need to start gathering items as it must be spreading. Within minutes I saw the fire crest our hill and it was panic. We literally had minutes to get anything we could grab along with our pets (including our one week old kittens and a nursing Mom) and leave. We headed to Oxnard Shores to my fiancé’s parents’ home.

BOB LITTERMAN,"This means that electric utilities, in particular, and other businesses more generally have to rethink how they prepare for dangerous fire conditions and other impacts of climate change. These impacts are only growing. The thousand-year flood is now a regular event. The future will also bring further sea level rise, stronger hurricanes, storm surges, droughts, heat waves and wildfires beyond historical precedent. PG&amp;E has noted that more than half of the companys vast service area of 70,000 square miles is now considered to be in extreme or high fire-risk areas. No doubt much of the considerable cost of girding against these conditions will fall on rate payers.
So what should electric utilities threatened by the potential for wildfires do? It may require better protecting grid infrastructure and being more prepared to shut off power when wildfire risk is especially high. Homeowners and businesses must be prepared when the grid is turned off and will require backup sources of electricity for critical needs.
But utilities arent alone in facing climate threats. For transportation companies, for example, it may require hardening infrastructure like port facilities or rail lines to protect them from floods or fires. Fossil fuel companies may be forced to deal with stranded assets like oil fields and coal seams that have been bought but wont be developed as society moves away from coal and oil. For others, like insurance companies, it may provide business opportunities. And for many entrepreneurs it may lead to completely new products and services.
Risk managers at these companies will need to consider scenarios that have never happened before. Investors will need to assess the climate risks embedded in their portfolios and must demand greater transparency from the managers of the companies that they own.
However, for society at large, and the government in particular, the most important and urgent action required is to minimize future warming by creating appropriate global incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Economists generally agree that rather than regulate behavior, it is more effective to allow individuals to choose their actions, as long as the prices appropriately reflect the costs, including the risks posed by climate change.",A firefighter checked out burned vehicles and a fallen power line after the Camp Fire in California in November.,2019-01-29T19:09:38Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Very High Costs of Climate Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/climate-wildfires-bankruptcy-california.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/opinion/29Litterman/29Litterman-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
Steve Dent,"The ER-2 has been scanning the blazes with a couple of interesting instruments that have flown, or will fly aboard the international space station (ISS). One of them is the AVIRIS spectrometer that can penetrate cloud, dust and smoke to see the ground below. While providing a clear image of the ground, it can also measure fine details in vegetation like water content and plant species growing. Eventually, a similar instrument will be launched into space. On the flight pictured above, however, it's carrying another instrument, the Cloud-Aerosol Multi-Angle Lidar (CAMAL). It was originally developed to a validate space-based version of the instrument called CATS, which operated for 33 months aboard the ISS, before going out of service last month. Now, CAMAL is being used for a similar purpose aboard the ER-2. Unlike other types of LiDAR used to scan the ground, CAMAL can study pollution, smoke, clouds and other atmospheric phenomena. Another view of the Thomas Fires from space Ideally, NASA flies the AVIRIS spectrometer over regions before a fire starts to get a base measurement, then overflies the same spot again afterwards. Comparing the before and after images gives researchers an idea about the severity of a fire. Meanwhile, when the blaze is active, the area can be scanned with the CAMAL LiDAR to get a picture of the dust, smoke and cloud cover in the area. Using the space-based version of the instrument, for instance, NASA scanned the October wildfires, finding plumes extending as high as 2-3 miles that created ""the worst air quality ever recorded in many parts of the Bay Area,"" NASA's CATS team said. ""The vision is that these types of measurements could be available from space in the next decade,"" said JPL's Rob Green. ""The resulting information would then be used to develop fuel maps in advance that could be used to make better predictions about where you could mitigate risk by clearing brush and trees."" CAMAL can also be used by researchers to study cloud formations and learn more about climate change, which is helping fuel the wildfires in the first place.","For the second time this year, swaths of California are burning out of control thanks to unseasonably warm and dry temperatures.

""If theres any way for Tesla to be helpful, please provide assistance and dont worry about payment,"" Musks email reportedly said. This wouldn't be the first time Musk has volunteered his or his companies' services to help a disaster. In 2017, on Musk's orders, Tesla shipped its Powerpack and Powerwall batteries to hospitals ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Then in the summer of 2018, Musk attempted to help with efforts to rescue the Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave for 17 days. He controversially insisted on building a kid-sized "" submarine "" and sending it to Thailand to transport them through the treacherous tunnels. While Musk likely had good intentions, his offer ended up being more interference that would land him in hot water with British cave diver Vern Unsworth, who did help rescue the trapped team, and whom he repeatedly accused of being a pedophile. Bizarrely, after initially apologizing to Unsworth, Musk backpedaled and doubled down on the unsubstantiated claim after immaturely goading the cave diver into suing him, which is happening. The question facing Musk is has he really changed his tune? Can he and Tesla really provide actual aid without interfering with the authorities? Or is this yet another marketing ploy to shout out Tesla veiled as an offer of help? After the episode in Thailand over the summer, some think that Musk's seemingly always-buzzing noggin is just savvily taking advantage of another unfortunate situation.","As California's deadly wildfires rage on, none other than billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk has come forth to offer help once again.

Robbie Gonzalez,"Not for the first time this year, Californians this week donned face masks to protect their lungs from the harmful airborne particles that have smothered the state in a sickly, sooty haze. The pollutants are products of three devastating infernos raging hundreds of miles apart, the largest of which, Butte County's Camp Fire, has swelled to become the deadliest and most destructive in state history. They join the more than 7,500 California wildfires that have this year consumed nearly 1.7-million acres of landmore than any fire season on record. The increasing intensity of California's blazes has many residents of the Golden State wondering: Is the smoke from wildfires also getting worse? That's a complicated question. On one hand, data suggests California's fires are burning hotter and consuming more land than they did in the past. ""If you use intensity as a proxy for pollutionthat is, if you assume stronger fires will produce more emissions like smokethen by stint of that, yes, there ought to be more smoke,"" says atmospheric composition scientist Mark Parrington. A senior researcher at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Parrington tracks wildfires around the world to better understand their effect on pollution and public health. Most mornings he's in his office by 8 am, downloading the previous 24 hours' worth of fire data from a supercomputer operated by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The datathermal infrared radiation measurements from NASA's MODIS instrument allow him to estimate the intensity of fires burning around the world; how many emissions (like lung-aggravating aerosols and greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide) they're pumping into the atmosphere; and how those emissions affect global air quality. From his office in Reading, just west of London, he's kept closer tabs on California's current wildfires than most. ""You really don't expect to see emissions of this magnitude, this late in the year,"" Parrington says. ""Even on a global scale, it really stood out."" Parrington also compares each day's emissions data to past measurements, which is how he knows that California's current wildfires have pumped more schmutz into the atmosphere than any November blazes on record. In fact, this year's California wildfires have produced more emissions than all but 13 of the past 16 years. ""It's not just the Camp Fire, but the wildfires from this summer,"" Parrington says. ""The Carr Fire, the Mendocino Complex Firethey've been devastating."" If the state sees any major wildfires in December (the way it did in 2017), 2018 could become the year with the highest emissions ever recorded for California. And yet, the question of whether smoke is getting worse is more complicated than many people realize. That's because smoke itself is pretty complex. For starters, it contains well beyond the 40 different ""pyrogenic species"" Parrington says his analyses account for, which include various forms of carbon, and toxic aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene. The relative and absolute quantities of said species can vary considerably, based on the conditions of the burnlike whether it's wet, dry, or has burned in the past. ""All of these factors contribute to how much of those fire emissions get turned into smoke and how the pollutants interact with each other,"" Parrington says. Determining how much smoke is actually in the atmosphere, let alone entering people's lungs, is also challenging. Parrington says it requires understanding how smoke interacts with large scale weather conditions like wind, ground temperature, air temperature, and cloud cover. In the Bay Area, for instance, high pressure atmospheric systems tend to produce inversion layers that, like a lid on a shallow pan, keep smoky air close to the ground. Determining the region's air quality has to do not just with the absolute quantity of smoke, but how much of it is is trapped at ground level. There's also fuel sources to consider, variations in which produce different kinds of smoke. ""The fact that more fires are happening at the wildland urban interface means that fires are encountering new materials,"" says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University specializing in fire-related air pollution. When it comes to fuel, McCarty says, fires are agnostic. If it's hot enough, it doesn't care if it's a tree, a house, or your car. But as a rule of thumb, the emissions emanating from a burning shrub are less caustic than those of a burning Subaru. ""Wood is far from clean, but it's nothing compared to something like burning rubber, which is downright toxic,"" McCarty says. Which is why, as people build deeper and deeper into wildland areas, the relevant question isn't just how much pollution these fires producing, but what kind of pollution they're producing. Answers to both questions, Parrington says, could be found in computational systems like the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring service, which is capable of taking many of these variables into account and synthesizing the data across multiples wildfire seasons. CAMs has only been operational for three years, but the data it collects is openly available to scientists around the world who are increasingly interested in nuanced questions about wildland smoke. For residents of California, answers to those questions can't come soon enough. In the meantime, hang on to any extra air masks you have lying aroundthere's no telling when you might need them again.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes California's latest catastrophic wildfire, the Camp Fire, was impossible to outrun when it first began burning. Officials say winds caused the blaze to burn through 80 miles (128km) of Northern California's hillside in just one hour. So how can you escape such a blaze, and why is the western US state so susceptible to these deadly fires? What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" H ow do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days Why are California fires so devastating? According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan.

The Camp Fire in northern California has killed at least 71 people. More than 1,000 people are reported to be missing, although officials say that figure could fluctuate. Leaving for California, Mr Trump again focused on forest management as a cause of the blazes, a claim that has been disputed by experts. On top of the Camp Fire, firefighters are also tackling several other blazes, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives. And adding to the misery, scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters and the air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst. Heavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation. What's the latest on the Camp Fire? The death toll rose to 71 on Friday after seven more bodies were found in the town of Paradise, which has been all but destroyed by the fire. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains eight days on after the Camp Fire first broke out.

Some of those on the list may be fine but unaware they have been reported missing, or unable to call, authorities say. The Camp Fire is now about 50% contained but fire officials say they may not have it fully under control until the end of the month. What kind of welcome will the president get? Mr Trump is due to meet survivors and firefighters involved in tacking the blaze when he touches down. Asked on Fox News if he thought climate change had contributed to the wildfires, he said ""Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management."" California Governor Jerry Brown, who has criticised this argument as simplistic, said he would welcome the president to the state. ""Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,"" he tweeted.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes in Southern California over the span of a week due to wildfires sweeping the region. In response to the ongoing devastation, Apple announced on Monday that it is donating $1 million to aid in relief efforts. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by the fires in Southern California, including our colleagues, friends and their families,” the company said in a statement, posted in a tweet by KTLA reporter Rich DeMuro. “Apple is donating $1 million to aid in the rebuilding and recovery efforts of the communities that have been impacted.” We have reached out to Apple for comment on how it determined the amount of its donation and where, specifically, it is donating the money. Apple has donated to relief efforts in the past. It donated $1 million to Northern California wildfire relief efforts in October and also matched employee donations. And without question it’s a good thing to provide resources following natural disasters. But it’s also important to understand just how impactful these contributions are. Apple is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and it’s on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar company. One million dollars is generous, but the cost of wildfires is astoundingly more than that. Cal Fire has an emergency fund budget of $426 million, KCRA reported, but it cost the department approximately $70 million more than that to fight wildfires from July 1 through December 7. “This is the worst season I’ve had — the longest, most devastating, most loss of life, most loss of structures,” Michael Bradley, Northern California assistant region fire chief, told KCRA. “Rate of spread is extreme.” I’m not shitting on Apple for donating 1,000 iPhone X’s-worth of money to help wildfire relief efforts, but Apple is the largest public company in the world. It’s important to remember how much Apple’s worth, versus how much it donated, versus how much is really needed to help. This is good, albeit incremental, support. But it’s also great PR for the tech giant.

"Rhett Jones on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Californias devastatingwildfires are now simply a way of life for residentsand things will likely only get worse. Since the presidents solution for combating these climate change-fueled disasters is to threaten to cut FEMA funding for the state, local governments are taking matters into their own hands. The plan: Goat Fund Me.
The tactic of using herds of goats to clear the flammable dry brush in forest areas has become increasingly popular. Now, the town of Nevada City, California, wants to deploy its own goat army to clean up its surrounding areas as soon as possible. Authorities in Nevada City are attempting to quickly subsidize their preventative measures through the power of crowdfunding and catchy branding.
Goat Fund Me, a campaign launched by Nevada City Vice Mayor Reinette Senum, aims to raise $30,000 that will be used to bring in several large herds of hungry goats for the purpose of eating up the wild brush on city land. Though wildfires in California are becoming a year-round problem, the winter season remains the best time for Nevada City to prepare itself. We can go out and pursue grants but that takes months, and we dont have months, Senum told Wired.
Climate change is undoubtedly making the wildfire situation worse through a combination of droughts and fast, hot winds. Wildfires spew tons of carbon into the atmosphere, further accelerating climate change. And the more wildfires that occur, the more money California has to spend fighting themleaving fewer funds to put toward forest management. Its a spiraling, unwinnable trajectory. But using goats to clear out brush before a lightning strike can send miles of forest up in smoke is a relatively cheap method. On its Go Fund Me page, Nevada City estimates that grazing can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per acre depending on the difficulty of the terrain and how much there is to graze.
Even at those costs, Nevada City isnt looking to clear out all 450 acres of its city-owned greenbelt at once. Its working with experts to target the areas that pose the greatest risk. And theres plenty of risks. Nevada City is located about 80 miles from Paradise, California, where last seasons Camp Fire killed at least 38 people and leveled the majority of homes. That disaster is estimated to have resulted in around $16.5 billion in losses for the region. With those kinds of numbers, $30,000 for some goats really starts to look like a bargain.
Using 200 goats, Nevada City can clear around an acre of its land each day. All thats needed is some solar-powered electric fencing to corral the goats into a specific area, a herdsman on hand to oversee the grazing, and a herding dog to ward off predators. Organizers try to locate areas that have nearby sources of water, but a water wagon is also used to help the goats wash that brush down.
When the goats are done, humans also have a job to do. Chainsaw-wielding hand-crews come in and take care of the bigger tasks. And as city officials go around town for planning their targeted areas they also use the opportunity for community outreacheducating private property owners on best practices to take care of their own lands.
Crowdfunding is no substitute for the massive funds, mobilization, and planning that can be done on the state and federal level. A wildly popular Go Fund Me campaign has raised almost $20 million to fund Trumps border wall since it was launched last month. A congressional report from 2017 estimated the wall would cost almost $70 billion to build and $150 million a year to maintain. So yeah, crowdfunding has its limits. On the other hand, that absurd campaign has raised 20 MILLION DOLLARS! Give goats a chance, people.

The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state. At least 228 people are missing, as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk. The fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts, including Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes across the state. Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for. How did people die? Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving blaze.

Among the victims were also elderly residents with mobility issues or people who decided to stay despite evacuation orders. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks.

Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The Californian town of Paradise has been devastated by the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. At least 81 people have lost their lives and hundreds more have been reported missing. As families across the US come together for Thanksgiving, Paradise's residents are beginning to assess the damage to their lives and the town they called home. When gale-force winds drove flames from the Camp Fire through dried-out scrub and trees into Paradise on 8 November, its people fled for their lives. In the space of a day, the flames had engulfed much of the town - home to 27,000. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Some of the victims died trying to get away, while others were discovered in the burned-out ruins of their homes. An estimated 13,000 homes were destroyed, with many of the town's mainly-wooden houses quickly reduced to ashes. The authorities are still working to search and identify bodies as the fire continues to burn in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. While a forecast of heavy rains could help extinguish the flames, it could also hinder the search for the remains of victims and cause misery for those left homeless by the disaster. Thanksgiving plans As the rest of America sits down to celebrate Thanksgiving on Thursday, those left homeless by the raging Camp Fire are contemplating their futures. A number of organisations are on hand to help with the immediate crisis, providing shelter, clothes and food. And for Thanksgiving itself, meals are being donated by several non-profit organisations - the day seen as a chance to bring together those affected to start the healing process. For Kassy Parish, 19, such generosity after the trauma of the fire has been comforting. She plans to spend Thanksgiving at her mother-in-law's, but a stranger has offered her twin sister, Alli, somewhere to sleep and invited her to join his family for the annual celebratory meal. ""It's brought out so much good in a lot of people in the area,"" said Kassy. ""A lot of people have been getting together and making sure everyone is taken care of."" Image copyright Kassy Parish Image caption Kassy Rose Parish, her twin sister Alli and their family home before the fire Kassy was staying with her mom and stepfather at their home on Skyway - one of the three main routes into Paradise - when the fire spread through the town. Their house was burned down. Her six siblings also lost their homes. Before the disaster struck, the town was a popular retirement spot and, according to the latest census, about a quarter of the population was aged 65 or over. Kassy worked as a personal carer providing support for adults in the town when they were unable to live independently. She plans to stay in the town, where everyone knows everyone. ""I know it's going to take a couple of years until Paradise is rebuilt but I have lived here all my life,"" she said. Acres of land destroyed The Camp Fire scorched 152,000 acres of land along with the thousands of the homes built on it. The blaze is still only 75% contained. The fire isn't expected to be fully under control until the end of the month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Although, there is no exact figure for the number of people left homeless, six official evacuation centres have been set up, including two in fairgrounds which had closed for the season. Some people have also taken refuge in tents or cars. Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers are helping run the emergency shelters, which slept up to 950 on one night, as well as providing meals for all evacuees. They are also dealing with a fast-spreading norovirus outbreak, which has been reported at four of them. The Red Cross is helping people search for those still missing, through their safe and well website. Sean Smith, debris coordinator for the California Office of Emergency Services told Time magazine the post-fire clean-up would be the biggest since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. One estimate puts the cost at $1.2 billion (about £900m). Along with the 13,000 homes destroyed, almost 500 businesses have also been hit. Morgan Stanley estimates insured property losses could approach $4 billion (£3.1m), while Moody's Investor Services puts the figure at $6.8bn (£5.3m). ""It's one of the worst disasters that I've seen in my career, hands down,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long told a news conference. While federal funds are expected to provide about 75% of Paradise's recovery costs, the state of California will also contribute. Image copyright Justin Sullivan The money will help rebuild streets, public utilities and buildings and possibly install a new sewer system - Paradise was the largest town in California relying on septic tanks - but families without insurance may have to bear the cost of rebuilding their own homes. Kassy and her family have set up a crowdfunding page to help them get back on their feet. Others are expected to do the same. 'Survived three fires' But for Maurine Johnson, who has lived in Paradise for more than 60 years, it is too soon to contemplate the future. The 79-year-old great-great grandmother has lost her family home and her estate agency business, built up over many years with her late husband. Her two sons have also lost their homes. She has experienced blazes before, but this one was different, she said. ""We have been through two or three fires up there and never felt threatened or worried."" Maurine, who fell over and broke her nose and damaged her teeth while visiting her sister-in-law at one of the evacuation centres, described how she fled her home with just one change of clothes and her mobile phone. She admitted she still did not appreciate the gravity of her situation, but has been cheered by other people's generosity. Image copyright AFP ""I am having to wear donated clothes,"" she said. ""It's a humbling experience when you are having to take from people."" It is this spirit of giving that has led many organisations to provide 15,000 Thanksgiving meals to Camp Fire survivors at several locations, including shelters, on Thursday. Food for the Thanksgiving Together events will be provided by the non-profit World Central Kitchen and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, while celebrity chefs will work side by side with Paradise restaurant owners to prepare the food. ""We have seen the power of food to bring communities together, especially in times of great need,"" reads a post on the World Central Kitchen website. But the question for many of those affected by the Paradise fire, is whether they will return to the town. Mayor of Paradise Jody Jones believes they will and that the town will be reborn. ""We're committed to rebuilding,"" she said. ""It's not an 'if', it's 'How long is it going to take?'"" But Maurine, who is considering winding up her estate agency business and retiring, fears many will not return. People are already moving on, she said. ""They are leaving the state - others won't be back.""

Andrew Freedman,"Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but even by historical standards, the events of early December 2017 stand out. The dreaded Santa Ana winds, which transport warm, dry air from inland toward the coast, have been unceasing. The air is dry enough to ignite any vegetation exposed to a spark, be it a downed power line, carelessly-discarded cigarette, or an arsonist's can of gasoline. Through December 7, wildfires had burned more than 100,000 acres in the greater Los Angeles area alone, with more than 200,000 people evacuated from erratic flames fanned by 50 to 80-mile-per-hour winds. The Thomas Fire, in Ventura, about 60 miles northwest of downtown L.A., has proven to be the biggest blaze so far, burning at least 96,000 acres. The weather conditions have been too difficult for firefighters to gain the upper hand against many of the wildfires, with the combination of the winds, lack of significant rain for at least 8 months, and some of the driest air ever measured in this part of California. In San Diego, the National Weather Service found relative humidity levels well below 10 percent on Thursday, with tinderbox dry air draped across the entire West Coast.","Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but even by historical standards, the events of early December 2017 stand out.

"Joe Sutton and Susannah Cullinane, CNN","(CNN) Firefighters are struggling to contain the biggest of six blazes burning in southern California, with the Thomas Fire slipping from 15% containment to 10% Sunday. Covering 230,000 acres, the Thomas Fire is now the fifth largest blaze in modern California history. The fires are collectively burning an area larger than New York City and Boston combined. Gusty winds and dry conditions are not helping the wildfire's spread, and there's no rain in the forecast for at least 10 days. Elevated conditions: The Santa Ana winds are forecast to decrease heading into Tuesday, but could gust between 40-55 mph on Monday before tapering, CNN meteorologist Rachel Aissen says. Ventura County and surrounding areas are under an elevated fire outlook, with temperatures remaining between 78-82 degrees as humidity continues to fall in a range below 10%. Warnings: A Red Flag Warning for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties has been extended through Monday evening, the National Weather Service said. It means that elevated fire weather conditions are expected due to a combination of gusty winds and low humidity. Power cuts: The Thomas Fire is causing intermittent electricity outages in Santa Barbara County. Southern California Electric said that outages and surges could potentially affect up to 85,000 customers, with 2,432 customers without power at 9 p.m. PST Sunday (midnight ET). Evacuations: Some 94,607 people were under mandatory evacuation orders in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties Sunday evening, Ventura County Sheriff Captain Garo Kuredjian told CNN. School closures: The Santa Barbara City Office of Emergency Services said in a tweet that 19 of its 20 school districts would be closed Monday and that all South County School Districts would remain closed through the end of the week. Death toll: The death toll from the Thomas Fire stands at one. Authorities believe Virginia Pesola, 70, of Santa Paula, died in a crash while fleeing the fire, her body was found Wednesday. The six blazes vary in size. Thomas Fire: It had scorched 230,000 acres by Sunday evening, with about 10% of it contained. It started Monday in Ventura County, and has since spread into Santa Barbara County. The fire has surpassed the 1932 Matilija Fire -- which burned 220,000 acres -- to become Ventura County's largest recorded blaze, according to CalFire. It has destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191, Ventura County Sheriff Captain Garo Kuredjian told CNN, with firefighting efforts costing $34 million by Sunday night. Creek Fire: The second-largest blaze ignited Tuesday in neighboring Los Angeles County. It has burned 15,619 acres and is 95% contained. Rye Fire: It broke out Tuesday in Los Angeles County and has burned 6,049 acres. Firefighters are making progress, with 93% of the blaze contained. Lilac Fire: This fast-moving fire has consumed 4,100 acres since it ignited Thursday in San Diego County. Firefighters have regained control of it, and it's 75% contained. Skirball Fire: It started Wednesday as a brush fire in Los Angeles County. It has burned 422 acres and is now 85% contained. Liberty Fire: The blaze in Riverside County has burned 300 acres since it ignited Thursday. It's 100% contained, but authorities are monitoring it ahead of a forecast increase in winds. As California Gov. Jerry Brown surveyed the damage in Ventura County Saturday, he predicted that extreme fire activity would happen on a regular basis for decades. ""With climate change, some scientists are saying that Southern California is literally burning up,"" the governor, who is a n advocate for climate science, said. ""So we have to have the resources to combat the fires and we also have to invest in managing the vegetation and forests... in a place that's getting hotter."" As for those facing the flames of the current wildfires, there's gratitude -- for life, community and the efforts of the firefighters working to protect both. One family whose home was destroyed in the Creek Fire told CNN affiliate KCAL9 News that they had lost everything to the blaze but were grateful to be alive. ""For me, it was like my 15 years of living here was flashing by -- of memories, you know, the gatherings, all that,"" Javier Hernandez told the station. ""And then at the same time, we were like, 'OK, my family's OK. If it's gonna burn, it's gonna burn.'"" A number of celebrities voiced their thanks to firefighters and concern for the communities at risk from fire. Oprah Winfrey and Ellen Degeneres, who both have homes in Montecito, tweeted that they were praying for their communities. ""Our house is under threat of being burned. We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters,"" Degeneres said, adding in a later tweet that she was proud to be part of a community where people were helping each other to safety. Winfrey tweeted that her prayer as the fires raged was ""peace be still."" Retired tennis player Jimmy Connors' said the Thomas Fire was also threatening his home, tweeting his thanks to the firefighters ""working tirelessly."" Firefighters from Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington state are helping to fight the fires. Additionally, the Nevada Department of Corrections and Nevada Division of Forestry -- which run conservation camps for inmates -- have sent six trained crews to help. The crews of minimum security inmates will be fighting the Thomas Fire, the department said in a release. CNN's Faith Karimi, Paul Vercammen, Steve Almasy, Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone contributed to this report.","Firefighters are struggling to contain the biggest of six blazes burning in southern California, with the Thomas Fire slipping from 15% containment to 10% Sunday.",2017-12-11T09:11:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",California wildfires now larger than New York City and Boston combined,http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/us/california-wildfires/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171211202727-thomas-fire-monitor-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,California wildfires,1
Andrew Freedman,"Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control. At least three large fires are currently burning in and around Los Angeles, including one — the Thomas Fire — which has already burned at least 90,000 acres near Ventura. Early Thursday morning, authorities closed the 101 Freeway in both directions due to strong winds pushing fire close to the road, cutting off movement between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Evacuation orders have gone out for idyllic communities in the Ojai Valley, as well as parts of Santa Barbara, as flames move toward the coast, according to the LA Times. More evacuations are likely on Thursday. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The weather conditions on Thursday are downright dire, with strong, damaging winds rushing through mountain passes and down hillsides toward the coast. This will create extraordinarily dry air, and make any new fires or ones that are already in progress extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control. California’s fire history is replete with Santa Ana-driven, damaging blazes. However, the combination of factors present on Thursday — powerful winds, preexisting fires, desiccated vegetation, and also population growth — make it stand out as an especially risky day for the state. According to news reports, more than 200,000 people have been evacuated due to the fires, and this number may climb as the winds interact with the fires to push them in new directions at a faster clip. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which forecasts the risk of wildfires based on anticipated weather conditions, fire weather is likely to be ""extremely critical"" — a rare designation reserved for only the most threatening situations — in a swath of Southern California on Thursday. These combustible conditions are going to affect about 9.5 million people, the SPC forecasts. Another 10.7 million people reside in a ""critical"" fire weather zone, including the city of Los Angeles. Elevated fire risk is forecast for Southern California straight through Saturday. ""Large fire spread and extreme fire behavior will occur with any new/ongoing fires,"" the SPC said in a forecast discussion. Average temperatures across California during the summer months (June, July, and August) in 2017. Image: NOAA The high winds may prevent aircraft, including helicopters and heavy water bombers, from doing their work, as well. This further inhibits firefighters' ability to contain these blazes. The National Weather Service is predicting strong winds to last all day on Thursday. The winds have already exceeded hurricane force in some high elevation areas, with gusts above 75 miles per hour. While wildfires are a typical occurrence in Southern California each fall, when the dry, offshore Santa Ana winds blow, the current blazes are occurring later in the year than normal. In addition, conditions in the region are far drier than they normally would be. These fires are an illustration of how short-term weather variability can interact with longer-term climate trends to create a precedent-setting, potentially deadly extreme event. A fire sends embers all over residential neighborhoods north of Ventura, Calif. on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: Marcus Lam/LA Times via Getty Images ""The risk of large wildfires in coastal California typically peaks in Autumn after the long dry summers — typical of California’s Mediterranean climate — increase the flammability of the vegetation that fuels wildfires,"" LeRoy Westerling, a scientist researching climate and wildfire at the University of California at Merced, said in an email. ""The overlap between the dry fuels and these warm dry wind events marks the peak fire risk for the year in coastal California,"" Westerling said. ""Usually, Autumn rains put an end to the fire season by wetting fuels and raising humidity, even though wind events may continue to occur."" The problem is, Westerling noted, it hasn't rained much in Southern California since March. The state also had its hottest summer on record, which dried out the vegetation that grew after one of its wettest winters, forming a perfect weather whiplash combo that is conducive to igniting large fires. ""Southern California has remained unusually dry through November and into December this year, extending the high fire risk fueled by the confluence of dry conditions and Autumn winds that are driving the large fires burning in coastal Southern California,"" Westerling said. While these fires cannot be directly tied to climate change, since they were most likely ignited by downed power lines or arson, they are consistent with what scientists expect to occur more frequently from a warming, drying climate in much of California. The entire American West, in fact, is likely to see — and in many cases has already seen — an increase in the size and frequency of large wildfires. ""Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation as well as increasing temperatures,"" Westerling said. ""This means that the probability of extremely large wind-driven fires in California occurring later in the year is increasing.""","Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control.

George Dvorsky,"In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee. Alarmingly, winds are expected to pick up in the coming days, making a bad situation potentially worse. The latest California wildfire started in early Monday evening in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, spreading quickly to more than 15 square miles in just a few hours. The fires, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions, are devouring vegetation that hasn’t burned in decades, according to fire officials. To date, around 10,000 people have had to flee their homes. It’s a destructive and dangerous climax to what has been a devastating wildfire season in the state. As of late yesterday, the blaze had burned over 100 square miles in areas just north of Los Angeles and east of Santa Barbara. Currently, there are five active major blazes. Some 150 structures have burned down, including the 82-bed Vista del Mar Hospital in northwestern Ventura. Officials say the number of homes damaged by the wildfires is likely much higher. The wildfire is also causing mass power outages and water disruptions. Around 43,000 homes are currently without power (with more expected), and the Casitas Municipal Water District has advised residents of the city of Ventura, Upper Ojai Valley, Casitas Springs, and Foster Park to boil their tap water for about a minute before drinking and cooking. Without power, some water pumping systems and fire hydrants are inoperable, complicating matters for fire crews. The largest of the five wildfires, the Thomas Fire, has reached and skipped across the 101 freeway just north of Ventura, burning through oil fields, and reaching the Pacific Ocean. This fire is moving extremely quickly, torching an acre per second. As of Tuesday, the Thomas Fire has spanned 50,000 acres, and is listed as “zero percent contained” by fire officials. No fatalities have been reported to date, but three firefighters in LA were hurt and taken to a hospital where they’re listed in stable condition. “This is life in Southern California. This is where we live,” Mark Gennaro, who’s home of 12 years was destroyed, told The Washington Post. “I stand on that back hill and I see all that brush and I’m like, ‘Something’s gonna happen at some point.’” About 150,000 people in LA have been affected by evacuation orders for the Creek Fire near Sylmar and Lake View Terrace. Curfews have been enacted in the city of Ventura from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am. In Ventura, more than a quarter of its 100,000 residents have been told to evacuate. And it’s not over yet. After a brief respite late yesterday, the Santa Ana winds are expected to pick up today and tomorrow, gusting as fast as 35 to 50 mph, according to National Weather Service. This will likely fuel the fires even further, and possibly start new fires as it blows embers and ash elsewhere. The dry Santa Ana winds are caused by high pressure in the Great Basin and lower pressure off the coast. In the previous two years, rains have arrived prior to this stage in the wildfire season, but the region hasn’t seen any rain in the past three months. California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared state of emergency for Ventura County, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said “We expect to be out here all week fighting and containing this fire,” Some 1,100 personnel are currently battling the wildfires. “We’ve been watching all these disasters on TV, you really don’t think about when it happens to you, and what do you pack in that moment?,” said Ventura resident Samantha Wells-Zuniga on KABC news. “Now, everything that I have, except for my lovely family, is gone.” Beginning Monday night, dry conditions combined with the most intense Santa Ana wind event of the… Read more Read [ CNN, LA Times, Washington Post ]","In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee.

Adam Rosenberg,"More than 100,000 acres of land have been consumed by wildfires in California since Thursday night. Donald Trump would have you believe it's all the state's fault. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018 California's ""forest management"" is to blame. Not the confluence of environmental factors that most experts have pointed out. In Trump's view, California isn't using federal funds correctly. He even threatens to cut the state off from that money in the future if something doesn't change. Yeah. That'll show 'em. SEE ALSO: Intense videos show the Camp Fire ravaging Northern California Of course, the reality of what caused this fire (and so many others across the western U.S. in recent decades) is quite different. ""Climate change"" is the short explanation, since a warmer climate means more of the dry vegetation that helps to kindle and propagate these massive fires. The current spate of fires is still unusual, however. As Mashable's Mark Kaufman noted on Friday, we've reached the time of year when wildfire risks start to abate. As more rain starts to fall in mid-October and beyond, the dry conditions that feed these fires change. Unfortunately, California is in the midst of a record-setting dry spell for the fall season. A lack of rain, coupled with strong, dry winds from the north and east, have combined to create the conditions needed for large fires to start, and then spread. While fire-vulnerable communities can take steps to protect themselves by reducing the amount of vegetation in the surrounding area, it's not an issue that is solved by federal funding (or exacerbated by mismanagement of those dollars). Even setting aside Trump's inability to appreciate the complexity of the situation we've all been dealing with the same historically stupid leader since Jan. 2017 the timing of his victim-blaming tweet is highly questionable, given the tragic impact the fires have had so far. Not to mention the fact that Thousand Oaks, one of the California communities affected by the fires, is still dealing with the fresh grief of a mass shooting. Angry Twitter users were quick to school the president on all of this in the hours after his ill-advised (aren't they all?) Saturday morning tweet. We are being ravaged by these fires out here within 24 hours after we personally lost friends and family from a horrible shooting and this is your response to us! God forbid you actually support us and try to help! Weve gone through enough and then you twist the knife! Sam (@mssnewcomb) November 10, 2018 This piece of shit flew to France to celebrate our victory in WW1, blew off the ceremony because its raining and instead is threatening California while we are literally on fire.

Im right next door to all of these fires in Santa Monica, I see the fire, people fleeing, devastated, and not knowing where they will be sleeping tonight. And you know what? Our President Trump could probably care LESS. And thats the TRUTH. Tiffany Bahr (@tiffany_bahr) November 10, 2018 At least nine people dead, hundreds of homes destroyed, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated, terror from mountains to the sea.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 24 July: Firefighters and volunteers try to extinguish flames during a wildfire at the Greek village of Kineta Wildfires have been sweeping through coastal towns east of the Greek capital, Athens. Dozens of people - including families with children - have died as they tried to escape the flames. But fires are also raging in Sweden, as far north as the Arctic Circle, and have caused huge damage in countries including Portugal, the UK and the US in recent months. So what is happening to cause these infernos and how can we tackle them? Flames take hold Fires can occur naturally in woodland or brush, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, the vast majority of wildfires - as many as 90% worldwide - are started by humans, according to experts. The cause could be barbecue charcoal, a discarded cigarette or even arson. As long as there is fuel and oxygen available, the flames can take hold easily. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A strong wind blows embers in California Greece had an unusually dry winter and spring this year, leaving grass and scrubland particularly flammable, says Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). As well as a lack of rainfall, wind also determines how devastating the fire will be, depending on its strength and direction. ""Burning embers can travel quite far and start new fires that could spread for kilometres if they are big enough,"" says Smith. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: Dry grass burns as fire crews tackle the flames in Greece Surface fires - burning on a forest floor, for instance - tend to spread slowly and can be more easily controlled. In fact some surface fires can be good, says Cathelijne Stoof, a wild land fire expert based in the Netherlands. ""It helps plants regenerate,"" she adds. ""The problem is when the flames can climb up low level branches and get to the tops of the trees. That's when you can't stop it."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 15 July: Due to the dry weather, about 80 wildfires have been burning in Sweden The most dangerous part of a blaze is called the head fire, explains Thomas Smith. It is driven forward by the wind and is very difficult to fight directly because it has long flame lengths. Image copyright AFP Image caption 17 July: This aerial view provided by the European Space Agency shows smoke billowing from several fires between the west coast of Norway to central Sweden. Head fires burn with blacker smoke But it is not just wood and grass that quickly become fuel for wildfires. Nearby homes and vehicles will combust because of the materials they contain, such as plastics and rubber. Hazardous In Greece, cars in the road caught fire before the surrounding verdant trees because they were more flammable. And they did not need to be directly licked by the flames to do so. ""It comes down to the amount of energy given off by the flames,"" says Smith. ""The cars could be tens of metres away and still be close enough to ignite."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 24 July: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati near Athens Sadly, people are often killed by wildfires as they attempt to escape. Many of the victims in Greece were trapped in traffic jams as people tried to flee as fast as possible, according to forest risk management expert Alexander Held. But this could have been avoided with better evacuation plans in place, he says. Fine fuel such as dry shrubs should be cleared away from roadsides and houses to stop flames getting close, he adds. ""This was a bomb waiting to explode."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: The contents of a home, including dry wooden beams, go up in flames in Greece Heat and flames are the most immediate dangers people face in a wildfire. However, smoke can also be harmful if you have an existing condition such as asthma or lung disease, or are exposed for weeks or months. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: A road block is set up as smoke fills the air near Athens Although smoke from burning vegetation is toxic, it will usually disappear quickly. Fumes produced by burning plastic or asbestos inside homes are much more hazardous. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 25 March: Ruins of a house are out of bounds after a bushfire in Tathra, Australia As well as changing climates, the differing land use over the centuries has led to more wildfires in Europe, according to experts. ""There used to be small agricultural fields across Europe and people would manage the land,"" says Cathelijne Stoof. ""But in the 20th Century people moved away and the land became overgrown. So when you do have a fire it spreads much more easily."" In the case of the huge fire near Saddleworth Moor in North West England, it was not just the vegetation that caught fire. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At its peak, the fire on Saddleworth Moor covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km) and burned for three weeks ""This fire definitely did get into the soil,"" says Dr Thomas Smith. The moorland is made up of peat soil, which is carbon-rich and needs little oxygen to burn, he explains. ""The fire gets underground and smoulders away.... It makes it much more difficult to put out."" Fighting fire Image copyright PA Image caption 28 June: Firefighters tackle a wildfire with beaters on Winter Hill near Bolton, UK Firefighters have a range of techniques to try to tackle a blaze by depriving it of oxygen or fuel. They need to have the right training to know which one will work the best. In the recent UK wildfires, they used beaters and water hoses to extinguish the flames. Dropping water and fire retardant containing fertiliser from planes and helicopters may also slow the spread of flames. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 7 December 2017: A plane drops fire retardant near a home near Los Alamos Road in Murrieta, California, last December Experts say one of the most effective methods of tackling wildfires is building firebreaks by clearing vegetation. But this is ""dirty and hard work"", says Alexander Held, and not an option that is always popular in public opinion. ""You can send a lot of helicopters and planes but without crews on the ground you won't put it out,"" he insists. Cathelijne Stoof agrees on the importance of creating firebreaks: in some places firefighters will create controlled fires to draw the energy out of the blaze they are battling. And she says fire prevention and land management should be ""sexier"" than it is now. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 21 July: Firefighters create a firebreak in the Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite National Park, California Teams with the right training can understand fire behaviour and choose the best way to respond, she says. But fire also behaves very unpredictably. ""It's dangerous. So I very much respect the people that put everything on the line to save others.""

JENNIFER MEDINA,"During a November meeting, Jeremy Prupas, the chief veterinarian for the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services, said he spoke with clinical nutritionists, a shelter medicine specialist and a veterinary toxicologist. None of them, he said, “thought it would be a good idea to feed shelter dogs a vegan diet.” When another commissioner asked him if any other shelter in the United States gave vegan food to animals, Dr. Prupas did not hesitate: “No.” After dozens of comments supporting the change, the commission asked for a formal analysis on the benefits and risks of moving dogs in the shelters to a vegan diet. Staff members are expected to deliver the report in February. Still, the proposal to go vegan has attracted several high-profile supporters, including Moby, the musician who also runs a vegan restaurant in the Silver Lake neighborhood. “If we adopt this, it’s one more thing that proves to the world that Los Angeles really is the progressive capital,” Moby said during the meeting last month. Critics point to two primary reasons to keep the omnivore diet: expense and digestion. Moving to a vegan diet with higher fiber is likely to mean frequent doggy diarrhea, said Madeline Bernstein, the president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles, which would make it difficult for staff to maintain the health of thousands of dogs. (Ms. Bernstein described herself as “an occasional and conscious” meat-eater and said the group is careful to have vegan food at staff meetings and events.)

In Palm Springs, Kenny Irwin offers Robolights — a four acre plot decked out with millions of lights. (Some claim it is the largest residential private Christmas light display in the country.) Solvang has been called one of the 10 best small towns for the holidays (an honor it promotes proudly.) Visit the decked out windmill and listen to carols in one of the first Danish colonies on the West Coast. For nearly a century, Christmas Tree Lane in Fresno has welcomed visitors to see trees and homes in their holiday finest — but only until Christmas Day. Head to Fort Bragg for a ride on the Magical Christmas Train, and for cookies, hot chocolate and a visit with Santa. (And you’re encouraged to come in your pajamas.)

Credit Left, Justin Sullivan/Getty Images; Christian Hansen for The New York Times Last week, we received some interesting responses to our use of the word “bodega” in a story about “Dr. Dre’s ‘weed man’” for this California newsletter. Most of the criticism came via Twitter, some of it in all caps. “FOR THE TRILLIONTH TIME,” wrote Gustavo Arellano, a California columnist for The Los Angeles Times opinion section, “WE DON’T CALL THEM BODEGAS HERE.” Dozens of replies and hundreds of retweets later, consider the message received. We could have called it a “liquor store” or simply, a “store.” But that admission doesn’t really do this topic justice. The internet is full of pieces that lay out the subtle distinctions between “convenience stores,” “delis,” “liquor stores,” “bodegas” and establishments that would seem to blur the lines. The terms we use also come loaded with regional history and significance. “Bodega,” for instance, comes loosely from the Spanish word for “warehouse,” and, according to this Gothamist post, was brought to New York by the Spanish-speaking people who began arriving during the first half of the 20th century. As it turned out, the conversation that emerged about “bodega” opened a space for readers to recall the synonymous words they used in the places they grew up: “ vaquitas ” — or farm stores — in Miami; “ ice houses ” in Texas; “ packies ” in parts of Connecticut; and, for Spanish speakers in Southern California, “tiendita” or “licor,” Mr. Arellano said. “None of those words have ever made it into Southern-California English,” he said in a telephone interview. “So I’ll give it to you New Yorkers — you’re beating us in the Spanish game out here in California, because at least you guys do use Spanish to refer to a convenient store while we still don’t.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

THOMAS FULLER and CONOR DOUGHERTY,"The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units. The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don’t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on. “It’s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,” he said.

THOMAS FULLER and IVAN PENN,"Mr. Newsom, who was elected governor in November, does not appear as a recipient of direct donations. But the final destination of PG&amp;Es campaign donations are in many cases unclear: Over the past decade the company contributed around 245 times to political action committees which in turn made their own donations.
There is recognition in California that PG&amp;E, the largest electric and gas operation in any state around the country, has an increasingly difficult job.
The company delivers dangerous commodities gas and electricity to homes in many semirural areas made more vulnerable to wildfires by a changing climate. Under California law, the company is liable for fires caused by its equipment even if it was not negligent.
As with many large for-profit companies, lobbying for more favorable regulations is seen as an essential cost of business. The company says its political contributions and lobbying expenses are paid for with shareholder funds, not utility customer dollars. The same is true, the company says, with its charity program: Since 2000, the company and its foundation have granted more than $100 million to nonprofit organizations.
And as part of its wildfire-prevention efforts, the company has spent $2.3 billion over the past six years to trim vegetation around power lines. Our most important responsibility is safety, and that continues to be our primary focus, said Melissa Subbotin, a spokeswoman for the company.
Yet California officials whose communities were devastated by the San Bruno explosion and the spate of fires that have been linked to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric equipment say they have been frustrated in their efforts to hold the company accountable.
After the pipeline explosion, the City of San Bruno sued to obtain thousands of emails between PG&amp;E executives and the states utility regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission.","A federal court convicted PG&E of negligence in a pipeline explosion that killed eight people, injured 58 and incinerated a neighborhood in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno.",2019-02-23T22:47:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Political Playbook of a Bankrupt California Utility,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/us/pge-california-politics.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/us/24pgepolitics-01-print/00pge-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1
Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires. What's more, over the same period, the state has experienced eight of its 10 most destructive fires in history. The U.S. Forest Service is in its highest level of fire response, with 29,500 firefighters battling blazes around the nation. Most, however, are combating fires in the super-parched West, where the record-breaking Mendocino Complex promises to spread even more.","For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history.

The camaraderie, I would say, is the most familiar thing, said Travis Wilkerson, a former Marine who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and now serves on a helicopter crew with the Forest Service. That sense of brotherhood you have. Natural disasters, of course, are something different from wars, with their human combatants and causes.

Ben Gruber and Mike Blake,"FARIA BEACH/LILAC, Calif. (Reuters) - Firefighters battled several intense wind-driven wildfires early on Friday that have swept across densely populated Southern California, destroying at least 500 structures and chasing 190,000 people from their homes over the past five days. A firefighter is working on extinguishing the Lilac Fire, a fast moving wildfire in Bonsall, California, U.S., December 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake More than 5,700 firefighters from across California and the region worked to stop the spread of six large wildfires and other smaller blazes that erupted since Monday, ranging from Los Angeles up the Pacific coast to Santa Barbara County and stoked by fierce westward Santa Ana winds. [nL1N1O7081] Firefighters and helicopters sprayed and dumped bucketloads of water and fire retardant on flames against a hellish backdrop of flaming mountains and walls of smoke as the blaze hopscotched over highways and railroad tracks and torched rows of houses. The raging fires have forced the evacuation of about 190,000 people and threatened 23,000 homes as of late on Thursday, CAL FIRE said on Twitter. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the country’s second largest with more than 640,000 students, said it closed more than a quarter of its nearly 1,100 schools for the second day in a row on Friday. The University of California Santa Barbara canceled Friday classes as well. The Thomas Fire northwest of Los Angeles grew to 115,000 acres (46,540 hectares) from 96,000 acres (38,850 hectares) and destroyed 439 structures, officials said. More than 2,600 firefighters from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Nevada were battling the blaze, which was 5-percent contained. North of San Diego, another blaze called the Lilac Fire grew from 10 acres to 4,100 acres (1,659 hectares) in just a few hours on Thursday, CAL FIRE said, prompting Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for San Diego County. The blaze destroyed 20 structures and prompted evacuations and road closures. Propane tanks under several houses exploded from the heat, sounding like bombs, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene. Three people sustained burn injuries and another suffered from smoke inhalation in the Lilac Fire. Two firefighters were also injured, CAL FIRE said on Twitter early on Friday. The other fires, which broke out on Monday and Tuesday, have reached into the wealthy enclave of Bel-Air on the west side of Los Angeles. Some major highways in the densely populated area were intermittently closed. In the seaside enclave of Faria Beach, caught between burning mountains and the Pacific Ocean northwest of Ventura, fires spread down the smoking hills. Flames jumped the heavily used U.S. 101 highway and headed toward clusters of beach houses. Firefighters lined up along a railroad track, the last barrier from the flames. Heavy smoke made breathing hazardous in some areas, and residents were urged to stay inside. Ventura County authorities said air pollution measures in the Ojai Valley were “off the charts.” The Los Angeles Police Department tweeted, “LAPD Working to Save Every Californian, Pets Included” along with a photo of a police officer in a respirator rescuing a cat. The Los Angeles County animal shelter said it was hosting 184 pets including llamas, donkeys and horses while reports said 29 horses were burned to death on Tuesday at a ranch in the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Skirball Fire in Los Angeles has forced hundreds of residents in the wooded hills near the Bel-Air neighborhood to evacuate and charred more than 475 acres (192 hectares). Skirball threatened media magnate Rupert Murdoch’s Moraga Estate winery. The property was evacuated, with possible damage to some buildings, Murdoch said in a statement, but “We believe the winery and house are still intact.” Utilities cut power to customers in some mountain communities northeast of San Diego and east of Los Angeles to lessen fire danger. The outage could last several days. The fires are the second outbreak to ravage parts of California this autumn. The celebrated wine country in the northern part of the state was hit by wind-driven wildfires in October that killed at least 43 people, forced some 10,000 to flee their homes and consumed at least 245,000 acres (9,900 hectares) north of the San Francisco Bay area. The California Department of Insurance said the northern California blazes caused insured losses of more than $9 billion.

Sarah Buhr,"Molekule, a San Francisco-based startup with a sleekly designed molecular air purifier started as an immigrant dream twenty years ago and ended up being named one of Time’s top 25 inventions of 2017. The inventor Yogi Goswami came up with the idea when his baby son Dilip started having a hard time breathing the air around him. Dilip suffered from severe asthma but no air purifier at the time seemed to work well enough to clean up indoor pollutants. Traditional HEPA filters simply trap a few pollutants but they don’t grab everything and they don’t break them down before releasing them back into the air. So, Goswami the elder came up with a filter technology that could both suck up things like allergens, mold and bacteria and then break them down to particles one-thousand times smaller than what a HEPA filter can catch using photo electrochemical oxidation (PECO) and nanotechnology to destroy the pollutants on a molecular level and eliminate the full spectrum of indoor air pollutants. The result? Clean, breathable air that even the most sensitive person can handle. Dilip and his sister Jaya Goswami patented the tech and founded Molekule to bring their father’s invention to the rest of us. The company now ships a stylish $800, two-foot-tall cylinder with the patented filter inside. Sure, it’s a lot pricier than most filters out there but the company also offers financing at $67 a month. It was also instrumental in helping folks breathe during the Northern California wildfires this fall. Jaya mentioned Molekule’s inventory was completely depleted during that time and that the company couldn’t ship fast enough — the product is still backordered till January 3rd, 2018. So far Molekule has brought in just over $13 million in venture funding to keep it going. It may be just in time as California is still dealing with wildfires elsewhere and, as global warming releases more C02 into the air, that causes more plants and flowers to release more pollen throughout the year. I visited Molekule’s headquarters South of Market lately to chat with Jaya about the business and get a look at how her filter works. You can see that interview in the video above.","Molekule, a San Francisco-based startup with a sleekly designed molecular air purifier started as an immigrant dream twenty years ago and ended up being named one of Time’s top 25 inventions of 2017.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them California's biggest wildfire on record is expected to burn for the rest of the month, fire officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex Fire has already engulfed 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles. Barely a third of it is under control, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Firefighters are tackling 18 major blazes across the state amid strong winds and low humidity. The fire - which comprises two blazes in the state's north - was declared the biggest in California's history on Monday. Officials had set a target to extinguish the fire by mid-August, but they now say they will need until early September. The fire has burned 75 buildings and led to thousands of evacuations. A separate blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more that 1,500 structures. Burning through almost 160,000 acres, it was 47% contained by late Monday. Meanwhile, more fires have been breaking out, adding to the mammoth workload of fire crews. The so-called Holy Fire, in southern California, grew dramatically and rapidly on Monday, with two hikers needing to be airlifted to safety. How are firefighters coping? At least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but they also receive $2 (£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires. Firefighters told the LA Times about their gruelling schedule. One said his crew had slept - sitting up - in the seats of their fire engine on some nights. ""It's been pretty crazy - they're calling this the new norm,"" said Omar Estorga, captain of a crew working on the Carr Fire. ""In years past, there were one or two big fires a year. Now they're doing three to four huge fires in a week."" Nearly half of the 10 largest California wildfires on record have occurred in the past decade, according to Reuters news agency. Officials have rejected a theory, tweeted by President Donald Trump, that the fires' spread was being ""made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Deputy fire chief Mr Mclean dismissed Mr Trump's comments to US media, saying firefighters had ""plenty of water"" to carry out their work. Will it get worse? National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned that conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes. Now, Montecito and Carpinteria, small coastal towns that suffered the bulk of that devastation, are under new evacuation orders as a strong rains are forecast. As of 8 a.m. Wednesday morning, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office has issued a Recommended Evacuation Warning for areas in the country that were recently hit by the Thomas, Sherpa, and Whittier wildfires. The burned areas clear a path for rocks and debris that otherwise would have probably have been contained during a flash flood. According to the warming, a winter storm arriving Thursday night and continuing through Friday could drop one-third to two-thirds of an inch of rain per hour. The National Weather Service informed officials that this heavy rainfall may be enough to trigger mud and debris flows near burn areas, according to KEYT news. Tree roots are also crucial in holding soil together along steep topography, and with that natural support removed, the land becomes much more susceptible to mudslides. This is especially the case in drought-ravaged regions where the soil is too dry to take in large amounts of water very quickly. This interactive map identifies the areas of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria most threatened by the rains. Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, told the Los Angeles Times that the “very moist system...goes right over” the Thomas Fire burn scar. The Thomas Fire, which ignited in early December, eventually became the state’s largest wildfire on record, burning about 281,900 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Many were also forced to evacuate when the Thomas Fire threatened the region. The back-to-back natural disasters have forced local officials to reconsider how they warn residents about threats and how to distinguish between voluntary and mandatory evacuation zones. “The problem is, sometimes the focus is on the word ‘voluntary,’ rather than the word ‘evacuation,’”Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown recently told The Washington Post. “The reality is, it’s still an evacuation area...Had we known what we now know, we would have evacuated the entire area.” Additional evacuation information will be provided later on Wednesday and if any Mandatory Evacuation Order is issued, everyone must least the designated areas by Thursday, March 1 at 9 a.m. “If at any time people feel threatened, take immediate action,” states the release. “Do not wait for a notification. Those with access and functional needs and those with large animals should leave.” When evacuated Montecito residents started returning to their homes in early February after the devastating January mudslides, they were met with a host of new problems, including unhealthy layers of mud containing everything from sewage to petrochemicals, according to local reports. And now, another decision about evacuation.","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes.

America's golden state is renowned for its hot, dry, sunny climate - and recently for drought and wildfires - so the BBC's Dan Johnson was at least expecting a break from typical British weather when he was posted to Los Angeles at the start of the year. That's not quite how it worked out.
Three months in Los Angeles. It sounded like a wonderful way to spend the winter. I had visions of weekends at the beach and afternoons by the pool. But I arrived to find it was raining. A storm passing through, I was assured. It would be gone in a few days and then the sun would shine. And it did. 
But then another storm came in - and another, and another. I kept tuning in for the local TV weather forecast presented by a man called, I kid you not, Dallas Raines. There wasn't a hint of gloom about his own sunny outlook and bright shiny smile but his map told a very different tale. Downtown Los Angeles saw more rain in January and February than during the whole of last year. It was welcomed by the locals. Refreshing, they said, and much needed to replenish reservoirs and ward off wildfires.

Parts of California have experienced drought since 2011. But after 376 consecutive weeks the state has at last been declared drought-free. The LA River, normally just a trickle at the bottom of a concrete canyon storm drain, has been a gushing torrent, trillions of gallons of water funnelled but then flushed straight out into the Pacific Ocean. There was flooding in the north of the state. Mudslides buried homes on hillsides still cracked and scorched from last year's wildfires. Roads are splitting open and the city's soaring freeways are afflicted by potholes. Drivers panic because they don't know how to deal with the wet conditions.

 A mudslide toppled this palm
People here are used to the weather being a constant, pleasant, mostly dry 20 to 25C, a reliable steady backdrop to LA life. Suddenly, though, it's become a topic of conversation. People talk about the weather. Then they talk about how much they're talking about the weather. Then finally they agree not to talk about the weather. Roofs are leaking after being pounded so heavily. Doors have swelled and filled their frames, drains have overflowed. Rainbows have become regular sights, hailstones a new threat.

During one storm more than 1,000 lightning strikes were recorded. Trees came down. A plane was hit and had to turn back. The airport suffered a power cut. Snow was forecast even as low as the Hollywood sign. In the mountains ski resorts have boomed as long as the roads have been passable and the whole place is green, so green.

The hillsides around LA are lush and the views are stunning. Forget ""smog city"" clouded with pollution, in between the showers the air's been clear and fresh. I've had more time on the ski slope than the beach but I've also been out walking the hills and trekking the canyons taking in the beautiful transformation.

Los Angeles is rarely recognised as a pretty city but when the rain stops and the clouds part it really has looked its best. And on the hills that rise from Lake Elsinore, about an hour away, Walker Canyon has been smothered with a blanket of bright orange poppies. They call this the super bloom. It happens most years, but few can remember it being so colourful, so vibrant and so widespread.

There were queues right down the freeway to take a look. The police had to block roads and divert drivers into a shopping centre car park where they were put on shuttle buses back to the canyon. I met a couple who travelled more than 400 miles (650 km from Utah. The crowds rivalled Disneyland, one reporter exclaimed. The portaloos overflowed and the fleet of ice cream vans was selling out fast as finally the sun shone and things began to warm up.
The orange coated hillsides were quickly covered in people desperate to capture this curious event, posing for pictures of themselves rolling amongst the poppies. Eventually the authorities had to restrict access as the crowds grew unmanageable and the flowers were getting damaged. And the tourists weren't the only ones flocking. Millions of butterflies have been migrating through the state.

Numbers of the Painted Lady butterflies hit an all-time low last year but now they're back, fluttering streams of brown and orange, skipping on the breeze over the hills and through the suburbs of LA.
Image copyrightGetty Images
Like the poppies, the butterflies might feel like a sign the dry times are over. But no-one's under any illusions here. This state still faces massive issues with water conservation, the drought risk and the threat of more deadly wildfires. 
And as I write this it's started raining again. The rumble of thunder has been a familiar sound here so far this year. It may not be what I'd hoped for but it has done something to redress nature's delicate balance.

Three months ago, eight people disappeared on a flight deep in the Amazon. Small planes are often the only way to get around - but because most landing strips are unofficial, pilots have to lie about where they are flying. And this means that when planes go missing, it can be unclear where to look for them.

Marcus Gilmer,"More harrowing footage of the California wildfires shows just how close the fires in the southern part of the state keep creeping to large urban areas. The new video from ABC7 show the Peak Fire burning right up to the edge of a busy Highway 118 in Ventura County, forcing passing motorists to drive in lanes as far from the highway shoulder as possible while firefighters battled the blaze. If there's any good news here, it's that the Peak Fire, which burned 186 acres, has been 100 percent contained according to California Fire officials. But this footage also shows the horrific reality faced by Californians as they try to maintain normalcy even as these deadly fires continue to encroach upon their daily lives. There's a certain terror in the normalization of an event like a helicopter dropping a load of water on a raging fire while regular rush hour traffic creeps by. It's a grim reality driven home by scenes from all around the state, especially the town of Paradise, California, which has been all but wiped out by the Camp Fire, now the deadliest fire in the state's history. While the Peak Fire may have been contained, Southern California is still being burned by both the Woolsey Fire, which has burned over 96,000 acres, and the Hill Fire, which has burned 4,500 acres. And things will likely get worse in the coming days. While the Hill Fire is 90 percent contained as of Tuesday morning, the Woolsey Fire is only 35 percent contained, and the Camp Fire 30 percent contained.

Mark Kaufman,"After transforming the once tranquil town of Paradise, California into charred automobiles and tales of horror, the Camp Fire takes its infamous spot as the deadliest wildfire in California history. At a multi-agency press conference Monday night, the Butte Country Sheriff's office announced that 42 have been confirmed dead. This grim statistic surpasses the 29 Los Angelenos killed by the Griffith Park Fire in 1933. After sparking on November 8, the newly-born blaze raced with rapid, potentially unprecedented speed toward the forested community of 26,000. In just 24 hours, the Camp Fire burned 70,000 acres of exceptionally dried-out vegetation. ""That blows your mind,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, said on Friday. The wildfire isn't just the deadliest blaze in California history. It's also the most destructive. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, reports that 6,453 single residences have been destroyed, while 260 commercial structures went down in flames. This toppled the previous record for destructiveness, set just last year by the Tubbs Fire, which also took 22 lives. SEE ALSO: The EPA completely axed its climate change websites. But why are NASA's still live? Now, seven of the top 10 most destructive wildfires in state history have occurred since the year 2000, and nine of the top 10 largest in recorded state history have occurred over the same period. The reality that the Golden State's fires are burning more land, destroying more homes, and inevitably killing Californians is consistent with a region that's growing hotter, and dryer. Larger wildfires though also strongly influenced by weather and human manipulation of the land are a well-understood consequence of climate change. This is particularly the case in California, which has experienced larger, more destructive wildfires in the last two decades as the region becomes both hotter and drier. In particular, conditions over large swaths of the state, notably forested Northern California, are seeing seasonal records or near-records for dryness. Now enter the Camp Fire. Like many climate change implications, scientists aren't arguing that climate change itself causes wildfires, hurricanes, or drought. These events happen regardless. But climate change often makes these events more extreme. And in the case of the Camp Fire, the inferno capitalized upon land that wasn't just dried out and whipped over the forest by seasonal winds: California has had little-to-no rain this autumn, and experienced record heat this summer. The land is tinder, waiting to burn.","After transforming the once tranquil town of Paradise, California into charred automobiles and tales of horror, the Camp Fire takes its infamous spot as the deadliest wildfire in California history.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Power provider PG&amp;E Corp filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, succumbing to liabilities stemming from wildfires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. 
PG&amp;E, the owner of the biggest U.S. power utility, also filed a motion seeking court approval for a $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, it said in a statement. 
PG&amp;E, which had a debt burden of more than $18 billion, said earlier this month it would need to pursue a court-supervised reorganization in the aftermath of the blazes, including November’s so-called Camp Fire. 
“Throughout this process, we are fully committed to enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, as well as helping restoration and rebuilding efforts across the communities impacted by the devastating Northern California wildfires,” PG&amp;E interim CEO John Simon said. 
The company also intends to pay suppliers in full under normal terms for goods and services provided on or after the filing date of Jan. 29, it said. 
The San Francisco-based company expects the court to act on these requests in the coming days. 
The bankruptcy petition was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.

Tom McKay,"Donald Trump’s administration has moved to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration take control of California water management under the official rationale of fighting the state’s rampaging fires, saying that the water “should be prioritized for wildfire response instead of endangered species protections,” ABC News reported on Wednesday. Of course, state officials say that there is more than enough water to fight the fires. The Commerce Directive announced a directive on Wednesday ordering the National Marine Fisheries Service, a sub-agency of NOAA, to “facilitate access to the water needed to fight the ongoing wildfires affecting the State of California.” Per ABC News, said directive would allow federal officials to overrule protections for threatened and endangered wildlife: The change announced Wednesday would allow federal agencies to expedite decisions about water under an emergency provision of the Endangered Species Act. The directive specifically says that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Marine Fisheries Service, will take over management of water during the wildfire emergency in California. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross directed the Service to tell other federal agencies “the protection of life and property takes precedence over any current agreements regarding the use of water in the areas of California affected by wildfires.” That follows on a very ill-informed tweet from the president earlier this week accusing California officials of wasting water needed to fight the fires, namely that it is “being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” (Actual wildfire experts point to the state’s extreme droughts, which are being worsened by climate change, as well as human encroachment in wildfire-prone areas and arcane funding laws that force the Forest Service to raid its regular forest management funds for emergency firefighting, per the New Republic.) This is probably all as cynical as it sounds, because firefighters who can’t access protected waters are obviously not the cause of the fires raging throughout much of the state. The Trump administration has been hostile to endangered species protections overall, as well as sought to undermine strict California environmental laws on everything from auto pollution to a water-use plan designed to protect salmon. As ABC News noted, there is “concern” what Trump actually intends to accomplish as a result of the order is injecting itself into a fight between the salmon fishing industry, which wants to reduce stress on populations critical to its future, and industrial farmers that want access to protected waterways. Per the Los Angeles Times, wildlife experts say the move is nothing more than a pretext to give the Trump administration the power to bypass laws protecting endangered species and redirect the water to “corporate agribusiness”: “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Kate Poole of the Natural Resources Defense Council said after the statement was issued. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Natural Resources Defense Council water division senior director Kate Poole told ABC News. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “At this point, water supply hasn’t affected any of our operations,” Cal Fire deputy director Mike Mohler told the Times. As the paper noted, firefighters have been drawing water from the Clear Lake reservoir to fight the nearly 300,000-acre Mendocino Complex fire, but the order could be a pretext to undermine California’s regulation of the Shasta Lake reservoir, which feeds recently devastated salmon smolt populations in the Sacramento River. The Times added: As we’ve reported, the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency, has proposed changes in both state and federal water projects to “maximize water deliveries” to non-environmental users and consider “modifications to regulatory requirements” established by the biological opinions. ABC News added that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recently wrote an op-ed saying that part of the solution to the fires needs to include a more “aggressive approach to thinning of forests. That approach is less controversial, but much of the necessary funding is tied up in budget fights, according to the New York Times. University of California, Merced management professor LeRoy Westerling told the paper that California “spending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands... And all that money is being raised because we’re putting a price on carbon.” According to CBS News, firefighting costs in California more than tripled from $242 million in the 2013 fiscal to $773 million in the fiscal year ending in June 30, while smoke from the fires now consuming some 600,000 acres across the state now cover three-quarters of the state.

Mark Kaufman,"Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change. Now, landlocked communities in Colorado have filed their own suit against the oil companies Exxon Mobil and Suncor, both of which extract large amounts of oil and gas from the Colorado ground. The lawsuit, filed by Boulder County, San Miguel County, and the City of Boulder, seeks compensation from oil companies ""for the substantial role they played and continue to play in causing, contributing to and exacerbating climate change."" These climate alterations, they argue, have brought increased heatwaves, droughts, and fire to the region. They believe Exxon and Suncor should pay for the damages. Previously, lawsuits from coastal cities focused on sea level rise, not the other extreme manifestations of global warming. This is the first such climate lawsuit from an inland state, according to the local agencies which filed the complaint. SEE ALSO: In court, oil company admits reality of human-caused global warming, denies guilt ""A few pebbles are turning into a landslide,"" Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute, a legal campaign to protect environments from climate change, said in an interview. ""It shows the tide is turning against fossil fuel producers,"" she said. ""This is about fairness. It's completely unfair that taxpayers are being asked to pay for the costs of the damages done by oil companies."" The Colorado counties contend that oil companies have known about the long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions for 50 years. They cite a report that Stanford Research Institute scientists presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1968. The report warned that carbon dioxide emissions would warm the planet, melt ice caps, and ""may be the cause of serious world-wide environmental challenges."" The report will likely serve as important evidence in the case, should the trial proceed and not be settled out of court or be derailed by a number of legal circumstances. ""I would expect that report and others like it would be key evidence in this case,"" said Siegel. A 2011 drought in Colorado destroyed a winter wheat harvest. Image: Denver Post via Getty Images The suit also cites the 2017 National Climate Assessment, in which 13 federal departments and agencies found that high-temperature events and forest fires, among many other adverse effects, are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. U.S. government scientists stated bluntly: ""This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization."" Some Colorado communities, who know these climatic shifts will adversely affect their business and agricultural sectors, are now working to decrease their dependency on fossil fuels. By 2030, the City of Boulder plans to generate all of its electricity from renewable energies, like solar. ""Communities in Colorado and across the country are already doing what they can to curb their carbon emissions and are spending millions of dollars to adapt to a wide array of harms caused by global warming,"" Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. ""Those costs will only multiply over the next few decades, and taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill that the fossil fuel industry has knowingly run up over the last 40 years."" The Union of Concerned Scientists is a nonprofit science advocacy organization that often speaks out against climate change deniers. In the western United States, one obvious consequence of increased drought and heat are wildfires. Today's wildfires burn nearly year-round and burn significantly more land than wildfires did in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, posing an outsized harm to the forested state, which is consistently battling drought and low snow pack — similar to California. Both Exxon and Suncor sell oil in Colorado. Suncor has an especially prominent presence, as the company runs its operations out of Denver, a city currently facing drought. Suncor sends over 200 truckloads of Colorado crude oil to its refineries each day. Last month, some of the nation's largest oil companies presented their understanding of climate science to a federal judge in San Francisco, in which they admitted humans were contributing to climate change, but side-stepped responsibility. These proceedings move incrementally, so it's not yet known if that hearing will advance to the next step, and then, potentially a trial. But oil companies are now being hit with lawsuits from local governments on both coasts and the interior of the U.S. ""This shows you the list of governments that are being affected and that can take action is almost limitless,"" said Siegel. ""The question is who will be next.""","Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change.

ALAN YUHAS and LANCE BOOTH,"3. California is grappling with two tragedies: the aftermath of a mass shooting and wildfires. Late Wednesday, a gunman killed 12 people at a country music club in Thousand Oaks, outside Los Angeles. The victims included a college freshman, a sheriffs deputy and a man who had survived the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people. And the states grief was compounded by new threats: infernos in the north and south. At least 23 are dead in the so-called Camp Fire, about 100 miles north of Sacramento, above, which has consumed 6,700 structures, left charred forests in its wake and became the most destructive fire in modern state history. Two others have died in fires near Los Angeles. In Southern California, fires forced evacuations of Thousand Oaks and Malibu.

"Judson Jones, CNN","Smoke from wildfires obscures a scenic view near Lewiston, Idaho, on Monday, August 20. With hundreds of wildfires burning across British Columbia and the western United States, smoke is now an everyday occurrence in the Pacific Northwest. ""Unhealthy air has become common across the area due to smoke from wildfires,"" the National Weather Service said Tuesday in its air-quality alert. On Monday, air quality in Seattle reached one of the worst levels it has seen this year. And an ""unhealthy"" air-quality index was reported from British Columbia to Northern California. When air is measured in the ""unhealthy"" category, everyone -- not just sensitive groups -- may begin to experience health effects, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. British Columbia had more fires burning on Tuesday than at any point last year, and the wildfire season still has months to go. Last year was a record year for acres burned across the province, and so far this year is already its third-worst on record. The good news is that air quality will begin to improve later this week as the wind shifts direction. The bad news is the smoke has to go somewhere. Like we have seen over the past few weeks, the smoke will continue to meander with the overall weather pattern. On Monday, smoke was already reaching Denver. By late Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, Texas, was predicting smoke across its horizon. At multiple points this month, satellite images have shown smoke caught up in the jet stream, which acts like a conveyer belt in the upper atmosphere, sending the smoke as far as the East Coast and even over the Atlantic.","With hundreds of wildfires burning across British Columbia and the western United States, smoke is now an everyday occurrence in the Pacific Northwest.",2018-08-21T16:54:46Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Unhealthy air has become common,https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/weather/gallery/wildfires-smoke-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180821093800-01-wildfires-smoke-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,California wildfires,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As out-of-control wildfires raged across the West, U.S. firefighting authorities took a seemingly unusual step late last month: they called up Australia and New Zealand and asked for help. It was the first time the southern hemisphere nations had been called on to fight U.S. wildfires since the summer of 2015, when 68 firefighters from Australia and New Zealand spent a month helping stamp out blazes in the Pacific Northwest. But this nearly 20 year old partnership has proven its value time and again over the years, with Australian and New Zealand firefighters coming north during their off-season and vice-versa. Unfortunately, climate change could make the fiery alliance harder to maintain in the future. The U.S. certainly needed the extra hands on deck this summer. About six million acres have burned across the West this year, already a million acres more than the ten-year average. California in particular has been on a seemingly endless tear of destructive, record setting blazes, from the Carr Fire that ripped through Redding in July to the Mendocino Complex, which spawned the biggest single fire in California’s history earlier this month. Mike Ferris, an emergency management specialist with the U.S. Forest Service, told Earther that when the nation hit a National Preparedness Level 5 with respect to fire activity (this happened just after a fire tornado exploded into life near Redding on July 26), international partners were mobilized. This scale, which ranges from 1 to 5, essentially describes how much of the nation’s state and federal firefighting resources are being used. Level 5 means personnel and other resources are basically stretched to the max, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. “When we hit that mark, that means we’re pretty much spread thin, we’ve exceeded the ability to fill [firefighting] orders that are coming in,” Ferris said. In early August, 140 firefighters from Australia and New Zealand arrived at the the National Interagency Fire Center headquarters in Boise, Idaho, after which they were dispatched to help fight the Carr and Mendocino Complex fires in Northern California, as well as several wildfires in Oregon and Washington. According to Ferris, the foreign firefighters could stay through the end of the month or even longer, depending on need. And with the fire situation out West still looking pretty grim, the need could definitely be there. Ferris said that the similarity in command structure, technology, and the types of fires experienced in the hot, dry West and the Australian bush make it easy for Australian firefighters to integrate into U.S brigades. The same is true when Australia calls on U.S. firefighters. “At the very time where we have sent personnel to the U.S. to help with your fires over there, we actually need them over here.” Paradoxically, the partnership also works well because of the distance: Being in opposite hemispheres means Australia and the U.S. experience their worst wildfires at opposite times of the year. But as a warmer climate prolongs fire season on both sides of the equator, Lynne Tolmachoff, chief of public education at CAL-FIRE, told Earther resource sharing “is becoming more and more of a struggle.” A 2016 analysis by Climate Central found that fire season out West is already more than 100 days longer than it was in 1970, “approaching the point where the notion of a fire season will be made obsolete by the reality of year-round wildfires.” Australia faces a similar reality. Despite it currently being austral winter, bushfires have been flaring up by the dozens in New South Wales and Queensland, fueled by prolonged drought and mild temperatures that have turned the region into a tinderbox. In New South Wales, 14 local council areas have already declare bushfire season open, something that normally wouldn’t happen until October, according to Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council. She sees this as an ominous sign, one that’s in line with the findings of a recent Climate Council report (of which Hughes is a member) showing that bushfire season is intensifying the southwest and southeast, placing additional pressure on firefighting personnel and aircraft that are shared with other countries. “At the very time where we have sent personnel to the U.S. to help with your fires over there, we actually need them over here,” she told Earther. “That’s one of the problems with the climate changing—we see extension both at the beginning and end of the fire season as well as the severity ramping up.” David Bowman, a fire ecologist at the University of Tasmania, agreed that the sharing of wildfire resources would become harder as the climate becomes warmer and drier. “Our fire seasons have merged,” he told Earther. “This summer has just been a watershed moment.” He thinks we need accept the fact that the fiery future is upon us and start proactively addressing that through adaptation, whether that means more prescribed fires, stricter building codes, or managed retreat from the wildland-urban interface. Until we’ve figured out how to manage our new pyrotechnic reality, firefighters will find it harder to catch a break as they’re increasingly being flown across the world to battle blazes all year long.","As out-of-control wildfires raged across the West, U.S. firefighting authorities took a seemingly unusual step late last month: they called up Australia and New Zealand and asked for help.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"My sincere hope is that I dont have to come here each night and report a higher and higher number, the Butte County sheriff, Kory L. Honea, said at a news conference on Monday night. [ Heres how you can help those affected by the fires ] The authorities on Monday night released the names of three people who were killed: Ernest Foss, 65, from Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, from Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, from Magalia. The death toll in the Camp Fire surpassed the Griffith Park Fire of 1933, which killed 29 people and for decades had held the infamous distinction of being Californias deadliest wildfire. Read more about the Griffith Park Fire here. Among the missing in Paradise are many older residents of the Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a close-knit retirement community of 97 pastel-colored homes, where residents were so tightly bound that they ate together, took walks together and often prayed together, bowing their heads at the mailbox, or in the middle of the street, when they heard of anothers misfortune. Just 20 or so of those people are accounted for by the parks owner, Glen Fuller. Ridgewood was flattened by the fire, a remarkable feat of destruction even for a blaze defined by its speed and brutality. Because the fire came from the east the park sits east of downtown it is likely that the people of Ridgewood were among the first to be hit by the flames. Compounding the danger, many of the residents were older, making a hasty escape difficult. This means that those who did make it out chased by the sound of exploding propane tanks have been left to wait for news of the people they cared for most. Its awful.

Mark Kaufman,"The flames scorching the Western U.S. aren't expected to relent anytime soon. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gave its monthly U.S. climate report on Thursday, and they used the opportunity to show that the next couple of months are ripe for an enhanced fire risk out West. SEE ALSO: The baking Pacific Ocean is changing the weather on the Southern California coast After noting the exceptionally hot and dry conditions that stoked destructive wildfires so far this summer, Tim Brown, director of the Western Regional Climate Center, said in a press call that it won't be until after October that ""we see a decline in significant fire potential."" A critical driver of this heightened fire potential is that trees, grasses, and shrubs, known collectively as fuels, are currently ""flirting with all-time record lows for fuel moisture,"" said Brown. In short, hot temperatures and multiple heat waves this summer have parched the land to extreme levels, turning it to tinder. Meaningful rains can solve the problem, but they don't usually show up in many portions of the West until November. What's more, the coming fall months have another potent fire factor that isn't usually seen in August: Strong offshore winds, blowing from the northeast. Called ""diablo winds"" in Northern California, these gusts are hot, dry, and fast and have historically whipped up fires. Case in point: The deadly firestorms that swept through Northern California neighborhoods last summer were stoked by October's diablo winds. On top of all this, Brown underscored that since 1895, there has been a trend in increasing temperatures at night, which ultimately won't allow fuels to cool off and recover. ""This can lead to longer fires and more smoke production,"" he said. But in the last couple decades, ""this trend has taken off,"" said Brown. Taken alone, each of these environmental conditions can stoke fires, but taken together, they invite major flames. Some of the largest fires in California history are burning through the ravaged state right now, and smoke from both the Western U.S. and Canada has traveled thousands of miles away to the Atlantic Ocean, actually engulfing a cyclone. Just out: NASA global temperature for July. It was the 3rd warmest July on record after 2016 and 2017.

Noel Randewich,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of California power utilities plummeted on Friday as wildfires in California left thousands of customers without gas and electricity. PG&amp;E Corp ( PCG.N ), which operates in the northern part of the state, sank 15 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day decline since 2002. Edison International ( EIX.N ), the owner of Southern California Edison Company, dropped 13 percent. PG&amp;E was blamed for wildfires in 2017 that ravaged wine country north of the San Francisco Bay area and killed 46 people, and this week’s fires create new uncertainties for investors in California’s utilities. In June, PG&amp;E said it would record a $2.5 billion in pre-tax expenses for the second-quarter related to last year’s fires after a report said some of them were sparked by trees toppling into PG&amp;E power lines. Three wind-whipped wildfires burned, with one in the northern part of the state advancing to the outskirts of the city of Chico, forcing thousands to flee after it left the nearby town of Paradise in ruins. Voluntary evacuations of 75,000 homes were called for in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles because of a spreading fire, while parts of the oceanside city of Malibu, about 30 miles (48 km) west of downtown Los Angeles, were under evacuation orders. PG&amp;E said in a statement on Friday that 25,000 customers in Butte County were without electricity due to the fire near Chico. It said it turned off gas to about 12,000 customers. Southern California Edison said on its website it notified 74,000 customers that it could shut off their electricity if high winds create a danger of power lines starting a fire. Both utilities said the causes of the fires were not yet determined. In September, the state passed a bill allowing PG&amp;E to pass on to customers some of the costs incurred from liabilities related to wildfires and protect it from going out of business. Shares of PG&amp;E have lost 40 percent since early October 2017, when the fires broke out.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Smoke from the wildfires that have devastated California for weeks has stretched some 3,000 miles to East Coast cities. The Weather Channel reported this week that the haze was expected to linger through Wednesday before an arctic chill descends on the Northeast over the Thanksgiving holiday. While pictures shared on social media captured a colorful hazy sunset, reports confirmed that smoke over cities like New York City and DC had traveled from the west. Meteorologist Gary Szatkowski shared a forecast map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association on Twitter on Monday that captured the smoke plume moving across the United States. Others confirmed the observation, with NBC News meteorologist Kathryn Prociv on Monday tweeting : Wow. I knew tonights sunset over New York City seemed different, and I shouldve realized! Wildfire smoke is in the air, all the way from California. Reports of intensified sunsets following wildfires are common. The Washington Post noted that this phenomenon results from the way light interacts with smoke particles in the upper atmosphere. Smoke is made up of tiny particles from wildfires, which can provide more points for light to bounce off and scatter. This leads to the enhancement of the red and orange hues you see. A deck of clouds near the horizon also has this effect, allowing the suns rays to reflect off the clouds and to our eyes. California now has some of the most toxic air on the planet as the result of the wildfires, and thousands have been left homeless because of their destruction. At least 83 people are dead in the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive fire in Californias history.

Back Story Jerry Garcia once said the Grateful Dead was like licorice : “Not everybody likes licorice, but the people who like licorice really like licorice.” The Grateful Dead broke up on this day in 1995, four months after the guitarist and vocalist’s death, and after playing more than 2,300 concerts over 30 years.

Credit Associated Press Even Mr. Garcia may have underestimated how long die-hard love for the band would last — or how it would evolve, as seen in a trip through the Times archives. In a 1973 article, “ The Grateful Dead Makes a Real Good Hamburger,” our reporter called the band “experts in the art and science of showing people another world.” Another Times writer liked the band’s “feathery locomotive groove.” Our coverage wasn’t always approving: In “ Just What the Tie-Dyed Crowd Wanted,” from 1989, we noted that “Grateful Dead shows are as iffy as blind dates,” and this year we referred to the band’s history as a “ 30-year hippie-pirate soap opera.” More recently, the Dead have been praised as music business pioneers. They favored the now common formula of prioritizing touring over selling records, and were first to encourage fans to make and trade concert recordings. In 2015, the remaining members reunited for “Fare Thee Well” shows. The average ticket price for some of them was $938.

MATT STEVENS and JULIE TURKEWITZ,"But a new report from the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, says the biggest reason is that more Southern Californians are buying cars. Between 2000 and 2015, the study says, private vehicle ownership in the area increased from 1.7 to 2.4 vehicles per household. And the study says car ownership grew fastest among “foreign-born households” and other low-income people who tend to take public transit the most. “Transit today relies on a high rate of use by a narrow base of people,” the report’s authors wrote. “But if that narrow base of people is acquiring vehicles, transit’s healthy future lies in reversing those circumstances, and striving for at least a low rate of use by a broad base of people.” In a region of 18.8 million people, they note that about 77 percent use public transit rarely or never. It’s a pool of “vast untapped potential.” The obstacle? Driving remains too darn cheap.

The Times reporter Maggie Astor spoke with more than a dozen people from California to Cairo about how climate change is affecting their decisions to reproduce or not. Some are swearing off children because they’re concerned about raising a family in a world of receding shorelines and violent fires. Others are disturbed by the idea of expanding their carbon footprint — having a child is one of the costliest environmental actions a person can take. Among those interviewed was Cate Mumford, 28. Though her Mormon religion teaches that God has commanded followers to “multiply and replenish the earth,” she will not have children of her own, she said. Instead she will adopt.

"ADAM NAGOURNEY, JULIE TURKEWITZ and JOSE A. DEL REAL","So in that spirit, here are some of the responses we got, on social media and in emails to our newsletter, California Today. They have been edited for clarity and brevity. The entire premise — making the newspaper some sort of parable or metaphor for the city as a whole — is misguided. First of all, L.A. is not an “Eastern establishment” city. The L.A. of today, the “metropolis” that it is, is a modern (i.e. 20th century) city. Here it doesn’t matter what your family name is, who you are, where you came from. L.A. was built by people coming here with a dream and trying to make a go at it. It’s a spirited Western town that has grown (and matured) into a liberal, educated, cultural urban center. The writers of this article are stuck in an old N.Y.C. image of L.A. as a cultural void, spread out, no core, no heart, etc. — wehoscott Los Angeles Imagine if the Upper West Side had a different mayor and didn’t contribute to N.Y.C.’s tax code? That’s what we have here. This is not a united city, because it is separate fiefdoms. I’ve always found it absurd. To really unite this city you’d have to have these rogue neighborhoods return to the city of L.A. — Tim, Los Angeles L.A. is a city of the future and its media is future-based: a daily paper thrown on your driveway is a thing of the past. We have KCRW, we have blogs, we have people interested in reporting and in knowing. Hopefully someone will take up the L.A. Times mantle and make it into the multimedia platform it should be that covers our state in a contemporary way. — David Law, Los Angeles What a bizarre article, condescending to and denigrating an entire city as well as the L.A. Times. A city that never quite came together? A lack of civic institutions? No philanthropy? Yes, L.A. has problems; every city does. But we have the L.A. Philharmonic, Lacma, MOCA and the Getty, and a government that tries to deal with the problems all cities face. — Emmy G, Los Angeles My city needs cohesion and honesty. It needs accountability. We have real problems. The first to come to mind is homelessness. It has literally exploded before our eyes. I would love to feel like journalists are investigating and highlighting issues and holding a light to dark and thorny issues, forcing us all to see and know what is going on in this vast city and how our government is dealing with this. — Jennifer Tucker California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

Some California communities are stuck with reputations for “blight and bad vibes” that they just can’t shake. The decline of local news may exacerbate the problem. [ The Los Angeles Times ] And Finally... When President Trump spoke during his State of the Union address about tightening immigration laws to keep out members of MS-13, the violent transnational street gang, many Angelenos working with former gang members raised their eyebrows at one omission: MS-13 was formed in Central Los Angeles, not Central America as the president suggested. Jorja Leap, a University of California Los Angeles anthropologist, lamented the common misconception that MS-13 was brought to the United States from El Salvador. The group was in fact able to thrive in the 1980s amid the intense poverty in Los Angeles. MS-13, she said, took advantage of a social situation in which young people had experienced abuse, trauma or social isolation in the United States, not abroad. MS-13’s brand of violence then spread back to Central America, exported by immigrants in the United States who were deported. Its leadership, such as it is, is based in El Salvador and most of its members are there. “Any gang is opportunistic. They go where the population is vulnerable,” Dr. Leap said, pointing out MS-13 has particularly terrorized the immigrant community. “They stick to the communities where they can intimidate, where they can abuse and blindside people.” She said the gang has lost power in Los Angeles in recent years, part of a collaboration between City Hall and law enforcement and activists, who have stressed rehabilitation for gang members seeking an exit ramp from lives of crime. She pointed to such collaborations as the path to reducing gang violence. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com.

Shannon Connellan,"While the Woolsey Fire burning in Southern California has been 98 percent contained as of Tuesday night, it's left a huge mark on the landscape. According to the state's fire services, the wildfire has burned almost 97,000 acres, an area so vast you can see it from space. SEE ALSO: Before and after photos show the devastation of the California wildfires NASA shared an image of the ""burn scar"" taken on Nov. 18 using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) that sits on on the space agencys Terra satellite. Burned vegetation in the area appears brown, while green indicates unburned vegetation. Buildings and roads are light gray and white. According to NASA, the colors have been altered to look more natural. According to a post on NASA's earth observatory website, this satellite data assists with recovery efforts after the wildfires. In particular, the images are being used for a NASA-funded project with Idaho State University called the Rehabilitation Capability Convergence for Ecosystem Recovery (RECOVER), an online mapping tool that allows fire managers to access data on 26 variables including land slope, soil type, and burn severity.

IVAN PENN,"When the utilities dont get what they want, they start turning the power off, said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group active on a range of issues. They were disappointed in the Legislature. They clearly want more. They want no liability. Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, which represents consumers before California regulators, said her organization worried about the companies broad authority to cut peoples power. Its always scary to consumers to trust them with a such a life-and-death issue, Ms. Spatt said. Wildfires have moved from a seasonal event to a year-round occurrence. State law allows the utilities to cut power to customers whenever there is a risk to public safety. The change in weather patterns that were seeing, we have to look at everything in a new light, Mr. Herrington said. It is something that truly is a last resort for us. Southern California Edison used blackouts in wildfire prevention in 2003 and again in 2017 in the Idyllwild area of Riverside County. It warned 130,000 customers over the weekend that they could face blackouts in the face of increasing Santa Ana winds a longtime autumn scourge, blowing hot, arid gusts from inland deserts toward brush and woodland. San Diego Gas and Electric became the most frequent user of the strategy after a series of fires in 2007 killed 10 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Since 2013, the utility has cut service 19 times to customers. On Sunday and Monday, 4,000 of its customers received warnings of possible blackouts, though just 360 lost power.","Citing safety concerns, power companies are cutting off electricity when and where the hazard is greatest.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out. The Ranch Fire can now officially take its place in the record books, having burned a grand total of 459, 123 acres. The Ranch Fire was part of the Mendocino Complex, which lit up on July 27. Paired with the River Fire, the complex became the largest fire in state history in early August. Just a week later Ranch Fire took the title of the largest single fire in California history, fanned by powerful winds over a hot, dry landscape. The Ranch Fire continued its smoldering march through Mendocino National Forest just northeast of Ukiah until it was officially declared out on Wednesday. Crews are doing mop up work, helping clean up fire lines dug to contain the fire and searching for any last hot spots. While the blaze is out, the California’s state fire agency warned plumes of smoke could still rise due to the warm, dry weather. As crews continue assessing the landscape, a large closure remains in effect for the forest, including the Snowy Mountain Wilderness Area. The Ranch Fire was one of a few notable fires in California this summer. The Carr Fire left a swath of destruction in Redding and spawned a firenado while the Ferguson Fire shut down parts of Yosemite National Park. And we may not be done yet. Southern California’s fall fire season is just getting started. The Santa Ana winds that usher hot, dry air into the region helped fan last year’s Thomas Fire, which held California’s largest fire crown for all of eight months. The winds are calm for now, but they may not stay that way. “So after the present reprieve, I would not be surprised to see a renewed surge in heat, wind, and fire activity before the winter rains arrive,” UCLA climate scientist and California weather watcher Daniel Swain wrote on his blog this week. “I’ll keep my fingers crossed that we get a break this year, though. It’s already been a rough few years as far as California wildfires go.” All fires now occur in the context of a warming climate. This was California’s second-hottest summer on record, which no doubt helped the Ranch Fire take the title of California’s largest fire yet. Hotter conditions melt out snowpack earlier and dry out vegetation, creating a landscape more prone to explosive conflagrations. Research has shown that climate change has essentially doubled the area burned in western forests since the 1984. It’s enough to make one wonder if we should keep building in these places.","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out.

THOMAS FULLER and INYOUNG KANG,"Adding to the 13 coroner teams from across the state that are already working to locate the dead in and around Paradise, the sheriff announced a sharp increase in experts who specialize in finding human remains: 150 extra search-and-rescue personnel, cadaver dogs and two portable, temporary morgue units from the military. Sheriff Honea is also seeking to bring in a machine to expedite the analysis of DNA to speed up the identification of remains. Search teams have found the remains of Paradise residents in cars, homes and outdoors. The sheriff on Monday identified three of the victims: Ernest Foss, 65; Jesus Fernandez, 48; and Carl Wiley, 77. My sincere hope is that I dont have to come here each night and report a higher and higher number, Sheriff Honea said.

"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908, https://www.facebook.com/markberman","OJAI, Calif. — As the Golden State continued to burn for a sixth day, California officials warned that higher Santa Ana winds forecast through the weekend could create more erratic fire behavior, offering little chance of a reprieve for residents and firefighters who have endured flames and smoke for nearly a week. On Saturday, multiple wildfires continued to rage throughout Southern California, cloaking the area in nightmarish flame and towering plumes of smoke so thick they were visible from space. On Friday, authorities reported the first fire-related death: The Ventura Medical Examiner Office identified a body found on Wednesday as Virginia Pesola, 70, from Santa Paula, the “only confirmed fire-related death in Ventura County to date.” Pesola had died from “blunt force injuries with terminal smoke inhalation and thermal injuries” in a traffic incident during “active fire evacuation,” according to the county medical examiner. As the fires spread, much of the region also faces the threat posed by the dense smoke. Public health officials warned of dangerously bad air quality and said it was particularly threatening for the elderly, children and people with respiratory or heart conditions. Los Angeles County issued smoke advisories, urging people to remain indoors when possible, while Santa Barbara County officials said they expected to distribute 50,000 masks to area residents. Phil Moyal, an air quality specialist in Ventura County, said the smoke was causing hazardous conditions there, especially in the Ojai Valley, which is surrounded by mountains that have been trapping the smoke. “When we say ‘off the charts,’ we mean off the charts,” Moyal said Friday about air-quality measurements there. “I would not want to be there too long... I would tell people to go to Seattle. There are not many places in Southern California that are clean or will stay clean, and that can change in a minute depending on the wind.” [ How Santa Ana winds spread wildfires ] There were a few positive signs for the state. Officials battling the Thomas Fire in Ventura County — the biggest active blaze in the state after burning through 140,000 acres — spoke in cautiously optimistic tones as they lifted evacuation orders for cities along the fire’s southern edge: Santa Paula, and parts of Ventura. The coastal enclaves of Carpinteria and Santa Barbara were still under threat as the fire’s northern vanguard continued to move. And officials said that winds which could strike up at a moment’s notice remained a concern. The fire had burned more than 200 buildings in that county, alone. President Trump on Friday declared a state of emergency in California, ordering federal aid to the state in response to a request from Gov. Jerry Brown (D). Firefighters, joined by reinforcements from outside the state, battled the blazes. Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed and thousands more remain at risk as more than a half-dozen blazes continued to burn, officials said. The fires combined to burn across nearly 250 square miles. In San Diego County, firefighters continued to battle the Lilac Fire, which injured three civilians and two firefighters. Residents who fled described rapidly moving flames. “Oh my God, the heat, the heat,” Clifford Sise, a horse trainer who had to evacuate while trying to get his horses out of the San Luis Rey Downs, a racehorse facility in San Diego County. “One of my fillies wouldn’t leave, she burned to death in like one minute. I had ’em all out, and then when I went back after. I must’ve had two little babies run back in their stalls and they died.” The winds fanning the flames were lighter Friday, but forecasts call for them to increase again through Sunday. Red flag warnings of heightened fire risk will remain in place for at least Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Sunday, when winds could peak at around 50 mph. That could combine with extremely low humidity to create more unpredictable fire behavior and severe conditions for firefighters on the ground. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Dianne Jacob, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, said Friday at a news briefing. “We need to stay vigilant and be prepared.” Across the region, people who fled recounted fire and smoke that seemed to come from everywhere. The sounds of helicopters woke Patricia Hampton and her boyfriend at their house in Ventura as the Thomas Fire was growing. When they looked outside, the ground was covered in ash, the air so smoky it was hard to breathe, she said. They hopped on bicycles and tried to flee. “We didn’t know what had happened,” Hampton, 48, said at a temporary shelter at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Thursday, two days after leaving home. “We rode down into town trying to make sense of what we were seeing — police everywhere, firetrucks, helicopters. It was like a war zone. You could hear transformers blowing up.” In Los Angeles, Lili Hamedi said she went into her yard during the week and found her swimming pool filled with ash. “We were surrounded by the fires,” said Hamedi, who lives in the Encino area. “I heard the fire. I never knew you could hear a fire.” In Ojai, the favorable weather Friday allowed fire crews to make progress against what had been multiple lines of flames in recent days. A morning offshore wind calmed to nothing by midday, then shifted to a light breeze that had firefighters near Ojai preparing to defend the western edge of the city. Along the Thomas Fire’s northern edge near Carpinteria, a small city in Santa Barbara County, fire crews, backed by helicopters dropping water near homes and ranches, made great strides against multiple blazes Friday morning and throughout the day. Parts of the city remained under mandatory evacuation orders, but the flames just miles away the previous day had turned into smoldering plumes of smoke. This let fire crews concentrate on Ojai, a quirky town where New Age and the Old West mix in the hills high above Ventura. It has been surrounded by the Thomas Fire for much of the week. Over several breezeless hours, smoke settled into the canyons and dry river beds, complicating visibility for the helicopters making drops to the north and west of the city. For firefighters, the stillness meant the wind was shifting, so they had to get ready, said Forrest Rowell, a battalion chief and strike team leader from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department. “We’re preparing to go in and keep the fire off the city from the north, and clean up some edges that could worsen with the new wind,” Rowell said. The smoke spreading through Ventura pushed Jet Kauffman to pack up her two dogs, two cats and valuables into a car. “Everything is literally burning around you and it’s raining ash and ember, and things are just lighting on fire around you, and you can’t really do much to stop it,” Kauffman said. Her boyfriend, Shaun Kelleher, stayed behind to protect the Victorian house he bought in 2012. He looked out a back window and saw the glow creeping over the hillside, consuming palm trees in its path. The 32-year-old, ignoring mandatory evacuation orders, threw a scarf over his mouth and goggles over his glasses and ran outside to douse the home and yard with a hose. “I saw a house light on fire, and that’s when I started to freak out, because there was no one around,” Kelleher said. A second house burst into flames, then a third, and then an apartment complex. Fire and smoke were getting closer to his house and the wind was picking up. Kauffman, at a friend’s house, called Kelleher and pleaded with him to leave. Then he heard a sound that filled him with relief: Sirens. Some 20 firetrucks pulled into the area, he said, and firefighters stopped the flames bearing down on the house. The couple ended up in Thousand Oaks, a nearby city, staying with Kelleher’s father. Their Victorian home in Ventura had no power or drinkable water, but it was still standing. Ventura resident Nate Weber wasn’t so fortunate. The anesthesiologist and his wife Christine fled Monday evening with their four- and two-year-old daughters to his mother’s house in Oxnard Shores. Early the next morning they got a call from a neighbor: their home at the top of a hill on Mint Lane was gone. Nate returned to find sympathetic neighbors crowded around what remained of his house. He said the experience was “similar to a friend dying.” “I lived in that house six years, but it was a very formative six years,” he said. “I got married, I had two kids — just watching the kids grow up in that house, all those memories.” The kids, too, have had trouble processing the loss. When he showed his 4-year-old daughter a picture of the burned home, she remarked about how sad it was. “Then she goes off to play,” he said. “Two hours later she said, ‘Dad, I’m ready to go home.’ ” Wang, Berman and Rosenberg reported from Washington. Rob Kuznia and Noah Smith in Los Angeles; Soo Youn in Ventura, Calif.; and Angela Fritz in Washington contributed to this report. The Thomas Fire burns between the 101 Freeway and the Pacific Ocean.

"Matt Novak on Earther, shared by Matt Novak to Gizmodo","President Donald Trump tweeted some incredibly ignorant things over the weekend about the wildfires that have so far killed at least 31 people in California. Firefighters have explained repeatedly why the president is so wrong, but CNN meteorologist Tom Sater broke it all down on Sunday to show why President Trump has no idea what hes talking about. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor, President Trump tweeted on Saturday. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! Sater started his segment on CNN by explaining that he enjoys covering the weather because, outside of climate change issues, its neutral and doesnt often intersect with politics. But when the president says something this terrible, even guys like Sater clearly have to speak out against it. This is wrong on so many levels, Sater explained. This has nothing to do with forest management. Were not looking at dense forest here, Sater said while gesturing at a photo of Paradise, California, where the town has been completely wiped out by the fires over the past few days. Especially down in Malibu! Forest management has nothing to do with mountain winds coming down the passes at 70 miles per hour. Or humidity levels in one hour dropping Thursday from 35 percent down into single digits, dryer than most deserts, Sater continued. Its like taking funds from the National Hurricane Center until you stop all these hurricanes, its the same notion, Sater said. But more importantly, people died in their homes, they found bodies outside their homes, in their vehicles trying to flee, outside their vehicles just trying to run away. You can watch the rest of the segment on YouTube, where Sater explains how firefighters are working their tails off, both in the northern part of the state to battle the Camp Fire and in the southern part of the state to fight the Woolsey Fire. Its not exactly news that President Trump is a blathering idiot. But when youve got the weather guy riled up you know something is very, very wrong. President Trump has always been a danger to national security. But his latest statements are particularly galling, even for Trump. People are dying, and hes threatening to pull funding. There are only two options: Hes either too dumb to be president or hes too callous to the suffering of his fellow Americans to be president. Either way, America is suffering because hes president. And that suffering isnt going away anytime soon.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","While visiting California this weekend, President Donald Trump said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto told him that raking was part of the countrys forest management before insinuating that its something the United States should be doing to mitigate wildfires. The remark was bizarre, to be sure. But now, Niinisto says that no such conversation ever happened. Answering questions from reporters with California officials about the states wildfires on Saturday, Trump said that management of the floors of the forest was important for avoiding future environmental catastrophes like the Camp Fire, which has become the states deadliest and most destructive fire in its history. He then pointed to a conversation he claimed he had with Niinisto. You look at other countries where they do it differently and its a whole different story, he said. I was with the president of Finland and he said, Were a forest nation. He called it a forest nation. And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they dont have any problem. And when it is, its a very small problem. It now appears that the conversation never happened. Asked about the remark by Finish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, Niinisto said he didnt recall a discussion about raking, though he did recall telling the president that we take care of our forests. Beyond the fact that Finlands president insinuated this conversation about raking happened exclusively in Trumps mind, perhaps at the very moment the words fell out of his mouth, it is not the first time Trump has mentioned raking in relation to Californias fires. Just one day before visiting Paradise, the California town that was essentially burned to the ground by the Camp Fire, Trump again mentioned raking. As it appears that his cited source now denies any such conversation ever happened, its unclear how or why the president has latched onto this bizarre and vastly oversimplified solution to a complex problem.

Perhaps it should have. “Could we have looked forward to what we would end up having, we would have panicked,” he said. “There’s no Goldilocks moment here — either there’s a whole lot of snow or very little.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

TIM ARANGO and MATT STEVENS,"Writing in The Los Angeles Times recently, Gustavo Arellano, a columnist, said: “Those young people helped launch the Chicano movement in Southern California and created a generation of leaders.” Mr. Arellano worries that the national news media coverage of the Parkland-inspired activists will ignore the Chicano walkouts, and focus instead on the youth movements against the Vietnam War and segregation in the South, and more recent youth-led protests against President Trump’s immigration policies. But in Los Angeles this week no one is ignoring that history. Los Angeles schools have held a number of events, including a re-enactment on Monday of a famous meeting in 1968 between Cesar Chavez, the Chicano labor leader, and Robert F. Kennedy. “Chicano history was not separate from American history, it was a part of American history,” Mr. Verdugo said. One of the sparks for the protests here in 1968 was a high dropout rate among Latino students. And Mr. Verdugo, who was failing in school, left for good after the protests. But later that year he was admitted to U.C.L.A. under an affirmative action program. “I walked out in March, dropped out in May, and in October I walked on to the campus of U.C.L.A.,” he said. He never graduated, but years later earned a degree from another university and went on to a long career in social work.

Among other things, the museum says you can take “really cool” photos. But … wasn’t that what was the Museum of Ice Cream was for? California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

"Melissa Etehad, Ruben Vives","Firefighters hoped to make more progress Saturday against wildfires burning from Ojai to Oceanside, destroying more than 500 structures and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee from their homes. As Santa Ana winds finally died down Friday, crews were able to begin containment of some of the biggest fires. But red flag fire warnings remain in effect, and forecasters say the Santa Anas will return to San Diego County late Saturday evening. On Saturday, Gov. Jerry Brown plans to survey the devastation Saturday in Ventura, the hardest hit by this week’s firestorms. Firefighters had a successful day battling flames on the southern edge of the Thomas fire, working toward the coast as well as parts of Ojai thanks to favorable wind patterns, a weakening of the winds and fire crews improving fire lines they had established, according to Bill Murphy, a spokesman for Cal Fire. By Friday evening, the Thomas fire had burned 143,000 acres and was 10% contained. As a result, Murphy said evacuations for most of the city of Ventura and Santa Paula were lifted. Firefighters continued to encounter difficulty on the east side of the fire above Fillmore. Crews used helicopters to drop water on that portion to try to contain the fire. Firefighters also made progress on Highway 33 and the 101 Freeway on the west side of the blaze. In Los Angeles County, firefighters were making progress on blazes in Sylmar, Santa Clarita and Bel-Air. Even as the tide began to turn, residents were beginning to come to terms with the devastation and loss from the fires. On Friday afternoon, Jacklyn Mann, 29, sifted through the charred metal and debris that was once her house. Her brother Ben Mann, 26, and her father, Roger Mann, 60, scoured the debris. The family is one of the first residents on their block in Ventura to return to the neighborhood. All down the windy street, houses like the Mann family’s had been destroyed by the Thomas fire. The Manns came back with one goal in mind: to salvage any household items they could find that held sentimental value. “I found another one!” Jacklyn shouted to her dad. In her hand was a dusty ceramic pinch pot that her other brother, Dixon Mann, had made years ago in elementary school. “Oh, cool. Sweet,” Roger responded. Lined on the side of their property were small items the family had dug up that day. Among them was Ben Mann’s swimming medals from when he was a child. The family decided to spend the day digging through the rubble after they had earlier found a Christmas ornament that belonged to Jacklyn. It had been hanging on their Christmas tree, which they had decorated on Monday before the fires destroyed their house. “We didn’t want to wait,” Jacklyn said. “It’s weird to see what survived the flames.” In northern San Diego County, the Lilac fire had 4,100 acres burned and 105 structures destroyed along the Highway 76 corridor that stretches west from the 15 Freeway through Bonsall and Fallbrook. But officials cautioned that dry, swirling Santa Ana winds are expected to return Saturday and Sunday and could kick up embers that might start new fires. At least 65 of the houses lost were at the Rancho Monserate Country Club, a mobile home community near where the flames leapt to life late Thursday morning. The blaze took off on a fast-paced rampage that also killed 35 horses at the storied San Luis Rey Downs thoroughbred-training facility and injured two firefighters and four civilians, including a horse trainer burned over 50% of her body. Among those coping with their losses was Jon Stecker, who stood alongside what had been his two-story, 2,700-square foot home on Olive Hill Road in Bonsall as the sun began to set Friday. “It’s gnarly, huh?” he said. He lost not just his home, but two other houses on the 1.2 acre property he’s owned since 1992. He’d been at work in San Diego when the fire hit, but said he knew his home was gone because his wife had told him she saw a solid wall of burning trees across the street as she fled. Stecker, 53, pointed to what had been his deck, now just a pile where a tiny orange flame or two stubbornly flickered. “Want a tub?” he asked, motioning at a buried bathtub, which on Thursday morning had been in a second-floor bathroom. He said he lost a horse and a pig in the fire, but his wife had been able to get their dogs out. They also lost three vehicles, now just metal shells. Waiting for his insurance agent, he said he’s resigned to rebuilding. “What can you do?” he said. Several people were hurt in the San Diego fires. Among those injured Thursday was Martine Bellocq, a trainer at San Luis Rey Downs, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over 50% of her body as she tried to rescue six horses, according to Alan Balch, executive director of the California Thoroughbred Trainers. She was airlifted to UC San Diego Medical Center and placed in a medically induced coma, Balch said. Bellocq was among several trainers, grooms and staff who tried to evacuate hundreds of thoroughbreds as the fire roared toward the sprawling, 200-acre, 500-stall training facility Thursday afternoon. In the rush to get horses to safety, many were simply allowed to run free once the flames began to sweep through the barns. Many of the 35 horses killed there perished in their stalls.

Mark Kaufman,"After leaping over California's Sacramento River, the swiftly-moving Carr Fire entered the City of Redding, home to more than 90,000 people, on Thursday night. The firestorm melted transmission lines, sent a towering, mushroom-like cloud into the sky, and prompted the evacuation of entire communities in the western part of the city. And two people have already lost their lives while fighting the fire. ""It easily moved across the river,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, who works and lives in Redding, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: The heat waves scorching Europe were given a serious boost by climate change ""The river is reasonably wide in that location,"" Belongie added. ""It’s normally a significant barrier — but not when you have that sort of fire."" Redding sits in a heavily-forested region of the state, a place rife in dry vegetation, like much of parched California. Making matters worse, the National Weather Service predicts temperatures in Redding will hit 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, prompting the service to issue an ""excessive heat warning."" ""It is extreme fire behavior — and dramatic — just like you would see in the Hollywood movies, if you will,"" said Belongie. ""It's quite the disaster."" The forests around Redding are particularly fire-prone, as extended periods of warm weather have dried out the grasses and vegetation, turning them to tinder, said Belongie. The Western U.S., and California specifically, have been besieged by powerful fires this summer, which recently forced the closure of a smoke-filled Yosemite National Park. This follows on the heels of California's worst fire season on record — in 2017. This is part of a growing trend, as wildfires now burn substantially more land than they did 30 years ago. Burned forests are now releasing so much fine, burned material into the air that, during the worst events, a vast swathe of the Western U.S. now experiences worsening air quality, while the rest of the nation's air gradually improves. Wildfires may be common in the Western U.S. — sparked by lightning, downed power lines, or people acting foolishly — but their acceleration into massive, dominant fires is further stoked by human-caused climate change, say scientists. Warm air further dries out the land and provides blazes with more fuel, though gusty winds are hugely important contributors — if not the most important factor. Historic mismanagement of forests also play a significant role. If you live in NW #Redding GET OUT NOW, !

Belongie said she has prepared for the worst, if flames, edged on by winds pushing flames over parched land, continue moving through Redding.

Mark Kaufman,"Ash is once again raining down upon California's Bay area, as the parched land to the north ignites. Not eight months after firestorms ravaged Northern California wine country, the flames have returned to the region. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, reports that the County Fire started at around 2:00 p.m. on June 30, and as of the morning of July 1, had rapidly spread to 16,500 acres. The agency says 110 fire trucks have been deployed to the Yolo County area, which abuts California's famed Napa wine valley. Yolo itself is also rich in vineyards and tasting rooms. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires Both of these areas typically have hot, dry summers. Even so, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Drought Monitor shows these regions are experiencing ""abnormally dry"" conditions. Meaningful rains aren't expected during the summer, and lacking winter rains left the region with about 30 percent less rainfall than usual, as of late June. These parched lands, combined with hot temperatures and wind, fueled the County Fire, as well as others to the north, like the Pawnee Fire. In October 2017, historic fires in and around the wine country burned down over 8,000 structures, killing 44 people. These flames were helped by "" diablo winds "" reaching 79 miles per hour and vegetation that had been turned to tinder, after being dried out by the hottest California summer on record. More extreme wildfires are an expected part of California's future, as scientists say climate change has begun to lock into a cycle where ""climate whiplash"" is the norm. Under these conditions, the state will alternate between years of extreme drought followed by deluges of rain. And during times of extended drought, more wildfire is expected. Already, the pattern appears to have emerged. From 2012 to 2016, the state experienced its worst drought on record, and likely worst in centuries more. This was followed by a winter deluge, one of the wettest in the state's history.","Ash is once again raining down upon California's Bay area, as the parched land to the north ignites.

Dan Whitcomb,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Cooler temperatures will bring some relief to firefighters battling California wildfires, but not until later in the week, the National Weather Service said. “No luck today, but starting Monday, we’re going to see a gradual cool down, as we shave just a few degrees off each day until about midweek it gets to something like normal, in the mid-90s (Fahrenheit) inland and 80s at the coast,” said Jim Hayes of the NWS Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “Today it’s going to be another miserable, hot, dry day,” he said early Sunday, noting that temperatures in some areas inland will hit triple digits. Santa Barbara County officials declared a local emergency on Saturday as a fast-moving wildfire destroyed 20 homes and other structures and forced thousands of residents to evacuate. The Holiday Fire, one of more than three dozen major blazes burning across the U.S. West, broke out on Friday evening near the beach community of Goleta, California, South of Santa Barbara, and raced through the seaside foothills. The flames forced more than 2,000 people to flee their homes, and left thousands more without power, prompting the emergency declaration which frees additional funds for the firefighting effort. As of early Sunday, the Holiday Fire burned through more than 100 acres and was 80 percent contained, officials posted on the Internet. Dozens of blazes have broken out across the western United States, fanned by scorching heat, winds and low humidity in a particularly intense fire season. This year’s fires had burned more than 2.9 million acres (1.17 million hectares) through Friday, already more than the annual average of about 2.4 million acres (971,000 hectares) over the last 10 years, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. On Friday, the remains of an unidentified person were found near a home burned to the ground by the Klamathon fire, which broke out on Thursday near California’s border with Oregon. It marked the first fatality of the fire season in California. The Klamathon, which has destroyed 15 structures and blackened nearly 22,000 acres (8,900 hectares), was 20 percent contained as of early Sunday, a spokeswoman said. Elsewhere in Northern California, the County Fire has charred 88,375 acres (35,764 hectares) in sparsely populated wooded areas of Napa and Yolo Counties. Some 3,660 firefighters faced with inaccessible terrain, high temperatures and low humidity, were battling the fire, which was only 48 percent contained. It has destroyed 10 structures, damaged two and threatened 110. In Colorado, officials said fire crews had made “much progress” battling the Spring Creek fire, which broke out on June 27 and has consumed 106,985 acres (43,295 hectares).

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire. The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

Mark Kaufman,"At around 7:00 p.m. PT on July 26, a towering vortex of smoke and flame spun into the California sky. The tornado-like column rose over 16,000 feet into the air. It was a violent night for the Carr Fire, which after preying on profoundly dry forests, breached the Sacramento River and headed into the City of Redding, home to over 90,000 people. There’s no official name for the dramatic phenomena, though “firenado” has become popular. SEE ALSO: California hit with two heat waves in less than a month. Here's why it matters. “I’m not particularly fond of the term,” Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, who works and lives in Redding, said in an interview. “But it works because of the strength of the fire whirl, the size — and the destructiveness is not unlike the power of a tornado.” The deadly Carr Fire, like many of the fires now burning across the besieged Golden State, was propelled by weather — strong gusty winds and hot temperatures — but enhanced by climate change, which has boosted summer temperatures to record or near-record temperatures around the globe and in Redding. Dominant fire tornados, stoked by incredible heat and other ingredients, have been observed before, but not too often. “It’s relatively rare — but it’s not an unknown phenomenon,” said Belongie, noting that substantially smaller fire whirls can often be spotted amid fires — though not imposing vortices. “What’s really unheard of here is getting it to come down to a population center,” Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies wildfire plume dynamics, said in an interview. ""Almost every fire has some sort of small whirl."" How did the firenado form? Not every fire has the benefit of burning over grasses, shrubs, and trees — collectively known as fuels — that have been dried-out by extreme heat. ""You have an extreme event in terms of July probably being the hottest July in northern Sacramento Valley on record,"" said Lareau. That further drives down the moisture in the fuels, he noted, making the land more combustible. ""All that energy can be converted into heat,"" said Lareau, which can then rise into the air at speeds of 130 mph. ""This is the mechanism driving these vortices."" The rising air forces the vortex to stretch upward, and spin faster. ""It's the ice skater effect,"" said Belongie, noting how ice skaters pull their arms in to whirl faster. ""It's the same physics."" Here is another radar rendering of the #CarrFire plume during the destructive vortex. The plume undergoes rapid vertical development, growing from 6 to 12 km (19-&gt;39Kft) in 40 min. Thats a lot of stretching and a possible explanation for vortex intensification. #CAwx #CAfire pic.twitter.com/1CTHAvl6Di — Neil Lareau (@nplareau) July 29, 2018 But unlike tornados, which typically form during thunderstorms, these firenados start on the ground level. The sources of the initial spin are ""countless,"" said Lareau. The fire tornados could be kicked off by whipping winds interacting with unique terrain and topography, or a spin enabled by the heat itself. Either way, if a small whirl is stoked into a towering firenado, it promptly becomes unpredictable. It's a spinning storm. ""It’s notoriously difficult to predict what they're going to do because they’re creating they’re own weather,"" said Lareau. ""You’re not sure where the vortex is going to go — it can wander a path with no predictability,"" said Belongie. During a massive fire, such a firenado can come and go. The Carr Fire vortex lasted 80 minutes. It didn't reappear over the weekend — but it very well could have, amid a towering, violent fire, which sent an apocalyptic plume into the sky. ""It's like a big eddy in the whole event,"" said Belongie. As of the morning of July 31 — the Carr Fire's ninth day of burning — it had spread to over 110,000 acres, destroying over 1,200 buildings and making it the seventh most destructive fire in California's history. Less than 30 percent of the fire is contained, and it has claimed six lives. A bright light, amid the whirling flames, leveled homes, and smoke-choked air, are the citizens of Redding themselves. Belongie said people are offering to help complete strangers in grocery stores, not knowing who has lost their home — or worse. ""We take care of ourselves very nicely,"" she said.

Tom McKay,"Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003. Per CNN, Cal Fire says the blaze has now burned through some 1,063 buildings and is just 65 percent contained weeks after starting on December 4th. It also said it expects fire crews to be working on the blaze 24/7 until at least January 7th. The fire began in Ventura County and spread to neighboring Santa Barbara County, fueled by flame-optimal winds and plenty of dry brush to burn. As the L.A. Times reported, the official list of wildfires only dates back to 1932 because prior records are less reliable. One contender for the all-time spot remains the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire, which reputedly scorched some 300,000 acres (and some research supports those accounts ). Large stretches of southern California now lie in ruins. In some cases, the fire spread so fast that terrified residents were forced to evacuate without their possessions in the dead of night as smoke surrounded their homes. “I feel like I’m spinning,” local resident Jeff Jacobson, whose house was mostly burned, told the L.A. Times. “I’m overwhelmed and stressed, which is hard because I need to be clear-minded.” According to officials, this is the worst season for wildfires in memory. Wildfires have ravaged vast parts of the state this year, with blazes burning from southern California all the way up to wine-growing regions hundreds of miles to the north. The frequency of massive fires in the state has dramatically increased in the last few decades, due to both accidental blazes started by humans and trends linked to climate change like extreme droughts. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the Times. “What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Fire officials said that the blaze is contained enough that any further spread will be the result of deliberate actions by firefighters, not uncontrolled expansion. “The main fire itself will not have any growth,” the California City Fire Department’s Captain Brandon Vaccaro told the Times. “Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.” [ CNN ]","Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003.

"Marie Hattar, Elizabeth Geary","gece33/Getty Images When fire swept through Santa Rosa, Calif., last month, destroying 4,658 homes, 94 commercial buildings, and displacing tens of thousands of people, Keysight Technologies was in the direct path of the disaster. Most people might think of Sonoma County for its wine, but Keysight is the largest employer in Sonoma County and has had a strong presence in the area since 1972. The Tubbs fire broke out at 10 p.m. in the hills above Santa Rosa and by 1:30 a.m. the flames were ferocious. Our headquarters was in the center of the mandatory evacuation zone, and many employees who lived nearby were ordered to evacuate. It was evident that we faced a crisis of a magnitude we hadn’t prepared for. Though our CEO, Ron Nersesian, and his chief of staff were in Germany presenting at a customer forum, our executive team leapt into action in the middle of the night, rushing to evacuate people, assess impact to our headquarters, and safeguard the 1,300 employees and families who work and live there. The next 13 hours were a blur of on-the-spot decision making and crisis triage. The team set up a command center a safe distance away from the fires, implemented an aggressive phone calling effort to locate every employee known to be in the area and made critical decisions on employee aid and compensation. The crisis had repercussions that extended well beyond company walls to our community, worldwide employees, customers, competitors, and numerous others. It tested our crisis management and leadership skills beyond what we could have foreseen or prepared for, demonstrating that in a large-scale crisis, it’s how you react to its real-time situations that determines the speed at which you can begin to rebuild. In the end, we ended up managing three crises: employees, customers, and competitors. Here’s how we did it. The First Crisis: Employees It became clear in the first 24 hours that many employees would lose their homes. As a leadership team, we wrestled with the company’s responsibility to its employees in the wake of a natural disaster. We had to remember these were people’s homes, families, and friends affected. CEO Nersesian’s messages to employees emphasized people first, response and resources second. But these conversations were not easy. Nothing brought the people vs. profit tradeoff to the surface more than the heated debate between company officers determining not if, but how much, aid to provide. On the financial side, we had no idea how many homes were destroyed and offering $10,000 per employee who lost their homes could quickly add up to millions. In addition, offering $5,000 per displaced employee could potentially extend to 1,300 people. The team knew the costs could be enormous and needed to weigh that against our desire to do right by loyal employees that were impacted by a once in a lifetime event. In the end, we offered an aid package of $10,000 to people who lost homes and $1,000 to displaced employees under the premise that the company’s strength and innovation rests on the long-term tenure of its people, offsetting short-term financial impact. But we needed to meet immediate needs, too. We set up a makeshift relief center to provide phone chargers, underwear, bottled water, and other basics. It was also a gathering place for employees to connect, help, get support, and receive counseling. Once relief assistance was set up, we were flooded with calls from employees requesting aid and unable to get to the relief center. Long wait times and voice mail became major obstacles to receiving desperately needed help. With no bandwidth left, the crisis team reached out one of our R&amp;D directors who researched and set up an external call center within 2 hours. The crisis, however, proved too big for the crisis team to handle themselves. With unreliable cell and internet coverage, the company engaged employees outside Santa Rosa to organize phone trees and deploy multiple forms of communications to reach impacted colleagues. Employees around the world, eager to help, rallied quickly offering aid. A software team in Atlanta got an SMS text solution working within hours as well as a public website for matching requests with aid. The social media team in Colorado used its channels to help employees keep track of one another. Another team set up a charitable fund. Critical to the effort was our ability to use these extended teams across the company to solve problems that could be addressed remotely. The Second Crisis: Customers Keysight customers are innovators who win or lose in the market based on being first and best. Their timelines don’t leave room for crises. And while most Keysight manufacturing is done outside headquarters, the site does house some high-end inventory and customers were naturally worried about impacts on their own operations. This was especially true of customers engaging in the 5G new radio (NR) pre-standard testing, the set of requirements for next-generation mobile networks that promise to deliver breakthrough performance and functionality to meet the growing demands of mobile data and applications. Keysight’s customers were concerned about the availability of products, especially since the initial phase of the 5G standard is expected to be ratified in December. Senior leaders from Keysight’s industry solutions teams personally visited those customers to reassure them that their product delivery would not be impacted or delayed. In one case pertaining to 100G production, the Keysight team worked to bridge possible delivery interruptions with loaners sourced from within Keysight as well as from channel partner inventories. This, combined with daily updates on our production ramp schedule enabled this customer to stay on plan with their own commitments. In other cases, the company deployed targeted communications to global sales arming them with drawer statements and Q&amp;As, assessed specific impacted orders and initiated customer outreach. Manufacturing facilities outside Santa Rosa drew from safety stock to maintain continuity. The mitigation actions had to be swift, ongoing, and tuned to each customer’s specific needs. The Third Crisis: Competitors In the midst of dealing with the local crisis, the repercussions turned global. While we went into the crisis believing we could isolate it from the rest of the company, it became clear customer-facing functions had to be prepared to stay on alert for unexpected and predatory side-effects of the crisis. Even while the fire was still burning, we got word from customers that some competitors were spreading rumors and uncertainty about Keysight’s ability to ship products. The competitors were offering to fill product gaps to purportedly de-risk customers’ production plans. They told our customers that Keysight would not be able to deliver on commitments Though we were already in touch with our customers, we realized we had to take both offensive and defensive action; we asked Keysight account managers to re-connect with customers and reassure them about product delivery, and Nersesian reached out to those competitors’ CEOs. When the CEOs denied these activities, despite confirmation from a customer that indeed it was a competitor’s high-level leader spreading this uncertainty, Nersesian told them that this predatory practice needed to stop or we would go public with their practices. As we move into this next phase, we’re figuring out day by day what that rebuilding looks like. It’s new homes for employees, new lives as children enroll in different schools, community gatherings to get stronger together. Now, as the wildfires are no longer the immediate threat, decisions can be more thoughtfully considered based on the longer term needs of our people, our business, and our community. Restarting critical operations is a source of stability for all of them; delaying optional ones gives us the breathing room we need to find our new normal.",Sonoma County’s largest employer faced three crises at once.,2017-11-29T15:03:35Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",What Happened When the California Wildfires Engulfed Our Headquarters,https://hbr.org/2017/11/what-happened-when-the-california-wildfires-engulfed-our-headquarters,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2017/11/nov17-29-496800078-gece33.jpg,,Hbr.org,California wildfires,1
Frederic Lardinois,"It’s one thing to dispatch a drone when an accident happens to get an aerial overview of what’s happening on the ground, but you get far better situational awareness if you can use augmented reality (AR) to add the names of roads, the location of key personnel, cars and other assets to that view. That’s what Edgybees, a Santa Clara-based startup that current specializes in AR for drones, offers first responders. Its system has already been used by emergency teams during the Northern California wildfires and hurricane floods in Florida. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.5 million seed funding round that includes Motorola Solutions Venture Capital, and Verizon Ventures, as well as 8VC, NFX, Aspect Ventures and Israeli crowdfunding platform OurCrowd. The company plans to use the new funding to bring its existing AR technology, which I recently saw in action during a drone demo with Israel’s volunteer first responder organization United Hatzalah in Jerusalem, to other platforms and to enter new verticals. These include defense, smart cities, automotive and broadcast media. Last year, Edgybees also partnered with drone manufacturer DJI to use its AR systems to build a racing game. That’s not really the company’s focus these days, but it shows the power of the platform the team has built. “What started as technology powering a racing game is now saving lives around the world,” co-founder and CEO Adam Kaplan writes in today’s announcement. “The overwhelming response by commercial and industrial drone users looking to leverage AR, and partner with us in the fields of fire, public safety, and search &amp; rescue has been amazing, and we can’t wait to expand the next set of drone applications into new markets.” Kaplan previously co-founded a number of companies, while his CTO Menashe Haskin was previously the head of Amazon’s Prime Air office in Israel.","It’s one thing to dispatch a drone when an accident happens to get an aerial overview of what’s happening on the ground, but you get far better situational awareness if you can use augmented reality (AR) to add the names of roads, the location of key personne…",2018-02-28T14:40:08Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Edgybees raises $5.5M to bring better AR to cars and drones,http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/edgybees-raises-5-5m-to-bring-better-ar-to-cars-and-drones/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/edgybees.png,techcrunch,TechCrunch,California wildfires,1

Mr. Brown said the bill would hurt residents in California while helping those in places that don’t have high state or local taxes — which happen to be Republican states, the governor noted. “You’re taking money from Californians and giving it to people elsewhere,” he said. “It’s unfair and unwise because California is an engine of American growth.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

Jennings Brown,"Elon Musk has already made millions selling a really small flamethrower (which is actually just a really big blow torch ), but one incensed California assemblymemember wants to put a stop to sales in his state. On Saturday, Musk announced he was selling the $500 flame-sputterers, which are a fundraising merchandise for his tunnel-digging business, The Boring Company. A spokesperson for the company told Gizmodo that as of this morning, it has sold 15,000 “flamethrowers”—$7.5 million’s worth. Musk tweeted that the short range of the flame (seemingly around two to three feet based on Instagram posts ) means the device doesn’t violate ATF’s flamethrower regulations. Flamethrowers are legal in every state but Maryland—where they are banned—and California, where they can be purchased with a State Fire Marshall permit. But the California restriction only applies to “flamethrowing devices” that “propel a burning stream of combustible or flammable liquid a distance of at least 10 feet.” One California politician believes that regulation isn’t enough and he is outraged that Musk is selling an extended-reach torch— outraged ! Assemblymember Miguel Santiago of Los Angeles took to Twitter to vent his anger : “If this is real, I’m outraged and you should be too. If this is a joke, then it’s a terribly insensitive one given that we’re coming off of the worst wildfire season in history. Either way: NOT FUNNY. NOT GONNA HAPPEN.” Santiago tweeted out a press release explaining that he plans to introduce legislation that will block the sale of the device. The memo includes a strange quote in which Santiago praises Musk and quotes Spider-Man: Like most Americans, I am in awe of Mr. Musk’s genius—the brains behind Tesla, Paypal, Solar City, and SpaceX... But as President Truman and Stan Lee have taught us all, “With great power comes great responsibility... There are many times in which technology and inventions benefit society, but are not made available to the public. we don’t allow people to walk in off the street and purchase military grade tanks or armor-piercing ammunition. Except, Musk’s weird swag is a far cry from military-grade tanks. It’s more like a toy dragon or a giant crème brûlée torch. But yes, fires are dangerous and most wildfires start with acts of human carelessness, like unattended campfires, fireworks, burning debris, and discarded cigarettes. Musk apparently plans to sell 20 thousand of his “flamethrowers” and there’s a very strong chance that many of the new owners will be careless and use them for really, really dumb things. And that’s why the California Professional Firefighters support Santiago’s plan to ban the sale of Musk’s torches in the state, according to Santiago’s release. Musk’s company seems unperturbed by the assemblymember’s efforts. “The Boring Company flamethrower is safer than what you can buy right now off-the-shelf on Amazon to destroy weeds,” a company spokesperson told Gizmodo. “Like a rollercoaster, this is designed to be thrilling without danger. Dangerous flamethrowers are already regulated and require a permit to own in California.” Many of the responses to Santiago’s tweets about his desire to ban Musk’s device seem to be mocking him. Curiously, the politician has retweeted a couple of them, including one tweet stating that you can buy a power torch with a similar range as Musk’s on Amazon. And one tweet with a GIF of Hank Scorpio, evil genius of The Simpsons, blasting a flamethrower and laughing maniacally.","Elon Musk has already made millions selling a really small flamethrower (which is actually just a really big blow torch ), but one incensed California assemblymemember wants to put a stop to sales in his state.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Several people are dead and thousands of homes and other properties destroyed after wildfires descended on California this week, burning both sides of the state and laying waste to everything in their path. The Woolsey fire has reportedly burned more than 70,000 acres and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate. The Camp Fire has since been declared the most destructive in Californias history. Several fire whirls were observed at the sprawling sites of the three wildfires, the Camp Fire in the north and the Hill and Woolsey Fires in the southern part of the state. KTLA, a CW affiliate, reported observing a fire devil near the 101 Freeway on Friday. Laura Anthony of ABC-affiliate KGO-TV also shared footage of a fire whirl near Paradise, a community of 27,000 people that was almost entirely wiped out by the Camp Fire. Another video shared on Instagram captured a fire whirl reportedly situated near Malibu. Fire whirls develop in a similar manner to dust devils and are essentially spinning columns of hot air. They are sometimes referred to as fire tornadoesand some of these incidents have been reported as suchbut according to weather scientists, theres a difference. California experienced what the National Weather Service announced was the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado during the Carr Fire in July, an incident that Clements pointed to as an example of a true fire tornado. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther at the time that documentation of such phenomena is rare, meaning we know relatively little about how and why they form. Fire whirls, by contrast, are more common. Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, described them to Earther as basically wind shear that gets tilted up. The three major fires continued to burn as of Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Camp Fire had reportedly burned 100,000 acres as of Saturday morning and was 20 percent contained. The Hill Fire was 25 percent contained after burning thousands of acres. The Woolsey Fire, however, was still not contained as of Saturday.","Several people are dead and thousands of homes and other properties destroyed after wildfires descended on California this week, burning both sides of the state and laying waste to everything in their path.

Saqib Shah,"Although, it's difficult to chalk 2017 up as anything other than a lousy year, we can find some solace in the well-meaning ""how"" queries sent Google's way. Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google. The company itself marked the year by fully embracing hardware, but (judging by its trends) the Pixel 2 wasn't the handset search users were anticipating the most. That honor went to Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X, which came in at second and third place respectively on global search results.

JILL COWAN,"Good morning.
(If you dont already get California Today by email, heres the sign-up.)
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has faced increased heat from regulators and outrage from consumers who have watched the states largest utility file for bankruptcy protection, then say that its equipment probably started the deadly Camp Fire. 
 San Francisco is exploring a public takeover, and various financial stakeholders in the company have circled as complex bankruptcy negotiations start. But how did PG&amp;E get here? 
This week, my colleagues published a piece detailing how the company has overlooked risks in favor of its bottom line over the years. And nothing explains it better than one very old tower in the Sierra Nevada foothills. I asked Ivan Penn, a business reporter based here in L.A., to explain how they got the story:
After the latest wave of wildfires in which Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has been implicated, Peter Eavis, James Glanz and I were assigned to take a deep look at a persistent question: What kind of safety culture has PG&amp;E built?
I am an energy reporter; Peter is a financial reporter in New York, and Jim is a veteran investigative reporter. Each of us brought pieces of the puzzle to the table, and one stood out: Tower 27/222, a 99-year-old transmission tower suspected of causing the 2018 Camp Fire, the worst wildfire in California history. A source pointed us to one document in particular, a form filed with federal regulators in which PG&amp;E noted that the useful life of such towers expired at 75 years.",Wednesday: How the utility chose profits over safety time and again; another reason immigration courts are bogged down; and seeing Oakland on screen,2019-03-20T13:15:41Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: What One Old Tower Says About PG&E’s Lax Safety Culture,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/us/tower-pge-safety-culture-camp-fire.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/us/20towercatoday/merlin_151538673_b67664b8-4f3e-4a59-a194-662eef9c09bf-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,California wildfires,1

Further north, another huge wild fire destroyed the town of Paradise, leaving nine people dead and 35 missing. In all, three major fires are burning across the state. Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, where a gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. Authorities say the Camp Fire in the North and the Woolsey Fire and Hill Fire in the south are being fanned by strong winds. Where is the Woolsey Fire? The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles, prompting the evacuation of 75,000 homes. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks.

Driving through walls of flame By the BBC's James Cook in northern California Driven by hot desert winds, the wildfire raced into Paradise, devouring the equivalent of 80 football pitches a minute. The town sits on a ridge and the few roads out quickly became clogged with traffic as 27,000 people tried to flee, many driving through walls of flame. Some motorists abandoned their cars and ran for their lives with children and pets in their arms. Residents are now using social media to search for missing friends and family members. Fire officials have also issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. The three blazes are among 16 currently active fires in California. Officials have put most of Northern California under a Red Flag Warning, which means ""extreme fire behaviour"" can occur within 24 hours.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Shares in California power company PG&amp;E fell sharply for a second day on Tuesday as investors took fright at the prospect of bankruptcy proceedings to protect from $30 billion in potential liabilities related to wildfires in 2017 and 2018. 
The state’s biggest private utility’s shares have lost 75 percent of their stock value since the start of January, when the company first began exploring options for protection from claims its equipment was responsible for the fires. 
Shares lost 52 percent of their value on Monday after the company said it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 protection, and they were down another 28 percent in morning trade in New York. 
California politicians are in a quandary over whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state’s largest private utility to fail. 
Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters late on Monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping PG&amp;E stay solvent, but no decisions had been made. 
PG&amp;E said on Tuesday that Rothschild Inc banker Roger Kimmel had resigned from the company’s board, adding only that the resignation did not involve any disagreement on any matter relating to its operations. 
Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, while PG&amp;E declined to comment. 
PG&amp;E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires. 
Its chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep it perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires. 
The doctrine, known as “inverse condemnation,” exposes utilities in the state to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved. 
That legal rule could keep PG&amp;E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter. 
Still, analysts from Chicago-based brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients that this was one of the rare cases where shares could emerge from the process with some value. 
“The most likely near-term scenario is a fourth-quarter 2018 accounting charge that cuts PG&amp;E’s book equity well below its allowed regulatory capital structure,” they said. 
“Our new fair value estimate for PG&amp;E is $11 per share after considering possible bankruptcy scenarios.” 
It was trading at around $6 half an hour after opening on Wall Street.

JENNIFER MEDINA and JACK HEALY,"After his mother fled, Mr. Sezzi, 51, returned to the home and tried to stave off destruction with a garden hose. He could see a glow behind the ridgeline above him, and as the winds kicked up, the hillsides erupted into quilts of fire. Flames skittered down the hills toward avocado orchards, neighboring streets — and him. “It was like someone had turned on a burner from a range,” Mr. Sezzi said. “The fire, the ash, the smoke — everything right toward me. It’s coming at me, getting in my eyes.” As the flames began to surround him, Mr. Sezzi decided his battle to save the house was lost, and he had to go. The fire destroyed the house. It burned so hot that it cracked the fireplace and melted a pan Mr. Sezzi’s mother used to make Christmas cakes into a “glob of molten metal.” Photo Paul and Steve Sezzi sorted through the remains of their mother’s home in Ventura on Wednesday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times “Everything is just gone,” he said on Thursday from his own home in Ventura — safe for now — where he was warily looking out the window and watching the winds. “It’s really scary. You just don’t know. We never think that the fire could reach us, but everybody’s a little bit on edge. Because where do we evacuate to?” Trish Valenteen said she had stood in her yard in Ventura and prayed for the fire to pass by the house she shares with her 84-year-old father. They were prepared to evacuate on Tuesday night, but ended up staying. She thought they were safe, but on Thursday morning, the Santa Ana winds carried a grimmer omen. “I’m listening to the wind start up again and realizing that we could be in for more destruction,” Ms. Valenteen said. In the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, Amanda Saviss, 26, woke up Wednesday and began packing as much as she could from her family’s home on Moraga Drive. Even before they saw firefighters down the hill from her home, the family knew they needed to get out. Photo A firefighter in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on Wednesday. Credit Jae C. Hong/Associated Press “It was in the air everywhere,” Ms. Saviss said. “Ash, smoke, all of it. We took everything we could, our whole lives — clothes, pictures, jewelry.” When they realized they had forgotten to water down some dry bushes nearby, a firefighter allowed them to walk back quickly. None of their neighbors had dared to ignore the evacuation orders, she said. “That would be crazy.” They spent much of the morning at a cousin’s house, glued to the local news. By late afternoon, the family of five started to look for a comfortable place for them and their dog. They landed at Hotel Angeleno, an iconic cylindrical tower just west of the 405 freeway and opposite the burning Bel-Air neighborhood. They tried to find their home from the window of a high building but never managed to spot it. They were assured by reports that the flames never reached their street.

Laura Vitto,"Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26. The fire tornado was part of the Carr Fire that's engulfed 223,610 acres of land in Northern California so far. A report from Cal Fire breaks down the details surrounding the fiery phenomenon. SEE ALSO: A fire tornado hit California. Here's how it happened. Per the report, the tornado ""was a large rotating fire plume that was roughly 1,000 feet in diameter at its base"" and managed to reach a height of 40,000 feet. In late July, we covered news of a fire tornado in the area on the evening of July 26. It's unclear whether the fire tornado in the report is the same as the one that garnered media attention at the time, according to Cal Fire. ""Observations from witnesses and other evidence suggest that either several fire tornados occurred at different locations and times, or one fire tornado formed and then periodically weakened and strengthened causing several separate damage areas,"" the report says. Fire tornados can happen when extreme heat spins up from the ground. As Mashable's Mark Kaufman explained at the time: ""The fire tornados could be kicked off by whipping winds interacting with unique terrain and topography, or a spin enabled by the heat itself."" ""Either way, if a small whirl is stoked into a towering firenado, it promptly becomes unpredictable. It's a spinning storm."" Firefighters captured the disturbing video above from a helicopter, as well as footage taken from a fire engine, and from the Keswick Dam on the Sacramento River. The Carr Fire continues to ravage parts of Shasta County and Trinity County. It is 77 percent contained, and other fires continue to rage in Northern California and other areas These fires are spurred on by extreme heat and dryness in the region. While human-caused climate change isn't necessarily the direct cause of any single weather event, like these fires, it can make extreme weather more likely now and in the future.","Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26.

Richard Gonzales,"Flames burn near power lines in Montecito, Calif. State fire officials say power lines coming into contact with trees sparked four Northern California wildfires last October.
Mike Eliason/AP
A federal judge in California dealt utility giant PG&amp;E another setback Wednesday by proposing to restrict the beleaguered company from using unsafe power lines during the 2019 California fire season.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, who is overseeing the utility after a 2010 gas pipeline explosion, said the company should be required to ""remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines"" and reinspect its grid.
The utility has two weeks to respond as Judge Alsup set a new hearing for Jan. 30.
PG&amp;E's power lines are widely believed to have caused the massive fires in northern and southern California that killed 86 people and destroyed 18,500 structures in 2018.
In June, state fire officials blamed PG&amp;E power lines for sparking several northern California wildfires in 2017.
Last week NPR's Eric Westervelt reported that PG&amp;E is considering selling off a major part of the company in the face of staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in the wildfires of 2017 and 2018.
""Internally, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has dubbed this strategy ""Project Falcon."" Under the plan, the company would sell its natural gas division this spring. After years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell NPR.
""All net proceeds from the sale of PG&amp;E's gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, the sources said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
""The company also is exploring selling key real estate assets, including its San Francisco headquarters, and moving its operations elsewhere in the Bay Area, the sources say.""
On Tuesday, Westervelt reported that a key ratings agency slashed the California utility giant's credit rating to ""junk"" status.
""S&amp;P Global Ratings stripped PG&amp;E of its investment-grade rating significant deterioration in the company's political and regulatory environment,"" Westervelt reported.
The company also announced the retirement of three executives in the utility's electric division.
A spokesman for PG&amp;E, James Noonan said safety is the company's ""most important responsibility.""
""We are aware of Judge Alsup's orders and are currently reviewing,"" Noonan added. ""We are committed to complying with all rules and regulations that apply to our work, while working together with our state and community partners and across all sectors and disciplines to develop comprehensive, long-term safety solutions for the future.""",PG&amp;E is under fire from many fronts as it faces the possibility of being found responsible for massive California wildfires the past two years.,2019-01-10T01:58:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Federal Judge Proposes Restrictions On Unsafe PG&E Power Lines,https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683815660/federal-judge-proposes-restrictions-on-unsafe-pg-e-power-lines,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/09/ap_18146054495537_wide-c1672ddf4ab30259d4aa76c0af7fb2312524b4fe.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,California wildfires,1
THOMAS FULLER,"Chief Ken Pimlott of Cal Fire said more than 212,000 Californians had been evacuated over the last week. He said wind conditions could create more problems through the weekend and into next week. In the pre-dawn hours Friday, bleary-eyed men and women gathered in the parking lot of the Ventura County Fairgrounds to slip on their fluorescent yellow fire gear and start another 12-hour shift or a double shift, like Mr. Uresti. Many were headed to the Ojai Valley, where health officials said the fire had created hazardous air quality levels that were “off the charts.” Photo The Thomas Fire left behind burned palm trees after sweeping through Faria Beach on Thursday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Fire trucks assembled here tell of a statewide effort and beyond — rigs from the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego and Nevada idle in a chorus of clanging diesel engines. There are 3,000 firefighters assembled in Ventura County alone; when they finish their shifts digging firebreaks and hosing down vulnerable terrain, many sleep in tents at the fairgrounds. The crews fighting the fire in Ventura include seasonal and permanent personnel from across the state; teams from the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management; and crews made up of prison inmates, who work for a base salary of $2 a day. They use shovels, chain saws and heavy duty rakes called McLeods to cut through vegetation. One firefighter standing on a blustery hilltop Thursday night had a repetitive task worthy of Sisyphus: monitoring a patch of already scorched hillside and using a garden hose to put out small fires that reignited with each gust of wind. The Ventura County Fire Department said on Twitter that crews were working “long hours in extremely steep, dry, rugged terrain full of drought-stressed fuels.” California has a long history of fire catastrophes. San Francisco burned to the ground at least four times in the years immediately after the gold rush of the 1800s. The state’s Mediterranean climate with its long, arid summers has made it an attractive destination for sun-seeking migrants from wetter and colder parts of the nation. It is also one of the reasons the state is so vulnerable to fire. In recent years the size and intensity of fires has increased. Of the state’s 20 largest wildfires over the past century, 13 have occurred since 2002, according to Cal Fire. With fires now regularly igniting late into fall and winter, a time that was previously considered the off-season, the department says it needs more trucks and more money. Cal Fire has spent $500 million since July and is on track to spend the most in the agency’s history. “We staff to meet the conditions,” said Chief Upton. “But it costs money.” Chief Upton calls California an “anomaly” compared with other states because of the vast resources that the state puts into fighting fires. There are 11,000 fire departments statewide. Photo Firefighters at the Rancho Monserate Country Club, a mobile home park in Fallbrook, Calif. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Los Angeles alone spends $650 million annually on firefighting, around 7 percent of the city budget. Already, the current fire in Ventura County has cost $17 million, officials said late Friday. On a per-capita basis, California has the sixth largest firefighting budget among states, according to the Urban Institute. Rhode Island, Alaska, Nevada, Florida and Washington spend more per capita, according to the institute’s calculation. But experts warn that calculating total fire expenditure is difficult because so many agencies are involved. As the climate changes and as more homes are built in areas close to nature — and thus more vulnerable to wildfires — there seems no end to the skyrocketing costs of firefighting in California. Some experts believe that the emphasis should be to make communities more resilient to fire, rather than buying more firefighting equipment. The furious winds that helped the initial spread of both the wine country fires in October and the current round of fires in Southern California have highlighted the difficulty — and at the peak of the winds, the seeming futility — of trying to stop the fires. “Of course you need fire protection, but just responding by getting more engines and aircraft doesn’t work,” said Stephen J. Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University. “Under the extreme conditions the system fails.” Mr. Pyne recommended “hardening communities” in ways that allow the fires to “blow over and around them without incinerating everything.” “Unless you do that you’re in this endless cycle,” he said. Chris Mehl, policy director with Headwaters Economics, a Montana research group that specializes in land use policies including fire prevention, said California would be forced into building more resilient communities. “This trend is impossible — we can’t keep this up,” he said of the increasingly frequent fires. “But how we build and where we build and the extent and the density — these are all things that are in our control,” he said. Will the firefighters make it home for Christmas? That depends, said David Clark, a Cal Fire spokesman. “I’ll get home when the fire is done,” he said. Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.

Adam Rogers,"Scott Wiener, the California state senator representing most of San Francisco, has a pretty good idea for how to save the world. In fact, sitting in a coffee shop in his city’s Financial District, Wiener seems downright perplexed that anyone would be against it. Here’s the idea: Build more housing. So, with his fellow senator Nancy Skinner, he authored a bill, SB 827, that overwrites some metropolitan zoning—putting policies that had been in the hands of cities under the authority of state government—to allow medium-sized multistory and multiunit buildings near transit stops. Lots of urbanists and housing activists believe the bill will shift California cities into a denser, transit-oriented, multi-use future. But an unlikely coalition has emerged in opposition: homeowners who don’t want their neighborhoods to change and advocates for the lower-income people of color who almost always get hurt by gentrification. This isn’t some dry policy fight. The mayor of Berkeley called the bill “a declaration of war against our neighborhoods.” A Los Angeles City Council member said it will make the residential areas he represents in LA’s tony Westside “look like Dubai.” A community organizer in LA wrote that Wiener is a “real estate industry puppet” who supports gentrification and displacement, and compared SB 827 to President Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act. Housing costs are crushing American cities, perhaps nowhere as severely as in California. It’s catastrophic—homes are priced 2.5 times the median in other places; rents are sky high; the population is increasing (but construction of places to live for them is not); poor people are getting pushed out; homelessness is severe, and on the rise. Wiener says his fix can, over time, address all that without worsening the state’s drumbeat of evictions. And it'll do even more: “If you want to limit carbon and reduce congestion on freeways, the way you do that is by building a lot more housing near public transportation,” he says. “You get less driving, less carbon emissions, less sprawl so you can protect open spaces and farmland, and healthier families.” It might even work. Wiener came to San Francisco in the late 1990s, just in time to see the first dot-com boom turn the city into the center of the world and wreak centrifugal havoc, pushing longtime residents out and housing costs up. As a community activist and then a politician, Wiener saw the other side of the problem. It’s really hard to get anything built in San Francisco. Booms, critical to the state economy because of the tax money they dump into state treasuries, don’t benefit cities the same way. Unemployment falls to nothing, but housing costs rise. The poorest people get forced out by gentrifying newcomers. The current boom, Wiener says, “has caused lasting damage to the culture and diversity of our city.” ""When we push people into areas like Phoenix and Houston, we see the climate impacts, from flooding to sprawl, with people in these high-polluting areas where they don’t necessarily even want to be."" Wiener has been full of ideas to counteract that. He’s behind a bill to make net neutrality a state law and another to let bars stay open until 4 am. (“Great cities have great nightlife,” he says.) He got a bill passed to force California cities to live up to their unenforced commitments to build new housing. And now he’s saying that within walking distance of mass transit, housing shouldn’t be single-family, suburban style. It should be tall, like 45 feet or up to 65, depending on how wide the street is. The goal, Wiener says, isn't Hong Kong–style high-rises. It's what housing advocates call the “missing middle,” things like side-by-side duplexes, eight-unit apartment buildings, six-story buildings—a building form even San Francisco built plenty of in the early 20th century. Typically these are wood-frame construction, cheaper to build than luxury steel-and-glass high-rises. If cities don’t build those housing units, other places will. “People first look for cheaper housing as far away from their jobs as they can that is still a reasonably feasible commute,” says Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at UC Berkeley Law School’s Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment. “When we push people into areas like Phoenix and Houston, we see the climate impacts, from flooding to sprawl, with people in these high-polluting areas where they don’t necessarily even want to be.” Denser urban cores, it so happens, are more environmentally responsible. Downtowns have lower per-capita carbon emissions than suburban and rural areas. A household in the heart of Wiener’s district has an average carbon footprint of about 31 tons of CO 2 per year. In downtown Phoenix, it’s 34. In suburban Phoenix, it’s 82. Thanks to global warming, the San Francisco Bay is full of rising seawater. Like Florida and New York, the region faces a future of chronic floods. It also faces fire : Seasonal wildfires like the ones that scorched huge swaths of California this year (including the biggest one in state history) begin at the wildland-urban interface, where human beings build near nature, like in the hills of the East Bay. Spread between mountains and the ocean, Southern California faces similar boundary conditions. These regions can’t build outward; they have to build inward and upward. After all, one of the fundamental functions of a city is to serve as a bulwark against disaster. ""What you have are two strips of land on both sides of the Bay that are flat, high enough above sea-level rise, and not as prone to fire,"" says Kim-Mai Cutler, an urbanist and a partner at Initialized Capital. ""Longer term, the safest and probably most inclusive way to handle the region's growth is missing-middle or more dense housing along transit lines."" (Like many of the people I talked to, Cutler stresses that she's in the ""support, if amend"" camp on SB 827—pending tenant protections, controls on demolitions, and some way to deal with affordable housing.) But economics and the law don't accommodate those pressures. Strapped California cities accrue more tax benefits from commercial development than from residential. (As American retail crumbles, “commercial” increasingly means office space and hotels.) Eventually, that pushes out everyone but the richest rich and the poorest poor. “We have offices in cities elsewhere in the US,” says Jeremy Stoppleman, CEO of Yelp and one of 120 signatories to a letter supporting Wiener’s bill. “As someone who lives in California, I’d love to allocate as many positions to San Francisco as possible, but I have to look at performance and retention.” Yimbys—the “yes in my backyard” supporters of efforts like Wiener’s—slough off aesthetic concerns about “neighborhood character,” sightlines, or the shadows cast by taller buildings. At best, they’ll say, that’s old-people whinging. At worst, this apparent concern for architecture and planning is cover for redlining, keeping affluent neighborhoods closed to young people, lower-income people, and people of color. “It’s areas that have the land values to support multifamily development but don’t want newcomers and more density,” Elkind says. “They’re happy to accept all the benefits of new transit—the property value and benefits it gives them at taxpayer expense—but when it comes to providing housing around those transit networks they consistently say no.” So the Yimbys instead want more housing to deal with population growth, more transit, more infrastructure, more everything. More city. Some of the Nimbyism—“not in my backyard” (or, even worse, Banana, as in “build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything”)—that Wiener encounters argues that building new housing doesn’t reduce housing prices, because it attracts even more upper-income people. That doesn’t seem true—Seattle’s recent home-building binge apparently lowered rents, for example. Some opponents, like the California Sierra Club, argue that allowing increased density near transit might quash people’s willingness to pay for any new light rail lines at all. To be fair, not everyone sees value in denser, more urban cities. You might think that having a place to get a coffee and drop off dry cleaning on the way to a bus stop or train is the best, but some city dwellers don't want to see changes like new four- to eight-story apartment buildings. They bring parking difficulties, traffic, and more crowds. “It’s becoming rapidly apparent to lots of people that, in fact, the Nimbys are greedy, and they benefit dramatically from the housing shortage.” Because of a state law called Proposition 13 and its follow-ons, Californians pay property tax based on the value of their home when they bought it—not on real-world increases in its value caused by, let’s say, a new subway nearby or a neighborhood suddenly turning “hot.” Now, changes to residential neighborhoods potentially lower the value of the houses there. Maybe young people keen on biking to work want apartments and light rail. But not so much for families with three kids to drop at two different sports practices, or someone who’s lived in the same house for 50 years who can’t easily move away because they’d face a steep increase in property taxes—again, thanks to Prop 13. To be really fair, though, putative improvements to cities have often benefited the rich at the expense of people who live there—especially people of color. Some of the opposition to Weiner’s SB 827 and the ideas behind it comes from a real concern for displacement, racism, and classism. It’s already happening. Retail stretches of hair salons and dry cleaners at area-appropriate price points begin to give way to the Four Riders of the Gentrification Apocalypse: bike shops, yoga studios, artisanal tchotchke stores, and third-wave coffee. The history of urban change in the United States is full of examples of low-income neighborhoods getting erased by capitalists in the name of renewal and modernization. Boston’s West End, Chavez Ravine in Los Angeles, and San Francisco’s Western Addition neighborhoods all used to be vibrant (low-income) communities. Urban renewal in the mid 20th century didn’t emphasize density or climate change, of course. It was about “blight,” in a literal sense because of the health issues all poor communities face, but also (as the writer Alexis Madrigal has discussed ) as a metaphoric term to cover failing infrastructure and economic collapse. But the end was the same. So the interests of the rich and powerful align here with the interests of disenfranchised people of color—which should be great! Except they’re aligned against the young, new migrants, and the middle class. Right now it’s hard to tell the players without a scorecard. “The Nimby movement for years stifled development and higher-density projects under the guise of ‘developers are greedy,’” Stoppleman says. “It’s becoming rapidly apparent to lots of people that, in fact, the Nimbys are greedy, and they benefit dramatically from the housing shortage.” For his part, Weiner doesn’t believe that new housing will ruin neighborhoods and displace poor people. And, he says, people in well-to-do areas are co-opting that argument to protect their own interests. “It makes me nuts when I see wealthy Nimby homeowners in Marin and elsewhere suddenly becoming defenders of low-income people of color,” Wiener says. “These are communities that fought tooth and nail to keep low-income people out.” Still, he knows the bill still needs work. California already gives a bonus to developers for higher density and mixed-income development, and in 2016 Los Angeles passed a law to do more of the same. “It’s very important that this bill not undermine those incentives,” says Sam Tepperman-Gelfant, an attorney with Public Advocates who works on low-income housing issues. “Giving developers of 100-percent market-rate housing the same or greater benefits awarded to mixed-income developments could really undermine the mixed-income development.” One risk is that SB 827 could increase the speculative value of land near transit. That would give landlords an incentive to tear down cheaper rental housing and build luxury condominiums. Worse, the death-spiral outcome ousts low-income people who live next to a transit station and replaces them with upper-income people, who use the available transit less often, leading to the demise of that transit. On the other hand, inclusionary housing requirements that force developers to subsidize low-income units sometimes scare developers off altogether—as may be happening in Portland, Oregon, for example. “The rhetoric and tone in the debate has gotten extremely heated,” Tepperman-Gelfant says. The solution: Making sure people in any potentially affected neighborhood, not just richies from the hills, are at the negotiating table. “If we’re going to get good solutions for low-income people of color, they need to be involved in shaping the policy.” Wiener knows the negotiations aren’t over. Far from it. “I don’t pretend the bill will be in its pristine form by the end,” he says. “And it’s not by any stretch of the imagination guaranteed to pass.” Cities change. That’s their nature. If California has to add 100,000 houses a year for the foreseeable future, someone’s going to have to goose that change along. Maybe it’ll be the guy trying to keep San Francisco bars open late. “I’m a progressive urbanist, and I embrace cities,” Wiener says. “A city’s character is not just the physicality of a neighborhood. It’s about who lives there.” A city underwater, on fire, with no young people, no families, no people of color, and restricted to only the richest rich and the poorest poor—that’s not a city at all.

Eight stables normally containing nearly 500 horses at the San Luis Rey Downs Training Facility in Bonsall suddenly caught fire Thursday afternoon from the nearby Lilac Fire, driven by heavy Santa Ana winds that have wreaked havoc on Southern California this week. Leo Tapia recorded a dramatic Facebook Live as he and others risked their lives to help release the horses from their stables. After being released, the confused horses can be seen stampeding around the grounds. The hope was to get all of the horses to the location's racetrack, which contains no structures that could burn.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Trainer Martine Bellocq suffered second- and third-degree burns to 50 percent of her body while attempting to free the horses. She was put into a medically-induced coma at the UC San Diego Medical Center. Most of the surviving horses were taken to Del Mar Racetrack, which has been acting as an evacuation center for livestock. Southern California has been ravaged by multiple wildfires this week.

Photo Part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range near Mammoth Lakes, Calif. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Yesterday we wrote about the snowpack in Sierra Nevada, using the term “Sierras” to describe the area that provides roughly a third of the state’s water. Several readers wrote to us demanding a correction: in Spanish sierra is plural, so “sierras” is redundant and therefore wrong. But in many parts of the state, people refer to the range as “the Sierras,” in the way they’d use “the Cascades” to refer to the Cascade Mountains. “You also call freeways ‘The 405,’” said Steve Frisch, the president of Sierra Business Council, said with a laugh when I called him Thursday. He implores all of his employees at the nonprofit to avoid the plural, even if hikers from all over the state use it. “Everyone who lives in the Sierra calls it the Sierra. It’s a symbol — are you an outsider or are you of the place? It’s really one of those are-you-one-of-us tests.” As it turns out, the debate dates back at least to the 1920s, when Francis P. Farquhar, a mountaineer and environmentalist, wrote in the Sierra Club Bulletin that “the Sierras” are “so frequently found in the very best works of literature and science that it would perhaps be pedantic to deny their admissibility.” The photographer Ansel Adams was less accommodating, writing in his autobiography that “To add an s is a linguistic, Californian and mountaineering sin.” We hope you can forgive us.

Andrew Freedman,"California's Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties has eclipsed the 2003 Cedar Fire as the largest wildfire in Golden State history, at a whopping 273,400 acres. This puts the blaze's burned area as larger than New York City, and nearly the equivalent of the sprawling city of Los Angeles. The fire has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged 280 more. During the past week, firefighters have made significant gains, with the state reporting 78 percent containment as of early Sunday morning. The record size was eclipsed on Dec. 22, with additional growth possible before full containment is made sometime in early 2018. SEE ALSO: Surreal scenes of devastation across Southern California from unrelenting wildfires This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fast-moving fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. The state is seeing a trend toward more damaging wildfire seasons, with 14 of the 20 largest blazes on record occurring since they year 2000. This is due to a combination of factors, from climate change to urban sprawl. Temperature departures from average during summer 2017 across the state of California. Image: noaa/ncei. The Thomas Fire, along with other blazes that erupted across the state during the late summer and fall, resulted from a combination of climate extremes that are becoming more common in the state as a result of global climate change. Repeated, record heat waves sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. Meanwhile, a large bulge, or ridge, in the jet stream has been steering Pacific storms away from California week after week, pushing the fire season deeper into the year. Computer model projections show virtually no precipitation falling in southern California during the next two weeks, for example.

Tom McKay,"Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday. According to the report, Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden brought up the throttling in an addendum to a multi-state legal brief seeking the overturn of the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission’s decision to throw out Barack Obama-era net neutrality rules. Bowden alleged that Verizon had throttled a SIM card connecting a fire department mobile command vehicle named “OES 5262” to 1/200th of its normal speed, putting lives and property at risk, and that the company’s support team refused to lift the restrictions until fire officials purchased a new data plan at “more than twice the cost.” Ars Technica wrote: “County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,” Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a declaration. “This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire’s ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.” Bowden’s declaration was submitted in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission. The government agencies are seeking to overturn the recent repeal of net neutrality rules in a lawsuit they filed against the Federal Communications Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. According to Bowden, County Fire IT staff verified the connection was being throttled, which “severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively.” When those staff reached out and said the throttling was impacting public safety, Verizon customer support personnel confirmed they had deliberately limited OES 5262's connection, but that it would only be restored if County Fire switched to a more expensive plan and contacted the billing department. As a result, fire personnel were forced to use other departments’ service providers as well as their personal devices until County Fire paid up. Bowden wrote those personnel were deployed to help fight the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest in the state. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that fire is extremely hazardous to the nearly 3,500 firefighters currently fighting it, with Draper City, Utah fire department Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett dying this month while trying to help contain the blaze. In general, the blazes across the state have increasingly exhibited extreme behavior like immense fire tornadoes. Adding a service provider dispute to this situation is indisputably not helpful. Bowden further alleged that Verizon knew full well what it was doing and took advantage of the situation to “coerce” County Fire into paying more: While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher-cost plans, ultimately paying significantly more for mission-critical service—even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. In a statement provided to Gizmodo as well as Ars Technica, a Verizon spokesperson wrote that the company “made a mistake in how we communicated with our customer about the terms of its plan,” which was a “government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost.” The spokesperson wrote that while the plan offers “unlimited amount of data... speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle”—though they added that Verizon maintains “a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations” and the incident was a “customer support mistake.” Verizon also stated that the matter had “nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court.” It’s true that throttling a plan that goes over its data limits isn’t a net neutrality issue per se. The Obama-era rules prohibited service providers from artificially slowing down or blocking content in a discriminatory fashion, whether it’s to limit their customers’ access to rival services or just charge extortionate fees to access certain services. But Bowden’s argument appears to be that County Fire’s experience with Verizon led him to believe they are quite willing to do just that to emergency personnel. “Please work with us,” a fire official wrote to Verizon on July 30th, according to documents filed with Bowden’s addendum. “All we need is a plan that does not offer throttling or caps of any kind.” [ Ars Technica ]","Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday.

Wall Street Journal,"Your editorial “ Fire and Water in California ” (Aug. 8) on California’s wildfires illustrates the need for policy makers to re-examine the shortcomings of the nation’s outdated forestry practices and initiate better policies to mitigate future disasters. Poor land management marked by bureaucratic red tape and excessive litigation during the past 30 years has led to the declining health of our national forests. The result is a marked increase in acreage ravaged by insects, disease and fire, fewer jobs and productivity in the forestry sector and a reduced amount of domestically produced lumber entering the market. Failure to properly maintain forests through prudent timber extraction has resulted in an overstocking of trees that has provided fuel for more and larger deadly fires on U.S. Forest Service (USFS) lands. The evidence clearly shows that the hands-off approach to management practices adopted in the 1990s has failed the public and only worsened the impact and severity of fires on federal lands in the ensuing years. The growing scientific consensus is that active management practices decrease the number and severity of forest fires. Moreover, this is an important safety issue. The Resilient Federal Forest Act of 2017, which has been approved by the House, would address the resiliency of our national forests by significantly reducing the red tape that has prevented the USFS from better managing its timber lands and increasing the delivery of domestic timber products into the market. By striking a more appropriate balance in how we manage our national forest system, this bill will rejuvenate a great natural resource and help reinvigorate the forestry and housing industries by increasing domestic lumber supplies. Randy Noel Chairman, National Association of Home Builders Washington California has become very antilogging. We had an active logging industry in El Dorado County that supported a large lumber of jobs at a mill near Pollock Pines, Calif., in the 1960s. Today, all of this is closed down. Of course not all fire issues are related to trees, as a lot fires involve grass and brush, but there are millions of dead or dying trees in California that need to be logged and turned into something useful. Unfortunately, all our politicians seem to do is talk about doing something, and how much it would cost. The cost would be minimal if California and the feds would allow commercial logging again. Gary Oetting King City, Calif. Each year my property is inspected in the late spring to ensure that I have reduced fire danger from the brush-covered hill behind my backyard. If the inspection fails, the city sends a crew to clear the brush and sends me the bill. If the same attention were paid to government-owned land or if the government would even allow private interests to take out the dead trees for commercial purposes, we would be better able to control the wildfires which annually ravage the state. Virgil Weatherford Woodland Hills, Calif. California’s wildfires are now polluting the other lower 48 states, as reported by Scott Bachmeier, a research meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: “much of the smoke is being ejected to high altitudes and transported eastward across the lower 48 states.” On behalf of the other lower 48 states, we call on the Environmental Protection Agency to file suit against the state of California for its failure to prevent this air pollution and the contribution to climate change that California is now causing.

Bush, California agreed to adopt more stringent standards for light bulbs two years ahead of the rest of the nation. There are still an estimated 250 million incandescent bulbs in use in California and replacing them will save $1 billion in electricity costs annually, according to estimates published by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental advocacy group. “There’s been an LED revolution — your computer, the headlight in your car, your flashlight, you name it,” said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the council. “It’s just a superior technology.” There are a few exceptions to the ban. Incandescent bulbs will still be allowed to illuminate the inside of ovens and clothes dryers. Edison’s bulb was inefficient, producing more heat than light, but it stands up much better than LEDs to high temperatures. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Associated Press,"LAKEPORT, Calif. – Jack Hattendorf steers his road grader back and forth across a dirt path cutting through blackened earth. With each pass, he smooths and tamps down the soil to remake a dirt road that fire crews tore apart days earlier to stop flames that would become part of the largest wildfire on record in California. Even as flames chew through forestland nearby, Hattendorf and others are working to repair the damage caused not by flames but by firefighters trying to stop them. They seek to restore private lands, protect the environment and water supply, and prevent erosion that can lead to mudslides like the one that tour though a community outside Santa Barbara in January, killing nearly two dozen people. ""Suppression repair"" begins almost as soon as the fire moves through and the ground cools off — a massive but often overlooked part of firefighting. ""We just follow behind when it's all done and controlled and fix everything that we can,"" said Tim Meyers, a forester for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection who is overseeing suppression repair at the twin fires known as the Mendocino Complex. Crews control wildland blazes by corralling them inside containment lines, built as quickly as possible by bulldozers and hand tools to clear flammable brush and slow or stop the spread of fire by eliminating its fuel. When the fire is extinguished in one area, a team with an array of heavy equipment goes in looking for things to repair. They replace barbed-wire cattle fences, gates and crushed culverts; smooth out dirt roads torn apart by heavy equipment; flatten the berms created by bulldozers and put hiking trails back in shape. When necessary, they work with Native American tribes to repair damage to archaeological sites or clean the pink liquid that suppresses flames out of waterways. If there's something they can't fix — say, a bulldozer plowed through an ornate gate outside someone's driveway — the property owner can file a claim for compensation. One day late last week, 19 bulldozers, four road graders, six excavators and about a dozen water tenders were assigned to make repairs at the Mendocino Complex Fire, Meyers said. Suppression repair is mainly led by foresters and other Cal Fire officials with a background in managing natural resources. They also train seasonal and permanent firefighters, Meyers said, and get help from dozens of contractors operating heavy equipment. ""Some of it's not as glamorous as the firefighting, but it's just as needed,"" Meyers said. Dawn Bodley didn't mind that bulldozers carved a containment line through her backyard. The fire swept through her property, but thanks to firefighters who stayed and fought, her home and garden were spared. ""I think those are special people,"" said Bodley, 62, who lives on a former ranch outside the city of Lakeport. ""I don't know how they do it. They run into fire to protect other people's property, not even their own."" Not everyone is pleased with how the firefighters went about their work. One rancher said bulldozers tore apart grazing land and knocked over trees with no apparent strategy. The rancher who refused to give his name because he didn't want to be identified criticizing firefighters said the repair crews have done good work, which he appreciates, but was irritated so much damage was done in the first place. Full containment of the largest-ever California wildfire that's burning about 120 miles (264 kilometers) north of San Francisco still is weeks away, but suppression work is in full gear and could last months. Among the most important tasks: building dirt humps across bulldozer scars to direct water away from the bare, dusty path. That prevents sediment from clouding streams and rivers, which is harmful to endangered fish. It also helps to control erosion — a serious concern after fire wipes out the vegetation that holds soils together. The mudslides that buried parts of the wealthy community of Montecito in January were triggered by rainfall that came quickly after the fire and before suppression repairs were done. The work can't prevent that kind of erosion, Meyers said, but it might slow it down. With California facing larger and more destructive wildfires because of heat and drought blamed on climate change, repair work is beginning earlier to ensure more manpower and equipment are available, he said. Keith and Melissa Barnhart, who manage a mobile home park that firefighters used as a base, said they were impressed with how well the crews cleaned up. The main evidence of the effort is pink liquid dropped by planes to slow flames that coats the trailers and buildings. ""It's pink, but we're happy,"" Keith Barnhart said. ""We'd rather see pink than black.""","Fox News Firefighting mars the earth.

Mark Kaufman,"Triple-digit temperatures and parched land have left much of California's expansive forests vulnerable to any spark or flame.

""In California, persistent heat and dryness increased fire danger,"" wrote the U.S. Drought Monitor on July 24, the day after the Carr fire began. In particular, the area around Redding is experiencing conditions worse than ""abnormally dry,"" and is now listed as experiencing ""moderate drought."" Much of the entire heat-stricken Northern Hemisphere has recently experienced record heat waves or above-average summer temperatures. Redding could be experiencing its warmest July on record, according to KRCR News meteorologist Rob Elvington. Redding's scorching 2018 summer isn't an anomaly. Each of the city's last June-July average temperatures for the last five years have been among the five hottest on record, noted Elvington. These conditions have helped further dry out the land and spawn a fire that leapt over the Sacramento River last week. Those conditions also stoked a towering vortex that propelled the Carr Fire's own violent weather system. ""This is a large and dangerous plume dominated fire in which spreading is not driven by the wind, but rather the fire itself,"" the National Weather Service wrote over the weekend. During the day, satellite images have picked up the fire's towering plume, which exploded to over 20,000 feet in around 40 minutes.

There are plenty of photoshops as well: And videos really show how the Finns get the job done: Other countries got in on the act as well, with Germans lamenting the fact that their un-raked forests are vulnerable, and Canadians showing how they rake the forest in the most futuristic ways possiblewith their Roombas. For the record, these historic and devastating fires in the United States are being made worse by climate change, not a lack of raking. The long and the short of it? President Trump, no matter what you think of his policies, is simply too dumb to be president. He has no idea what hes talking about on almost any subject and just makes things up as he goes along. Previous presidents used to have their entire legacies defined by a single gaffe. But well forget all about this raking nonsense by tomorrow because there will almost certainly be some new, mind-numbingly idiotic comment that shows just how dumb our president can be. Its a scary time for America. But at least we can take solace in the fact that President Trumps incompetence and lack of intellectual curiosity might actually be making us safer. Its hard to share vital national security secrets with foreign adversaries when you dont even read your presidential daily brief. What an idiot.","President Donald Trump stood near the charred remains of Paradise, California on Saturday (he called it “Pleasure”) and said that Finland doesn’t have problems with destructive wildfires because that country “rakes” the forest.
