The fire broke out inside the three-storey building just after midnight on Tuesday. Police have arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected arson. Reports allege he blocked the bar's only exit with a motorbike before starting the fire. Video circulating on social media showed bystanders watching as intense flames engulfed the bar. Police were first alerted to the fire at 00:30 local time on Tuesday (16:30 GMT Monday). It was extinguished by 00:55, according to a statement by Qingyuan police on micro-blogging site Weibo. Suspected arsonist Liu Chunlu, who according to the police suffered from burns as a result of the fire, was arrested the next morning. According to state broadcaster CCTV, he had blocked the only entry and exit point and then lit a fire. Authorities had offered a 200,000 yuan (£22,746; $31,665) reward to anyone who provided information leading to the suspect's capture. Last year, 22 people were killed after a fire broke out in a two-storey house in eastern China. Police later arrested a man for allegedly setting the residential building on fire. In 2016, 17 people onboard a bus were killed in a suspected arson attack, with a man later arrested in connection with the incident.",A 32-year-old suspect has been arrested on suspicion of starting the fire and blocking the only exit.,2018-04-24T07:32:57Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","Fire in karaoke bar in Yingde, China kills 18",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43875528,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16C11/production/_101010239_arson.png,bbc-news,BBC News,arsonist,1
Idrees Ali,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. general accused Russia on Tuesday of playing a destabilizing role in Syria and acting as “both arsonist and firefighter,” as a brief truce unilaterally declared by Moscow in the eastern Ghouta region collapsed. The United States and Russia have been on different sides of the seven-year-old war, with Moscow heavily backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad whose forces are besieging eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held area near Damascus. “Diplomatically and militarily, Moscow plays both arsonist and firefighter, fueling tensions among all parties in Syria... then serving as an arbitrator, to resolve disputes, attempting to undermine and weaken each party’s bargaining positions,” said U.S. Army General Joseph Votel. Votel is the head of the U.S. military’s Central Command. He was speaking to a House of Representatives Armed Services Committee hearing. Over the past week, Syria’s army and its allies have subjected eastern Ghouta to one of the heaviest bombardments of the war, killing hundreds. A Russian call for a five-hour truce on Tuesday failed to halt the bombing, with residents saying that government warplanes had resumed striking the region after a brief lull. The United Nations said it was proving impossible to aid civilians or evacuate the wounded, and said all sides must instead abide by a full 30-day ceasefire demanded by the U.N. Security Council. On Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Russia was failing to abide by the ceasefire. “They’re not adhering to the ceasefire because they continue to sponsor and back Bashar al-Assad’s government. That is tragic,” Nauert said, pointing to the rising death toll among civilians and children. She said the attacks in eastern Ghouta were “horrific” and likened the devastation there to the assault last year on Aleppo. RUSSIA‘S SYRIAN ALLY Votel said Russia had failed to rein in its Syrian ally. “I think either Russia has to admit that it is not capable, or it doesn’t want to play a role in ending the Syrian conflict. I think their role is incredibly destabilizing at this point.” He added that Moscow was using Syria to test new weapons and military tactics, and it had increased its surface-to-air missiles in the region that threatened the United States’ ability to “dominate the airspace.” As Islamic State militants near defeat in Syria, tensions between the United States and Russia have risen and added uncertainty to an already complex battlefield of opposing local fighters and their international backers, which also include Turkey and Iran. Votel became the latest in a string of senior U.S. defense officials to decline public comment on whether Russian civilian contractors were involved in a Feb. 7 attack on U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in Syria. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said that the United States is still unsure who directed the attack. Reuters has reported that about 300 men working for a Kremlin-linked Russian private military firm were either killed or injured in Syria. U.S. Senator Chris Coons told reporters on Tuesday there were “a fair number of Russian and Iranian and Syrian casualties.” Separately, Votel said the U.S. military was seeing some “positive indicators” from Pakistan, showing it is becoming more responsive to U.S. concerns about militant safe havens. Relations between the allies have plummeted recently and last week Washington persuaded member states of the Financial Action Task Force to put Pakistan back on the watchlist of nations with inadequate terrorist financing or money laundering controls. “It does not yet equal the decisive action that we would like to see them take in terms of a strategic shift, but they are positive indicators,” Votel said.

N. R. KLEINFIELD,"After graduating from Cornell in 1970, he joined the Marines, specializing in intelligence work. When he left the military after four years — he saw no action in Vietnam — he got a graduate degree at the University of Cambridge. Hoping to enter intelligence work, he was blocked by a government hiring freeze. He held various engineering jobs, working on, among other things, automobile airbags and the innards of missiles, before retiring in 2009. He always nursed an interest in institutional history. “Lots of people are forward-looking,” he said. “I can’t go through life without looking through the rearview mirror.” An active alumnus of his fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, he learned in 1985 that the Cornell chapter had records dating back to 1870. To preserve its heritage, and as a distraction from lingering depression over a woman who “dumped” him 15 years earlier, he decided to write its history. He has been publishing it online piecemeal. He has reached 1969. While scrolling through newspaper clippings for his project in early 2013, he tripped over stories about the fatal fire. “I had forgotten about it completely and thought, that’s interesting,” he said. “The thing that came immediately to mind was, who was this arsonist? And the story just died.” So began an absorption that crossed into obsession. Ever since, the fire has inhabited Bill Fogle. From his home in Mesa, Ariz., he has sought to uncover the truth of what happened inside the burning Res Club and of how it was investigated. A law enforcement officer warned him, “Don’t go down a rabbit hole,” and he thought right back, “You tell a U.S. Marine that and that’s exactly what he does.” To assist with his sleuthing, the 70-year-old Mr. Fogle assembled a fleet of helpers, including a number of Phuds. Some applaud him — one calls him “amazing”— while others have come to find him too off-putting, too wobbly in his beliefs, too condescending. Some dismiss him as a “nut case” and worse. By entangling himself with them, Mr. Fogle became a story inside a story, one of compulsion and connections and the slipperiness of narrative. For better or worse, he awakened the Cornell fire and brought it to the present to live again.","The 1967 blaze at Cornell University killed 9, including members of a fast-track Ph.D. program.

Connie Loizos,"According to a new report from a Raleigh, N.C. television affiliate WRAL, Google might have quietly helped local detectives in their pursuit of two gunmen who committed separate crimes roughly one-a-half years apart. How? According to the story, Raleigh police presented the company with warrants not for information about specific suspects but rather data from all the mobile devices that were within a certain distance of the respective crime scenes at the time the crimes were committed. In one of its homicide cases, Raleigh police reported asked Google to provide unique data for anyone within a 17-acre area that includes both homes and businesses; in the other, it asked for user data across “dozens” of apartment units at a particular complex. As the outlet notes, most modern phones, tablets and laptops have built-in location tracking that pings some combination of GPS, Wi-Fi and mobile networks to determine each device’s position. Users can switch off location tracking, but if they’re using a cellular network or relying on WiFi to connect, their devices are still transmitting their coordinates to third parties. Google hasn’t responded to a request for more information that we’d sent off earlier today. But in response to WRAL’s investigation, a company spokesman declined to comment on specific cases or discuss whether Google has fought requests from the Raleigh investigators, saying only that: “We have a long-established process that determines how law enforcement may request data about our users. We carefully review each request and always push back when they are overly broad.” According to a Raleigh Police Department spokesperson, the request account data was not limited to devices running Google’s Android operating system but rather all devices running any kind of location-enabled Google app. The department began using the tactic after learning about a similar search warrant in California’s Orange County, said this spokesperson. A Wake County district attorney tells WRAL that the data that investigators have sought from Google contain only anonymized account numbers without any content included, though it sounds from her comments as though Google has been complicit in supplying further information when forced to do so. “We’re not getting text messages or emails or phone calls without having to go through a different process and having additional information that might lead us to a specific individual,” she tells WRAL. Google says that in recent years, it’s been receiving between disclosure requests for between 75,000 and 80,000 users every six months. As of January 2017, which is the last time it publicly updated its transparency report about requests for user data, it says it produced data roughly 65 percent of the time that it was asked to do so. Google doesn’t publicly disclose what kind of data it provides to governmental and other authorities. Further, in cases where it does hand over data, it may be under court order not to identify the individuals impacted. Either way, the area-based search warrants Raleigh detectives have sought seem to be a newer trend, one that will undoubtedly concern Fourth Amendment advocates anew. For one thing, in addition to potentially violating the privacy of Google users and protecting them from unreasonable searches, one can imagine people being wrongly accused by sheer dint of being tied to a murder scene via cell phone location records. In fact, it has happened before. It’s also not too hard to imagine someone with nefarious designs leaving his cell phone behind. Indeed, says WRAL’s investigation, in two separate cases where Raleigh investigators have presented Google with area-based search warrants — one involving a fire and another sexual battery — there was not evidence that either the arsonist or attacker had a cell phone.","According to a new report from a Raleigh, N.C. television affiliate WRAL, Google might have quietly helped local detectives in their pursuit of two gunmen who committed separate crimes roughly one-a-half years apart.

Morgan Winsor,"Someone set fire to a mosque in Southern California on Sunday and left graffiti referencing the deadly terror attack at two mosques in New Zealand, authorities said.
Seven people were inside the Dar-ul-Arqam mosque in the city of Escondido when the blaze erupted Sunday during the early morning hours. They managed to extinguish the flames before firefighters arrived, and the building was left with only minor damage to the exterior facade. No one was injured, according to Escondido Police Lt. Chris Lick.
Authorities discovered graffiti left behind at the scene by the suspect that referred to the recent massacre in New Zealand, in which worshipers were gunned down inside the Al Noor mosque in the city of Christchurch and then at a nearby mosque in the suburb of Linwood on March 15. At least 50 people were killed, and dozens more were injured, making it the deadliest terror attack in the country's history.
""That same hatred has resurfaced in Escondido,"" Dustin Craun, executive director of San Diego's chapter for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement Sunday. ""It is disturbing enough that some sick individual would attempt to burn a house of worship to the ground, but referencing the slayings in New Zealand is beyond the pale.""
The mosque fire in Escondido is being investigated as both an arson and as a hate crime, according to Lick. There have been no suspects identified, and the investigation is ongoing.
Agents from the FBI as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting with the investigation.
""Members of the public are encouraged to call the police department to report suspicious activity in the area of the mosque,"" Lick said in a statement Sunday.
The two most recent years of FBI statistics reveal the highest number of anti-Muslim assaults ever recorded in the United States -- a threefold increase from a decade ago.
The FBI recorded 33 anti-Muslims assaults in 2007. The FBI recorded 105 such assaults in 2017, and another 168 incidents targeting Muslims for practicing their religion.","An arsonist who burned a California mosque referred to New Zealand attack in graffiti, according to police.",2019-03-25T16:40:22Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Arsonist who burned mosque referred to New Zealand attack in graffiti: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/arsonist-burned-california-mosque-referred-zealand-attack-graffiti/story?id=61919931,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/mosque-arson1-KGTV-ht-ml-190325_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,arsonist,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Gavlebocken Image caption It is a good year for the giant goat in snow-covered Gavle There is extra Christmas cheer in the Swedish town of Gavle this year because its annual giant straw goat has survived for more than three weeks. Last year's goat fell victim to an arsonist on 27 November, less than 24 hours after it had been erected. Standing 13 metres (43ft) tall, it is the world's biggest straw goat. Most of its incarnations have been burnt or vandalised since 1966, when the tradition began. However this year, the goat is still sending merry tweets. Maria Wallberg, who handles the goat's public relations, said: ""It's great that he has been left standing for so long."" She said new higher and double fences had kept intruders away. This year a non-profit security firm, X-Cons Gavleborg, also deployed guards to protect the goat, she told the BBC. News site The Local has compiled a list of the ""weirdest attacks"" on the yule goat, including an attempted kidnapping via helicopter and the time a person dressed as a gingerbread man shot it with flaming arrows. By tradition, the goat effigy goes up in Gavle, 158km (98 miles) north of Stockholm, on the first Sunday of Christian Advent. This year it has been standing since 3 December, and the town hopes the 3.6-tonne effigy will survive until 2 January. Image copyright AFP Image caption Last year the Gavle Goat was destroyed by fire just hours after being inaugurated Gavle's official tourism website says the famous effigy was invented by Stig Gavlen, a man who proposed a giant version of the straw goat ornaments that Swedes put on show at Christmas. The intention was to boost business at shops and restaurants in the area. Giant Goat facts: It is made from a lorryload of straw from a nearby village, Mackmyra Its straw coat is made from 56 five-metre straw mats Its wooden skeleton is made from 1,200 metres of Swedish pine Construction involves 1,000 hours of labour Gavle sent the goat to Zhuhai, a twin town in China, in 2015 and it drew 420,000 admirers It has 14,600 Twitter followers. Ms Wallberg said the Gavle Goat ""is very popular and has fans all over the world"". ""We are often asked if it's better for Gavle that the goat burns down. We say it's the opposite - he is an attraction, a reason to visit Gavle. ""When he stays safe our visitors can experience him at Castle Square in Gavle and that's much better for the shops, restaurants and hotels.""",A giant straw goat built every year in Gavle has defied the usual vandals.,2017-12-28T14:23:48Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Sweden's giant Gavle goat survives Christmas,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42502375,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/138ED/production/_99390108_mediaitem99390106.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,arsonist,1
Eliza Relman,"In an effort to paint the Democratic Party as increasingly radical, Republicans have begun attacking a rising star on the left, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who was elected into a House leadership position on Wednesday and is widely viewed as a potential future speaker of the House. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel attacked Jeffries in a Wednesday tweet accusing him of characterizing the president and his administration as ""racist,"" and calling the Brooklyn Democrat a ""radical."" Jeffries has specifically said he doesn't believe the president is a racist, but described Trump as a ""racial arsonist"" who ""uses race to advance his own ends"" in an interview with CNN last year after Trump blamed ""many sides"" for a deadly Ku Klux Klan rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. In that interview, Jeffries said Trump ""chose to pull the sheets off and reveal himself, in terms of his tendency to be a racial arsonist, fanning the flames of hatred,"" an apparent reference to the KKK's white robe uniform. And he argued that the president has a history of elevating racist sentiment, pointing to Trump's years-long promotion of the ""racist lie"" that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the US, known as the ""birther"" conspiracy. McDaniel also referred to Jeffries' April 2017 comment that, ""while Jim Crow may be dead, he's got some nieces and nephews that are alive and well. And a few of them are running around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."" And she appeared to attack comments Jeffries made on the House floor last year, in which he argued that while not every Trump supporter is a racist, ""every racist in America voted for Donald Trump."" Jeffries, 48, was elected chairman of the House Democratic caucus on Wednesday — the fifth most-senior leadership role in the lower chamber — and is one of the youngest members of the party's new leadership team, at at time when many in the party are pushing for a new generation of leaders. But many progressives were pulling for Rep. Barbara Lee — a 72-year-old from California with a strong left-wing record — over Jeffries, who ultimately beat Lee by 10 votes. Jeffries' ascendance was facilitated by another New York progressive, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who successfully primaried longtime incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, who currently occupies the post Jeffries will soon take over.","In an effort to paint the Democratic Party as increasingly radical, the GOP has begun attacking a rising star in the House, Rep.

PETER BAKER,"During his 2016 campaign, he regularly summoned images of violence. He warned that youd have riots if he did not win the Republican nomination and suggested that Second Amendment people could stop Mrs. Clinton. He encouraged physical responses to protesters who disrupted his campaign events. If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? he said at one rally, promising if they did, I will pay for the legal fees. At another, he said of a protester, Id like to punch him in the face. As a protester was being taken out by security at a third rally, he said: Try not to hurt him. If you do, Ill defend you in court. His messages include inherent contradictions. Upset at the allegations made against Justice Kavanaugh, he lately has extolled due process, even as he bathes in lock her up chanting about opponents who have never been charged with a crime. He has talked a lot about the presumption of innocence but says he is 99 percent sure Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, leaked a letter accusing Justice Kavanaugh of sexual assault. His certainty was based not on evidence but on her body language in denying it. It was his comments about Ms. Feinstein that generated the lock her up chants in Council Bluffs, following the more ritual lock her up chants at the mention of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump then said Democrats have grown out of control: You dont hand matches to an arsonist, and you dont give power to an angry left-wing mob. And thats what the Democrats are becoming. Anger so infuses politics today that Mr. Trumps campaign has taken to broadcasting a prerecorded warning at his rallies before the president arrives urging his supporters not to resort to violence if they see a protester during the event. Do not in any way touch or harm a protester, the announcer says.

Just moments before,12 jurists had announced they'd found the man accused of setting the fire guilty. ""Yes,"" each said when asked one by one if that was their true verdict. The trial of Marq Vincent Perez, who was indicted last year of a hate crime related to the Jan. 28, 2017 fire at the Victoria Islamic Center, began last week at the federal courthouse. It took the jury about three hours of deliberations before finding him guilty of three felony counts including damage to a religious property, use of fire to commit a federal felony and possession of a destructive device related to an earlier incident. ""No group anywhere in the United States of America should be subjected to such hate crimes,"" said Omar Rachid, who handles community and public relations for the mosque. ""I think what the jury has done today, this afternoon, is send a message loud and clear that such behavior and such crimes will not be tolerated,"" he continued. U.S. District Judge John D. Rainey will decide Perez's sentence at an Oct. 2 hearing. The date could coincide with the opening of the newly built mosque. ""God works in mysterious ways, and maybe one of those ways he has in store for us is that the sentencing could very well take place at about the time we take possession of our new mosque,"" Rachid said.

He also suggested that Perez was ""profiled"" because he's conservative, had a brief stint in the military and was allegedly a part of the militia group. Di Carlo flipped through a copy of the Quran that had been admitted into evidence. ""And do not cover the truth with falsehood,"" he read, asking the jury to find Perez not guilty. He told reporters after the trial's conclusion that the entirety of Perez's social media postings and interview with investigators weren't allowed to be entered into evidence at trial and that ""only things that were adverse to his interests came in."" Di Carlo said he was surprised by the jury's decision.

""Again, as stated during the trial, there was issues regarding his concern about Middle-Eastern people, about terrorists, about illegal immigrants and the mention of religion was very, very minimal."" ""I hope that point was made to the jurors,"" he continued. ""Perhaps it wasn't made well enough."" Di Carlo said Perez took the verdict ""very somberly."" U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick lauded the conviction as a commitment to protect religious liberty. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the religious liberty of all people and their ability to practice their faith without being the target of this kind of dangerous activity.” Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said the department "" is committed to holding hate crimes perpetrators accountable under the law."" “All people are entitled to live free from violence and fear, regardless of their religion or place of worship,” Gore said. “Perez’s actions were criminal, unlawful and dangerous."" Perez faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the hate crime count and up to 10 years for possessing an unregistered destructive device, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. For use of a fire to commit a felony, the penalty is consecutive and he faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison. Each count carries a possible $250,000 fine. And as Perez awaits a decision on how long he'll be behind bars, members of the mosque are looking forward to opening the doors of their new mosque.

""The last thing we want to do is for evil to win by making us... be separated from our community,"" Abe Ajrami said. He extended thoughts and prayers to Perez, adding that maybe Perez can use his time in jail to learn about Islam. He also extended prayers to Perez's family. ""There is no hard feeling here, and I can tell you in the name of the Muslim community, Mr. and Mrs. Perez are invited to the open house."" At the end of the day, what's more important than the verdict is how the community came together following the fire, Ajrami said. ""That's what gives me hope,"" he said.

Gina Martinez,"Police have arrested and charged the man suspected of starting the “Holy Fire” that has destroyed up to 14 structures, Orange County District Attorney’s office said. Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, was charged with two counts of felony arson, one count of felony threat to terrorize, and one count of misdemeanor resisting arrest on Thursday. If convicted he faces up to life in prison. He is currently being held on $1 million bail. According to CNN reports, Clark texted Holy Jim Volunteer Fire Department Chief Mike Milligan two weeks ago saying “the place is going to burn”. The Holy Fire has already burned over 18,000 acres since it began at the Cleveland National Forest’s Trabuco Canyon, near Orange County, on Monday afternoon. The blaze has quickly spread to Riverside County and it remains only 5% contained, U.S. Forest Service officials said Friday. The fire has grown quickly because of high temperatures and the area’s steep terrain, according to the Cleveland National Forest. It has caused the evacuation of over 20,000 homes in Southern California. The Holy Fire is just one of the wildfires currently ravaging California. The Mendocino Complex Fire has burned through over 290,000 acres in Northern California and as of last week was named the largest wildfire in California history.","Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, was charged with two counts of felony arson",2018-08-10T15:31:20Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Alleged Holy Fire Arsonist Texted ‘The Place is Going to Burn’ to Fire Department Chief,http://time.com/5363929/holy-fire-arsonist-arrested/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/forrestgordonclark.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,arsonist,1
Jonathan Lloyd,"What to Know The Holy fire started Aug. 6 near the border of Riverside and Orange counties in Cleveland National Forest The fire spread quickly in dry brush, steep terrain and extremely hot weather The fire is one of more than a dozen large wildfires burning this summer throughout California A 22,158-acre wildfire allegedly set by an arsonist has forced the evacuation of more than 7,400 homes and destroyed about a dozen buildings as it rampaged through dry brush and into a Riverside County neighborhood. Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for Riverside and Orange counties as the Holy Fire has blackened 10,236 acres of the Cleveland National Forest and was 36 percent contained as of Saturday evening. It forced the evacuation of more than 7,400 homes totaling about 21,400 people. The fire burned about 10,200 acres by Thursday, spreading to an estimated 18,100 acres Friday morning. Overnight flare-ups cast embers into decades-old dry brush, sparking spot fires that kept firefighters on the move and residents on the lookout. By Saturday evening, the fire had charred 22,158 acres. While the flames had charred more land, the increased containment size meant that some area evacuations were lifted Saturday. Those rescinded evacuation orders were limited to Horsethief Canyon, Rice Canyon and McVivker Drainage. Mountain Street at Avocado Way in Lake Elsinore remained closed, the CNF said. ""It burned all the way across and I was up until about 5 this morning,"" said Lake Elsinore resident Fred Heldreth. ""I slept for about an hour and a half, got up again and there's just still fire all over. The rocks are what saved it from burning all the way down. It would hit those rocks and stop."" It is one of 13 large fires burning Friday in California, where more than 13,500 firefighters are on the front lines. The fires have scorched more than 671,000 acres and damaged or destroyed more than 2,000 buildings. About 3,300 residents remain evacuated statewide. Since it erupted Monday afternoon, the Holy fire has destroyed a dozen cabins in the Holy Jim Canyon area of the Cleveland National Forest and advanced into Riverside County. While the blaze continued its unrelenting march, U.S. Forest Service officials said Thursday they ""expect favorable weather conditions this weekend"" to help the firefighting effort. On Thursday afternoon, the flames raced downhill toward Lake Elsinore, threatening homes and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for homes fronting the mountains. As a roaring firefighting air tanker soared overhead, at least one resident used a garden hose in an effort to protect homes. ""It's right there on the hill... and there's active firefighting going on right now"" to keep the flames from homes, said Thanh Nguyen of the Garden Grove Fire Department, who is one of the spokesman for the firefighting effort. What started as voluntary evacuations around 1:30 p.m. quickly escalated in 30 minutes to mandatory evacuations, Nguyen said. At their height, the flames appeared to be licking at the backs of homes closest to the mountains, but a series of precision drops of water and fire retardant successfully deflected the blaze, at least temporarily, and there were no immediate reports of homes being damaged in the area. A large swath of homes, however, was bathed fire retardant, creating the appearance of a bright red river cutting through the threatened neighborhood. Riverside County sheriff's deputies stepped up patrols in the evacuated areas to prevent looting, Nguyen said. The Holy Fire is being fed by thick, tinder-dry brush that hasn't burned in nearly four decades. The fire was reported about 1:15 p.m. Monday near Holy Jim Canyon and Trabuco Creek roads, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Tony Bommarito said. The governor's emergency declaration means that state resources would be used to help with the blaze which has threatened thousands of homes, critical infrastructure and has caused the evacuation of residents. The fire is believed to have been intentionally set and an arrest has been made. Forrest Gordon Clark was being held in lieu of $1 million bail. He faces charges of aggravated arson damaging at least five inhabited structures, arson of inhabited property, arson of forest and criminal threats, all felonies, as well as two misdemeanour counts of resisting arrest, according to Assistant District Attorney Chris Duff. Clark refused to leave his jail cell Thursday, delaying his scheduled arraignment until Friday, when it was once again pushed back. He is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 17. The fire dramatically increased in size near the Horsethief Canyon area on Wednesday, then jumped the North Main Divide dirt road, burning into the Lake Elsinore area of Riverside County, Bommarito said. As the fire advanced into Riverside County, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for McVicker Canyon, Rice Canyon, Horsethief Canyon, Glen Eden, El Cariso Village, Sycamore Creek and Rancho Capistrano, along with the Ortega (74) Highway corridor from the Lookout restaurant to the Nichols Institute. Weather conditions with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees and relative humidity below 15 percent created conditions conducive to extreme fire behavior as well as heat illnesses for the firefighters, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a smoke advisory through Friday in Orange County and portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties because of the Holy fire. In Los Angeles, the advisory covers the east and south San Gabriel Valley and Pomona/Walnut Valley.

Reuters,"A rescue worker holds an injured girl in the rebel held besieged town of Hamouriyeh Thomson Reuters Syrian government forces and allied militias gained ground on Wednesday in clashes with rebels in eastern Ghouta near Damascus as fighting raged despite a Russian ceasefire plan, according to a war monitor. The Russian plan is for daily, five-hour ceasefires in eastern Ghouta, but after a brief lull, the agreement collapsed into renewed bombardment on Tuesday, the first day of the plan. Syria blamed the rebels for breaking the truce by shelling Damascus, insurgents denied such shelling, and a senior U.S. general accused Moscow of acting as ""both arsonist and firefighter"" by failing to rein in Assad. BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces and allied militias gained ground on Wednesday in clashes with rebels in eastern Ghouta near Damascus as fighting raged despite a Russian ceasefire plan, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. The government forces advanced in the Hawsh al-Dawahira area on the eastern edge of the opposition's besieged stronghold, the Observatory reported. The Syrian army and rebel sources could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. The Russian plan is for daily, five-hour ceasefires in eastern Ghouta from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0700 GMT to 1200 GMT). But after a brief lull, the agreement collapsed into renewed bombardment on Tuesday, the first day of the plan. Eastern Ghouta, where the United Nations says around 400,000 people live, is a major target for President Bashar al-Assad, who has recovered numerous areas from rebels with Russian and Iranian military backing. On Feb. 18, the government and its allies began one of the heaviest bombardments of Syria's seven-year conflict on eastern Ghouta, killing hundreds of people in air and artillery strikes, the Observatory and local rescue workers say. It led the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution on Saturday calling for a full, 30-day humanitarian ceasefire reaching across all of Syria but excluding some jihadist groups. Moscow and Damascus blamed rebels for the collapse of the truce on Tuesday, saying fighters had shelled a safe route intended for civilians to leave the enclave. The insurgents denied such shelling, and a senior U.S. general accused Moscow of acting as ""both arsonist and firefighter"" by failing to rein in Assad. A Syrian military source said the corridor was open for a second day on Wednesday to allow civilians, the sick and wounded to leave eastern Ghouta. But state TV reported that no civilians had left the area on Tuesday or Wednesday. Rebels say people will not leave eastern Ghouta because of fear of the Syrian government. The eastern Ghouta is an area of farmland and towns that represents the rebels' last major stronghold near Damascus. Smoke rises from the besieged Eastern Ghouta in Damascus Thomson Reuters Rebels have intensified shelling of nearby government-held Damascus. A medical official in the capital said on Monday 36 people had been killed in four days. Damascus and Moscow say the campaign in eastern Ghouta is needed to halt such shelling. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday the plan would allow aid to be delivered to eastern Ghouta. But the United Nations said it was proving impossible to aid civilians or evacuate wounded, and said all sides must instead abide by the 30-day truce sought by the U.N. Security Council. With no sign of decisive international pressure to stop the attack, eastern Ghouta seems likely to meet the same fate as other areas won back by the government, where rebels and dissident civilians eventually left in negotiated withdrawals. The multi-sided Syrian war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven half of the pre-war population of 23 million from their homes. Fighting has escalated on several fronts this year, with the collapse of Islamic State giving rise to conflict between other Syrian and foreign parties. As Assad has pressed the offensive against eastern Ghouta, Turkey has launched an incursion against Kurdish fighters in the northwestern Afrin region. Tensions have also flared between Iran and Israel, alarmed by Tehran's influence in Syria. Syrian air defenses shot down an Israeli F-16 earlier this month as it returned from a bombing raid on Iran-backed positions in Syria.","Thomson Reuters Syrian government forces and allied militias gained ground on Wednesday in clashes with rebels in eastern Ghouta near Damascus as fighting raged despite a Russian ceasefire plan, according to a war monitor.

JIM DWYER,"Photo During a flood in the 1980s, when the subways were suffering from neglect, a nun waded along a ramp from the Times Square shuttle to the Lexington Avenue line. Credit Neal Boenzi/The New York Times Things don’t always get worse. In outlaw days, someone stole the steps to the elevated train station at Livonia Avenue in Brooklyn, and there were no plans to replace them until a photograph of a man shimmying up the banister ran on the front page of a newspaper. An arsonist burned the mezzanine of another el station, at Intervale Avenue in the Bronx, and it stayed closed for three years; officials did not want to rebuild it. The Franklin Avenue shuttle line in Brooklyn fell into such ruin that M.T.A. officials wanted to walk away from it. An influential figure with the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group, urged closing 30 stations and shutting down entirely several lines in the Bronx. All these episodes took place during the 1980s, when gangsters might as well have openly connived with establishment figures. Neglect, dressed up as responsible resource-allocation decisions, can be just as violent as a can of gasoline and a book of matches, if slower acting. Most immediately, the victims were people cut off from transportation: nurses’ aides, fabric cutters, doormen, shipping clerks, young students going off to school, sick people headed to their doctors. Had these shrinkage schemes not been foiled, they would have been acts of vandalism against the future. But people pushed back. Politicians howled. The transit authorities yielded. The total riderships in 2016 for Livonia in Brooklyn and Intervale in the Bronx were one million at each station. Sometimes, politics works. Sometimes, what looks like pandering winds up being good civic hygiene. On Thursday a new generation of thinkers and researchers with the Regional Plan Association published a new plan for the region, a serious work about transportation, housing and sustainability that weaves thorough analyses of problems with proposed solutions. It commands respectful attention, not awe. One of its ideas is to break up the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or at least farm out its work to new public bodies, in order to protect transit operations from changes in the political weather. The current subway mess begins, it should be noted, with an epochal success by political figures. In 1979, with the transit system on the brink of collapse, Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed a shrewd and well-liked builder, Richard Ravitch, to be chairman of the M.T.A. Mr. Ravitch insisted that everyone — in government, and in the general public — see that the infrastructure was made of parts that had to be replaced before they failed, not after. Since then, the public has invested more than $100 billion. Ridership has doubled. New York has boomed. Even over the last two years, with a slight decrease in the number of passengers, the city remains close to peak subway ridership. During busy times, half of the city’s 20 main lines have room for neither more trains nor riders. Five other lines have no room for more trains. A 10-minute delay for a sick passenger at rush hour can hold up 72 trains, about 144,000 people. Crowding is a force multiplier. Ridership is not much different today than a decade ago, but the system was in better shape then. Why? Too much maintenance was cut after the 2008 fiscal crisis and not restored when the economy recovered because, in the meantime, transit debt ballooned, with pension costs also rising. And the debt climbed because it was convenient for vanished governors, legislators and mayors to borrow money for transit infrastructure, rather than annoy people by raising taxes or fares. So they punted the ball into the future, and it landed around 2012. The people running the system did not have enough money to keep current with repairs, serve the swarms of riders, and pay the debt. So they paid the debt, as required by law. The past was vandalizing the present. Now a frantic maintenance and repair catch-up effort is underway.

In fact, it has occasionally helped.",2017-11-30T23:18:31Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","About New York: Politics in the Subways: Great When It Works, a Mess When It Doesn’t",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/nyregion/subway-politics-mta-report.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/01/nyregion/01-Y-ABOUT/01-Y-ABOUT-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,arsonist,1
"Allie Conti, Lauren Messman","A massive forrest fire that began in the Holy Jim Canyon of Southern California has ravaged more than 18,000 acres and threatened about 7,000 homes since Monday. Nearly 20,000 people have had to be evacuated so far, and it's unlikely they'll be able to return home soon: Only about 5 percent of the blaze has been contained. On Thursday, police arrested 51-year-old Forrest Clark, the man they believe intentionally started the fire after he allegedly sent a text to a volunteer firefighter two weeks ago saying, ""This place is going to burn."" And although it's unclear why Clark may have started the fire, his Facebook page shows that he traded in a wide range of conspiracy theories, some of which have influenced others to act violently in the past. ""The guy was like a canary in a coal mine,"" JJ McNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, wrote on Twitter. ""He was always one of the first true believers to glom onto whatever conspiracy theory was new and sexy that month."" Some of the conspiracies Clark posted about were merely goofy, like the Illuminati, ancient aliens, and Flat Earthism. Most recently, he seemed to have bought into Qanon, which some suspect to be a troll on Boomer conservatives. Meanwhile, others were directly related to forest fires and some did veer into extremist territory. For instance, his Facebook activity suggests he was obsessed with the idea of secret pedophile rings —the same idea that led a man to bring an assault rifle to a Washington, DC, pizza parlor back in 2016. He also identified as a sovereign citizen, like the man who killed four people at a Waffle House this past April. Clark's apparent delusional belief system also seemed to have extended into his own wellbeing: Despite posting about having skin cancer, he also seem preoccupied with pseudo-scientific ""cures"" like beets. The fire that Clark allegedly started is smaller than both the Carr Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fire, which are both in Northern California. However, it's fierce and has spread across county lines. Even amid a notable season that's seen more than a dozen flare-ups throughout the state, authorities are calling the so-called Holy Fire a ""monster."" ""This shouldn’t be called the Holy Jim fire, it should be called the Holy Hell fire,"" Orange County supervisor Todd Spitzer said during a press conference on Wednesday. The alleged arsonist has been charged with five felonies. He's being held on $1 million bond and could face life in prison if convicted, although he says that he was ""asleep"" when the fire started.

Xeni Jardin,"This post is going to be super upsetting if you are a cat person. I am sorry. A dozen cats have been found across part of Washington State since February, and authorities are trying to find the person who killed them. It appears that the pace of cat murders is increasing. The mutilated remains of beloved pets have shown up in public places around Olympia, Wash. — on front lawns, in neighborhood parks, even on the grounds of a church. There may well be more cats involved. A case reported in Lacey, Wash., in February, involved body parts that could have come from three different cats. As the reports have come in, so have donations. There is now a $35,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer. The case has become serious enough for the authorities in Thurston County to set up a 10-person task force, led by a former police officer with decades of experience investigating animal cases. The team, which includes a homicide detective, is to meet Thursday to put together a game plan for hunting down the cat killer. If found, the person could face as much as two years in prison for each cat killed. On Tuesday, a cat was found dead in Olympia, near where another cat’s body had been discovered just days before. All the signs indicate that the killer was the same one who has been plaguing the county for months, the authorities say. The cat had been slit down the stomach and laid out, just like the other cats found in Olympia. The cats were “displayed for people to see,” said Erika Johnson, the animal cruelty investigator leading the task force. “Kind of like an arsonist goes back to the scene of fire. They want people to find these animals.” “It’s for shock value,” Ms. Johnson added. “It’s like a trophy.” Animal abuse is often carried out by persons who are violent toward family members or other people. It is not known whether the person or people who killed these cats have harmed other humans, but investigators are looking into it.",This post is going to be super upsetting if you are a cat person.

Historians have a unique opportunity in 2018 — the centenary of British women gaining the right to vote — to re-examine a pervasive silence at the heart of the story: that of the nationwide bombing and arson campaign carried out by the Pankhursts’ Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Previous attempts to examine this phenomenon have been met with criticism and personal attacks, as traditional idealists refused to allow an in-depth critique of the leadership of the suffragettes. But the evidence is clear. Between 1912 and 1915, hundreds of bombs were left on trains, in theaters, post offices, churches, even outside the Bank of England; while arson attacks on timber yards, railway stations and private houses inflicted an untold amount of damage. Yet the lives of the women who did this have been largely forgotten and erased from history, as a long-standing desire to sanitize the actions of suffragettes and portray them as perfect activists, or perfect martyrs, has altered our perception of even those whose names we know. While some historians have begun to acknowledge the violence and extremism of the WSPU, there remains a dominant belief that its violence amounted to little more than firecrackers in tins, or a few well aimed stones. This long-running historical myth has its roots among the suffragettes themselves. While planning a potential memoir of Emily Wilding Davison in the early 1930s, Edith Mansell-Moullin wrote to Edith How-Martyn, one of the founders of the Suffragette Fellowship, asking for her advice on a difficult issue. Should she, “[as I do] … leave out the bombs?” Similarly, Sylvia Pankhurst’s claim, made in her 1931 memoir, The Suffragette Movement: An Intimate Account of Persons and Ideals, that it was Emily Wilding Davison who bombed Lloyd George’s cottage, is rarely acknowledged. Laura E. Nym Mayhall, in her work on the militant suffrage movement, identified the importance of “a small group of former suffragettes” in the 1920s and 1930s, who “created a highly stylised story” of the WSPU and the history of suffrage in England, which emphasized “women’s martyrdom and passivity.” The group set about compiling the documents, memoirs and memorabilia that now form the basis of the Suffragette Fellowship Collection held by the Museum of London. Although this is a remarkable collection, Nym Mayhall points out that it has “come to serve as a basis for much of the current scholarship on the women’s suffrage movement.” The Fellowship decided what constituted appropriate suffrage history and which stories should be minimized or left out, creating a “master narrative of the militant suffrage movement” and those it involved. At its most extreme, the Fellowship “lobbied to have incorrect passages excised from forthcoming memoirs or removed from subsequent editions of accounts already published.” As the suffragettes sanitized their own history, the real lives and experiences of the woman who had fought so hard and risked so much became the reason for their exclusion. The bombs were deemed inappropriate and those who carried out these violent actions have been hidden from view. Kitty Marion, a prolific bomber and arsonist for the suffragettes — and later an important part of the founding of Planned Parenthood, then the Birth Control League — has been consistently ignored. In her autobiography, written in the late 1930s, Marion left one of the most detailed accounts of the personal beliefs and actions of those who traveled across the country on the orders of the WPSU’s leadership to enact their self-proclaimed “Reign of Terror.” Her later role in the international campaign for birth control, operating between the U.S. and the U.K., offers one of the most interesting lives of an early feminist campaigner. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter Yet, Susan Kingsley Kent leaves Marion out entirely from her detailed history, Sex and Suffrage in Britain, 1860-1914 (1990), neither recognizing her as a member of the suffrage movement, nor as a birth control activist; nor does she feature in Hera Cook’s The Long Sexual Revolution: English Women, Sex and Contraception 1800-1975 (2004). Historian Brian Harrison fleetingly referred to Marion’s autobiography as “little more than an unreflective catalogue of [music hall] engagements,” passing over the rich complexity of her life that the autobiography encompasses. A recent biography of Emmeline Pankhurst recorded only a single mention of Marion: that she expressed “the view that there was ‘much dissatisfaction and withdrawal’” of WSPU membership after Pankhurst called for an end to militancy following the outbreak of the First World War. What is so striking about Marion’s absence is that she went to such efforts to see her history conserved. Multiple copies of her autobiography survive. A copy is held by the New York Public Library, along with her original papers and notes, and two are held in the UK, in the archive of the Museum of London and in the holdings of the Women’s Library, now conserved by the London School of Economics. At least two copies of the autobiography have been on permanent public access since Marion wrote them and yet this remarkable woman has been neglected by historians. She has been reduced to a sentence or a mere name in a list for any work on suffrage or birth control in Britain, despite working and appearing continually in both campaigns. The same has happened to Mary Richardson, Lillian Lenton and all those violent suffragettes who published or attempted to publish their own autobiographies in the decades following the suffrage campaign. We need to re-examine their lives and their own accounts to gain a clearer understanding of the suffragettes in this centenary year. It might be uncomfortable, but it is entirely necessary.

 Hundreds of Weibo users are posting pictures of themselves in gothic make-up and using the hashtag #ASelfieForTheGuangzhouMetro
China's community of goths is coming together in protest online after a woman was made to remove her make-up before being allowed to enter a busy subway. 
The woman, who media are not naming, posted on social media that she was stopped by subway security in the southern city of Guangzhou, and told that she needed to remove her dark make-up if she wanted to travel.
Although she was not carrying any prohibited items, she was told she would be refused entry unless she removed her make-up, to avoid ""distressing"" other passengers.
Since similar incidents have come to light, Weibo users have begun using the hashtag #ASelfieForTheGuangzhouMetro and sharing pictures of themselves in gothic make-up and attire.
Although subway staff have officially apologised, China's netizens are saying that it is their freedom to dress however they want, and are calling for wider acceptance of subversive styles.
What happened?

 A woman posted about her experience sparking lively discussion online
On 10 March, a woman wearing dark lipstick and heavy eye make-up was stopped at the security check point of a subway station.She described the experience on her Sina Weibo microblog. ""A female security guard called her manager, and said that my make-up was 'problematic and really horrible'."" She adds that she was asked to ""please remove it"".""I'm hoping to use this relatively public platform to challenge the authorities: what laws grant you the right to stop me and waste my time?"" she asked.The Guangzhou subway has since apologised and says that it had carried out an investigation and found that staff handled the situation inappropriately.It says it has suspended a member of staff linked to the incident and adds that she will receive remedial training when she returns to work.
#ASelfieForTheGuangzhouMetro
The unnamed woman's post has been shared more than 5,000 times, and media website NetEase brought to light at least two previous incidents on the same subway from 2018.The revelation has enraged Weibo users, and has led to thousands posting pictures of themselves in solidarity.
Some 5,000 Weibo users have used the hashtag #ASelfieForTheGuangzhouMetro, and many are criticising subway staff for ordering the woman to change the way she was dressed.Many shared pictures of themselves out in public and say that they will not be made to feel invisible.""I'm on the bus; please hand me the makeup remover,"" mocks He Jianlu.

 ""I'm sorry people of Guangzhou, sometimes I go out like this""
""I've had too many scary experiences on the subway, but I've never made a child feel afraid,"" says Chunmeng Dingzhi.Many say that it is their own right to choose what they wear.""If beauty ideals remain the same, then art will die out,"" adds Sansen Chenww. ""I'm not a murderer, an arsonist, I don't smoke or spit in public, I just love gothic dress.""""It's 2019, girls have the right to decide their own hairstyle and makeup, they do not need to seek the approval of strangers,"" says Qin-2Y.""What you see as fancy dress, I see as freedom,"" adds Jiolaa.
How did gothic culture enter China?
Gothic culture has entered the mainland largely as a Japanese import, as a result of the growing popularity of ""Lolita fashion"" - a style of clothing with Victorian and Edwardian influences.E-commerce websites have seen a boom of suppliers offering the flamboyant style of dress, and while it has found popularity as a form of costume play or ""cosplay"", it has also seen uptake as a choice of day-to-day wear.Japanese manga novels, and the Twilight novel franchise have also been influential in bringing gothic culture to China. While many books with dark themes are banned for being too violent or pornographic, some are seen by Chinese youths as treading the fine line of being acceptable, yet slightly subversive.

Emo a no-no
Music associated with western gothic culture has seen limited, but growing success in China.American band Linkin Park and Canadian singer Avril Lavigne found fame in the late 2000s, and an increased number of bars and nightclubs in major cities cater to gothic themes.
Rock music, however, as a whole is largely frowned upon in the country, and few acts enjoy much success. China is wary of subcultures that might be seen to have an adverse effect on young children, especially if they have alleged overseas influences. It has already taken steps to ban elements of hip-hop culture, with broadcasters blurring tattoos and earrings if they are worn by male performers.But with Chinese millennials having more spending power and opportunities to travel, there is the likelihood of broader exposure to gothic culture.

Ashley Reese,"An arsonist was caught on camera setting fire to a California Planned Parenthood, and the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the suspect’s arrest. ABC News reports that the fire took place on July 20 around 4 AM at a Planned Parenthood in Watsonville, California, a city just southeast of Santa Cruz. According to police, the building was moderately damaged. Nobody was hurt. While the overall rate of vandalism against abortion providers has declined, research conducted by the National Abortion Federation indicates that there has been an uptick in coordinated activities by anti-abortion activists to disrupt services and intimidate staff and clientele. These activities range from blockades and trespassing to brick throwing campaigns. The Associated Press reported on the Federation’s 2017 findings in May: Acts of trespassing increased from 247 in 2016 to 823 in 2017, instances of obstruction tripled to 1,704 and threats of death or other harm nearly doubled to 62. “The protesters are feeling emboldened by the political environment and seeing what they could get away with,” said the federation’s president, Vicki Saporta. “They want to make it more difficult to provide care, without going to very extreme forms of violence.” Emboldened is one way of putting it. In February, a man crashed a stolen truck into a New Jersey Planned Parenthood. Three people, including a pregnant woman, were injured; the suspect is facing terrorism charges. With attacks from both the Trump administration and anti-abortion menaces, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers are certainly bracing themselves for rougher waters ahead.","An arsonist was caught on camera setting fire to a California Planned Parenthood, and the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the suspect’s arrest.

Carla Herreria,"The audience at President Donald Trump ’s rally in Iowa on Tuesday night erupted with a lively “Lock her up” chant, but this time it wasn’t aimed at Hillary Clinton. The crowd jeered after Trump claimed, without evidence, that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) leaked the letter that was sent to her by Christine Blasey Ford, the California research psychologist who accused Brett Kavanaugh, then a nominee for the Supreme Court, of sexually assaulting her in 1982. “How about Sen. Feinstein? That’s a beauty,” Trump said. “Did you leak the documents?” Interrupting Trump, the crowd repeatedly chanted, “Lock her up!” “And I think they’re talking about Feinstein,” Trump said, reacting to the crowd. “Can you believe it?” “Did she leak it? One hundred percent,” he added. “I don’t want to get sued 99 percent. See? Now I can’t get sued.” Trump then took aim at the people who believe professor Ford and other survivors of sexual assault who came forward in light of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings. “You don’t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don’t give power to an angry left-wing mob,” Trump said as he worked up the crowd. Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, denied that she leaked Ford’s letter, which was first revealed by The Intercept, during the committee’s confirmation hearing on Sept. 27. Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for The Intercept, has denied that Feinstein leaked the Ford letter, its contents or its existence to his investigative team.","At an Iowa rally, Trump falsely claimed the California Democrat leaked the letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.",2018-10-10T01:07:04Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Trump Crowd Chants ‘Lock Her Up’ As President Mocks Senator Dianne Feinstein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-iowa-rally-dianne-feinstein_us_5bbd41e8e4b01470d05690e9,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bbd4d5524000031009914b7.jpeg?cache=0ac2KwnFod&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,arsonist,1
Dominique Mosbergen,"Hours after the Senate confirmed embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump celebrated the “tremendous victory” in a speech delivered to a cheering crowd of supporters in Topeka, Kansas, on Saturday night — and excoriated what he described as the Democrats’ “disgraceful campaign” to “destroy” the judge. Using the bitter, partisan battle over Kavanaugh as an example of the “devastation” Democrats could wreak if they win seats in November, Trump urged supporters to vote for Republican candidates in the midterms or risk giving power to an “angry, left-wing mob.” Pres. @realDonaldTrump : ""You don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob - and that's what they've become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob."" pic.twitter.com/E9r4Xrnrrw — The Hill (@thehill) October 7, 2018 “In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob,” said the president, who was in Kansas to drum up support for Kris Kobach, the controversial secretary of state and hardline conservative who’s vying to be Kansas’ next governor, and GOP congressional candidate Steve Watkins. “Each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict, on the Democrats’ conduct, at the ballot box,” Trump continued, warning of the “profound stakes” in the upcoming elections especially given the potential future openings on the Supreme Court. “If you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change. They could change and they could change fast,” Trump said. “You don’t hand matches to an arsonist and you don’t give power to an angry left-wing mob and that’s what they’ve become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern.” At one point in his speech, Trump claimed Democrats, who he referred to as the “party of crime,” had introduced a bill called the “Open Borders Bill” though, as CBS News pointed out, no such bill exists. Trump just making stuff up: ""Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders - and it's a bill. And it's called The Open Borders Bill. What's going on? And it's written by - guess who - Dianne Feinstein."" — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 7, 2018 Trump reiterated his staunch support of Kavanaugh, his second Supreme Court pick since taking office. Kavanaugh was accused by at least three women of sexual misconduct but Trump insisted the allegations were part of an elaborate smear campaign engineered by the Democrats a conspiracy theory that was repeatedly pushed by Republican leaders in the lead-up to Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote. “Since right from the moment we announced [Kavanaugh’s nomination], radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish and destroy,” Trump said at Saturday’s rally, prompting loud boos from the crowd. “Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect.” The president singled out Democratic Senators Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren, who he again referred to by the derogatory nickname “ Pocahontas,” for the “horror” they put Kavanaugh and his family through. “If Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want and crave,” Trump said. According to The Washington Post, Trump’s support for Kavanaugh was met with great enthusiasm from the Topeka crowd. “Kavanaugh’s name elicited thunderous applause, with supporters cheering, fist-pumping into the sky and holding up babies in celebration,” the paper wrote.

"Matthew Zeitlin, Matthew Zeitlin","Omarosa Manigualt-Newman waits to promote her new book on The ‘Today Show’ on August 13, 2018 in New York City. Not to be outshined by Watergate-chronicler Bob Woodward, former director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison and multiple-time Apprentice cast member Omarosa Manigault Newman resumed her media rounds with a new tape from inside the White House with an appearance Monday on The View. In a particularly meta-moment, Omarosa says that Trump had “specifically told” her to “go after” Joy Behar and had complained that Sarah Huckabee Sanders had not been “tough” enough during her appearance one year ago on the daytime talk show where the co-hosts “streamrolled her.” Omarosa further advanced — or muddled — the narrative around the possibly-not-real “N-word tape,” saying that while she does not “hold” the tape, she has “heard the tape.” Omarosa said “they have been talking about releasing it,” and that she suspects it will happen “around the midterms.” It’s unclear who “they” refers to. The hosts pushed her on perhaps the central question of the Omarosa heel turn: If Trump is as racist and “unhinged” as she says he is, why did she work with him in the White House and repeatedly defend him and testify to his character in public. “When you’re in an interpersonal relationship with somebody and you find out that person is an arsonist,” Omarosa replied, “you’re not going to stand by and keep handing them gasoline. I discovered Donald Trump was an arsonist trying to burn this country. In some way I was complicit … at some point you have to stop a toxic relationship.” And she speculated on who the latest senior administration official to bash the president was: She said she believed the New York Times op-ed writer was a senior official in Vice President Mike Pence’s office. (The vice president has denied the op-ed came from him or anyone on his staff.) While she didn’t say the name, she referred to his chief of staff, who is Nick Ayers. She unveiled a new tape of President Trump “crashing” a meeting with the communications staff in October 2017. “When Donald Trump got bored, which was very often because his attention span was very short, he would sometimes try to figure out what meetings were taking place in the White House and he would crash those meetings,” she said. “He came into the meeting, sat down, and he starts rambling from topic to topic, and none of it makes sense,” Omarosa said. He then went into his favorite topic: Hillary Clinton, the real colluder: I think Hillary is getting killed now with Russia. The real Russia story is Hillary and collusion. Somebody told me, Hope, you told me, it was $9 million they spent on the phony report. Sanders chimed in to say that the Clinton campaign had spent “closer to six” million, presumably referring to the dossier assembled by former British spy Christopher Steele. Trump says, “Nobody knows who spent it. No, I heard it was nine. I heard it was 5.7, but now they said it was nine.” For what it’s worth, the New York Times reported that the Clinton campaign and the DNC spent just over $12 million on the services of the law firm Perkins Coie who then, according to Reuters, paid Fusion GPS just over $1 million, of which $168,000 went to Christopher Steele’s firm. In October of last year, when Omarosa said this taped meeting occured, Trump tweeted that the Clinton campaign had spent $12 million, higher than the figures suggested by either Sanders or, also in the tape, Hope Hicks. Never seen such Republican ANGER &amp; UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 “It was spent in a law firm,” Trump says on the tape. “That way they can’t trace it. But they traced it. One thing in this business is they trace it … The reason a law firm is because this way you don’t have to give any papers. But they found out, it’s definitely illegal and it’s illegal from a campaign standpoint, from a campaign financing standpoint.” To be fair, Trump is entirely right here regarding illegal campaign contributions and tracing transactions through law firms.

SAM ROSENFELD,"If one party definitively shifted its position on an important subset of those issues — if the Republican Party shifted left on entitlements, for instance — the response by the other party could bring about a realignment. That’s what Mr. Bannon says he’s after. In fact, he peddles two different visions of realignment, depending on his audience. Sometimes it’s about building a diverse coalition united on issues of economic nationalism, pitted against a “globalist” opposition. When Mr. Bannon met with the teachers’ union president Randi Weingarten to discuss potential alliances or called the American Prospect editor Robert Kuttner, a labor liberal, to chat up his admiration for Mr. Kuttner’s position on trade, this is the realignment he seemed to be pursuing. It was reflected in Mr. Trump’s promises during the Republican primary to protect Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare; invest in infrastructure; and raise taxes on hedge fund managers. The populist party shaped by this vision would undoubtedly include some racist “deplorables,” but the racism wouldn’t be what defined the coalition — economics would. More frequently, the nature of Mr. Bannon’s envisioned realignment appears different, and darker — centered around racial and ethnic identity. Breitbart’s output under Mr. Bannon’s editorial control and the Trump who brought us the wall, the Muslim ban and the response to Charlottesville, Va., are consistent with the goal of a cross-class party coalition of whites united by whiteness. Economics wouldn’t be what defines the coalition — white nationalism would. The fact that Mr. Bannon serves simultaneously as, in the journalist Ben Smith’s words, “the guy selling a new cross-racial coalition” and “the chief arsonist of that coalition” casts suspicion about how seriously to take his pronouncements. Nevertheless, political science research confirms that large numbers of Americans hold positions on issues that are both noncentrist and inconsistent with the standard line of either modern-day liberalism or conservatism. At least some raw material exists, in other words, for a transformation of party conflict. A single election sweeping an unorthodox candidate into power hardly suffices. President Trump’s evident disinterest in even trying to reorient Republican governance away from priorities like welfare state retrenchment and regressive fiscal policy underscores the point. Mr. Bannon says he knows that realignments are something activists will have to “ grind out day in and day out for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years.” What he thinks those years of effort entail is less clear. Investment in candidate recruitment and nomination challenges would be one component. On that score, though, the lack of consistent issue or ideological patterns in the challengers that Mr. Bannon has touted so far for 2018 is notable. Even more important would be the long-term intellectual work and institution-building necessary to build political alliances among existing or emerging groups. The tweedy quarterly American Affairs presents itself as the high-level intellectual exponent of Trumpism, while Breitbart provides day-to-day red meat in the form of trolling, outrage and race-baiting cultural politics. Mr. Bannon’s one institutional reform goal in the 2018 challenges invites further skepticism. He has said he’s seeking a Republican Senate majority that would vote to do away with the filibuster, making it easier to pass Mr. Trump’s agenda. This ignores the reality that even in the event of a filibuster abolition, the agenda helped would be orthodox Republican — like the current tax cut bill — reflecting the priorities of the interests that dominate the party and the policy expertise of the Heritage Foundation veterans who staff the executive branch under Mr. Trump. By contrast, a serious pursuit of reforms that could advantage “populists” might include changes to the campaign finance system, which currently facilitates the very party dominance by plutocrats that Mr. Bannon denounces. If the potential is out there in the electorate to reshuffle the deck of political alliances and conflict, how would a serious realigner actually do it? Such a person might look at the very realignment that produced our current, polarized age. Starting in the postwar years and throughout the second half of the 20th century, politicians in both parties deliberately pursued their reorientation around modern liberalism and conservatism. National politics at midcentury involved historically high levels of bipartisanship: Conservative Southerners remained an empowered force in the Democratic Party; liberal and moderate Republicans were frequent occupants of East and West Coast statehouses and Senate seats. Key intellectuals, activists and politicians on both the left and the right came to share a systemic critique of the parties’ fuzzy programmatic overlap, as well as a democratic argument for forging disciplined, ideologically distinct parties in their stead. When, say, the United Auto Workers passed a resolution in the 1950s calling for a “real realignment” of the party system producing a “clear demarcation” between a liberal party and a conservative one, the liberal union was echoing contemporaneous sentiments expressed by the editors of National Review, who criticized the “fatuous” celebration of “bipartisanship” and heralded a “two-party system that fights its feuds in public and honestly.” The polarizers’ efforts involved both coalitional and institutional work. A postwar generation of issue-driven liberal activists battled to wrest control of Democratic organizations from traditional political machines while challenging the clout of conservative Southerners within the national party. On the right, intellectuals and operatives incorporated racial elements into a broader conservative ideology that helped to facilitate Republican forays into the Solid South. In the aftermath of the 1960s, meanwhile, movement activists like Heather Booth and Michael Harrington worked with the progressive wing of organized labor to reconstitute a labor-liberal alliance at the base of the Democratic Party, while New Right political brokers like Phyllis Schlafly and Paul Weyrich secured a lasting partnership between Republicans and a nascent Christian right. Key activists recognized the party system as a system. Transforming it would require not just ideological advocacy but reform of the party organizations themselves and the governmental institutions in which they operated. Liberal Democrats pursed congressional reforms that ended the sanctity of seniority and the autonomy of committees — which had long advantaged Southerners — while concentrating new powers in a party leadership accountable to rank-and-file sentiment. Others instituted reforms of the Democratic presidential nominating procedure that opened them up to popular participation. These reforms rendered the political system more permeable and responsive to ideological activism, with long-term consequences for the parties’ ideological sorting. By drawing new party lines across an array of issues while rendering the parties vehicles for issue-oriented politics, the polarizers helped to construct our political world. The story of how such a system came to be forged tells us something about what it would take to transform it. The ideologically defined partisan conflict that currently structures our politics is not the only world possible. But changing it would take as much collective and long-term effort as it took the polarizers to bring it about in the first place.

Ethan Gach,"Far Cry 5 ’s first piece of post-launch content went live yesterday. It’s called “Well Done” and it’s about setting animals on fire. Don’t let the name fool you, though. The game’s first live event is way undercooked. Well Done isn’t a new mission or side activity so much as an additional perk challenge. Like the ones in the game that require you to catch a certain type of fish or skin a certain number of bears, Well Done rewards you for lighting animals on fire without using flamethrowers or molotov cocktails. Kill 10 animals this way and you get 50 silver bars, the game’s premium currency. Kill 20 and you get a gold-encrusted flamethrower. If the community as a whole, meaning all the game’s players combined, reach 250,000 roasted carcasses, you get the Flamebearer costume: a black jacket, muddy pants, and a gold mask. To initiate the activity you open up your character navigation bar and scroll over to Online Activities. From there you can click on the Well Done live event to start the counter. Otherwise nothing in the game changes. As you hit each benchmark a notification will pop up telling you your reward is waiting. The silver bars automatically go into your inventory, while the flamethrower gets unlocked for you to pick up at the nearest arms dealer. There aren’t any quest givers involved, and the activity itself is pretty easy to complete. Just stock up on incendiary arrows and shotgun shells, head to the nearest farm, and get in touch with your inner arsonist. The whole thing took me about 15 minutes. The main draw of Far Cry 5 is its open world. More specifically, it’s the weird and unexpected stuff you can do in it. I was hoping the game’s first live event would lean into that and maybe introduce a new enemy type or some other activity with a few different layers to it. What I got was a short-lived barbeque. Its rewards also point to one of the weaker parts of the game: the depth of your arsenal. While Far Cry 5 ’s weapons feel good, handle well, and there’s a lot of variety on the surface, the bench is pretty shallow within each class of guns. There are lots of different-looking 1911 handguns in the game, for instance, but none of them really handle differently or have unique stats. Some just have more expensive skins. The Flamebearer flamethrower is in the same boat. While its description reads “Adorned with stolen gold, this weapon is an intimidating display of wealth,” it doesn’t actually differ in any meaningful way from the other flamethrowers in the game. The game’s first live event would have been a good opportunity to introduce a new weapon into the game, something with a weird quirk or unique stats. Instead it feels worth skipping. The Well Done live event runs until April 10, which is more than enough time to burn every animal in Hope County to a Trump-approved crisp.","Far Cry 5 ’s first piece of post-launch content went live yesterday.

Kenya Foy,"Less than a year after his passing, a mansion that formerly belonged to renowned rock star Tom Petty is on the market. After acquiring the 11,483-square-foot estate for $2.6 million in 2015, the current owners are asking $4.995 million. Perhaps the current owners are fans of Chip and Joanna Gaines, because the place has a distinct farmhouse vibe. Accessible via a long, gated driveway, the Encino home features an atrium, a circular staircase and multiple living and entertainment areas as well as several fireplaces. A skylight-laden, driftwood beamed ceiling hovers over one particular living rooms. In addition to its 10 bathrooms, the three-story home has two master suites, which are among the home's six bedrooms. The mansion also features a windowless media room with wet bar and sunken seating area, along with a spacious kitchen and breakfast room. Outdoor amenities include a pool and waterfall. Petty's former studio area was revived as a cabana that has since been outfitted with a workout room, full kitchen with stainless steel appliances and a wine cellar that's built into the hillside. Topping off the rockstar residential vibes is the mansion's nine-car garage. The listing listing for 4626 Encino Avenue assures would-be buyers that the renovations include updated finishes that ""reflect current styles and colors-herringbone tile, Carrara marble, and exquisite fixtures."" The property sustained extensive damage the home sustained after an arsonist set fire to its wooden stairs in 1987. After a complete restoration, Petty's ex-wife received the home during the divorce but subsequently lost it in a foreclosure two years before he died. Additionally, a Ventura County lakeside property once owned by Petty is also up for sale. As Variety notes, the singer's former Lake Sherwood residence hit the market in 2017 at an asking price of $6.2 million that has since dropped to just shy of $5 million.","Less than a year after his passing, a mansion that formerly belonged to renowned rock star Tom Petty is on the market.

"USA TODAY, Joel Shannon, USA TODAY","New Zealand bans assault rifles just six days after the Christchurch shootings.
 USA TODAY
California police say they are investigating a fire at a mosque as an arson and a hate crime after graffiti that made reference to the deadly New Zealand mosque attacks was found at the scene.
The incident happened early Sunday about 30 miles north of San Diego in Escondido, police said in a release. Police say the graffiti was left by the suspected arsonist.
Seven people were in the mosque at the time, but no one was injured, police say. The fire caused minor damage to the outside of the building.
The San Diego office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the incident: ""It is disturbing enough that some sick individual would attempt to burn a house of worship to the ground, but referencing the slayings in New Zealand is beyond the pale,"" Executive Director Dustin Craun said in a written statement.
The statement says the California incident was motivated by the ""same hatred"" held by a gunman who killed 50 people in a terrorist attack on two mosques in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand.

Police believe the fire was set with an accelerant, but there are no suspects as of Tuesday, the New York Times reports. The fire, which scorched an outside wall, was put out using a fire extinguisher, the newspaper reports, citing police.
Escondido police said Sunday that Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives agents are assisting with the investigation.

"Inkoo Kang, Inkoo Kang","Bohemian Rhapsody Doesnt Ignore Freddie Mercurys Sexuality, but You May Wish It Did XXXTentacion Confesses to Domestic Violence and Also to Stabbing Nine People on Newly-Released Secret Recording Which of Todays Hits Will Be Tomorrows Classics? Introducing the New American Songbook. The Haunting of Hill House s Devastating Twist Episode Will Crush You Emotionallyand Enchant You Visually Steven Yeuns performance is an unsettling revelation in Burning, the exceptional art-house thriller that South Korea selected as its entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar this year. Best known as Glenn on TVs The Walking Dead and seen earlier this summer wooing Tessa Thompson in Sorry to Bother You, Yeun plays in his latest film an elegant arsonistand possible murderersomewhere between Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Christian Bale in American Psycho. But the movie, adapted from a short story by Haruki Murakami by Korean auteur Chang-dong Lee ( Secret Sunshine, Poetry ), also discomfits for a reason its director probably never intended: Ben is the kind of top-of-the-social-hierarchy character that the Korean American actor might never have gotten play if he hadnt returned to the country his parents left nearly three decades ago. That irony wasnt lost on Yeun. After the shoot wrapped in Seoul, where the film is set, he realized it was the first production that hadnt made him feel othered. And while the ensemble is across-the-board terrific, Yeuns performance is so spine-tinglingly good you also cant help wondering how many other would-be star-making turns Hollywood is missing out on by undervaluing actors like him. In person, Yeun is both puppy-dog earnest and relentlessly cageya manner he may have learned while gently guarding the twists on The Walking Dead. He met me in a café in Los Angeles Silver Lake neighborhood, and we had the kind of code-switching, culturally specific, thoroughly idiosyncratic conversation that I never could have imagined before #AsianAugust. It also felt like Id caught Yeun at the end of a journey of self-discovery, from a Michigan childhood spent wishing he could be white to finding new ways that enable him to feel like a human being, rather than a prop for the American white gaze. Working with Lee, one of his artistic heroes, was part of that rehumanization process. So was not worrying too much if the roles he takes on are good for Asian American representation. Inkoo Kang: What drew you to playing Ben, this cosmopolitan floater? After the shoot wrapped in Seoul, the actor realized that it was the first production that hadnt made him feel othered. Steven Yeun: The initial draw was Chang-dong Lee. I would do anything that he asked me to do. Hes incredible. After reading the script, I was like, Wow, Im really going to get to play, to feel what its like to live in this persons skin, be present in his present. I realized in hindsight that nothing I had done prior gave me that feeling. I wasnt supposed to be in this role. If youre packaging this in Korea, theyre not thinking about me. They already had someone lined up, and suddenly there was an open space, and [Lee] was like, Heres an American Korean person, and if I can help him get to a full Korean embodiment of his character, his inherent American-ness will create that dissonance that makes you feel like hes other [in Korean society]. Hes so Korean, but hes not at all, you know what I mean? People can draw their own conclusions about who Ben is. Hes meant to be enigmatic and ambiguous. But for me, the experience that I had there felt rich and full because there wasnt an otherness that I felt. Something great about your performance as Ben is that the entire time that hes talking to Jong-su, his economically struggling romantic rival, Ben uses jondaetmal [polite speech], but theres such a palpable condescension to everything that he says to Jong-su. Oh, thanks! That was something that we were cognizant of: You need to notice when he speaks jondaetmal to him and when he speaks banmal [casual speech] to him. Those are important moments, you know? We crafted those choices, and thats so fun working with [Lee] for that kind of stuff. Are you disappointed that American or international audiences wont get all of the nuances in the dialogue? No, because were talking about one layer of this story, and really the human layer is the thing that binds it all together. Do you mean the romantic triangle in the film? I mean the feeling of unrequited loneliness. The feeling that were all alone. We can try to put labels on ourselves and try to separate each other, but really, were all fucking alone and thats what it is. And its scary, and it sounds terrible, but really, its OK. Yesterday, when you were introducing the movie [at a screening], you called Chang-dong Lee a film genius. What draws you to him? He reached out to me through his films first, obviously. Peppermint Candy helped me understand why I have this han [an untranslatable strain of sorrow that makes up a pillar of Korean national identity] in my body that I cant explain. I couldnt explain how me being a 5-year-old immigrant in America was filled with so much rage. It wasnt just the fear of my environment, or being an Asian kid in America. That probably stoked it a little bit, but I didnt experience war, I didnt experience trauma. You dont know where it comes from, but then you watch [the movie] and you go, Oh my God, theres a whole level of Korean experience that Im missing out on. There was this deeper level that I couldnt access, and that film helped me get there. Have you heard of the idea of inherited trauma? Uh-huh. I often wonder how much of that courses through all Korean peoples blood. The idea is Christian, too: the sins of the father getting passed down. And now we have a way to tangibly, physically explain that: traumatic DNA passing down through our bodies. I like to joke that Korean cinema, which is known in part for its intensity of emotion, is 5,000 years of suffering condensed into an art form. Yeah, thats real. Youve worked with heavyweights in the Korean film world: Joon-ho Bong on Okja and Chang-dong Lee on Burning. Theyve given you meaty roles, as well as the opportunity to work with art-house auteurs. What do you make of the fact that these opportunities seem to be primarily coming from the Korean side, rather than the American side? Sometimes its tough. Ill come back from Burning, and Ill be like, Will I ever get this experience again? Will I ever feel this free in a character? Will I ever feel like theyre looking to get my best performance? Down to the lighting, the makeup, the boundarylessness that they project on me? I feel like theres a mold here in America, that even in my daily walking around I feel subjected to. Someones projecting, like, This is how youre supposed to fit in this world. Its this generic Asian man mold that pervades. Going forward, how much does thinking about representing Asian America play a role in you weighing your projects? I think representation is key and paramount. But its like all social mandates or ideasthey have to stem from an actual willingness and desire to do it. I want to be attracted to a project as a human being. Not someone telling me, You have to do it. And my face is my face. That will check the box of representation. Now, if we want to get supercerebral and break it down, Should I do this or not? you get into arguments like, Does this character put me in a space where Im just doing a thing that the American white gaze is asking me to do? Those are the things that Im trying actively to avoid. What do you feel like that gaze wants you to do? I wont speak for other Asian American actors, because I dont know what theyre being offered. But for me, its like: nice guy, dependable, supportive, benign. Beige. And as a Korean man, I am not beige. And I felt that when I was over there [shooting Burning ]. Did you feel beige when you were playing Glenn on The Walking Dead ? Yeah, I felt beige with Glenn. That was a little bit of the frustration that I could never explain to the wider society, to fans of the show. Am I incredibly grateful, and did I have a wonderful time on that show? Yeah! I wouldnt take that experience back at all. I made lifelong friendships. I got to learn so much. But I will say that I felt cramped. I felt like there wasnt space for me to fully spread all of who I was, and that was partly due to me, too, because when I started, all I was trying to do was to work within the parameters that they were giving me. And then, over time, I just outgrew it. Thats why it was beige. Because he was meant to be the heart of that show. When you look back, you go, Thats great, everyone wants to be represented that way. Why wouldnt you want to be a perfect being? But I dont wanna [play] perfect, because were not perfect. And thats a thing that I wasnt able to feel for a while, because I was holding up this ideal that was way bigger than me, way larger than any single human can possibly do. I became less and less interested in doing that. Do you think of yourself as a heartthrob? Ay-yi-yi. Im at this interesting point of not rejecting it, because I want to be representative of the idea that anyone can be that and feel that. For that reason, I dont want to reject it. But definitely I want to reject it. Why? Self-hatred. Maybe when I was young, I wanted that. I was like, Why not me, why cant an Asian man be this? Then you try to find that through systems that arent native to you. Youre like, I know what it means to be hot. It means you work out. It means you drink a ton of milk, so you get huge. It means youre mean to people. Toxic masculinity. Then you realize its so stupid. Just be comfortable with yourself. Do you get mistaken for other Asian actors in the states? No. Thats amazing. Yeah, but also sad. Because there arent other Asian American actors to be confused with? Its a weird double edge. Its like, cool, Im not compared to anybody, but is it because theres no other person that youre fixating in your head about? John [Cho] is here. [LiterallyCho happened to be at the café where this interview took place.] Maybe Ive been mistaken for him one time. You know the actor Daniel Henney, right? Yeah. Like you, hes from Michigan. It seems like he decided pretty early in his career to go to Korea because as a half-Korean guy, hes going to have a lot less discrimination in Korea than in the U.S. as an actor and model. Did a similar journey ever occur to you? No, I rejected that journey. Maybe it was prideful to be like, Im going to make it here, its all about here. I remember saying that, when people were like, Are you going to go to Korea? So people asked you if you were? Yeah, they were like, You should go to Korea. Im like, No, Im going to do it here. What was your reasoning? [Koreans] think that the easiest avenue to succeed [for Korean Americans in show business] is going to be Korea. Thats not true. There are so many people trying to make it out there. Also, Im an American person. I feel connected here. Am I Korean? Yes. Do I speak Korean? Yes. Is that my culture? Yes. But I am here. I want to identify as here. As I was coming here, I had to explain to my mom what I was doing. She had no idea who you were. But when I explained that I was going to interview a Korean American actor, she went and got the car washed for me, even though you are not going to see this car. That is awesome. She wanted to see a photo of you, so I pulled it up on her phone. She was like, Oh, tell him that hes very handsome and he has a good insang [impression or demeanor]. I thought, This is the most Korean-mom thing Ive ever heard in my life. Thats so funny. Your mom is hilariously sweet. I hear my mom when you just said that. How old were you when you moved to L.A.? I was 25. L.A. has this amazing Koreatown and the most Korean Americans anywhere in the states. At the same time, the industry that you wanted to break into when you arrived is extremely white. What were your impressions of L.A. when you first got here, and has your relationship to the city changed in any significant way? Koreatown at first became a safe haven for me where you can go to not feel othered. I wasnt cognizant of [being othered then]. I was aware of me being an Asian actor, but I was not thinking about anything but just working within the system, whatever that meant. I wouldnt take roles that would be bad as an Asian person, but I was looking to just get work. So you do that on the daily and then you come back, and for some reason you always just keep gravitating toward K-Town. Its comfortable. Then you start to let it go for a bit. Because you go, Oh, I dont need the security blanket of this place. And then you find it again, where now youre approaching K-Town not from a place of fear. Rather, now youre just going there to go eat some bomb food and celebrate your culture. Thats the confidence that you build over time, or you hope to.

Al Jazeera,"An arsonist convicted of burning down a mosque in the United States last year has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison for a crime prosecutors said was motivated by hate. Marq Perez, 26, was convicted of hate crime and felony arson in July for setting fire to the Victoria Islamic Centre in Texas on January 28, 2017. At the sentencing, senior US district judge John Rainey said hate crimes were ""a cancer to our society"" and ""this conduct would not be tolerated in our society,"" the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said. During a week long trial in a federal court in Texas, prosecutors called the crime ""a simple, straightforward case of hate"". The jury also found that Perez possessed an unregistered destructive device for a separate but related incident that occurred on January 15, 2017. One person, who was with Perez on the night of the fire, said he was excited and ""jumping up and down like a little kid"" while watching the mosque burn, the New York Times reported. Prosecutors said Perez broke into the mosque a week before the fire, the man later placed papers inside the building and set them on fire with a lighter, a witness said, according to prosecutors. ""Everyone in this country has the right to worship freely without fear of violence,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore. ""This defendant terrorised the Muslim community in Victoria, and the Department partnered with federal, state, and local agencies to ensure that the person responsible for this heinous hate crime would be found and prosecuted,"" he added. The crime was seen by the Islamic rights groups as part of a growing wave of bigotry towards the Muslims int the US. The court said that the most important factor in determining this punishment was stating that ""this conduct would not be tolerated in our society."" Rainey also noted that Perez wanted to send a message to the Muslim community, but the court was also sending a message to Perez and others like him, Texas News reported. Marq Vincent Perez was just sentenced to over 24 years in prison for his attack on the Victoria Islamic Center. The #FBI investigated the hate crime aspect of Perez's activities and proudly partnered with @ATFHou @VictoriaPDtx @TxDPS to bring this case to a successful conclusion. FBI Houston (@FBIHouston) October 17, 2018 The mosque was rebuilt after a flood of donations came in to the restore the facility. In July, 2017 the Victoria Islamic Centre posted a photograph on Facebook of the new building, ""Almost there!"" the post said. ""Rebuilding with love."" When Perez learned the Victoria Muslim community had raised money to rebuild the mosque, he told a witness he would burn the mosque down again if it was rebuilt, the Department of Justice said. Mark Di Carlo, Perez's defence attorney, says his client is ""disappointed in his lengthy sentence"" and will appeal his conviction. Incidents of hate crimes in the US went up to 6,121 during 2016, seeing an increase of 4.6 percent compared to the previous year, according to data released by the FBI. The crimes committed, particularly against African-Americans, Jews and Muslims, rose with a spike of 10 percent from 2014 to 2015.","Marq Perez had set fire to Victoria Islamic Centre, a crime seen as part of a wave of bigotry towards Muslims in US.",2018-10-18T07:57:32Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Arsonist gets 24 years in jail for burning Texas mosque,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/arsonist-24-years-jail-burning-texas-mosque-181018060732191.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/10/18/f2884d5028284a57bb061421edb6ec30_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,arsonist,1
http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork,"CHICAGO (CBSNewYork) – Newly released surveillance video shows a man igniting some paint thinner on board a Chicago subway train, sparking a wall of flames. It happened on January 18 on Chicago’s North Side. Police identified the alleged arsonist as 28-year-old David Ferguson. Witness Mia Edwards was on the train moments before police came on board to get Ferguson under control. “Came down to the next stop, and then they was like, ‘everybody got to get off the train,” she said. Police said Ferguson threatened to light himself on fire using the can of paint thinner. Surveillance video shows one officer trying to kick the can away. Then, as the officers struggle to take Ferguson into custody, the liquid is ignited. Right as the officers rush off the subway car with Ferguson, the flames erupt. “Man, the smell was real strong,” Edwards said. At one point, one of the officers’ shoes caught on fire, and another officer was burned. The injured officer was taken to a hospital and treated for his burns. Ferguson was arrested and charged with aggravated arson and aggravated battery to a peace officer and transit employee.

Paul Elias / AP,"(SAN FRANCISCO) — Thousands were forced to flee their homes Monday as major wildfires encroached on a charred area of Northern California still recovering from severe blazes in recent years, sparking concern the state may be in for another destructive series of wildfires this summer. Severe drought has already forced officials in several western states to close national parks as precautions against wildfires and issue warnings throughout the region to prepare for the worst. In California, officials said unusually hot weather, high winds and highly flammable vegetation turned brittle by drought helped fuel the fires that began over the weekend, the same conditions that led to the state’s deadliest and most destructive fire year in 2017. Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday declared a state of emergency in Lake County, where the biggest fire was raging about 120 miles (190 kilometers) north of San Francisco, a rural region particularly hard-hit by fires in recent years. The declaration will enable officials to receive more state resources to fight the fire and for recovery. Jim Steele, an elected supervisor, said the county is impoverished and its fire-fighting equipment antiquated. He also said the county has just a few roads into and out of the region, which can hinder response time. Steele said the area has also been susceptible to fire for many decades because dense brush and trees in the sparsely populated area, but the severity of the latest blazes is unexpected. “What’s happened with the more warming climate is we get low humidity and higher winds and then when we get a fire that’s worse than it’s been in those 50 years,” Steele said. The fire that broke out Saturday evening has forced 3,000 residents from their homes and destroyed at least 22 buildings. It is the latest devastating blaze to rip through the isolated and impoverished county of just 65,000 people in the last few years. In 2015, a series of fires destroyed 2,000 buildings and killed four people. The following year, an arsonist started a fire that wiped out 300 buildings. Last year, the county was among those ravaged by a string of fires that ripped through Northern California wine country. “I think we’re all just so traumatized and overwhelmed with all these fires year after year, this whole community is at a breaking point,” said Terri Gonsalves, 55, who evacuated her home around midnight Sunday. She put four goats into her truck after she looked out her back window and saw a big hill aflame. She is staying with her daughter in nearby Middletown, a small city where dozens of homes were destroyed in 2015. “When this stuff happens, we rally around each other.” Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said more than 230 firefighters were battling the Lake County fire in a rugged area that made it difficult to get equipment close the blaze. A forestry scientist says it’s difficult to forecast how severe California’s wildfires will be this year, but said the drought-dried vegetation throughout the state is a bad omen. “You have a lot of grass and its dry and that’s cause for concern,” said Keith Gilless, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley’s department of environmental science. Authorities on Monday afternoon lifted evacuation orders in Tehama County, where two wildfires were burning. Multiple homes and businesses in the city of Red Bluff were destroyed. A Red Bluff police officer helping residents evacuate lost his home, authorities said. Red Bluff Police Lt. Matt Hansen said people had donated about $10,000 in cash along with furniture and clothing to the family as they search for a rental home. Residents also fled a wildfire in Shasta County. No cause has been determined for any of the fires. Last year, California’s costliest fires killed 44 people and tore through the state’s wine country in October, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage. While the weekend’s blazes were the first major ones of the season to hit California, others have raged throughout the west for weeks. Earlier this month, a Colorado wildfire forced residents of more than 2,000 homes to evacuate. The last evacuees returned home last week. The fire north of Durango was in the Four Corners Region where Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah meet — the epicenter of a large U.S. Southwest swath of exceptional drought, the worst category of drought. Moderate to extreme drought conditions affect those four states plus parts of Nevada, California, Oregon, Oklahoma and Texas, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. __ Associated Press writers Lorin Eleni Gill and Janie Har contributed to this story from San Francisco.","The fire has forced 3,000 residents from their homes and destroyed 22 buildings",2018-06-26T02:02:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",California Governor Declares State of Emergency as Wildfires Force Thousands to Flee,http://time.com/5321840/california-wildfires-state-of-emergency/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/ap18176135007776.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,arsonist,1
Hoai-Tran Bui,"Sequel mania is coming even to modestly received 1991 blockbusters whose biggest claim to fame is getting a sweaty, soot-covered Kurt Russell to don a firefighter suit. That’s right, the Backdraft sequel you’ve been eagerly waiting for is on its way. Backdraft 2 is now officially in the works at Universal with a director attached and co-star William Baldwin set to return. Universal has tapped Spanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego, best known for the 2011 science-fiction thriller Apollo 18, to helm Backdraft 2, according to MovieHole. The film is tentatively titled Backdraft II and will reportedly follow the grown son of Kurt Russell’s character, an investigator with the Chicago F.D. who still holds his uncle (Baldwin) responsible for the death of his father. The villains this time around are a group of agents who are attempting to sneak a missile out of the country, using a series of deadly fires as a distraction. Production is set to begin in Romania and Toronto next month. It sounds like the plot of the sequel — which will take place a daunting 27 years after the original — is formed in the vein of the “legasequel,” a relatively modern creation. Creed, Star Wars, even Pacific Rim follow a next-generation character who has to live up the legacy of the heroes before them — those heroes often being their own father. The original 1991 film boasted a star-studded ensemble, including Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and was an early hit for director Ron Howard. However, the only familiar face confirmed to return for the sequel is Baldwin. The first Backdraft followed a team of firefighters in Chicago on the tail of a serial arsonist. Here’s the synopsis to refresh your memory: Chicago firefighting brothers Stephen (Kurt Russell) and Brian (William Baldwin) have been rivals since childhood. Brian, struggling to prove himself, transfers to the arson unit. There he aids Don (Robert De Niro) in his investigation into a spate of fires involving oxygen-induced infernos called b ackdrafts. But when a conspiracy implicating a crooked politician and an arsonist leads Brian back to Stephen, he is forced to overcome his brotherly competitiveness in order to crack the case. The movie received mixed critical reviews, but had a fairly successful box office run, apparently becoming the highest-grossing movie about firefighters until I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry took that crown in 2007 (seriously). It also received lavish praise for its state-of-the-art fire effects. There’s no news yet on when Backdraft II is set to be released.

JOSH LEDERMAN and MATTHEW LEE,"President Donald Trump’s prospects for brokering the Mideast peace “deal of the century” sank further Monday as the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem opened amid bloodshed in Gaza. The day fueled global concern that U.S. policies are tipping the broader Middle East into deeper, intractable conflict. At the same time, Trump is winning international support for his efforts to strike a deal with nuclear-armed North Korea. But his contentious decisions in the Middle East are roiling a region where U.S. administrations have traditionally sought perhaps their biggest diplomatic prize: an elusive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The embassy move, which Trump hailed a “great day” for Israel even as dozens of Palestinians were killed in Gaza, damaged Washington’s stature as a mediator between those parties. And it’s but the latest in a series of U.S. decisions that may have set off a domino effect of unpredictable consequences. “Traditionally we’ve tried to play a role of fireman in the Middle East. Now we’re playing the role of arsonist,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former State Department and Pentagon official who runs the Mideast program at the Center for a New American Security. Trump’s withdrawal last week from the Iran nuclear deal, against the protestations of European allies, appears to have emboldened both Israel and Iran to move more forcefully toward full-on confrontation. In Syria, Trump’s eagerness to pull out U.S. troops as soon as the Islamic State group is defeated has forced a reckoning by Iran’s enemies about the possibility that Tehran will fill the void. Dan Shapiro, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said Washington is not responsible for the fact that Iran acts as “the major source of tension and instability in the region.” But he said the question is whether Trump’s administration, having pulled out of the nuclear deal, has a strategy to deal with Iran in its absence. Shapiro, who is now at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel, said that while some U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia have celebrated the pullout, the reaction “will soon be followed by some degree of concern about whether the administration is sufficiently focused, prepared, staffed and able to devote the necessary attention when it’s also managing another major foreign policy challenge in North Korea at the same time.” U.S. officials insist the administration remains committed to restarting the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In a speech at the embassy opening, Trump’s son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, said the U.S. “is prepared to support a peace agreement in every way we can.” Left unsaid was the fact that Kushner’s team has had to shelve Trump’s long-awaited peace plan indefinitely amid the Palestinian uproar over the embassy move, several U.S. officials have said. Since Trump in December recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and announced the embassy would move, the Palestinians have effectively cut off all ties with the White House, a diplomatic chill that augurs poorly for the possibility that Trump can now introduce a plan the Palestinians would accept or deem fair. “We’re going through a rough-patch,” U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said Monday on Fox News. “It’ll last as long as it lasts. I can’t predict, but we will be back in a position I’m confident where we’ll be discussing peace.” White House spokesman Raj Shah said the peace plan will be released “at the appropriate time.” That time, by all accounts, is not now. Responding to the embassy opening, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat dismissed Washington as “no longer a partner and a broker.” “We will not sit with them,” Erekat said. “They have become part of the problem not part of the solution, a big part of the problem. Trump’s administration is the biggest problem.” The White House response to the deaths of dozens of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli troops on Monday during mass protests on the Israel-Gaza border won’t help. The administration called the deaths “tragic” but said they were the fault of Hamas, which controls Gaza and has fomented the protests. It voiced strong support for Israel’s right to self-defense. The renewed Gaza violence has created the unsettling but real possibility that Israel — far from enjoying a new era of peace with its neighbors — could soon find itself fighting wars on two fronts: with the Hamas militants who run the coastal Gaza Strip, and with Iranian troops and Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Already, fallout from the embassy opening has spread far beyond Jerusalem, illustrating how in the delicate Mideast, one point of conflict often begets another. Jordan’s King Abdullah II took to Twitter to say the embassy move would have “dangerous implications” for security and “provoke Muslims and Christians.” Thousands gathered in Turkey to protest the move. Several nations said they were pulling their ambassadors from Israel to protest the deaths in Gaza. And Erekat announced Monday that Palestinian leadership in the West Bank had decided to file a war crimes complaint against Israel with the International Criminal Court. “The U.S. has selected one of the most sensitive, one of the most difficult issues, to step in and put forward a position that it knows will be significantly damaging to its efforts,” said Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian pollster and head of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. He said Trump proceeded anyway “because of internal pressures and right-wing tendencies and evangelicals and others.” “I cannot see the U.S. being an honest broker, whatsoever, as far as the Palestinian public is concerned,” he added.",It's the latest U.S. decision that may set off a domino effect of unpredictable consequences,2018-05-14T22:57:11Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Jerusalem Embassy, Gaza Bloodshed Puts Trump’s Mideast Promise at Risk",http://time.com/5277276/jerusalem-embassy-gaza-mideast-peace-trump/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-958402774.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,arsonist,1
By Curt Yeomans curt.yeomans@gwinnettdailypost.com,"Gwinnett County fire officials are looking for an arsonist accused of starting a fire that destroyed two tractor trailers at a business in unincorporated Lawrenceville last month. The fire happened shortly before 3 a.m. on Nov. 25 at Levantina, which is located at 2499 Newpoint Place Parkway. Firefighter Driver Engineer Donald Strother said someone called 9-1-1 at 2:59 a.m. after hearing an explosion and seeing a large amount of smoke. Another person who was passing by the business also called 9-1-1 to report the fire. Strother said no suspects have been identified but investigators have obtained video of a vehicle believed to have been driven by the person who started the fire. The video shows what they believe to be a red dodge pickup truck with a silver hood and the drivers side headlight out, Strother said. The pickup truck also has a silver driver side front quarter panel and silver gas cap cover. Footage shows the suspect vehicle leaving the area immediately after the fire being set. Anyone who has information about the fire is asked to call Gwinnett fire investigators at 678-518-4890 or the Georgia Arson Control Hotline at 1-800-282-5804. There is a reward of up to $10,000 offered by Georgia Arson Control Inc. for information that results in an arrest and conviction of the arsonist. They should reference Arson Case No. 11-25-18.

R. Douglas Fields Ph.D.,"The inferno of tragic fires in California has destroyed thousands of homes, incinerated hundreds of thousands of acres, and killed many people this year. In the latest, the entire town of Paradise was reduced to smoldering ash. Highlighting the vulnerability of anyone and anything to the destructive power of wildfire, among the homes lost in this weeks California fires include those of celebrities Miley Cyrus, Neil Young, and Gerard Butler. The current blazes are still raging out of control, and it is too soon to know the causes and full extent of the destruction, but some of these California fires were ignited intentionally. A 51-year old man has been charged with starting the Southern California Holy Fire. A 32-year old man has been linked to 5 California fires. What sort of person is compelled by pyromania to kill, terrorize, destroy lives and property, and devastate the beauty of nature with fire? Although President Trump has pointed fingers of blame at California for its environmental policies as the root cause of these infernos, the problem is hardly unique to that state. Between April 2016 and March 2017, there were 76,106 fires in England that were set deliberately, according to Tyler et al., resulting in 1,027 casualties and 47 deaths. The financial losses are staggering1.7 billion British pounds. The same study finds that in the United States there are an estimated 261,330 deliberately set fires reported every year, costing approximately 1 billion in property damage and 440 deaths. Arson can be used as a weapon of revenge or motivated by some other conniving, covert, destructive aim, but fire-setting is also an irresistible compulsion for some, recognized as a form of mental illness. More research is needed, but typically, fire-setting is viewed not as a distinct disorder, but as a behavior that stems from another deep-seated pathology. Research shows that fire-setters are significantly more likely to have been registered with psychiatric services compared with other criminal offenders, and four times more likely compared with community controls. Between 10 percent to 50 percent of patients who are admitted to medium-security forensic mental health services have a record of deliberate fire-setting. Fire-setting in adolescence and early adulthood predicts schizophrenia in later life. Fire-setting behavior is associated with animal cruelty in juveniles ; the other statistically significant risk factors being male gender, and the victim of sexual abuse. Arsonists differ from typical violent offenders in being more socially isolated and lacking coping skills, and the prevalence of suicide is significantly higher than controls. Females are reported to commit nearly one-third of deliberately set fires, but less is known about the psychopathological and criminal characteristics of female fire-setters. Female fire-setters in a recent study were more often diagnosed with depression, substance abuse, and personality disorder than male arsonists. Fire-setters appear to be a discrete group of criminal offenders with a distinguishing constellation of psychological characteristics. This suggests the necessity of specialized treatment to target these individuals in prison and before they become offenders. Greater research is needed to guide treatment effectively, but a small study of 63 male and female patients with a history of deliberate fire-setting, published by Tyler and colleagues in 2018, has tracked the efficacy of intervention programs for the mentally disordered offenders. The results suggest that the treatments significantly reduced the compulsion to start fires, but far more research is necessary to extend and confirm this small-scale study. Views toward arsonists have changed over time, according to a 2018 review of pyromania in Western Europe between the years of 1800-1950, by Lydia Dalhuisen, a criminologist at Ultrecht University. The data show the pendulum swinging back and forth from being viewed as a crime to being regarded as a mental illness. If viewed as an illness, punishing arsonists for a form of insanity becomes an ethical dilemma, but there is no doubt that more needs to be done to reduce the horrific destruction by fire that society is suffering. While current debate centers on the influence of climate change on the raging number and intensity of wildfires, less attention is given to understanding the mind of the person who would light the match. Society faces daunting challenges of grappling with altering the global climate, but in looking for ways to prevent the devastating destruction of fires sweeping California and elsewhere, increased support for psychological research and greater mental health services would seem to provide an effective and easily attainable way to fight this inferno.",Increased support for psychological research on arson and greater mental health services are needed.,2018-11-12T16:27:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Psychologytoday.com'}",Inside the Mind of an Arsonist,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-brain/201811/inside-the-mind-arsonist,https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2018-11/arsonlowres.jpg?itok=DoXqaOBd,,Psychologytoday.com,arsonist,1
"USA TODAY, Deirdre Shesgreen, USA TODAY","President Donald Trump said he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""fell in love"" because of Kim's ""beautiful letters.""
 USA TODAY
WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump faced immediate blowback on Friday for his assertion that his predecessor in the Oval Office, Barack Obama, was on the brink of starting ""a big war"" with North Korea. 
Trump made the claim during a rambling news conference on Friday in which he touted his own success in negotiations with North Korea.
Trump said that Obama, during a 2016 meeting in the White House just after Trump won the presidential election, said the former president told him North Korea's nuclear weapons program presented the greatest threat to the United States.
""He told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea,"" Trump recounted.
""It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the Obama administration was considering anything like that,"" said Michael Fuchs, who served as Obama's deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. He said Trump was simply ""lying"" about that exchange. 
""We were not on the brink of war with North Korea in 2016,"" Ben Rhodes, a former national security adviser to Obama, tweeted on Friday in response to Trump's claim. He suggested that Trump didn't understand Obama's 2016 description of the threat North Korea posed.  
We were not on the brink of war with North Korea in 2016. Highlighting the longstanding and widely known threat of North Koreas nuclear program is very different from saying youre about to start a big war.
— Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) February 15, 2019
Obama's former CIA director, John Brennan, also sharply refuted Trump's claim.
While he was not in the room during that meeting, Brennan told NBC News, ""President Obama was never on the verge of starting any war with North Korea, large or small."" He said Obama viewed North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons with ""deep concern and he constantly pressed his national security team to present options to reduce the threat from North Korea."" 
President Donald Trump declares a ""national emergency"" to free up funds for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 15, 2019.
 (Photo11: ERIK S. LESSER, EPA-EFE)
Experts say any military strike against North Korea would almost certainly result in massive loss of life in South Korea and is far too risky to contemplate. Fuchs said such a move would not only result in ""mass casualties"" for the South Koreans, but it could ""easily spiral"" into a greater regional conflict involving nuclear weapons. 
""The list of disasters that could be created by a conflict with North Korea are ... too unthinkable to consider,"" he said.
Fuchs and other experts argue that it was Trump who ratcheted up the danger of a military confrontation with North Korea when he took office in 2017, threatening Kim Jong Un's regime with ""fire and fury,"" among other provocative statements and actions.  Now, critics said, Trump is trying to claim credit for progress in negotiations aimed at pressing Kim's regime to relinquish his nuclear arsenal. 
""This is again the president, when it comes to North Korea, attempting to play the role of both arsonist and firefighter acting like there was some big emergency that he saved everyone from,"" Fuchs told USA TODAY.

"Allie Conti, Lauren Messman","A mom in Katy, Texas, was driving into a local car wash on July 10 when she heard a ""boom"" and felt a sudden pain in her arm. When she parked, she realized she'd been shot by a bullet that ended up lodged just inches from her heart. Now authorities say that the shooting was just one of many that 29-year-old Nicholas D'Agostino committed because of his ""very dim view"" of women, Buzzfeed News reports. According to ABC 13, D'Agostino, who's admitted to being involved in five different road rage incidents and shot at six female drivers, was recently arrested twice for two similar shootings. He was apprehended last month on suspicion of the July shooting, then again on Thursday for allegedly shooting another female driver in the arm near the same car wash back in March. In both cases, authorities say D'Agostino said he shot at the women out of self-defense after they swerved into his lane. ""It was vehicular manslaughter,"" D'Agostino told ABC 13 of the July shooting. ""It's almost happened to me before. But cops argue that D'Agostino's alleged motive was tied to his view of women, and that he was ""randomly"" targeting female drivers. In court documents, Harris County Sheriff's Detective Dennis Palmer described social media posts in which the alleged shooter ""rants and rambles on about female motorists and how incompetent they are and that their sole purpose is to give birth to male children."" His Instagram page, which has since been removed, apparently showed a picture of a.45 millimeter weapon—the gun that is thought to have been used in the shootings—as well as a green SUV similar to the vehicle at least one victim noticed at the crime scene. His attorney told BuzzFeed News that there's ""absolutely no evidence"" his client ""hates women,"" but that he does suffer from mental health issues. ""There are a lot of misassumptions being made,"" Kenneth Mingledorff said. ""His family and I are very, very sorry for the pain and suffering that anyone might have experienced here and we want to make sure he gets whatever treatment he needs,"" he added. In the Facebook posts, which have since been taken down, some of D'Agostino's rants seem so nonsensical that it's not clear whether or not he was obviously targeting women. For example, one post that Katy Magazine published before the profile was taken down read, ""No, school shooters from scotland don't get to menstruate at guns. No, Brilliant German Women are not strong."" The published posts certainly don't echo the same kind of misogynistic rhetoric that consumed self-described involuntarily celibates, or incels, like the 2014 Isla Vista shooter or the man behind the Toronto van attack. Still, they serve as another example of how a person's bizarre social media activity can portend criminality. For instance, the alleged Holy Fire arsonist clearly displayed signs of mental illness on Facebook, where he often posted about conspiracy theories, including ones that had to do with fire. For his part, D'Agostino's lawyer tried to argue that social media posts can't be used as evidence in court, which is not true. As New York State Supreme Court judge Judge Michael Corriero explained to Business Insider last year, social media posts are part of the public domain and can be shown to a jury as long as they're traceable to a defendant. Motive aside, D'Agostino has been charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on $250,000 bond.

"KING-TV, Seattle, Brian Price and Drew Mikkelsen, KING-TV, Seattle","The Seattle division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ruled a fire at a Jehovah's Witness center in Lacey, Wash., was arson. It's the fifth fire to strike a Jehovah's Witness hall in Washington state this year. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) LACEY, Wash. A fire that ripped through a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall in Lacey Friday morning was ruled an arson. The Seattle division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives announced their conclusion Saturday, saying they were investigating the fire with the Thurston County Sheriff's Office. Video shared with KING 5 showed the roof collapse, destroying the structure. ""It's devastating for the whole congregation,"" said Dan Woollett, one of the ministers who helped build the hall in 1976. The Thurston County Sheriff's Office called the fire suspicious. A $36,000 reward is being offered for information. The fire started around 3:30 a.m. at the Kingdom Hall in the 6500 block of 6th Avenue SE, according to the sheriff's office. Fire officials say they worked with this specific church in Lacey in recent months to improve security, given the recent attacks. KING 5 spoke with some church congregants who say there was an elevated level of fear among churchgoers as the attacks on Kingdom Halls continued. ""It does make you sad,"" said Woollett, ""but it's just a building."" He said if it turns out that their hall was another victim of an attack, that won't keep them from practicing their religion. ""No matter who we are, no matter what our religious persuasion is, we have to cope with the problems we face,"" said Woollett. The incident is the latest in a string of attacks at Jehovahs Witness Kingdom Halls in Thurston County. An arsonist hit two Kingdom Halls on March 19 one in Tumwater and the other in Olympia. Another fire scorched the Olympia Kingdom Hall in July and a fourth in August at the Yelm Kingdom Hall. In May, a suspect shot about 35 rifle rounds at the Yelm Kingdom Hall, causing over $10,000 in damage. This is the same Kingdom Hall where the fire took place Wednesday. Thurston County Sheriff John Snaza said his office will do whatever it can to help federal investigators hold someone responsible for the attacks over the year. ""It makes you feel really ill,"" said Snaza. ""How frustrating is it that people who find a solemn place of worship, and now it's being destroyed?""

Michael Dempsey,"President Vladimir Putin’s re-election on Sunday to a fourth six-year term comes amid a feeling both in the West and in Moscow that he is ascendant as a global leader and that Russia has reemerged as a global superpower. However, if one scratches beneath the surface of these assertions, it’s clear that Putin faces a growing number of complex challenges that are likely to deepen in the coming months and gradually erode his political momentum. Here are a few that will be the most difficult for him to overcome. In Syria, as I wrote last year, Russia is increasingly stuck on both the military and diplomatic fronts. On the battlefield, Putin has repeatedly boasted that Russia’s military goals in Syria have been accomplished -- the defeat of extremist groups threatening the regime of Bashar al-Assad -- and that he soon plans to draw down Russian military forces. However, given the chaotic situation on the ground -- the Assad regime still controls only about one-third of the country -- that seems unlikely anytime soon. The cost of Moscow’s presence in Syria, meanwhile, continues to grow. In the past few weeks, the Russians have suffered the crash of a military transport with several senior officers on board, the downing of a Russian fighter jet by anti-government forces, a clash involving American-backed forces and Russian mercenaries that produced dozens of Russian casualties, and an attack by insurgents using drones on two of its bases. The latter reportedly damaged several Russian aircraft, and is likely to be repeated in the coming months. There are also, despite recent regime advances, still thousands of Islamic State and al Qaeda-affiliated extremists operating in Syria, as well as many thousand embittered and heavily armed opponents of the Assad regime, who will never accept his legitimacy. A question: Is it likely that Assad’s political opponents will embrace a spirit of political reconciliation in the wake of the regime’s brutal conduct in the ongoing Eastern Ghouta campaign? On the diplomatic front, meanwhile, Putin had hoped his 2015 military intervention would pave the way for Moscow to play a lead role in negotiating a final resolution to the civil war -- one that would bolster Russia’s diplomatic influence regionally and secure its defense and commercial interests in Syria in the post-conflict reconstruction phase. Instead, it’s crystal clear, and has been for some time, that Assad has no intention of negotiating his departure from office, that the opposition will never trust him, and that countries such as Turkey and Iran have their own distinct visions for Syria’s future, and their roles in it. Finally, there is no chance that the U.S. and the West will provide major reconstruction aid to Syria as long as Assad is in power. This is especially problematic for Assad (and Putin) given that America’s Kurdish-backed allies now control most of the critical oilfields in Eastern Syria. Therefore, it’s a safe bet that Assad is unlikely to have sufficient money to begin rebuilding Syria’s badly damaged infrastructure in the near future, even though this is critical to ensuring his long-term political viability. So, while Russia had hoped by this point in the conflict to present a bill to Assad for services rendered, it may instead be presented with a tab for money owed. Nearly three years on from Russia’s military intervention, then, Putin is discovering that playing both fireman and arsonist in Syria is a difficult needle to thread. If Syria is a mess, how about the situation in Eastern Ukraine? For Putin, that’s not looking good either. Despite periodic spikes in fighting over the past few months, the front lines (as well as the negotiations for a political settlement) have been largely static. So, even if Putin (at least for now) has succeeded in preventing Kiev from pursuing closer integration with the West, the cost is steep and growing steeper by the month. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine is continuing to prompt punishing economic sanctions from the U.S. and its European allies with no relief in sight. This at a time when Russia’s economic growth is already anemic (the World Bank forecasts GDP growth of below 2 percent through 2019) and with 20 million or so Russians already living below the official poverty rate of $180 per month. Even more ominous, the loss of access to U.S. and Western technology and investment over such an extended period is going to erode Russia’s long-term economic competitiveness. It’s also worth noting that Russia’s intervention is steadily undermining traditionally high public sentiments toward Russia in Ukraine. According to recent polling, more than 60 percent of young Ukrainians now believe that Moscow is responsible for the escalation of the conflict, while only five percent blame Kiev. In short, Putin is steadily turning the next generation of Ukrainians against Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S. has finally announced plans to provide Kiev with so-called lethal defensive aid including more than 200 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launch units in the coming weeks. This equipment will certainly help Ukrainian units counter the old-model tanks that Moscow has provided to the separatists in recent years. As in Syria, then, Russia is finding that intervening in the Ukraine conflict was far easier than extricating itself. In the run-up to the election, Putin trumpeted Russia’s resurgence under his leadership, skillfully portrayed Russia as a victim even as it acted aggressively abroad, spoke publicly (and menacingly) of Russia’s newfound military prowess, and engaged in a series of brazen acts, most notably the reported nerve agent attack against two Russians residing in England. If he intends to govern in his next term according to this script, the U.S. and its allies will have little choice but to push back hard. Some of the options that policymakers might consider include: new and creative ways to raise the military cost to Russia for its foreign interventions; sweeping policies to further curb Russia’s access to advanced technology; measures to eliminate the ability of Putin’s cronies to hide money abroad; active cyber operations against Russian entities involved in hacking; and aggressive public messaging efforts to highlight Putin’s anti-democratic actions and expose the sources of his vast personal wealth, especially to audiences inside Russia. It seems clear to me -- I'm currently on a government-funded fellowship and these opinions are solely mine -- all this adds up to a daunting set of challenges Putin faces in the coming years. And it’s certain that provoking a more intense and direct confrontation with the West is not going to make his job any easier.

Tim Stone,"Outnumbered and facing fearsome Allied siege engines like the Churchill AVRE and Wasp flamethrower, Caent’s dwindling band of German defenders is beginning to give ground. Or perhaps “relinquish ground” would be more accurate. The behaviour of our forces during the last couple of turns has been anything but acquiescent. (Overlordy is an open-to-all game of Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord in which German forces are orchestrated by commenters while British units are computer controlled. For a scenario outline and summaries of earlier turns, click here ). As British infantry bundle through the backdoor of the maison at d21, German infantry – still reeling from the effects of an AVRE attack – flee through the front door. The retreating rifle squad is one of three units heading towards f23 in the early stages of Turn 17. At T+20, caressing the sands near the western beach exit with its crisp cruciform shadow, the fleetest of this trio, an RAF Mustang, commences a blink-and-you’d-miss-it South-North bomb run. By the time the shout of “Jabo!” goes up, HE is already on its way down. The first bomb decimates the pretty clifftop bungalow at e13. The second plunges towards our Hetzer and the bakery… …but overshoots, erasing the dwelling at f23. Two of the AVRE survivors, their luck reservoirs drained during the previous turn, are struck and killed by flying debris. Gruber takes advantage of the pandemonium to begin his desperate attack on d21. Within seconds he’s receiving fire from multiple sources. As he stumbles towards the scant cover of roadside trees at c22, bullets pluck at his smock and glance off his helmet and the deadly apparatus strapped to his sweat-drenched back. Common sense says he can’t succeed – not in the face of that horrendous grenade-laced lead storm – but in Caent there’s no such word as can’t. The two-storey house with the gaping hole in its south facade is well ablaze when British bullets finally catch up with our heroic one-man dragon. As predicted, Stein’s killers see little of Turn 17. Once Teichert’s FJ squad have neutralised the closest infantry threat they turn on the remnants occupying Larcher’s cottage and deal with them with equal efficiency. Aware, perhaps, that the Brits behind the hotel are struggling, the Wasp attempts to offer support. Scheaffer, our Panzerschreck pointer, is moving to cover when the Allied arsonist presents itself. By the time he levels his length of Dunkelgelb-coloured stovepipe, the unnerved Wasp is rolling back the way it came. Has Gruber left it too late again? It seems not. When the turn ends the battlefield looks like this: 1) The bakery has been under two-inch mortar fire for the past ten seconds or so. The bombs have yet to cause any casualties. 2) &amp; 3) The FJ squads behind the hotel are essentially intact and have ample supplies of ammo. 4) The paratroopers at q21 are ‘cautious’ and down to seven men but appear to be holding their own. 5) Possibly the platoon HQ that led the initial British assault (there’s no sign of it at m20) 6) The AVRE is out of LoS.","Outnumbered and facing fearsome Allied siege engines like the Churchill AVRE and Wasp flamethrower, Caent’s dwindling band of German defenders is beginning to give ground.

https://www.10news.com/zac-self,"ESCONDIDO, Calif. (KGTV) -- Graffiti referencing the New Zealand mass shooting that left 50 people dead was discovered at the scene of a possible arson at an Escondido mosque early Sunday morning. 
According to police, the fire started around 3:30 a.m. at the Islamic Center of Escondido located near the intersection of 6th Avenue and Escondido Boulevard. 
Police believe members of the mosque were able to extinguish the flames before firefighters arrived. Seven people were inside when the fire was reportedly set. 
No one was injured and minimal damage was done to the building, according to police. 
""Our message to community is to make sure they keep a watchful eye out,'' Escondido Police Lt. Chris Lick said. ""If they see something suspicious, especially around a house of worship, they should call police.''
According to police, graffiti left behind by the suspect made reference to the mass shooting in New Zealand, though details on the graffiti weren't available. 
Police tell 10News they are investigating the incident as attempted arson and a possible hate crime. No suspects have been identified at this time. 
Following the fire, members of the mosque scheduled an interfaith prayer vigil. The event will be held at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Islamic Center of Escondido. 
""Once again, we will stand together in love and prayer as we show our unified support for the members of this local Mosque and for the Muslim community at large. All are welcome to attend,"" the mosque said in a news release. 
CAIR also released a statement on the incident. Read the full statement below: 
A little more than a week after 50 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand were brutally massacred at the hands of a white supremacist terrorist who cited Donald Trump in his hate manifesto, that same hatred has resurfaced in Escondido. It is disturbing enough that some sick individual would attempt to burn a house of worship to the ground, but referencing the slayings in New Zealand is beyond the pale. While the majority of humanity has responded to the tragedy to draw closer to one another and refute hatred, a violent and hate-filled minority seeks further divisions. We are grateful that someone was inside the mosque and was able to act quickly to put the fire out. We ask anyone with information to come forward and contact the Escondido Police Department. We stand in solidarity with our community members who attend the Islamic Center of Escondido.",Note referencing New Zealand left at Escondido mosque after possible arson 10News California mosque arsonist leaves note referencing New Zealand shootings New York Post Suspect of Possible Arson Attack at Escondido Mosque Leaves Note Referencing New Zealand T…,2019-03-24T15:14:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': '10news.com'}",Note referencing New Zealand left at Escondido mosque after possible arson - 10News,https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/police-investigate-possible-arson-at-mosque-in-escondido,https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5846a6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx-default-stgec.uplynk.com%2Fausw%2Fslices%2F92a%2F790551469ef2448fbb6dfa541303db12%2F92ac60078c3f4f30a014ad9faf7b5b16%2Fposter_77aa3d93cb6543b7bcc1555da5cfef33.jpg,,10news.com,arsonist,1

"Opinion columnist, Christian Schneider, Opinion columnist","President Trump (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) One must give President Trump credit where it is due: Arguing he is innocent of obstructing justice by threatening to fire the investigator looking into whether he obstructed justice is a novel strategy. It would be like an accused arsonist ordering a judge to find him innocent or he’ll burn her new car to the ground. Yet while the president and investigators publicly wrangle over collusion, obstruction and “spying,” Trump continues his assault on something as valuable as democracy itself: the English language. As the president makes daily pronouncements on Twitter, one only wishes he occasionally colluded with a dictionary. Surely, Trump’s supporters admire his willingness to defy convention. But when proper grammar, punctuation and spelling are treated with more enmity than Vladimir Putin, it weakens America’s standing and undercuts the force of the president’s words. A recent Boston Globe report suggested aides who post tweets on Trump’s behalf actually add garbled syntax, unnecessary exclamation points, and random capitalization to Trump’s posts just to make them sound like the president of the United States. “Some staff members even relish the scoldings Trump gets from elites shocked by the Trumpian language they strive to imitate,” says the Globe report, “believing that debates over presidential typos fortify the belief within his base that he has the common touch.” More: Calorie labeling for menus disrespects eaters and food More: Many have said hurtful things about LGBTQ people. We need an amnesty. For one, the debate over “typos” isn’t necessarily one about misspellings or awkward punctuation. It is a well-grounded concern that the most powerful man in the world often communicates to the world without any filter or prior review by his advisers. Certainly anyone on Twitter long enough will admit they have regretted sending certain tweets, but our inept postings likely won’t lead to a Syrian village being vaporized. And granted, while one is unlikely to hear the Queen’s English being spoken at backyard cookouts across America this summer, the president’s official statements should adhere to a basic standard of properness and decorum. If the president aspired to be a “drain the swamp”-style rabble-rouser, it would be more palatable if he demonstrated a fifth-grade proficiency in language. That’s not to say there wouldn’t be times where the president couldn’t defy language conventions, Tom Wolfe-style. But before one begins stuffing prose with extraneous exclamation points and random capitalization, they should at least master the basics first. International conflict is not the proper venue to feature Trump’s off-the-cuff beat poetry. Instead, Trump’s tweets (or at least the ones he writes) portray an undisciplined, capricious mind prone to laziness and emotional outbursts. Take, for example, this gem from May 23, in which Trump tweeted : “Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before!” More: Enough gloom and doom already, fellow Never Trumpers. We're getting boring. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media One visualizes Trump breathlessly tapping the shift button on his phone to emphasize the words “Phony Collusion.” The capital “P” and “C” are simply too much for him to resist; finally, he gives in to temptation, as if the eye-popping uppercase characters are a porn star at a golf outing. His Ivy League education (recall his declarations that he has the “ best words ” and “ a very good brain ”) begs him to use his linguistic turn signals; but making letters bigger just feels … oh so right. In Aldous Huxley’s The Doors of Perception, Huxley argues the role of the human brain is “eliminative:” the brain essentially serves as a referee, filtering all of the body’s senses and desires to allow humans to function. In the same way, proper use of language further distills the base emotions in the brain into an orderly, understandable stream of communication. The inability of the most powerful person in the world to adhere to even basic linguistic rules — and to brag about this lack of discipline! — should worry even Trump’s most ardent supporters. His lexical lurches toward whatever is on his mind that very second are a window into his unpredictable temperament and capricious judgment. With his game of syntactical bumper cars, Trump highlights both the best and the worst of the American system of government. On the one hand, it demonstrates anyone can be president. On the other hand, it demonstrates that anyone can be president. Let’s just hope one day we find out he’s had an undisclosed meeting with Merriam-Webster.

Claire Lampen,"A strange motive has emerged for the confessed arsonist suspected of setting luxury vehicles ablaze in the huge Kings Plaza Mall parking garage fire on Monday morning: According to a criminal complaint, he said he believed couples were using the cars for secret sex, so he set them on fire. On Tuesday, police say 23-year-old Evon Stephens admitted to starting the fire, telling authorities ""that he was motivated... by his belief that others used the parked vehicles for sexual activity."" According to the criminal complaint, Stephens—who is reportedly homeless—also stated that he ""routinely went to the Parking Garage and accessed vehicles owned by the car dealerships"" that stored their stock there, and that he picked one of these on purpose. The complaint notes that security cameras captured guards confronting Stephens after seeing him in the lot between 8:10 a.m. and 8:25 a.m. on Monday, before the area had opened to the public. He reportedly ignored them, heading instead for the part of the garage where a local Mercedes Benz dealer kept some of its cars. Security camera video shows Stephens getting inside one of these models and moving around. Afterwards, that car can reportedly be seen smoking, with fire spreading throughout the structure in just a few minutes. Footage also features Stephens fleeing the scene, making an ""obscene hand gesture"" for the cameras as he goes, according to the complaint. After police arrested Stephens Monday evening, he apologized for the inferno, which flared into a seven-alarm fire that required hundreds of firefighters to extinguish. Over 130 cars went up in flames as witnesses outside heard ""loud explosions like bombs going off"" and watched an ominous plume of smoke unfurl from the garage. All told, six civilians and 22 firefighters sustained injuries from the blaze, none of them life-threatening. As it turns out, the vehicles qualify as interstate property, making the case a matter for federal investigators, who said Stephens signed a confession on Tuesday.","A strange motive has emerged for the confessed arsonist suspected of setting vehicles ablaze in the huge Kings Plaza Mall parking garage fire on Monday morning: According to a criminal complaint, he said he believed couples were using the cars for secret sex,…",2018-09-19T13:22:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gothamist.com'}",Alleged Kings Plaza Arsonist Says He Set Luxury Cars Ablaze Because People Had Sex In Them,http://gothamist.com/2018/09/19/kings_plaza_mall_cars_arson.php,http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2018/09/091718kingsfire1-thumb-640xauto-1024089.jpg,,Gothamist.com,arsonist,1

The United States and Chinese delegations meet at the negotiating table on&amp;nbsp;January 30, 2019 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesGetty
President Trump has drawn criticism for his aggressive and unorthodox trade policies. As one prominent example, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) said&amp;nbsp;trade actions against China had been very detrimental to Iowa, and that the results for soybeans and corn had been catastrophic.
Yet Grassley, now Chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, recently acknowledged that President Trumps trade threats could be effective. In the context of potential auto trade restrictions under a national security investigation, Grassley said that while he was not in favor of tariffs they may be an effective tool. The threat was probably the only thing that will bring Europe to the table in a reasonable way.
Similarly, in the House, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) introduced a new bill&amp;nbsp;that would enhance President Trumps powers to apply tariffs to other countries. In an op ed, he wrote&amp;nbsp;that this was not ultimately intended to raise protection, but rather to provide the president with necessary leverage for bargaining. The president should have a wide array of tools to open the markets of United States trading partners and encourage participation in negotiations.
The premise seems to be that it has historically been difficult to get major U.S. trading partners to negotiate on trade. Thus, extraordinary measures are required to drag these countries to the table.
In fact, the opposite is true. Every country with which the Trump Administration is seeking, starting, or finishing a trade agreement was already at the table&amp;nbsp;when President Trump took office.
The most advanced pending negotiation is the new USMCA deal, the rewrite of NAFTA. This involves Canada and Mexico. Both were active participants in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks, having joined the discussions in 2012.&amp;nbsp; Many of the most constructive elements of the new USMCA deal are, in fact, derived from the TPP, despite President Trumps vigorous criticism of that deal.
Even before the TPP negotiations, there was no difficulty in getting Mexico and Canada to the negotiating table. There were regular talks with these key NAFTA partners. The difficulty was finding a viable legislative vehicle to push through updates to the 1994 NAFTA agreement. Given the potential opposition&amp;nbsp;faced by the USMCA in Congress, it is not yet clear that the Trump administration has overcome this difficulty. Much of that difficulty stems from same aggressive trade policies that are being lauded for their efficacy.
Chairman Grassley specifically addressed the difficulty of getting the European Union to the negotiating table, yet this was not a problem for President Trumps predecessors. When President Obama left office, his administration was actively negotiating a broad deal with the EU, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Those negotiations, launched in 2013, were sought more ardently by Europe than by the United States. Thus, President Trump has almost managed to work his way back to where the country was when he took office.
With China, on the eve of President Trumps inauguration, the United States had been actively involved in negotiating a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). This type of agreement, which can often serve as a precursor to a deeper trade deal, could have addressed many of the issues that are prominent in the current trade negotiations, such as requirements for American firms to take on Chinese partners in joint ventures a practice that can threaten the safety of the American companies intellectual property.
The final major target&amp;nbsp;of the Trump administrations trade negotiation ardor is Japan. The Trump team made clear early on that it would like to have a bilateral deal with the Japanese. If for no other reason, there was an eagerness to deliver on promises of agricultural market access under the TPP. Once again, though, it was a scramble to win back gains that had been readily available when President Trump walked away from the TPP in his first week in office. Japan had been at the negotiating table; it was the Trump administration that left.
If it has traditionally been easy to draw major trading partners to the negotiating table, why has it seemed so hard under President Trump? Arguably, it was because of the Presidents abrasive&amp;nbsp;and unreliable negotiating style. If the President publicly savaged mutually beneficial deals that the countries had already struck, such as the TPP, then few countries relished the idea of starting discussions from scratch.
If that was the initial cause of countries trepidation, the NAFTA renegotiation experience did nothing to allay concern. The Trump administration made the talks a grueling experience and, in the end, settled on measures that were either already in the rejected TPP, were counterproductive (rules of origin&amp;nbsp;in autos) or were likely to threaten passage through Congress. Few countries who observed this were eager to sign up for the experience themselves.
Crediting the Trump administration for drawing trade partners to the negotiating table is like crediting an arsonist for putting out a blaze. Too bad about all the fire damage.

The final major target of the Trump administrations trade negotiation ardor is Japan. The Trump team made clear early on that it would like to have a bilateral deal with the Japanese. If for no other reason, there was an eagerness to deliver on promises of agricultural market access under the TPP. Once again, though, it was a scramble to win back gains that had been readily available when President Trump walked away from the TPP in his first week in office. Japan had been at the negotiating table; it was the Trump administration that left.
If it has traditionally been easy to draw major trading partners to the negotiating table, why has it seemed so hard under President Trump? Arguably, it was because of the Presidents abrasive and unreliable negotiating style. If the President publicly savaged mutually beneficial deals that the countries had already struck, such as the TPP, then few countries relished the idea of starting discussions from scratch.
If that was the initial cause of countries trepidation, the NAFTA renegotiation experience did nothing to allay concern. The Trump administration made the talks a grueling experience and, in the end, settled on measures that were either already in the rejected TPP, were counterproductive (rules of origin in autos) or were likely to threaten passage through Congress. Few countries who observed this were eager to sign up for the experience themselves.

Jen Chung,"An arsonist was caught on tape setting fire to a Staten Island gas station early Monday morning. The alarmingly stupid video shows him jumping back—as if in shock that his match has ignited all the gas he's sprayed on the ground: According to the NYPD, the incident took place around 1:50 a.m. on July 30th, at the gas pumps outside of the 7-Eleven at 1705 Richmond Avenue. Police say the genius they're looking for ""filled a portable gas can with gasoline"" and then he ""sprayed gasoline around it and used a lit piece of paper to ignite a fire."" The suspect apparently went to the gas station to first buy the canister that he's seen filling. The fire was extinguished by the station's fire suppression system. A 21-year-old man in the vicinity suffered internal injuries and was removed to Richmond University Medical Center in serious but stable condition. The suspect, who fled the location, is being sought for arson. He was last seen wearing a light colored long-sleeved shirt, dark colored shorts and dark colored slippers. Police say he arrived at the location inside of a blue mini-van.

Blakely fired back that Avenatti himself was a felon. (Cohen has pled guilty to several felonies; Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in Los Angeles last month.) Avenatti, in turn, replied that hed never been convicted. Nor has he been charged with one: Local prosecutors are weighing bringing a misdemeanor charge over the domestic violence arrest, but already decided to not charge Avenatti with a felony. Avenatti has said that he is innocent. Avenatti and Blakely were at the courthouse thanks to a lawsuit launched by Daniels, who very publicly broke her non-disclosure agreement about a 2006 affair she said she had with Trump.

Daniels and Avenatti have patched things up since a high-profile blowout last week, when Daniels accused Avenatti of suing Trump for defamation against my wishes, according to a statement to the Daily Beast. She also said that Avenatti dodged her questions about how money from a crowdfunding campaign to support her legal defense and safety expenses was being spent.

"William Hughes on TV Club, shared by William Hughes to The A.V. Club","""Danger Island—Strange Doings In The Taboo Groves"" It only took five episodes—i.e., more than half this season’s entire order of shows—but Archer has finally zeroed in on what makes Danger Island great: Stick Pam and Archer somewhere, give them something to fight about (with Crackers on the outskirts to crack jokes and catch an occasional “Shut up, bird”), and let the magic happen. Sure, I could quibble with some of “Strange Doings In The Taboo Groves”’ other choices—Lana’s continued exile to a single scene per episode (something that also plagued the first half of last year’s Dreamlands ) continues to grate—but it feels petty to ding an episode too hard when it not only gives us Archer’s blundering, accidental proposal to his personal Chewbacca, but also the return of Charlotte Vandertunt: Would-Be Arsonist. Tonight’s hotel-set B-plot is pretty slight, so we can go ahead and dispense with it quickly: Pam accidentally lets slip that she and Archer are searching the island for the MacGuffin idol, and Malory’s treasure hackles immediately go on the rise. (It feels like Jessica Walter has gotten saddled with a lot of exposition work this season, but I love the way she bites into the word every time Malory gushes about “treasure!”) Soon she, Ray, and Deputy Dudu are getting ready to make their way out into the jungle (unknowingly competing with both Archer and Pam and Fuchs’ Nazi goofballs for their prize), when Charlotte invites herself along on the grounds that she’ll burn the damn hotel down if they don’t bring her with. Malory complies, partially in the hopes that “The Crazy Coconut Lady”—who’s been using her influence with the Germans to push her failed former madame around of late—will get herself killed in some jungle deathtrap or other, but mostly because Danger Island needs to get all of its leads in one place for the upcoming finale. (I’ll take it.) The episode’s real meat, though, is in Archer and Pam’s search, which—courtesy of Pam’s shitty, barbecue-sauce-slathered map—quickly lands them both in a big ol’ puddle of quicksand and interpersonal conflict. Blithely ignoring the quicksand issue, Pam zeroes in on a comment Archer made moments before they got stuck about ditching her as soon as they find the idol, and Danger Island suddenly gets about as real as it’s ever likely to get. The ensuing conversation is “emotional Archer ” at its finest: a mixture of real feelings, great voice acting, and a bunch of dick jokes and references to obscure cartographers, all culminating in the moment when Pam weepingly maneuvers Archer into realizing they’re soulmates—then mercilessly busts his ass for floating a marriage idea so bad it “would suck a dick just to cut in line to suck a bigger dick.” (Meanwhile, those of you who think Adam Reed’s using these dream seasons to reflect on Archer’s real-world turmoils can make of all of this ‘shipper fuel what you inevitably will.) I’ve gushed before about this season’s take on the Archer-Pam friendship, but “Groves” dials into what makes it so great, courtesy of a pair of fantastic H.Jon Benjamin monologues in which Archer first denounces his long-time partner as a “jinx,” then hesitantly admits that she’s “the only person I don’t hate to be around.” The trick is that they’re both true: Archer is a dick to everyone—and Archer is a world where that’s the norm—so having a couple of characters who genuinely like each other because they’re both rude, sarcastic fuck-ups can serve as an antidote to so much mean-spirited nastiness that could otherwise develop. (It doesn’t hurt that this is a fantastic episode for Crackers; not only do we get the moment when Pam describes her “ownership” of him as having “half of an old magical bird,” but he gets to serve as the closest thing we get to a voice of reason as his two friends fight it out.) I have a nasty (sinking?) feeling that we’re looking at Danger Island ’s high-point here; with just three episodes left, the season’s plot is inevitably about to kick back in to high gear, and plotty Archer has never been this show’s best version of itself. Still, it’s reassuring to know that Archer can still produce at least one top-tier episode per season, even in its old age; Archer himself might be up to his neck in quicksand, but Archer the show is still occasionally capable of rising above. Stray observations Everybody’s on their way to Dead Man’s Cove, a.k.a. “Foreshadowing Lagoon,” a.k.a. “Harbinger Harbor” (copyright Charlotte Vandertunt). If we’re going to do funny Nazis, this is a pretty good take on them; I’m always going to be on board for dopey, cheerful henchman humor. Speaking of: “We were wondering if, perhaps, as a group, we could speak English?” My total inability to translate German thanks you, Crazy Coconut Lady. Does anybody have any idea who Peggy Deadlegs, the recipient of Malory’s Tahiti-bound package, is supposed to be? I feel like I’m missing an obscure reference, and that pains me. Fun to see an updated version of the “Duchess” painting on the wall of Malory’s office. Crackers, on quicksand: “Yeah, try not to thrash around, it makes you sink faster.” “How would you know?” “Cowboy movies!” Like I said, this is a pretty fantastic episode for Lucky Yates and his magical bird. And again, in the middle of Pam and Archer’s fight: “C’mon, guys, you’re talking crazy.” “Why should I stick around someone who doesn’t appreciate me?” “No, I meant about getting out of here alive.” Aw, poor Luigi. Amber Nash does a lot of amazing work this week as Pam—from the big, racking sobs as she contemplates her “colossal tits,” to her gleeful Archer mockery at the end of the episode—but her best line read might be that half-sure “Positive?” she gives right before Archer tumbles down the ravine. And here’s Benjamin’s whole “jinx” rant; it’s easy to take his ever-excellent performance as Archer for granted at this point, but the way he digs into the anger on that final “YOOOOUUUU” is so, so good: “Because, Pam, I’m currently up to my ears in quicksand. And before that, I flew here in a plane made out of literal garbage. And before that, my eyeball got shot out in Spain. And before that, I went bust on those goddamn chinchilladas. And the common denominator in every bad thing that’s ever happened to me, is you. And you know why? Because the only two kinds of luck you have are bad, and none, because you are a jinx. And that idol is my ticket out of Loserville, population: YOU!” Obscure reference alert: But hey, maybe I just loved this one because the ORA got a workout this week; Elisha Otis, obviously, is the inventor of the elevator. (That one’s just babytown frolics.) The multiply-referenced Weir Of Hermiston, meanwhile, was Robert Louis Stevenson’s final, uncompleted novel. (Like Dudu, I haven’t read it.) And Hendrik Hondius I wasn’t just a famous 16th century cartographer; he also published a world-famous book of portraits of influential dead artists. Thanks, learning! Line of the episode : I’m half-tempted to give this one to Ray; for some reason, Adam Reed yelling, “Où, Dudu, où?” in a bad French accent cracked my dumb ass up. But instead, this is another Crackers week; his cheerful “But I’m hugging you with my talons!” while perched on Archer’s head made me giggle like a jerk.","It only took five episodes—i.e., more than half this season’s entire order of shows—but Archer has finally zeroed in on what makes Danger Island great: Stick Pam and Archer somewhere, give them something to fight about (with Crackers on the outskirts to crack…",2018-05-24T02:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",A little quicksand can't drag down Danger Island's best outing yet,https://tv.avclub.com/a-little-quicksand-cant-drag-down-danger-islands-best-o-1826270368,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--RoHNl-Y9--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/issazv3nbzawjnptmigz.jpg",,Avclub.com,arsonist,1
Wilhelm Arcturus,"Week two of the Summer Fantasy Movie League and we get to see how the first eagerly awaited title of the season came along. It was an interesting mix this week with a variety of anchor choices both old and new to choose from. The lineup looked like this: Ocean's 8 $626 Hereditary $219 Solo $218 Deadpool 2 $201 Hotel Artemis $138 Avengers: Infinity War $93 Adrift $89 Book Club $67 Upgrade $32 Life of the Party $31 Breaking In $24 Overboard $16 A Quiet Place $16 Action Point $15 RBG $11 Ocean’s 8 was the big new title for the week, and while not expected to be a blockbuster, it was clearly set to top the week. After that there was a range of options from the new slow burn horror film Hereditary, to multi-week retreads Deadpool 2 and Solo, to Hotel Artemis … which is referenced in this week’s title. Yeah, things did not go well for Hotel Artemis this week. While priced to exceed The Avengers it in fact was much closer to Upgrade in value when the final numbers, making it about $80 over priced. Fortunately for me, I was in no way tempted by Hotel Artemis. Likewise I was down on Solo as well. That was not going to be my anchor. Instead I was juggling around options with Ocean’s 8, Hereditary, and Deadpool 2 looking for the right mix. As I said in last week’s post, for the Monday Hot Takes league I was in on Hereditary largely due to Liore’s enthusiasm for it. However, as the week went on my enthusiasm for the title waned and I was weighing Ocean’s 8 versus Deadpool 2. Eventually I split the difference, and for the TAGN league I anchored on Deadpool 2 while I used an Ocean’s 8 lineup in another league. With three screens of Deadpool 2 I had enough room for four screens of The Avengers and one of Breaking In. That was my choice. Summer Movie League – My Week One Pick And then the perfect pick ended up being anchored on Solo. Not that my lineup was horrible. Without bonuses it was the 7th best lineup possible. But Solo was the anchor for the top lineup, which was 2x Solo and 6x The Avengers, both with and without bonuses. That left the scores for the week looking like this: Goat Water Picture Palace – $74,929,344 Wilhelm’s Abyssal Pocket Playhouse – $72,843,102 Corr’s Carefully Curated Cineplex – $72,531,960 Paks’ Pancakes &amp; Pics – $70,582,538 I HAS BAD TASTE – $67,754,584 Po Huit’s Sweet Movie Suite – $67,524,560 Miniature Giant Space Hamsterplex – $67,243,494 Too Orangey For Crows – $66,626,858 Vigo Grimborne’s Medieval Screening Complex – $65,429,411 Biyondios! Kabuki &amp; Cinema – $65,429,411 SynCaine’s Dark Room of Delights – $64,018,260 Bean Movie Burrito – $62,986,713 Darren’s Unwatched Cineplex – $62,969,256 Ben’s X-Wing Express – $62,969,256 Kraut Screens – $62,896,688 grannanj’s Cineplex – $56,064,376 aria82’s Cineplex – $55,104,817 JHW’s Cineplex – $27,370,850 Joanie’s Joint – $23,682,815 Aure’s Astonishingly Amateur Amphitheatre – $21,856,990 (did not copy picks) Skar’s Movies and Meat Pies – $20,978,053 (did not pick) DumCheese’s Cineplex – $10,480,818 (did not pick) Goat got the perfect pick which, even without bonuses put him at the top of the list for the week, while my 7th best got me into second. The top half of the list was a mix of picks anchored on Solo, Hereditary, Deadpool 2, and Ocean’s 8. The pricing on those was good enough to keep a variety of picks competitive in the no bonuses game. Hotel Artemis however. Joanie’s Joint was all in on Hotel Artemis and paid the price. A tough week for Jodie Foster fans. And then there is DumCheese. At first glance I thought he picked this week, his lineup being 2x Upgrade and 6x Action Point. It took me a bit to realize that this was his pick from last week which had rolled over. It just looked different because last week Action Point was the anchor while this week it had been devalued so much that Upgrade was worth more. Strange days. So into the second week the overall lineup looks like this: Wilhelm’s Abyssal Pocket Playhouse – $145,366,336 Corr’s Carefully Curated Cineplex – $143,454,008 Goat Water Picture Palace – $137,953,188 Vigo Grimborne’s Medieval Screening Complex – $137,479,475 Biyondios! Kabuki &amp; Cinema – $134,307,401 Too Orangey For Crows – $133,531,136 Po Huit’s Sweet Movie Suite – $132,363,247 Paks’ Pancakes &amp; Pics – $130,537,531 SynCaine’s Dark Room of Delights – $128,707,980 Ben’s X-Wing Express – $126,171,761 Kraut Screens – $126,047,334 Bean Movie Burrito – $125,552,918 I HAS BAD TASTE – $125,226,763 Darren’s Unwatched Cineplex – $122,328,210 aria82’s Cineplex – $121,483,595 grannanj’s Cineplex – $118,611,195 Miniature Giant Space Hamsterplex – $111,168,339 Joanie’s Joint – $85,803,863 Aure’s Astonishingly Amateur Amphitheatre – $78,851,830 Skar’s Movies and Meat Pies – $76,087,549 JHW’s Cineplex – $69,480,658 DumCheese’s Cineplex – $34,163,612 I have managed to hold on to first place… so still rigged… but the gap between me and the the middle of the pack is only $20 million, something a big week could make disappear with the right (or wrong) picks. And speaking of big weeks, we are finally getting one. Week three has a blockbuster anchor showing up, with the options as: Incredibles 2 FRI $521 Incredibles 2 SAT $427 Incredibles 2 SUN $350 Ocean's 8 $201 Tag $145 Solo $89 Deadpool 2 $78 Superfly $71 Hereditary $62 Avengers: Infinity War $48 Adrift $26 Book Club $25 Hotel Artemis $13 Upgrade $11 Life of the Party $11 The Incredibles 2 is on the scene and split across three days as it is expected to bring in… more than Solo did on its opening weekend. Also new on the scene are Tag and Superfly. All of that meant somebody had to get dropped, and so we say farewell for now to Breaking In, Overboard, A Quiet Place, Action Point, and RBG. As for what to pick… well, as I have said in the past, if the pricing was perfect just spending your full $1000 budget would be enough. But we know pricing is imperfect, some times comically so. For this weekend you have to be at least seriously considering a lineup anchored on one day, if not two, of The Incredibles 2. The long range forecast puts it at about $140 million for the weekend, with the FML split at 40%/33%/27% for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So that could be $56 million for Friday, $46 million for Saturday, and about $38 million for Sunday. But the forecast is imperfect and the split is imperfect, and the prediction for all the other features are imperfect. It could hit $150 million and be heavy on Saturday because it is a kids film. Your other anchor options are Ocean’s 8, which is probably good for about $20 million, and Tag, which looks awful (as do a lot of movies these days, but I’m a grumpy old man on that front) with had a forecast of $13 million last week. Then there is a lot of expensive filler. The new Superfly, a remake of the famed 70s blacksploitation flick, second to Shaft in my mind, but still a thing in its day, which looks to be good for $8 million, and is cheaper than Solo or Deadpool 2, which I gather FML thinks are both going to have a gentle drop this week. And at the cheap end there is competing filler. In the dollar difference race between Adrift and Book Club I might take Book Club, while in the low end race between Hotel Artemis, Upgrade, and Life of the Party, I’d probably take U pgrade over Life of the Party, but Hotel Artemis might be correctly priced this week after last week’s debacle. My Monday Hot Takes league pick this week is 2x Incredibles SAT, 1x Deadpool 2, 5x Hotel Artemis., which leaves me $3 to spare. We’ll see if I change my mind on that before Thursday morning rolls around. Go make your picks! The league locks in less than 24 hours after this post goes live.",Week two of the Summer Fantasy Movie League and we get to see how the first eagerly awaited title of the season came along.

PTI,"By: PTI | Washington | Published: December 15, 2017 1:11 pm (Representational) The Pakistani Army is the arsonist in Afghanistan which also wants to be part of the fire brigade, a former top Pakistani diplomat has said. The remarks by Husain Haqqani, Pakistan’s former Ambassador to the US, came as several American experts highlighted the role of the Army in the country’s decision. Haqqani said Pakistan was an ally of convenience during the Cold War, but Pakistan’s main objective to compete with India has never been an American objective. “Therefore, American and Pakistani interests in the region don’t really coincide,” Haqqani said. “Another objective gets undermined as well, and that is that America, at some point, wants to leave that region, and it wants to hand over authority to a strong and stable Afghanistan government, which is not constantly confronted by the Taliban on a daily basis,” he told Cipher Brief. “The problem is that the Pakistani military also sustains the very Taliban who it tells the Americans it will help fight. They are the arsonist and also want to be part of the fire brigade. That is the real complication,” he said. According to Bill Milam, former US Ambassador to Pakistan, for almost the entire period of Pakistan’s independence, the Army has been a significant factor in its political life. “In recent years, the Pakistani military has used a variety of methods to squeeze the operating space of the civilian governments,” said Dan Markey from the Johns Hopkins University.

(Representational Image) The Delhi High Court on Monday expressed apprehension over the safety of people in their homes in the national capital, saying that an “arsonist is on the loose throwing fire bombs and setting cars ablaze”. The remarks were made by the court during the hearing of a petition relating to a woman lawyer’s assault by the police in a stalking case against her in connection with a property dispute. There was high drama during the proceedings as some advocates beat up an unidentified man suspecting him to behind the recent attacks on lawyers. A senior lawyers, who have been representing the woman, have been at the receiving end of arson attacks at their homes and the cars of two of them were set ablaze, reports PTI. According to court staff, the bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Deepa Sharma had risen for a five-minute break when some of the advocates present in the court beat up the man. Lawyers said the man did not state how he entered the court premises and alleged his face resembled that of the arsonist who was caught on CCTV footage throwing a fire bomb at one of the senior lawyers’ home. After returning from the break, the judges expressed serious concern over the incident and said that the court room cannot be turned into an “akhaada” (wrestling ground). They also rapped the police for not maintaining law and order in the court as well as in the city in view of the arson attacks on lawyers, including president of the Delhi High Court Bar Association Kirti Uppal. “If you (police) are unable to handle law and order, let us know. We cannot allow the court to turn into an ‘akhaada’. We are not going to permit this,” the bench said and questioned “is anybody safe?” “We are concerned that there is an arsonist on the loose in the national capital throwing fire bombs and setting cars ablaze,” the bench said. It also asked the registrar general of the high court to look into how unauthorised people were entering court premises. The court was also unhappy that no FIR had been lodged till date in connection with an assault on the woman lawyer by police officers on December 19 last year. The court said it would continue with the hearing. Earlier in the day, it termed the recent attacks on properties of three advocates as “startling” and sought an action taken report from the Delhi Police on the issue. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar sought the report in two days, saying the incident warrants swift and necessary action. The court’ direction came while initiating the proceeding on its own after taking note of the fact that lawyers abstained from the work on January 25 in view of the attacks. The high court bar association had on January 24 passed a resolution condemning the January 9 and 22 attacks on the properties and cars of senior advocates Vikas Pahwa and Kirti Uppal, who is also the president of the DHCBA, by using an inflammable substance. A similar incident took place on January 4 when the two cars– a Maruti Swift and a Honda Amaze– parked in the east Delhi house of advocate Ravi Sharma were allegedly torched by unidentified persons.

"Jamelle Bouie, Jamelle Bouie","Florida delegate Henry Allen carries a Lock Her Up sign through the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 20, 2016. Trump Trusts Dictators but Not Climate Scientists. Heres How He Justifies It. In America, Those Who Earn Their Anger Are Often the Ones Who Are Punished for It Minority Rule Does Not Have to Be Here Forever Brian Kemp Has Put Democracy Itself on the Ballot in Georgia The tax bill is part of a bigger theme that were going to call The Great American comeback, said Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, at the committees planning retreat in February. If we stay focused on selling the tax reform package, I think were going to hold the House and things are going to be OK for us. Republicans tried to stay focused. They talked about the tax cuts and touted economic growth After years of stagnation, our economy is finally on the rise. By just about any economic measure, the American people are better off now, said House Speaker Paul Ryan over the summer. But as of Tuesday, just three weeks before the midterm elections, Republicans are trailing Democrats by nearly 9 percentage points in the congressional generic ballot. FiveThirtyEight gives them a 1 in 5 chance of holding a majority in the House of Representatives. President Trump is still historically unpopular, moderate and independent voters are leaving the GOP in droves, and Democrats are highly motivated to vote. With the party behind and bereft of further accomplishments to show voters, Republicans have abandoned their script. Instead, theyve embraced the path set out by Trump in the 2016 presidential election: constant, unyielding demonization of their opponents. Trump, of course, is leading the charge. If Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, just imagine the devastation they would cause if they obtained the power they so desperately want, he said last week at a rally in Kansas, attacking Americans who gathered at the U.S. Supreme Court building to protest the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. You dont hand matches to an arsonist, and you dont hand power to an angry, left-wing mob, and thats what they have become. Congressional Republicans are on the same page. They have encouraged mob rule, said Chuck Grassley, attacking Senate Democrats. Likewise, in an interview with NPR, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cited the mob when he praised Republicans for confirming Kavanaugh. We stood up to the mob, and we also stood up for the presumption of innocence in this country, McConnell said. Republicans in tight re-election fights have also begun slamming their opponents as terrorists and terrorist sympathizers. In California, Rep. Duncan Hunter has accused Democratic opponent Ammar Campa-Najjar as being a security risk, attempting to tie him to Islamists and radical Muslims trying to infiltrate the U.S. government. This is false, but Hunterunder federal investigation for misuse of campaign fundsis vulnerable and has made anti-Muslim bigotry a key part of his campaign. In Virginia, where Republican Rep. Dave Brat faces Democrat Abigail Spanberger in a closely watched race for the states 7 th District, a GOP super PAC aligned with Paul Ryan has run ads attacking Spanberger for her ties to a Muslim high school in Northern Virginia where she briefly taught English. In 2005, a graduate of that high school was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempted terrorism. Theres no substance to the attack: Its guilt by association that, like Hunters charge, leans on anti-Muslim prejudice. Whats striking about these attacks, and the charges of mob rule in particular, is how they seek to delegitimize Democrats and Democratic opposition. Its not just that Republican lawmakers disagree with their Democratic challengers positions, its that the latter are pawns for Americas enemies. Like Republicans in the wake of Obama, Democrats are channeling grass-roots energy in boisterousbut normalexpressions of political behavior. But to Trump and the Republican Party, this isnt democracy in action, its an illegitimate violation of the political order. Whats striking about these attacks, and the charges of mob rule in particular, is how they seek to delegitimize Democrats and Democratic opposition. You can understand President Trumps constant (and false) reference to paid protesters as a similar declaration of disbelief in civil society opposition. Real Americans, in the presidents view, arent protestingtheyre at his rallies, shouting down the free press. None of this is new, strategywise. During the George W. Bush administration, Republicans routinely cast Democrats as weak on terror to the point of accusing them of sympathizing with terrorist aims. During Barack Obamas tenure in the White House, conservative activists cast liberals and liberal policy as existential threats to the republic. But in age of democratic backslidingwhere a president who praises dictators is actively hostile to democratic norms and representative institutions, and where his party is fighting to entrench rule by minoritythese attacks take on a more sinister light, particularly given their frequency and lack of any grounding in reality. Republicans arent favored in November, but they could still win. And if the attacks on Democratic candidates and agitators are serious, and not just rhetoric, then they could have real consequences. Already, Trump is pursuing restrictions on protest at the White House. With his regular chants of state action against his Democratic rivalsLock Her Up!are we confident he wont try to actualize the latter? If he and his party faces down a blue wave and survives, we might be in deeper than we realize. If you think Slates work matters, become a Slate Plus member.

"USA TODAY, Janna Herron, USA TODAY","From business expenses, rental expenses and medical expenses, here are some of the weirder things people have deducted.
 Time
Many Americans get creative at tax time, pushing the limits on deductions to reduce their tax bill to Uncle Sam.
The goal, of course, is to get away with as much as possible without getting a knock on the door from the Internal Revenue Service.
You'd be surprised at what the agency allows tax filers to deduct  everything from the cost of tanning oil to music lessons. 
To avoid the harsh gaze of the tax man, keep accurate records that back up your deduction such as receipts for donations, medical expenses or business costs.
If your deduction seems like a stretch, check to see if any previous court cases or IRS filings can back up your claim. If not and your deduction is denied, you could face back taxes plus interest and possible penalties.

Here are six unusual deductions the IRS approved and four others that didnt pass the smell test.
In 1962, the IRS ruled that a taxpayer could deduct the costs of a clarinet and clarinet lessons for his son because an orthodontist recommended playing the instrument as a way to treat his severe overbite.
In 1944, the U.S. Tax Court said a taxpayer from Cleveland could write off almost $1,000 for costs related to sending his daughter to a boarding school in Tucson, Arizona. The five-year-old girl suffered from chronic bronchitis, sinusitis and asthma, and was sent to the school in the warmer weather for her health - on doctors orders. Her health improved and the deduction was considered a medical expense.
A Wisconsin bodybuilder deducted almost $14,000 from 1999 to 2001 for the cost of three body oils including a tanning product that helped his career. The U.S. Tax Court allowed the business expense write-off because the oils were primarily marketed in bodybuilding magazines, instead of sold to the public.
An exotic dancer in 1988 wrote off about $2,000 for the depreciation of her breast implants, arguing to the U.S. Tax Court that the implants were a stage prop that boosted her earnings substantially. Before the implants, she made up to $750 a week. After, her earnings in a 20-week period were $70,000, or about $3,500 a week. The U.S. Tax Court ruled that her implants  size 56N after a second surgery  were for work rather than a personal benefit, and allowed the deduction.
To treat severe allergies to chemically contaminated food, a Chicago couple in 1971 could eat only pricey organic food as prescribed by three different doctors. The pair deducted as a medical expense the difference in price between the organic food and regular food treated with chemicals. The U.S. Tax Court allowed the $3,000 deduction.
South Carolina scrap yard owners in 2001 wrote off $300 for the cost of cat food as a business expense, claiming the food attracted wild cats to the business to scare off snakes and rates. The deduction was approved.
Going too far
There is such a thing as going too far with unique deductions. Here are four instances when taxpayers tried to claim an odd deduction, only to be denied, according to H&amp;R Block.
Writing off your life: One taxpayer with a real estate business calculated the value of his life, time and expertise to his business, coming up with $1.75 million. He then tried to amortize that amount as a business expense, but the IRS said no.
Deducting crime costs: The owner of a failing furniture store paid someone to burn down his store. As he should, he reported the insurance he received as income to the IRS. But he went one step too far and deducted what he paid the arsonist as a consulting fee and admitted that during the IRS audit. Oops!
Dress for success: A businessman tried to write off the cost of a mink coat for his wife to wear to business functions. It wasnt allowed.
Groceries as medicine: A diabetic on a restrictive diet tried to deduct the costs of lettuce, tomatoes, artificial sweeteners and reduced-salt foods as medical expenses. The IRS denied the claim.
After so many tax changes this year, what will filers try next? 
Its tax time again. In your rush to get your taxes done, dont make these six mistakes.

"Ilan Goldenberg, Ilan Goldenberg","The U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem. Monday, as an American delegation including Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Steve Mnuchin, and top Republicans from Congress gathers for a ceremony to mark the transfer of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, they may also be marking another milestone: the end of America’s role as the central mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.* Since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the United States has been the primary negotiator between Israelis and Palestinians. Bill Clinton came closest to ending the conflict during the failed Camp David summit between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak in 2000. George Bush led the Annapolis process in 2007–08, failing to yield results. And most recently, under Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry spearheaded an effort in 2013–14, which also crashed and burned. (I was part of the State Department negotiating team in that latest round.) In every one of these talks, other countries played an important supporting role. The Norwegians hosted the secret dialogue that led to the initial breakthrough in 1993 and set the terms for future negotiations between Israelis and the Palestinians. The Arab states, especially Egypt and Jordan but also increasingly Saudi Arabia, have been brought in to give the Palestinians greater political cover while offering incentives to the Israelis in the form of full normalization with the Arab world. The international community has provided humanitarian, economic, and political support through the Middle East Quartet, which comprises the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia. But the United States has always been the irreplaceable player. This was not because we were viewed as evenhanded brokers. We weren’t. We tried our best to be evenhanded, but Americans have always had the strongest relationship with Israel. The United States was viewed as the key, because it was the only one that could deliver Israel. The special relationship between the two countries meant that the United States could reassure Israel, providing it with the security and diplomatic assurances it needs to take the risk of offering the Palestinians a state and territorial control of most of the West Bank. But also that it had the most leverage in pressing the Israelis to accept American proposals. Twenty-five years of failure have already caused many people, especially on the Palestinian side, to question whether an Israeli-Palestinian negotiation under the auspices of the United States was the best way to achieve the two-state solution. And now, the decision by the Trump administration to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital may seal that doubt, eliminating any fiction that the United States could act as the effective sole mediator in bringing an end to the conflict. Credible mediators cannot blatantly support one side over the other on a core issue in the negotiation, but that is precisely what the Trump administration has done. Conflicting Israeli and Palestinian claims on Jerusalem as their capital have always been at the heart of the conflict. The United States has traditionally chosen not to weigh in, instead stating that the issue must be resolved between the parties. This, despite the fact that American negotiators privately acknowledge that the only solution that makes sense is two capitals in Jerusalem. If the United States wanted to move the ball forward, it could have announced the opening of two embassies in Jerusalem: one for Israel and one for the future state of Palestine. Or it could have conditioned moving the embassy to Jerusalem on an Israeli decision to reopen Palestinian governing institutions in East Jerusalem—institutions that had existed in the 1990s as a symbol of Palestinian self-rule and preparation for statehood that included Jerusalem. These institutions were closed after the eruption of violence during the second intifada in the early 2000s. Re-establishing them while also moving the U.S. Embassy would have given a big symbolic win to both sides while cementing the reality that any agreement would include two capitals in Jerusalem. Instead, President Donald Trump chose to give a huge political gift to the Israelis while giving nothing to the Palestinians. He put his own campaign promises and political needs above the political needs of the parties themselves—precisely the opposite behavior of a credible mediator. It is no surprise that the Palestinians reacted to this announcement by cutting off ties with the Trump administration and have refused to meet at senior levels for the past five months. The provocative timing of the embassy move only further undercuts American credibility. The move comes on the 70 th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, a day commemorated by Palestinians as the “Nakba”—the catastrophe. It comes the day before the start of Ramadan, in the midst of mass protests in Gaza, and during escalating tensions in Syria between Israel and Iran. Perhaps the only good news is that thus far the embassy move has not prompted significant violence. Palestinian security forces coordinating with Israelis have kept a lid on the situation in the West Bank. With the Middle East absorbed by civil war and domestic instability, the Palestinian issue has not been top of mind across the Arab world. But why press our luck and throw additional uncertainty into a sensitive situation? That is not the role of a peacemaker. In its traditional role of mediator, America has always played the firefighter trying to put out the flames of the conflict. But by moving the embassy at this particularly sensitive moment, we are instead playing the arsonist. This undercutting of the American role may worsen if the Trump administration then follows up the embassy move by releasing a new peace plan, as it has been preparing to do for months. According to media accounts, the plan would be a radical shift from previous U.S. efforts and offer the Israelis more than any previous American administration. Coming on the heels of the Jerusalem announcement, the Palestinians will dismiss it out of hand. And for those who believe that this trend is temporary and that the United States will return to its central role after Trump—don’t bet on it. Given the domestic political blowback that would result, it is highly unlikely that any future American president will reverse the Jerusalem decision. So what happens instead? The United States will continue to play an important role in any future negotiations. We remain the global superpower and the country with the closest ties to Israel. But others will have to be brought into the process as equal participants instead of remaining as the supporting cast. The format could be similar to the P5+1 (U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Russia, China) negotiations that reached a nuclear agreement with Iran. It could include a regional formula that brings in the Arab State more directly. Or we may see greater involvement by the United Nations. But whatever the new formula looks like, one thing is clear: The days when the United States dominated the Middle East peace process are likely coming to an end.

Jon Tattrie,"As U.S. President Donald Trump arrives in Quebec for a G7 meeting today, he's flying into a historic storm over the burning question: Did Canada torch the White House? During a heated exchange with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over tariffs, Trump reportedly asked, ""Didn't you guys burn down the White House?"" CBC News went to the experts to find out the truth about what happened during the War of 1812. John McCavitt wrote The Man Who Captured Washington, the biography of Robert Ross, the soldier who ordered the fire. So did Canada burn down the White House? ""Absolutely not,"" McCavitt says. ""It was a British Army led by an Irishman Maj.-Gen. Robert Ross from Rostrevor, County Down, present-day Northern Ireland."" We put the same question to John Boileau, a retired army colonel and author of Half-Hearted Enemies: Nova Scotia, New England and the War of 1812. Did Canada burn the White House? ""No. Interestingly enough, it wasn't Canada that burned the White House. There were a couple of Canadians there because they were serving in the British Army,"" Boileau says. A 'pivotal moment' in Canadian history In 2012, the Canadian government spent $28 million marking the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. Then-prime minister Stephen Harper called it ""a pivotal point in the development of our great country."" Harper said the war bonded the French, English and Indigenous peoples as they rallied around the common goal of resisting American invasion. ""These bonds created by our ancestors are at the origin of a truly pan-Canadian identity that made possible our Confederation,"" Harper said. Looking out the window of his home in Rostrevor, McCavitt can see the obelisk honouring Ross. But he says the War of 1812 isn't well known in Britain or Ireland. ""Or in America, either, if we go by President Trump's remarks."" The British were busy fighting Napoleon's France and the U.S. took the chance to invade pre-confederation Canada. When Napoleon abdicated, British troops were freed up to defend Canada. Ross gathered his men in Bermuda in August 1814 and sailed directly into U.S territory. American newspapers were full of fear that the whole country would fall to the British, just 38 years after the Declaration of Independence. McCavitt says the ""trumpeted"" threats were mostly scare tactics. The capture of Washington ""He had no intention whatsoever of attacking Washington,"" McCavitt says of Ross. ""When he arrived on the coast of America, he couldn't believe how easy it was to carry out operations, partly because Americans were so frightened they were going to face this massive expedition."" In suspiciously Canadian fashion, Ross accidentally captured Washington. ""He never dreamt for one minute that an army of 3,500 men with 1,000 marines reinforcement, with no cavalry, hardly any artillery, could march 50 miles inland and capture an enemy capital."" Boileau says the Americans had about 9,000 fighters to defend the city, but they were mostly untrained militiamen. The key battle took place in Bladensburg, just outside of Washington. ""These are hardened, experienced British soldiers who had been fighting Napoleon's best troops, against militiamen who had never fired a shot in anger in their lives. Although some Americans stood and fought, it was basically a rout,"" Boileau says. The Americans fled. A young British lieutenant quipped, ""Never did men with arms make better use of their legs."" An admiral said Ross didn't follow up his victory because ""the victors were too weary and the vanquished too swift."" One American supposedly died from excessive running. Ross had clear orders: The Americans had burned York (now Toronto) and he was to take revenge. He could demand a ransom or burn the city down. Ross, whom McCavitt describes as ""an officer and a gentleman,"" first sought an orderly surrender of the American capital. But treachery was afoot. As Ross entered Washington under a flag of truce, an American militiaman opened fire. ""His horse was shot dead. Two of his men were killed,"" McCavitt says. ""He very reluctantly agreed and ordered the burning of the White House and also the Capitol. I would describe him as a reluctant arsonist."" To the victors go the spoils The soldiers torched the Library of Congress, the Capitol building and the Treasury. British troops stormed the president's mansion, only to find an American victory meal prepared for the departed U.S. president, James Madison. The troops tucked in. ""They then set the White House on fire,"" Boileau says. ""The legend is, to cover up the scorch marks on the presidential palace, [Americans] used whitewash. From that time, it was called the White House."" ""The people of Washington in general were very appreciative that Ross didn't carry out a revenge raid on the city,"" McCavit adds. Canadians thought they got what they deserved. Ross led his troops onto Baltimore to make his second great contribution to Americana by launching rockets creating a red glare as the bombs burst in the air, inspiring amateur poet Francis Scott Key to pull out his pen. ""Francis Scott Key — who actually had dinner with general Ross on board a Royal Navy vessel — he was watching and dreading: Would the Star-Spangled Banner still be in Baltimore?"" McCavit says. Key started writing the poem Star-Spangled Banner, which would later become America's national anthem, when the dawn rose to reveal the flag was indeed still there. Ross wasn't. An American sniper had killed him. McCavit, who has spoken about Ross to the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, says the general died respected by enemies and friends alike. When President Andrew Jackson toasted the American militiaman who killed Ross, ""American newspapers were full of condemnation of the American president for insulting the memory of an honourable enemy."" A newspaper in Washington said Ross ""took the horror out of the war."" Half-hearted friends? Boileau called his book Half-Hearted Enemies because his research showed most people in Nova Scotia and New England wanted to avoid fighting each other and kept trading deep into the War of 1812. Canadian lumber headed south and American beef headed north. ""I would say [today] we're more than half-hearted friends,"" Boileau says. ""This is just an argument within a family. I can't think of any two nations that are closer than Canada and the United States."" After his death, Ross was embalmed in a cask of rum and taken to Halifax, where he was laid to rest in the Old Burying Ground. It's not clear why he ended up there. He was buried with full military honours in the historic graveyard in downtown Halifax. It's a quiet spot today, despite being surrounded by busy roads. Large trees cast shadows over lichen-covered graves. Ross's tomb looks like an old stone resting in the ancient cemetery. But the plaque on the graveyard gates suggests that Trump might have been onto something. It reads: ""We are not Americans because of the service of men like the sailors and soldiers, casualties of the War of 1812, buried in this historic burying ground. They fought and died at sea and ashore to prevent the United States' invasion and annexation of our country.""","Historians say U.S. President Donald Trump is wrong about the War of 1812.

James Rettig,"The rousing Durham punks Martha released a new track for the holidays last month, “Heart Is Healing,” and today they’re back to announce a new album, Love Keeps Kicking, which that song is on, and to share its title track and a new music video. The album is the follow-up to 2016’s Blisters In The Pit Of My Heart. 
“Love Keeps Kicking” is itchy and restless, with a chorus of voices resounding that love does indeed keep kicking, even if it’s sometimes in the form of “love keeps kicking the shit out of me” and less in the way of a genuine human connection. The video is an elaborate take on an alien invasion, with the alien being a giant foot. 
“We wanted to do an old sci-fi alien invasion pastiche and create a threat that no one can outrun, because as the song implies, at some point or another, we all feel the harsh sting of heartbreak,” directors Ben Epstein and David Combs said in a statement. “And what better metaphor is there for the inevitability of a broken heart than the swift kick of a giant disembodied foot? It basically wrote itself.”

Tim Stone,"When it comes to scenario durations, CMBO is as pedantic as a parks department pedalo führer. Unlike its successors, it always halts battles at precisely the advertised time. Overlordy will have no false dawns… no painfully extended death rattle. The defence of Caent will end in exactly sixty seconds’ time. (Overlordy is a 20-turn open-to-all game of Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord in which German forces are orchestrated by commenters while British units are computer controlled. For a scenario outline and summaries of earlier turns, click here ). My final order implementation duties are hardly onerous. Confident that the defensive arrangements that saw them through Turn 19 with barely a scratch will see them through Turn 20 just as painlessly, the Comment Commanders leave most of their units to their own devices. Apart from some minor meddling in the east, and some Hetzer adjustments in the centre, “Keep doing what you’re doing” is the order of the day minute. For the first twenty seconds of the action phase the battered Brits seem as uninterested in last-gasp glory-hunting as the Germans. Bullets continue to nibble at the bakery and stalk the lanes islanding the blazing hotel, but most are making for static targets relatively safe behind bulwarks of brick or timber. The illusion of armistice vanishes circa T+22 when a squad of Tommies emerge from the cottage south of the hotel, and hares north. Harried by Kar98ks propped on the rim of the bomb crater at f23, the runners are almost across the street when the unit responsible for excavating that crater makes its fourth and final appearance. This time the Typhoon pilot isn’t distracted by immaterial matériel. He spots Brenner’s battlewagon smokescreen sculpting in the village centre and gently guides the buttoned TD into the centre of his shivering reflector gunsight. The first few cannon shells tear at cobblestones like happy rioters. The last few find something more meaningful to mutilate. The Hetzer has been immobilized, a serious condition for any AFV, a calamitous one for a turretless TD like the Jagdpanzer 38. In the seconds following the Tiffy attack the British assaulters near the KOed Churchill adjust their trajectory, turning for the cottage that Larcher, the Pioneer platoon leader, defended so fiercely for so long. Are they hoping to take advantage of the Hetzer’s disability and mount a daring last-minute AT attack? No, it seems not. Their doomed dash across i21 implies they were hoping to surprise the bakery defenders with a westward sally. Their backs guarded by the Green Devils behind the hotel and the AVRE victims in the bomb crater, Nerbul and his men are free to concentrate on breaking up the game’s last significant offensive action, a second surge from the denziens of West Wood. When the curtain falls, bloodied British infantry are detouring north past the body of Gruber, our heroic arsonist, in an effort to avoid the cramped kill zone west of the bakery. The flanking manouevre comes much too late to revitalise the faltering Allied advance and spare British blushes. Overlordy is a clear tactical victory for the Germans! AXIS SCORE: 63 74 casualties (23 KIA) 1 gun destroyed 2 pillboxes knocked-out 2 vehicles knocked-out 51 men ok ALLIED SCORE: 33 137 casualties (35 KIA) 1 mortar destroyed 6 vehicles knocked-out 61 men ok The scratch speed bump has done its job brilliantly.

"Brian Bennett / Houston, Texas and Tessa Berenson","In front of thousands of supporters packed into in the Houston Toyota Center, President Donald Trump talked up his one-time rival Ted Cruz and starkly laid out his version of the choice voters face in the midterm elections on Nov. 6. Trump boiled it down to a slogan short enough to fit on a single Teleprompter screen: “Republicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs.” In the final days before the midterms, Trump has been an active campaigner for Republican congressional candidates, dominating the news cycle by hosting multiple rallies per week in states around the country. This week alone, Trump will visit at least three states for rallies: Texas, Wisconsin and North Carolina. White House officials are planning to increase that pace in the final stretch next week. “One of the assets I have is I’m able to speak to people in tremendous numbers,” Trump told TIME this month of his power in the midterms, calling from Air Force One on his way to an Oct. 10 rally in Erie, Pa. “We have thousands of people lined up outside right now trying to get in. But I’m able to speak to them and often times it’s on live television, you understand. So I’m able to get my word out.” Read More: How the Midterms Will Test Trump’s Hold on the GOP With just two weeks to go and Democrats holding a nine-point lead among likely voters over Republicans in congressional preference, according to a recent NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll, it’s time for the president to, as he might say, close the deal. A pattern has emerged of his closing arguments to voters on why they should vote for Republicans instead of Democrats. He enumerated it himself at a rally in Montana on Oct. 18: “This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense,” he said. The midterm results will test whether his stark, misleading rhetoric hit the right notes or pushed too far. Here’s a look at three of the president’s main pitches to voters in the home stretch of midterm campaigning. Democrats are ‘the mob’ Trump has employed one of his favorite tactics against an opponent, this time against Democrats as a whole: coming up with a damaging nickname to brand an adversary. His new moniker for the Left is “the mob.” At stake in this election, Trump told a cheering crowd in Houston, is continued prosperity under his policies, “or we let the radical Democrat mob take a giant wrecking ball and destroy our country or our economy.” The Democrats, went on, “want to replace the rule of law with the rule of mob.” It’s a phrase he’s used like a hammer in recent weeks, attempting to frame high-profile protests in the nation’s capital against a Republican health care bill, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation and other issues as beyond the pale. “The Democrat party has become an angry, ruthless, unhinged mob determined to get power by any means necessary,” Trump said at a rally in Elko, Nevada, on Oct. 20. “You don’t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don’t give power to an angry left-wing mob, and that’s what they’ve become,” Trump said during a Kansas rally the day Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court. The “mob” branding contributes to the overall pictures of the Democrats that Trump likes to paint: that their policies foster crime and that, were they to take control of Congress, they would be dangerous for America. In Ohio on Oct. 12, Trump said, “Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob.” Democrats want illegal immigration and crime One specific pitch Trump often makes to voters is that Democrats are soft on issues like illegal immigration. This was Trump’s signature issue during the 2016 presidential election, and he continues to think it will be a winning strategy in 2018. Trump has repeatedly blamed Democrats, without evidence, for a migrant caravan headed to the U.S. “I think the Democrats had something to do with it,” Trump said Monday night. “That’s an assault on our country,” he said. On Oct. 21, Trump tweeted that the caravan is a “disgrace” to the Democratic Party. In a tweet the following day he added, “Remember the Midterms!” And, to contribute to the “mob” idea that Democrats shouldn’t lead, Trump has placed the blame for the faults in America’s immigration laws on the Party’s congressional leaders, calling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi “obstructionists” on the issue, although immigration bills failed in the Republican-led Congress during the Trump Administration. Trump’s attacks on the Democratic Party on immigration are all part of a broader theme, which he repeats often: “It is,” he said on Oct. 1 at a rally in Tennessee, “the party of crime.” Republicans are already making America great Trump famously rode into office on the slogan “Make America Great Again.” Now, he’s announced a new one for his reelection campaign: “Keep America Great.” As he denigrates Democrats at his rallies, he’s also making an affirmative case for why voters should punch the ballot for Republicans next month. “Under Republican leadership, America is winning again. America is respected again, because we are putting America first,” Trump said in Houston. “We are taking care of ourselves for a change folks.” He often touts the booming economy, tweeting Oct. 21 that “Dems can never do even nearly as well!” At a rally in Nevada on Oct. 20, Trump hinted that he and Republican lawmakers have been working on “a very major tax cut” for middle-income families. With Congress in recess before the election and few on Capitol Hill aware of what Trump is referring to, these hypothetical tax cuts couldn’t pass before Nov. 6, so bringing the plan up at a rally shows that Trump thinks the idea will energize voters for the GOP. The success in confirming Kavanaugh and a raft of other conservative judges is another key selling point for Trump and Republican candidates. “The Democrats are even talking about doing really bad things now to Justice Kavanaugh,” Trump said at a rally in Iowa on Oct. 9. “Last week, they were saying, ‘We’ll impeach.'” The president then joked: “I have to go first, right? Don’t I? — even though we’ve done nothing wrong other than create one of the greatest economies in the history of the world.” It was said with a wink but encapsulates the most essential message to voters on both sides ahead of the midterms: vote for Republicans to protect Trump’s policies and power. Or vote for Democrats to undo it.","In front of thousands of supporters packed into in the Houston Toyota Center, President Donald Trump talked up his one-time rival Ted Cruz and starkly laid out his version of the choice voters face in the midterm elections on Nov. 6.

Al Jazeera,"The United Kingdom asked Interpol to issue arrest warrants for two men accused of working for Russian intelligence and are wanted for the nerve agent attack on a former spy and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. In a statement before the UN Security Council, UK Ambassador Karen Pierce reiterated on Thursday the British government has ""clear evidence of Russian state involvement"" in the attack and the use of the Novichok chemical weapon against former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. ""There is an established pattern of malign Russian behaviour perpetrated by military and intelligence agencies overseas,"" Pierce said. ""They work in a parallel universe where the normal rules of international affairs are inverted."" 'Full confidence' Pierce's strongly worded statement came as the UK, France, Germany, Canada and the United States pledged to work to disrupt ""the hostile activities of foreign intelligence networks"". In a joint statement, the countries said they backed Britain's assessment that Russian officers were behind the Skripal attack. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU, and that this operation was almost certainly approved at a senior government level,"" it said, adding they urged Russia to provide ""full disclosure of its Novichok programme"". ""Yesterday's announcement further strengthens our intent to continue to disrupt together the hostile activities of foreign intelligence networks on our territories, uphold the prohibition of chemical weapons, protect our citizens, and defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies."" 'Mythical chemical' In response, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, accused London of ""repeated lies"" during the investigation. He told the UN Security Council the allegations were ""unfounded and mendacious"", and referred to the Novichok nerve agent as ""mythical"". Nebenzia also said the accusations intended to create ""hysteria"" against Moscow. The UK government has refused Russia's offer to join in the investigation of the case, he added. Pierce responded, ""You don't recruit an arsonist to put out a fire. You especially don't do that when the fire is one they caused."" On Wednesday, UK prosecutors announced they were charging two suspects - identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - for the attack. The Skripals were poisoned with the military-grade nerve agent - developed by the former Soviet Union in the 1970s and '80s - in March but survived after spending weeks in hospital. The failed attack sparked an international diplomatic crisis with Russia being accused of responsibility by several countries - allegations Moscow has repeatedly denied.",UK envoy to UN says British government has 'clear evidence' of Russian state involvement in failed assassination.,2018-09-06T18:39:26Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",UK seeks Interpol arrest warrants against Skripal suspects,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/uk-seeks-interpol-arrest-warrants-skripal-suspects-180906154306169.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/9/6/436452bd8f564ebea33be902adfd87b0_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,arsonist,1
"Dennis Perkins on News, shared by Dennis Perkins to The A.V. Club","Few issues are more heated these days than immigration. Especially since the United States government is in the hands of really, really racist people. Anyway, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver took on the issue with host Oliver’s signature blend of investigative reporting, comic hyperbole, and nonsense-puncturing stunts as he delved into the shockingly ludicrous legal system that determines whether people seeking asylum in this country get to stay, or whether they get deported back to places they’ve fled, often in very real fear of their lives. Understaffed, wildly whimsical in terms of judgement rates, and, as one immigration judge puts it, “doing death penalty court cases in a traffic court setting,” this system is shown as profoundly, often tragically unjust. Lest that seem like hyperbole in itself, Oliver pointed up just a few cases where, after facing years of waiting followed by summary deportation, people were indeed assaulted or murdered as soon as they were sent back into the sights of the people they’d been running from. In one case after a hearing lasting less than two minutes. “Now hold on,” one might be saying, “This is the judicial system of these great United States you’re talking about, mister.” Well, as Oliver points out in what’s certain to be a surprise to some, it is and it isn’t, as immigration courts aren’t in the judicial branch at all, but, instead, are under the supervision of the executive. Meaning that every decision surrounding asylum seekers—most of whom are people of color—is subject to the political whims of the particular administration in control. Which, in this case, means noted and empirical bigot Jeff Sessions and, by extension, somehow even more racist Donald Trump. Plus, as Oliver shows in a development that will seem completely, farcically unfair to anyone with a human soul, said courts are exempt from that whole “if you can not afford an attorney, one will be provided for you” idea—even when it comes to children. With one immigration judge (Jack Weil is his name) heard arguing that kids as young as three can be made to understand the intricacies of their options and rights under U.S. immigration law, Oliver played one immigration lawyer’s rebuttal to that shameless nonsense in the form of a series of interviews with actual children expected to represent themselves in court. One, asked to “designate a country of removal,” answered, correctly, “Pizza.” As ever, Oliver ratchets up his plea for sanity amidst the world’s bullshit with a goof and some celebrity friends. In this case, Archer and Bob’s Burgers star H. Jon Benjamin (in the flesh for a change) came on as a suspected arsonist in the Oliver-produced Tot Bench, a variation on the ubiquitous TV judge shows where Benjamin’s fate is in the hands of a court filled with delightfully inattentive three and four-year-olds. Spoiler: it doesn’t go well, as the honorable and adorable Judge Riley sentences him to “a jillion years” in prison. Well, at least he got a fair trial, by U.S. immigration court standards.","Few issues are more heated these days than immigration.

"Dan Neilan on News, shared by Dan Neilan to The A.V. Club","Last weekend, you may have seen a number of comedians online paying their respects to Sean Rouse, the 43-year-old Houston-based comedian who died on June 29th after suffering a stroke and a heart attack. Despite his years in the business, Rouse’s name is likely unfamiliar to most, even self-professed comedy nerds. But that doesn’t mean he was any less good at what he did. In a moving eulogy published on Vulture, fellow stand-up and longtime friend, Doug Stanhope, recounted Rouse’s sniper-like precision as a stand-up and the chronic pain that plagued his life both on and off the stage. Sean lived most of his life with his candle burning at both ends — one end torching through the downward spiral of crippling rheumatoid arthritis, the other ablaze with drugs and alcohol, both celebratory and medicinal, and those drugs, more often than not, were yours. And in spite of that, for over two decades he created some of the most unique, adorably morbid, and precisely crafted stand-up comedy I’ve ever watched. He would build routines like a drama, using silence as the foundation, and cautiously chosen, succinct sentences as the framework before blowing the whole structure to pieces, blindsiding you with a punch line you never saw coming and then gleefully pounding out taglines like a child arsonist kicking up the embers of his own destruction. Like Stanhope, Rouse was known for taking on subjects most stand-ups would consider taboo or, at the very least, too difficult to make funny. Jokes about natural disasters, death and dismemberment, his own molestation as a child, and, as Stanhope puts it, “fearless material about race while being possibly the whitest man alive” were all hallmarks of Rouse’s sets. He would either win audiences over with his boyish grin, or completely lose them. The regular occurrence of the latter is what lead him to be featured in Stanhope’s documentary The Unbookables. “Nobody told Sean Rouse what to do. Not in comedy, not in life,” Stanhope writes. As mentioned above, Rouse also struggled with chronic pain and illness. Rheumatoid arthritis made it difficult for him to get out of bed most mornings, let alone walk on to a stage. When Stanhope first met him, Rouse had been falsely diagnosed with lupus as doctors struggled to figure out what was wrong with him. His penchant for drug and alcohol abuse likely relieved and contributed to his constant pain. But, as Stanhope writes, Rouse never painted himself as a victim of these lifelong struggles. “His demons were a slave to him. He owned them. And if he peed on your couch or puked in your car, he’d smile and tell you that it was your own fault for inviting him.” You can read all of Stanhope’s touching, hilarious eulogy here.

https://www.facebook.com/missy.ryan,"The United States must contend with growing competition from Russia and China across the Middle East following the defeat of the Islamic State, a senior U.S. official told lawmakers Tuesday. Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command (Centcom), described an array of steps those “great power” nations have taken to expand their military and political clout in a way that challenges American interests from Syria to Afghanistan. Describing the chief issues facing the U.S. military in the region, Votel took aim at what he characterized as Moscow’s attempts to monopolize events in Syria, where the course of a grinding civil conflict was redirected by Russia’s military intervention in 2015. Although President Vladimir Putin announced a drawdown of Russian forces from Syria in December, Moscow’s continued military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has allowed his government to claw back areas under opposition control. [ Syria’s war mutates into a regional conflict, risking a wider conflagration ] In Syria, “Moscow is playing the role of arsonist and firefighter... fueling tensions and then trying to resolve them in their favor, and then manipulating all the parties they can in order to achieve their objectives,” he said during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. The new focus reflects a shift outlined in the Trump administration’s recent national defense strategy, which seeks to reorient the Pentagon from the counterinsurgency wars that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks toward competition with large, sophisticated nations posing a threat to U.S. military primacy. Although U.S. officials acknowledge that counterterrorism threats emanating from the Centcom region are far from being vanquished, they also have embraced a “great powers” lens to view the region. Syria in particular, Votel said in his written statement, has emerged as a testing ground for new Russian weapons and military tactics, often without taking care to protect civilians. Enhanced Russian air defenses likewise pose a new threat to U.S. air activities in the region. The general said that Russia was seeking to exploit differences among the complicated array of factions in Syria — the Assad government, Iran and Turkey, along with the United States and the Kurdish forces it has supported against the Islamic State. While the United States and its allies have pushed the Islamic State out of most areas it once controlled, a U.S. force of about 2,000 troops remains in northern and eastern Syria in a bid to prevent the extremists from returning. The general blamed Russia for failing to enforce a U.N.-backed cease fire approved over the weekend. “Either Russia has to admit that it’s not capable, or it doesn’t want to play a role in ending the Syrian conflict here,” he said. “I think their role is incredibly destabilizing.” Votel, meanwhile, said that Russia had “exaggerated” the threat posed by an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan and had mischaracterized that group’s rise as an indication of a failed U.S. strategy. [ Putin ally said to be in touch with Kremlin, Assad before his mercenaries attacked U.S. troops ] Votel also referred toChina’s growing military ambitions in the region, citing a new base in Djibouti, its attempts to expand arms sales to U.S. allies and, like Russia, its efforts to develop “multidimensional” ties with U.S. adversary Iran. The general suggested that the United States would try to balance the new focus on great- power competition and the ongoing threats from militant groups by relying on allies in a way that might allow for a smaller U.S. footprint in the region. U.S. efforts to elevate the military capabilities of regional allies have had mixed success. One large-scale threat identified by the Trump administration that does reside within the Middle East is Iran.

And the voice careens crazily, from a just-the-facts tone to awkwardly elevated diction (there are no homes in this book, only “domiciles”) to lamentable efforts to introduce local color (the “ragamuffins” who “do-si-do” around the place until they need to “vamoose”). It’s intensely irritating — but interesting, too. I remonstrated with Fieseler out loud and in the margins. Why does this seem like an energetic impression of a book? The anxious, frantic shifts make it feel as if he is constantly trying to please someone reading over his shoulder. Oddly enough, this might not be far from the truth. In the acknowledgments, Fieseler writes that the idea came to him from a book editor and two professors at the Columbia Journalism School. Although the fire had been covered in at least two books and a documentary, they felt it was still “underexplored.” Fieseler, a first-time writer and former student at the school, was tapped to write a history. The inconstant voice suddenly makes more sense. But so do the moments of narrative power. Fieseler has taken the helm. He describes with feeling and extraordinary immediacy the horror of the fire ripping into the room, how men leapt from the window or crept back into the burning building to look for lovers and friends. Many died in one another’s arms, their bodies found fused together. Fieseler also attends to a different kind of heroism — the painstaking slog of activism that has seen the fire commemorated in plaques and public days of mourning, the seeking of sympathy from a dilatory city and church. And he sensitively recounts how the fire forced other, more personal confrontations. There was a memorial shortly after the fire. Reporters had gathered outside. Mourners, terrified of being outed, planned a discreet exit out a side door. And then, as some recalled, “a butch-looking woman” shouted “I came in the front door, and I’m damn well going out that way.” The group followed her. One survivor told Fieseler, in wonderment: “That was the first time, for a lot of people, they had ever joined together with other gay people, gay and lesbian, in the light of day though they’d known each other at night.”","In “Tinderbox: The Untold Story of the Up Stairs Lounge Fire and the Rise of Gay Liberation,” Robert W.

Peter Edwards - Staff Reporter,"As an author, you sometimes wonder who’s reading your books. This week, courtesy of Google Alerts, I learned that one reader who’s apparently warm for my long-form is Timmins arsonist Gerald Caza, 49. A story published this week in the Timmins Daily Press notes that Caza stole my 2010 book, The Bandido Massacre: A True Story of Bikers, Brotherhood and Betrayal, from the Timmins Public Library, then left it at an arson scene. Why he stole a book he could have borrowed free from the library intrigued me. Why he cared about the book at all was also of interest. He added that “perhaps it wasn’t just the title that appealed to him.” “I didn’t include this part in the story,” Grech continued, “but when Caza was being interviewed by police after his arrest, an officer pulled out the book and noted to Caza that he was seen carrying this item as he entered the building shortly before the fire. Caza remarked to the officer that he had finished reading it.” I wasn’t sure whether to be flattered or appalled. Further investigation showed that Caza has made multiple appearances in the news pages of The Daily Press. They have all been unsettling. There was a 1999 story which noted Caza was charged with murder and arson with disregard and appeared in court in a “torn lumberjack jacket and leg shackles.” He ended up serving more than eight years for manslaughter. Then there was a 2011 article by Grech headlined, “Dressed like a bandit, jailed like one.” It describes Caza as “walking into a restaurant dressed all in black, with sunglasses, hat, bandana over his nose and mouth.” “Just like in the movies,” commented judge Ralph Carr, the article notes. Defense lawyer Nancy Cooper tried to explain Caza’s attire by saying he covered his face with a bandana because he thinks scarves are “too effeminate.” “It’s part of his fashion,” Cooper said. Assistant Crown attorney Gerrit Verbeek added: “Mr. Caza is not too bright if he dresses like that after having a robbery conviction, whether it looks cool or not.” Caza was defiant to the end that day, even after he was sentenced to 45 days in jail and scolded by the judge not to wear a bandana over his face while entering a business establishment. “I don’t wear scarves,” Caza shot back. “No one is going to force you to wear a scarf,” Carr said. “It’s a free country.” Grech added in his story: “However, the judge pointed out that people get uneasy when someone walks into a business dressed like a bandit with a bandana covering the lower part of their face.” “It makes people think you’re a robber,” Carr said. That brings us to this week’s story by Grech, which describes how Caza set a $30,000 blaze in a two-storey apartment building last summer. It notes that Caza pleaded guilty in Timmins provincial court on Monday to arson, break and enter to commit an indictable offense, theft and breach of probation. “The theft charge was laid in connection with a book Caza stole from the Timmins Public Library, which he then left on the floor at the scene of the July 1st arson,” Grech writes. “The name of the book was The Bandido Massacre.” Caza didn’t comment on why he took my book when he tried to explain his actions. “It’s drinking that brings me in these courtrooms. I know for a fact, I will have to stay off the booze when I get out.” Caza was sentenced to 5½ years in prison this time. “So how much was for the arson and how much was for the theft?” asked Star editor Barry Brimbecom. I’m prepared to live with that mystery.",Star reporter Peter Edwards learned this week he has an unlikely fan in convicted Timmins arsonist Gerald Caza.,2018-02-28T21:45:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thestar.com'}",My book was stolen from the library and left at a crime scene.

Jeff Seldin,"PENTAGON — A top U.S. general is accusing Russia of sowing the seeds of instability in Syria and across the greater Middle East, part of an ongoing attempt to expand its influence at the expense of the United States and the international community. ""Diplomatically and militarily, Moscow plays both arsonist and firefighter, fueling tensions among all parties in Syria,"" the commander of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, told lawmakers Tuesday. Votel further accused Russia of then offering to serve as a mediator in an effort to ""undermine and weaken each party's bargaining position."" The criticism, though worded more sharply than in the past, is in line with previous warnings from U.S. and Western intelligence officials, who have said Russia views Syria as an opportunity to reassert Moscow's central place on the world stage. It also echoes concerns laid out in the most recent U.S. National Security Strategy, which called Russia a ""revisionist power"" intent on tearing down the current international order. ""It is clear that Russia's interests in Syria are Russia's interests and not those of the wider international community,"" Votel said. ""Their role is incredibly destabilizing at this point."" But the general's words may also reflect a growing disconnect with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has often sought to emphasize areas of cooperation. While administration officials say there are areas in which Russian activity is impinging on U.S. interests, and in which the U.S. is pushing back, they say the Middle East is not one of them. ""Is there a threat to us, a direct threat to us from Russia emanating from the Middle East? Obviously, the threat there is the terrorist threat and Iran,"" a senior administration official said recently on the condition of anonymity. Blaming Russia In Syria, the U.S. and Russia have found themselves on different sides of the ongoing Syrian conflict, with Moscow backing the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S. backing the Syrian Democratic Forces, a group of moderate rebels, who have until recently largely been focused on efforts to defeat the Islamic State terror group. Both Washington and Moscow have made concerted efforts to avoid conflict, setting up a deconfliction line in order to make sure their forces on the ground in Syria did not engage each other by mistake. Still, Central Command's Votel said Russia's actions in Syria are actively undermining efforts to roll back IS and, ultimately, find a political solution to the larger conflict. ""Russia has placed this progress at risk with their activities which are not focused on defeating ISIS but rather on preserving its own influence and control over the outcome,"" Votel said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Votel also criticized Russia for its failure to follow through on its self-declared ""humanitarian pause"" in Syria's eastern region of Ghouta on Tuesday. Residents said at least six civilians were killed after just a brief pause in fighting, when Syrian government warplanes resumed their bombing of the region. Russian officials blamed the resumption of fighting on rebel groups, but the U.S. State Department put the blame on Moscow. ""They're not adhering to the cease-fire because they continue to sponsor and back Bashar al-Assad's government. That is tragic,"" the State Department's Heather Nauert told reporters. In his testimony Tuesday before the House Armed Services Committee, U.S. Central Command's Votel was equally blunt. ""Either Russia has to admit it is not capable or that it doesn't want to play a role in ending the Syrian conflict,"" Votel said. 'Clever game' There are also concerns Russia is increasingly willing to use proxies and allies in Syria and across the Middle East to confront the U.S. as part of a larger, great power competition with the U.S. Earlier this month, pro-Assad forces attacked U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in Syria. U.S. defense officials have refused to comment on who directed the attack. But audio recordings obtained from a source close to Kremlin by Polygraph.info, a fact-checking project by Voice of America, indicate some of the forces were part of CHVK Wagner, a Kremlin-linked private military company. Analysts also see Russia's hand in Turkey's decision to launch an incursion into the Afrin region of northern Syria last month. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said at the time that Ankara had a deal with Moscow, and Russian media reported Russian troops in the area had withdrawn prior to the incursion. ""Russia's played a very clever game here by being the newfound friend of Erdogan,"" said Luke Coffey, a former British defense adviser now with the Washington-based Heritage Foundation. ""Then, of course, you throw Iran into this and [Syria's] Assad and you see this sort of deadly cocktail that is present that makes it more difficult for the U.S. to act and act in a coherent and strategic manner."" Top U.S. defense officials, like Votel, worry that with Moscow's help, the stage is being set for more and bigger problems. ""Russia is a party to this and they have responsibilities to ensure that the tractable partners that may be in this area are under control,"" he said Tuesday. Still, there are those who worry that as long as Trump administration officials are more focused on terrorist groups like IS and al-Qaida, and on Iran, Russia has the upper hand. ""We never saw what's happening in Syria as a [great power] competition, but [Russian President Vladimir] Putin always did,"" said Anna Borshchevskaya, a fellow specializing in Russian Middle East policy at The Washington Institute. ""We basically ceded Syria to him without even realizing it,"" she said. ""With dictators, you always have to show strength. Putin will push until someone pushes back.""","Voice of America US Calls Out Russia for Playing 'Arsonist and Firefighter' in Syria Voice of America A top U.S. general is accusing Russia of sowing the seeds of instability in Syria and across the greater Middle East, part of an ongoing attempt to expand it…",2018-02-28T03:04:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Voanews.com'}",US Calls Out Russia for Playing 'Arsonist and Firefighter' in Syria - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-calls-out-russia-arsonist-firefighter-syria/4273815.html,https://gdb.voanews.com/EC4FE2A9-5305-4AA8-8F54-3255627AF949_cx12_cy11_cw80_w1200_r1_s.jpg,,Voanews.com,arsonist,1

PTI,"Washington : The Pakistani Army is the arsonist in Afghanistan which also wants to be part of the fire brigade, a former top Pakistani diplomat has said. The remarks by Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's former Ambassador to the US, came as several American experts highlighted the role of the Army in the country's decision. Haqqani said Pakistan was an ally of convenience during the Cold War, but Pakistan's main objective to compete with India has never been an American objective. ""Therefore, American and Pakistani interests in the region don't really coincide,"" Haqqani said. ""Another objective gets undermined as well, and that is that America, at some point, wants to leave that region, and it wants to hand over authority to a strong and stable Afghanistan government, which is not constantly confronted by the Taliban on a daily basis,"" he told Cipher Brief. ""The problem is that the Pakistani military also sustains the very Taliban who it tells the Americans it will help fight. They are the arsonist and also want to be part of the fire brigade. That is the real complication,"" he said.

"Palm Springs Desert Sun, Christopher Damien, Palm Springs Desert Sun","Cranston Fire suspect defense lawyer, Joseph V. Camarata gives a statement after arraignment on Friday, July 27, 2018.
 Palm Springs Desert Sun
PALM SPRINGS, Calif.   Brandon McGlover, the man accused of igniting the Cranston Fire in July 2018, changed his plea in the case from not guilty to guilty Thursday.
The change in plea comes after a preliminary hearing in November that revealed eyewitness evidence and CAL FIRE investigative materials alleging he used a BBQ lighter and a can of WD-40 to lite the nine fires that tore across 13,000 acres near Idyllwild, Anza and Sage.
He pleaded guilty to two charges of arson of wildland and one enhancement of multiple destroyed structures. McGlover initially faced one count of damage to five or more inhabited structures, nine counts of arson for uninhabited structures and five counts of arson for inhabited structures. 
McGlover was sentenced by Riverside County Superior Court Judge Kelly Hansen to 12 years and four months in prison and is required to register as an arsonist for the rest of his life, the judge said. He will also be responsible for paying restitution to victims.
Daniel Fox, a Riverside County Deputy District Attorney, read victim statements during McGlovers sentencing. Andrea Bond, one of the victims, described living in constant anxiety since the fire destroyed her home and belongings, like her sons birth announcement and her mothers hand-made Christmas ornaments.
Alta Kavanaugh, another victim, described the heart-wrenching loss of the cabin she purchased on a teachers salary and lost in the fire. It was her prized possession, she wrote, and insurance denied reimbursing her for the loss. 
Fox gave the final victim statement from memory. The victim, he said, was too upset to put it in writing.
Jeanine Munson and her husband, Tim Hammons, lived in the woods near Idyllwild for more than two decades, Fox said. When told to evacuate the fire area, they gathered what belongings they could and raced down the hill toward Hemet. During the drive, Hammons suffered a massive heart attack and died three days later.

Ms. Munson wants the court to know that she holds McGlover accountable for the death of her husband, Fox told the judge. 
McGlover, 33 of Temecula, was arrested on July 25, 2018 on the same afternoon the fires broke out. He was held on $3.5 million bail since July.
Over a three-day hearing in November, the Riverside County District Attorney painted a picture of McGlover intentionally and maliciously starting fires on the morning of July 25, 2018, in the sparsely populated forest near Hemet.
Investigators say he was armed with a BBQ lighter and cans of WD-40, driving across an area of more than 70 miles, over two and a half hours, ultimately setting nine separate fires.
At the Nov. 16 hearing, Captain Greg Ewing, a CAL FIRE investigator and a main witness in the case, testified that his investigation pointed to McGlover, based on patterns in the locations of the nine fires, how they were set, witness testimony from the 911 calls and investigator interviews, and the contents of the suspects car when he was arrested.

Ewing was one of four CAL FIRE investigators who, over the course of the hearing, testified that five fires were ignited on the hot summer morning along Wilson Valley Road and Sage Road in the rural area near the towns of Aguanga and Sage, followed by a second group of four fires along Highway 74.
The investigators determined all the fires were ignited by a lighter, but Ewings investigation connected each one.Each fire was started on the roadside, immediately adjacent to the road, Ewing said. Fires were ignited on both sides of the road. They were ignited with a handheld open flame device and they were ignited in two clusters in a linear pattern.
Brandon McGlover, 32, of Temecula, Calif. appears in court for arraignment. He is charged with 15 felony counts for setting nine fires, including the Cranston Fire.
 (Photo11: Richard Lui/The Desert Sun)
The first report of a fire on Wilson Valley Road was a 911 call just before 9:30 a.m., Ewing said, and the last report, in the first set of fires, was called in at 9:50 a.m. 
What happened in between was a chaotic mixture of firefighters spotting fires while fighting other fires and more 911 calls reporting more fires. Drivers calling in the fires had trouble giving the exact locations of where they were or where exactly the fires were burning, Ewing testified. 
Another witness, Peter Devries, testified during the Nov. 16 hearing that he saw a white car dart out from a clearing where a fire was burning just off of Sage Road, the last in the Wilson Valley Road group of fires. 
Then at 11:37 a.m. a 911 caller reported another fire along Highway 74. Three women who had been driving home together from their work in Idyllwild to their homes in Wildomar testified that they observed McGlover near his white car at one of the fires on Highway 74, then pulled over to call 911. 
The three testified they saw McGlover and his car again by another fire after they got on the road again, concluding that he must have passed them while they were stopped. The second time they saw him, they chased him to get his license plate number to report to the police.
Last SlideNext Slide
McGlover was pulled over by Detective Troncale of the Hemet Police Department, who testified that he spotted McGlovers car in Hemet near State Street and Domenigoni Parkway after a law enforcement advisory was sent out saying to arrest him if spotted.
Ewing arrived at the scene of the traffic stop within ten minutes to arrest McGlover. 
Ewing searched McGlovers car and found three lighters, along with two cans of WD-40 lubricant and a receipt showing that one can of WD-40 had been purchased at a Walmart in San Jacinto at 11:02 a.m. between when the first and second sets of 911 calls were made.

Ewing said the WD-40 could be used in combination with the lighters to shoot flame onto the brush and ignite the fires.
The Cranston Fire cost $23 million to contain, Ewing said. And by the time it was extinguished, the fire consumed approximately 13,000 acres, prompted the evacuation of more than 7,000 people and destroyed seven homes.
Joseph Camarata, McGlovers attorney, said during sentencing that his client offered his deepest sympathies to all those impacted by the fire he started. But when the judge asked if McGlover wanted to speak, he declined. 
Before McGlover was taken out of the courtroom, Camarata said he had one last request. His parents, who were present, asked if they could give their son a hug before he was transported into the custody of the state prison system. 
The judge denied the request and the courts deputy led McGlover out of the room quietly.

Kaitlyn Schwers,"The owner of an Independence gold-buying business is charged in federal court with conspiring to burn down a rival’s storefront along with a house belonging to another man. The business owner was identified as William “Bill” Joseph Reneau in a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Missouri. He owns Gold Rush Exchange, which has two locations in Independence. Reneau, 41, was charged Wednesday with one count of conspiracy to commit arson after federal prosecutors said he paid others to damage and burn Bobby Jackson’s Trading Company, a business operated by Reneau’s former employee, as well as a house owned by his wife’s ex-husband. Court records said it appeared Reneau’s actions were driven by “personal grievances.” It started last year when Reneau allegedly paid someone $800 to damage Bobby Jackson’s Trading in Independence, according to court records. On July 17, 2017, a stolen Jeep was driven into the building in the 300 block of East 23rd Street, damaging the exterior. Police later found the Jeep unoccupied, but still running, with parts of the building attached to the vehicle. Then, on Aug. 4, 2017, police said it appeared someone poured gasoline around the business and started a fire near the front door and windows, causing $5,000 in damage. More recently, on Aug. 13, authorities responded to another fire — this time at an unoccupied house in the 1200 block of South Ranson Street. The fire started on the back deck of the home. Police found a partially burned rug that smelled of gasoline and a melted plastic gasoline container. They also found a set of car keys on the ground at the foot of the stairs leading to the deck. Police determined the keys belonged to a Pontiac G6 which was abandoned a street over from the home. Police interviewed the car’s owner, who allegedly told them he started the fire at the house and lost his car keys in the process. The man told authorities the store manager of Gold Rush Exchange had hired him on Reneau’s behalf to burn down the home, court records said. Prosecutors allege Reneau had paid the man $500 to set the fire. Court records said the man was also asked to burn Bobby Jackson’s Trading, but he backed out. Reneau was arrested on unrelated charges in Buchanan County on Aug. 23. A court date has not yet been scheduled.","Kansas City Star Feds: Independence gold trader paid arsonist to burn rival business Kansas City Star Reneau, 41, was charged Wednesday with one count of conspiracy to commit arson after federal prosecutors said he paid others to damage and burn Bobby Jackson…",2018-08-30T13:58:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kansascity.com'}",Feds: Independence gold trader paid arsonist to burn rival business - Kansas City Star,https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article217553245.html,https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/oqayte/picture217558550/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/William%20Renea_fitted.jpeg,,Kansascity.com,arsonist,1
Tarini Parti,"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was officially sworn in this week and has already been presiding over oral arguments, but President Donald Trump is not ready to let his confirmation battle go. Trump has brought up the judge repeatedly before cheering crowds at rallies and in his public comments over the last two weeks, casting Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault, as a ""flawless"" man who was under attack by Democrats and the ""angry, left-wing mob."" As he takes a victory lap, his comments have become much more aggressive than they were during the confirmation process, when he initially refrained from attacking Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, who testified that the judge sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. Although Kavanaugh's nomination process has galvanized both the right and the left, in the areas where Trump is campaigning mostly states he won in 2016 where Democrats are now defending 10 Senate seats and some governorships Republicans are counting on the political divide to favor their side in pushing Trump supporters to the polls. The backlash from women and moderates, however, could further hurt Republicans in swing districts, where House Republicans have been to keep races local and away from Trump. ""If Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, just imagine the devastation they would cause if the obtained the power the so desperately want,"" Trump said at a rally in Kansas on Saturday, immediately after Kavanaugh's confirmation vote. The president was campaigning for Kris Kobach, one of his most loyal allies who is in a tight race for governor. ""You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't hand power to a angry, left-wing mob, and that's what they have become,"" Trump said, a line he later repeated at a rally in Iowa. Ahead of a White House swearing in ceremony for Kavanaugh on Monday, Trump took his rhetoric a step further, telling reporters the allegations against his nominee were a ""hoax set up by the Democrats."" In a speech later that day to the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Orlando, Trump again brought up Kavanaugh. False charge. False accusations. Horrible statements, he said as the crowd cheered. It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil and he toughed it out and we toughed it out together. He went on to claim Kavanaugh had been ""proven innocent"" during his swearing-in ceremony at the White House that was largely symbolic since the judge had already been sworn in on Saturday. And on Tuesday, Kavanaughs first day on the bench, Trump opened his rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, with the same topic, claiming that Democrats' handling of the Kavanaugh allegations was a ""national disgrace."" Encouraging his supporters to vote for Republicans, Trump also said that Kavanaugh was still not safe from Democrats' attacks, calling the party ""unhinged"" and ""wacko"" in its ""lust for power."" ""Last week, they were saying, well impeach him. Impeach him for what?"" Trump also attacked Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, claiming without evidence she had leaked Ford's confidential letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh. As the crowd chanted ""Lock her up!,"" which Trump supporters typically shout in response to former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump said: ""Did she leak it? 100 percent."" Ben Ray, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Trumps use of the Supreme Court fight on the campaign trail shows that the other issues Republicans were messaging on tax reform and health care were not working. They're really having to grasp at straws right now to bail themselves out before the election, Ray said. If they want to attach themselves to the least popular Supreme Court nominee turned Supreme Court justice ever, fine. Trump hit on those policy issues and others Wednesday night during a rally in Erie, Pa., but the Kavanaugh battle after some words about Hurricane Michaels landfall earlier that day in the Florida panhandle was still his leadoff topic. The audience inside the Erie Insurance Arena cheered loudly during Trumps victory lap over Kavanaughs messy confirmation. What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a massive disgrace, the president said to prolonged boos. Disgrace. What they did was a disgrace. Look at Cory Booker you look at Sen. Dianne Feinstein the disgraceful behavior, the disgraceful leaking of documents, you look at what they did. You look at the false charges, you look at the false accusations, it was a disgrace. On Nov. 6, Trump continued, you can vote to reject the Democrats shameful conduct by electing [a] Republican House and a Republican Senate. Rep. Lou Barletta, a Trump-backed candidate facing an uphill battle to unseat Democratic Sen. Bob Casey this fall, piggybacked off Trumps comments later at the event. If you dont like the way that Justice Kavanaugh has been treated, Barletta said, then you cant reward Bob Casey by sending him back to Washington. Though the Supreme Court was a crowd-pleasing subject, as Trumps supporters waited outside in line before the rally, few who spoke with BuzzFeed News mentioned it as a motivating issue. (Most emphasized state and local issues, such as taxes and road and infrastructure projects.) One exception was Vince Friscarella, a New Alexandria man who described himself as a past Democratic voter who voted for Trump in 2016 and now, because of the Kavanaugh hearings, will never vote for a Democrat again as long as I live. It was clear hed been listening to the president on the matter in recent days. The way they treated Kavanaugh, Friscarella said, that was a total disgrace by our government.

Police are investigating a fire at a California mosque as an arson and possible hate crime after a note was discovered that mentioned the recent shootings at two New Zealand mosques, authorities said.
Escondido police and fire authorities received a call around 3:15 a.m. Sunday about a fire at the Islamic Center of Escondido, north of San Diego, said Escondido police Lt. Chris Lick, a department spokesman told CNN affiliate KGTV. Several people in the mosque came outside and extinguished the fire before authorities arrived, Lick said. The fire damaged the exterior of the building, police said.
The note was found in the area of the mosque parking lot, Lick said. Police don't have a suspect, he said.
""At this time, we're just going to leave it as it was a reference to the New Zealand shooting,"" he said.
Escondido police have been doing extra patrols in the area since the shootings at the mosques on March 15 in Christchurch, New Zealand, according to Lick.
New Zealand officials said a self-avowed white supremacist killed 50 people at Al Noor and Lindwood mosques in Christchurch.
""Everybody should remain absolutely vigilant and watchful over their prayer centers,"" Lick said
Yusef Miller, a member of Escondido's Islamic community, encouraged fellow Muslims ""to make sure you're hypervigilant.""
""It was especially alarming to have it happen this morning, and everybody is on edge here today,"" Miller said. ""Given what's been going on around the nation, around the world, we're not too surprised. We try to stay vigilant, but this can happen to anyone anywhere.""
Miller said local Muslims were already on high alert after the New Zealand shootings.
He said when the note made a connection to New Zealand, ""It gave us more of a mortal fear that something might happen that's outlandish.""",Note referencing New Zealand found at Calif. mosque fire KTVZ California mosque arsonist leaves note referencing New Zealand shootings New York Post Suspect of Possible Arson Attack at Escondido Mosque Leaves Note Referencing New Zealand Terrorist Attacks NBC…,2019-03-24T22:11:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ktvz.com'}",Note referencing New Zealand found at Calif. mosque fire - KTVZ,https://www.ktvz.com/news/national-world/note-referencing-new-zealand-found-at-calif-mosque-fire/1062181548,https://static.lakana.com/npg-global-us-east-1/photo/2019/03/24/Mosque%20fire%20California_1553464785092.jpg.jpg.jpg_37839142_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg,,Ktvz.com,arsonist,1

He died of his injuries after being taken to hospital following the blaze that broke out on Thursday afternoon. The fire destroyed more than 500 shacks, leaving hundreds homeless. Police are yet to determine the cause. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani says vigilante killings are common in poor areas where crime is often high and communities feel frustrated with the police. The densely populated township of Alexandra is north of the city of Johannesburg Although it right by the affluent Sandton neighbourhood, which is known as Africa's richest square mile, poverty and unemployment are high there, our reporter says. One eyewitness, who posted a video of the inferno on social media, shared a theory that the fire had broken out because of a fight. Many people were at work when the blaze started out on Thursday. No other deaths or injuries have been reported. Image copyright Eyewitness News Fire fighters attended the scene but struggled to contain the blaze. Johannesburg Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Nana Radebe told eNCA TV channel, "" We don't have hydrants in this area."" Water in fire engines only lasts four minutes, so access to water hydrants was essential, she said, adding that residents had built over those installed for factories that were once in the area. The water pressure in one available hydrant was so low it could not be used and a water tanker had to be brought in, Ms Radebe said. Image copyright Eyewitness News An aid worker told South Africa's TimesLIVE that 690 shacks had been destroyed, affecting 2,000 people, including a woman who had given birth on Thursday. ""We found her sitting on the side of the road. She lost everything,"" Emily Thomas of Gift for Givers was quoted as saying.

Karl Bode,"After having just successfully convinced the Trump administration to neuter state and federal oversight of lumbering telecom monopolies, those same companies continue their unyielding call for greater regulation of Silicon Valley. If you've been paying attention, you'll know that Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon's attack on net neutrality rules was just the tip of a massive, dysfunctional iceberg. Those companies have also convinced the Trump administration to effectively neuter FCC authority over ISPs, and are in the process of trying to ban states from protecting consumers from wrongdoing as well (you know, for freedom or whatever). With neither competition nor even tepid meaningful oversight in place, the kind of bad behavior we've long seen from Comcast appears poised to only get worse. At the same time, top lobbyists for the telecom industry continue to insist it's Silicon Valley giants that are in need of massive regulation. You're to ignore, of course, that these calls are coming just as giants like Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Comcast try to pivot more fully from broadband into online video and advertising, in direct competition with the companies' they're calling to have heavily regulated. Former FCC boss Mike Powell, now the cable industry's top lobbyist over at the NCTA, has been leading this charge for much of the last year or two. Powell was back last week at an industry event insisting once again that government needs to step in and start heavily regulating the companies Powell's clients are trying to compete with: ""I think there is a fundamental underappreciation in policy circles about the extraordinary power of the platforms and the data that rides on these companies and value of that information both as a competitive advantage as a platform and the potential dangers to consumers. That has always been a naive concept and one that I think government was entirely inattentive to for too long, only to wake up in 2018 to realize there are some consequences that are not necessarily affirmative."" Powell's of course trying to play up Silicon Valley's admitted and obvious naivete as it pertains to aiding the amplification of propaganda and racist drivel. But at the same time, of course, he's happy to ignore all of the obvious problems caused by his own sector's growing competition issues, which Powell will be happy to tell you don't exist. In fact back in March Powell gave a very similar speech during which he effectively accused Silicon Valley of most of the things the telecom sector has been doing for years: ""Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy. For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging. They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle."" While it's obvious that Silicon Valley has plenty of problems that need addressing, listening to Powell's advice (read: Comcast's advice) on these subjects is like getting fire safety advice from a serial arsonist. But for whatever reason it's advice that's clearly resonating in the Trump administration, which pretty consistently has called for antitrust inquiries into major Silicon Valley giants while neutering most meaningful consumer protections (from privacy to net neutrality) governing some of the most clearly anti-competitive and unpopular companies in all of American industry.","After having just successfully convinced the Trump administration to neuter state and federal oversight of lumbering telecom monopolies, those same companies continue their unyielding call for greater regulation of Silicon Valley.

Daniel Malloy,"So much of Donald Trumps political rhetoric has centered on Americas southern border, where he has cracked down on immigrants and pledged a big, beautiful wall that his supporters are still waiting on. But the road to success in the midterm elections may well run along the worlds longest border between two countries the U.S.-Canada divide. A handful of competitive House races and two pivotal Senate contests touch the border. Mondays announcement of a new dont-call-it-NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico may yet prove to be the weeks most politically consequential moment. Yes, the dramatic installation of Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court will shape American law for decades and has, for now, awakened an own-the-libs backlash to how Democrats handled sexual assault allegations against the judge during his confirmation hearings. But by Election Day, the culture wars will have fresh kindling. Meanwhile, the USMCA (short for United States Mexico Canada Agreement, a silly rebranding that few will use) hits important voters in the pocketbook. In striking a deal at last with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau despite their frosty relationship, Trumps success comes in part because of what didnt happen: a full withdrawal from NAFTA, grinding supply chains to a halt. That strikes me as the arsonist taking credit for not burning down your house, quipped Scott Lincicome, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, to National Public Radio, and hes got a point. Aspects of the deal which likely goes before Congress next year for ratification that touch on intellectual property and digital trade mirror the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that Trump chucked out the window upon taking office, so much of this is status quo from President Barack Obama. But because Trump seemed willing to shoot the hostage and kill what hes called perhaps the worst trade deal ever made, he was able to wring key concessions for U.S. workers in the auto industry. By late in the week, executives from BMW and Daimler AG told reporters they were considering relocating more production to North America because of the new deal, with The Wall Street Journal reporting that more automakers were likely to follow. The result may well be more expensive cars the deal requires more cars to be made with higher priced labor but Trumps trade ethos is that employing more Americans in key industries is worth the cost trade-offs. The economy continues to go gangbusters, with unemployment now reaching its lowest level since 1969 at 3.7 percent. But those gains remain unevenly distributed, just as they were under Obama when the forgotten men and women Trump often spoke to were drawn toward a disruptive presidential candidate. Health care costs are still rising faster than wages. Trumps multifront trade war has made much of his own party wary. In critical states such as Missouri and North Dakota, Republican Senate candidates had to tiptoe around trade. Now, they can point to a benefit and a potential end game to Trumps economic escalations with China that have rocked farm states. The president, thus, is further emboldened to take on the European Union, China and whoever else. By the way, without tariffs, we wouldnt be talking about a deal, just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs that includes Congress, Trump said in the Rose Garden on Monday, willing as always to play the rhetorical arsonist.",President Trump struck a deal with Canada that may prove more politically consequential than Kavanaugh.,2018-10-07T04:20:44Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ozy.com'}","Donald Dossier: NAFTA, Better Known as Trump's Midterm Boost",https://www.ozy.com/opinion/donald-dossier-nafta-better-known-as-trumps-midterm-boost/89814,https://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/1500xany/6/2/3/131623_gettyimages1024541874.png,,Ozy.com,arsonist,1

Rauher Kulm is a small basalt mountain, so it makes for a lovely hike to the top. Trekking up the observation tower reveals beautiful views of the lush landscape speckled with quaint villages. The looming 82-foot-tall observation tower that stands atop the summit today wasn’t the first tower built on the mountain. The original one was built in the early 1800s and boasted a gilded sun. By the end of the 19th century, this first version became too dilapidated and a newer model was erected in its place. The most recent tower was erected in the late 1980s after an arsonist set a previous one ablaze. A stoic castle crowned the mountain during the Middle Ages. But sadly, the fortress was destroyed during the Second Margrave War of the 1500s. Some of the old walls still stand on the mountain, though they’re all that remain.","Stand at the top of this mountain’s observation tower, and you’ll be rewarded with sprawling vistas of Bavaria’s forests and countryside.

Terry Firma,"On Friday, a serial arsonist torched another Jehovah’s Witnesses Kingdom Hall in Thurston County, Washington. It was the fourth in-county arson attack on a JW building since the string of incidents began back in March. Also, in mid-May, a Kingdom Hall in Yelm was hit by more than 30 rounds from a rifle. No one has been hurt so far, but the damage is considerable, and Jehovah’s Witnesses in Washington are understandably beginning to feel more than a little besieged. Yesterday, on CNN, county sheriff John Snaza (pictured below) was quoted as follows: … it’s sickening to think of someone attacking houses of worship out of “ some sort of animosity towards any religion.” If I’m understanding him correctly, he’s essentially saying that there may be a militant atheist at work here. Unless Snaza has a solid lead that would prove any such thing, he might do better to stop shooting off his mouth for now. His theory is possible, of course, but is it plausible ? If someone who is hostile “toward any religion” started to burn down houses of worship, why would he or she target only one religion — and why a marginal one like Jehovah’s Witnesses, which represents just 0.8 percent of the U.S. population? It seems way more likely that the perp has it in for Jehovah’s Witnesses in particular, to the exclusion of other faiths (thus far anyway). This suggests either a disenfranchised current member or someone who has been disfellowshipped or who left in disgust voluntarily. Pure and simple, the arson and the gunfire amount to domestic terrorism and deserve everyone’s straight-up condemnation — regardless of the attacker’s religious feelings, or lack thereof.

Daniel Larison,"Secretary Mattis’ case for supporting the war on Yemen earlier this month was remarkably weak, and his praise for Saudi Arabia this week is obnoxious: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is applauding Saudi Arabia for its humanitarian aid to war-torn Yemen. Specifically, Mattis said, “Your significant amounts of humanitarian aid is critical to helping the innocent caught up in this conflict (and) we applaud you for that.” The Saudi “aid” efforts are not what they seem, and Mattis is wrong to applaud them. Even if the Saudi-led coalition were making a sincere effort to mitigate the worst consequences of their war, the aid they have provided is a pittance compared to the enormous humanitarian crisis that their policies have created. The amounts of aid are not all that significant, and they are woefully inadequate when weighed against depriving the civilian population of essential goods by blockading the main ports in the north. The Saudis and their allies have it within their power to ameliorate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis significantly, but they have to give up their blockade to do so. Until they do that, any “aid” is being done for the sake of appearances at best and at worst it is a deliberate distraction from their cruel policy of starving Yemen. Unfortunately, the coalition has not been making a good faith effort to alleviate the suffering of most Yemen’s people. Instead they have maintained a blockade that has created conditions for famine and cholera, and that blockade is still in place today. Mattis is quoted as saying that the Saudis are “part of the solution,” but the truth is that they are a principal cause of Yemen’s current problems. Praising the Saudis for their “aid” efforts in Yemen is akin to applauding the arsonist because he offers his victims a bucket to put out the fire that he set. It is ridiculous, but worse than that it gives the perpetrator a pass on his much larger crimes. Mattis went on to say that “we are going to end this war and that “we are going to end it on positive terms for the people of Yemen.” There was an opportunity to move towards ending the war earlier this week by cutting off U.S. military assistance to the coalition, but Mattis opposed the resolution that would do that. The people of Yemen desperately need peace, but unless the war is brought to an immediately it is difficult to see how it could end “on positive terms for the people of Yemen.” The best thing that Mattis and the Trump administration could do is to demand an end to the blockade and insist on a cease-fire by coalition and coalition-backed forces, and that could create an opening for a more permanent negotiated settlement. At the very least, it would offer the civilian population some relief. Until they do that, the war will drag on with U.S. backing and the people of Yemen will continue suffering grievously.","Praising the Saudis for their ""aid"" efforts in Yemen is akin to applauding the arsonist because he offers his victims a bucket to put out the fire that he set.",2018-03-22T19:09:04Z,"{'id': 'the-american-conservative', 'name': 'The American Conservative'}",Don’t Applaud the Saudi Arsonist for ‘Aiding’ Yemen,http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/dont-applaud-the-saudi-arsonist-for-aiding-yemen/,http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/salman-mattis.jpg,the-american-conservative,The American Conservative,arsonist,1
By William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),"Federal prosecutors have charged a California man with starting a fire last month at Comet Ping Pong, the Washington pizzeria at the center of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.
Police had been looking for the suspected arsonist since Jan. 23, when a man set a curtain at the pizzeria on fire with matches and lighter fluid. Comet Ping Pong has been the subject of conspiracy theories alleging that Hillary Clinton and other top Democratic officials conduct Satanic pedophile orgies in its non-existent basement.
Arson suspect Ryan Rimas Jaselskis, 22, came to police attention weeks after the fire, when he jumped the construction barrier surrounding the Washington monument on Feb. 4, according to court filings. After two Park Police police officers tried to arrest him, Jaselskis started fighting them, giving one officer a bloody nose in a brawl that was captured on video. 
After being released from jail, Jaselskis tried to break into the monument again a day later and was arrested again. 
In both incidents, Jaselskis was wearing a blue jacket identical to one the the Comet Ping Pong arsonist was wearing on surveillance videos, which prompted law enforcement officers to investigate whether Jaselskis was also behind the arsons. Security cameras reviewed by police after Jaselskis arrest captured his car near Comet Ping Pong around the time of the arson. 
Its not clear why Jaselskis started the fires, or why he attempted to break into the Washington Monument. 
The January arson attack was the latest bizarre incident at Comet Ping Pong, which has experienced harassment and worse from Pizzagate believers over the past two years. 
In Dec. 2016, a North Carolina man traveled to the restaurant and fired a gun. While Pizzagate has died down since amid legal threats against conspiracy theorists promoting the conspiracy theory, it continues to win adherents as part of the larger QAnon conspiracy theory.","Matt McClain/Getty Federal prosecutors have charged a California man with starting a fire last month at Comet Ping Pong, the Washington pizzeria at the center of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Pool Image caption Trump's cabinet had its first official meeting on 13 March Meet President Donald Trump's inner circle and cabinet. Vice-President Mike Pence The former Indiana governor is a favourite among social conservatives and boasts considerable experience in Washington. Mr Pence was raised Roman Catholic along with his five siblings in Columbus, Indiana, and says he was inspired by liberal icons John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. He is known for his staunch opposition to abortion, signing a bill to ban abortion in Indiana on the basis of disability, gender or race of the foetus. Media caption What does Vice-President Mike Pence believe? He has said he would favour overturning a 1973 Supreme Court judgement, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case, which bars the US government from prohibiting abortions. Women's rights advocates have mounted online campaigns against his views, including asking people to call his office to tell them about their periods or to make donations to family-planning organisations in Mr Pence's name. He served as the chair of the House Republican Conference, the third highest-ranking Republican leadership position. He also chaired the Republican Study Group, a coalition of conservative House Republicans, which could give him a boost with some evangelicals of the party that have questioned Mr Trump's ideological purity, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says. Who is Mike Pence? THE AIDES John Kelly - Chief of Staff Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US Marine Corps General John Kelly has four decades of military experience The president initially nominated the retired Marine General to oversee Homeland Security before promoting him to chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus. Mr Kelly was a key influence on the decision to fire the director of communications, Anthony Scaramucci, after just 10 days in office. The former four-star general, whose military career spans four decades, quit as head of the military's Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, to join the Trump administration. Mr Kelly is the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His son Robert, a first lieutenant in the Marines, was killed in combat when he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan in 2010. The seasoned commander had previously clashed with the Obama administration on illegal immigration at the US-Mexican border. HR McMaster - National Security Adviser Image copyright Reuters Image caption HR McMaster A lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job because he misled Vice-President Pence about his calls with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he ""might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker"". He is no stranger to questioning authority. In a 2014 interview, he said: ""The commanders that I've worked for, they want frank assessments, they want criticism and feedback."" Who is Herbert Raymond McMaster? Stephen Miller - Senior policy adviser Mr Miller was a top aide to Jeff Sessions before he joined the Trump campaign. He often warmed up crowds before Mr Trump took the stage at rallies on the campaign trail and was subsequently named the national policy director for Mr Trump's transition team. He also served as the campaign's chief speechwriter. Image copyright AFP As a senior adviser, Mr Miller manages White House policy staff, speechwriting functions and ensures the implementation of the president-elect's policy. ""He is deeply committed to the America First agenda, and understands the policies and actions necessary to put that agenda into effect,"" Mr Trump said. A combative interview with CNN's Jake Tapper ended prematurely when the CNN host lost patience. Kellyanne Conway - Counsellor to the President Image copyright Reuters The Republican strategist and veteran pollster serves as the highest-ranking woman in the White House after having earlier been considered for the role of press secretary. ""She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message,"" Mr Trump said. The mother of four was promoted as Mr Trump's third campaign manager in August 2016 as part of another staff shake-up after the Republican convention. She has been praised as the ""Trump whisperer"" and became the first woman to run a successful US presidential campaign. THE FAMILY Melania Trump A former model born in Slovenia, Melania married Donald Trump in January 2005. Image copyright AFP Image caption Melania has been married to Mr Trump since 2005 and they have one son She has stood by her husband despite reports of his infidelities, alleged sexual assaults, and campaign revelations that he boasted about groping women. In July 2016 she made headlines after making a speech at the Republican National Convention, which she was accused of having plagiarised from one made by Michelle Obama in 2008. In an October interview with CNN, she was asked what she would change about her husband. She replied: ""His tweeting"". She stayed in New York with their son Barron until he finished his school term, before formally moving into the White House in June 2017. Media caption What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia? The new first lady Ivanka Trump Perhaps the best-known of Donald Trump's children, the only daughter of his marriage to Ivana, his first wife. A model in her early years, she was a vice-president at The Trump Organization, before stepping down when her father became president. She also launched her eponymous fashion line and was also a judge on her father's reality TV show The Apprentice. Image copyright Reuters Her brother Donald Junior says Ivanka is the favourite child and is referred to as ""Daddy's little girl"". She was given a level of authority in the family business that none of his wives ever had and is said to have handled some of the company's biggest deals. Since Mr Trump became president, she has regularly been seen at his side. She, rather than the first lady, travelled with him to an air base in early February 2017 to mark the return of the body of a soldier killed in a raid in Yemen. She joined her father's administration as an unpaid aide with the title Adviser to the President, and has her own office in the West Wing of the White House. After her father became president, Ivanka said she had resigned from her signature apparel and accessories brand. She converted to Judaism after marrying Jared Kushner in 2009. America's other First Lady? Jared Kushner Mr Trump's media-shy son-in-law is the son of a prominent New York property developer and is married to Ivanka Trump. Mr Kushner arrived at the White House with the broadest of briefs and has come out on top of several rounds of infighting in the West Wing. But he increasingly faces a battle for relevance - stripped of his top-level security clearance and locked in a power struggle. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump smile for the camera at Donald Trump's presidential victory party It emerged that Mr Kushner had attempted to arrange a communications backchannel with Russia during the presidential transition. But Mr Kushner denies any suggestion of collusion with the Kremlin. He is a wealthy property developer and publisher. He owns 666 Fifth Avenue, a skyscraper a few blocks down from Trump Tower, and in 2006, aged just 25, he bought the once-venerable New York Observer newspaper. Mr Kushner was born and raised in comfort in Livingston, New Jersey, alongside two sisters and a brother. His grandparents escaped Poland during the war, arriving in the US in 1949, and his father Charles made his fortune as a New Jersey property mogul. Trump's right-hand man Donald Trump Jr Donald Trump's eldest son from his first marriage to Ivana is now executive vice-president of The Trump Organization, but had played a significant role during Mr Trump's campaign. In July 2017, it emerged that Mr Trump Jr - along with Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort - had met with a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin during Mr Trump's presidential campaign. He initially explained that the meeting was held to discuss Russian adoptions, which were suspended after the US announced sanctions on Russia in 2012. But emails showed that he decided to attend the meeting after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton. He and President Trump have since described the meeting as ""opposition research"" that any politician would engage in. Eric Trump The third child of Mr Trump's marriage to Ivana, he is also an executive vice-president of the Trump Organization. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald (L) and Eric Trump both have important roles in their father's business He is president of the Trump Winery in Virginia and oversees Trump golf clubs. In 2006, he also set up the Eric Trump Foundation, which was embroiled in a controversy over donations. THE CABINET Mike Pompeo - Secretary of State-designate Media caption Pompeo on Russia, North Korea and Trump The former hardline Republican Congressman became US spymaster as head of the CIA. Now he has been nominated to take over as America's top diplomat following Mr Trump's abrupt firing of Rex Tillerson. The three-term Tea Party Republican from Wichita, Kansas, was a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran and has defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme. He also opposes closing Guantanamo Bay and, after visiting the prison in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight. In January, he told the BBC that Russia would target the US mid-term elections. Trump's new loyalist top diplomat Steven Mnuchin - Treasury Secretary Not all of Mr Trump's supporters welcomed the idea of handing the levers of national tax policy to a consummate Wall Street insider. During his time running the OneWest bank, his business oversaw thousands of home foreclosures in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis. Mr Mnuchin amassed a fortune during his 17 years at Goldman Sachs before founding the movie production company behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise and American Sniper. Five things about Steve Mnuchin The treasury secretary found himself under investigation after he took a government-subsidised trip to Fort Knox with his Scottish wife Louis Linton, amid claims they were sightseeing. US treasury secretary's wife rues missteps James Mattis - Secretary of Defense Gen Mattis served in the Marine Corps for 44 years, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. A counterinsurgency expert, he played a key role in fighting in Falluja in 2004. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Gen Mattis retired from the military in 2013 after more than four decades of service From 2010-13 he led US Central Command, which covers an area from the Horn of Africa into Central Asia and includes all US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is known for his blunt comments. In 2005 he was criticised after saying - in reference to Afghan men who ""slap women around... because they didn't wear a veil"" - that ""it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them"". But he is also described as a popular leader, well-liked by those he commanded, and an avid reader of literature on warfare. His nicknames were warrior monk and mad dog. As Gen Mattis retired in 2013, the law that bans military officers from serving as defence chief for seven years after leaving active duty was waived. 'Warrior Monk' to head Pentagon Elaine Chao - Transportation Secretary Born in Taiwan, she became the first Asian-American woman to hold a position in a presidential cabinet when she led the Labor Department under President Bush from 2001-09. Ms Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, served as deputy secretary of transportation and director of the Peace Corps in former President George HW Bush's administration. She came to the US with her family at the age of eight and settled in New York, where her father became a shipping magnate. Jeff Sessions - Attorney General Mr Sessions had been one of Mr Trump's closest allies throughout the campaign, and his loyalty was rewarded when he became the nation's top prosecutor. But the former senator from Alabama has appeared isolated after the president said he never would have appointed him if he had known that Mr Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russian investigation. Mr Sessions later said the president's attacks were ""kinda hurtful"". Image copyright AFP Allegations of racism have dogged him throughout his career, and were raised during his confirmation hearing in the Senate. He lost out on a federal judgeship back in 1986 when former colleagues said he had used the N-word. But during the hearing, he acknowledged ""the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters"". Gina Haspel - nominated as CIA director Image copyright Office of Strategic Services Society Ms Haspel has been chosen by Mr Trump to take over from Mike Pompeo as he steps up to become secretary of state. If confirmed, she will become the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A career intelligence officer with more than 30 years' experience, she was appointed CIA deputy director last year. Controversially, she ran a prison in Thailand where suspected al-Qaeda members were tortured by waterboarding in 2002. Trump's pick as new CIA director Nikki Haley - US ambassador to the UN Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mrs Haley was critical of Mr Trump during his presidential campaign In the Republican primaries, Nikki Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, first backed Mr Rubio and later Texas Senator Ted Cruz before she finally threw her support behind Mr Trump. She was highly critical of Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, calling it ""un-American"", and also of his refusal to release tax records. Announcing her as the first woman chosen for his cabinet, Mr Trump called her ""a proven dealmaker"" who will be ""a great leader representing us on the world stage"". Nikki Haley, the Republican who took on Trump The daughter of Indian immigrants, Mrs Haley was the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial tensions. At times, she has contradicted the White House, and said ""everybody knows that Russia meddled in our elections"" despite the president's more nuanced stance. Rick Perry - Energy Secretary The former Texas governor heads an agency he proposed to eliminate during his failed 2012 presidential campaign. The former Dancing with the Stars contestant was a vocal critic of Mr Trump, calling him a ""barking carnival act"" and a ""cancer on conservatism"" before he dropped out of his second unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2015. Image copyright Getty Images As governor of Texas, Mr Perry called for lighter regulation on the oil industry and referred to the science around climate change as ""unsettled"". After being picked by Mr Trump, he stepped down from the board of directors at Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Betsy DeVos - Education Secretary A wealthy Republican Party donor and a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman, she became the second woman nominated for a cabinet position. She had however once described Mr Trump as ""an interloper"" who didn't represent the Republican Party. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Betsy DeVos has supported the Common Core education standards that Mr Trump has criticised Mrs DeVos is an advocate of Republican-favoured charter schools, which are publicly funded and set up by teachers, parents, or community groups outside the state school system. She also previously supported the Common Core education standards that Mr Trump and many conservatives have pilloried. Mr Trump called her ""a brilliant and passionate education advocate"" but she was criticised after appearing to struggle at times during her nomination hearing. Why is Betsy DeVos so unpopular? Alexander Acosta - Secretary of Labor Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Unlike other cabinet members, Acosta has a long record of government work The former Florida International University law dean has worked for the National Labor Relations Board, the Justice Department's civil rights division, and the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Before joining the Trump administration, he was chairman of the US Century Bank, the largest domestically owned Hispanic community bank in Florida. During his time serving as US Attorney in Florida, he cut a secret deal with billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, who had been accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls. The deal was criticised by lawyers representing the alleged victims, saying that the punishment was too lenient. Ryan Zinke - Secretary of the Interior The former Navy SEAL was picked to lead the agency that oversees federal land, including national parks such as Yosemite and Yellowstone. He is a former congressman for Montana, where he was raised near Glacier National Park. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Zinke spoke at the Republican convention in Ohio Mr Zinke has bucked his party on the issue of privatisation or transfer of public lands to states, which he believes should remain under federal control. Environmental advocacy groups condemned the pick, accusing Mr Zinke of being in hock to corporate polluters. Who is Ryan Zinke? Scott Pruitt - Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) boss The former Oklahoma attorney general and well-known climate change sceptic leads the federal agency tasked with protecting the environment. Mr Pruitt's appointment came as he led a 28-state effort to halt President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which aimed to limit emissions from coal-fired plants; a plan that the EPA has been in charge of enforcing. Mr Pruitt has called the EPA's work ""unlawful and overreaching"" and he has said the global warming ""debate is far from settled"". Media caption Scott Pruitt said he didn't think climate change was a 'hoax' Environmental groups said Mr Pruitt's appointment was ""like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires"". Peter Navarro - Director of Trade and Industrial Policy Mr Navarro is a top economic advisor to the president and director of the White House's Trade and Manufacturing Policy office. A staunch anti-China and pro-tariff economist, Mr Navarro was sidelined and demoted by Chief of Staff John Kelly and other free trade economists on the National Economic Council last autumn. However, the former Trump campaign advisor - an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine - still wields influence in the White House, as seen by the tariffs placed on steel and aluminium.

"USA TODAY, Susan Page, USA TODAY","As newly-confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh arrives at the Supreme Court to be sworn in as an associate justice, he was met by hundreds of protesters demonstrating on the steps of the building. (Oct. 6) AP Jane Pitz holds up a sign during the We Believe Them rally, Saturday, Oct. 6, 2018, in downtown South Bend, Ind. (Photo: Michael Caterina, South Bend Tribune, via AP) WASHINGTON Brett Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court over the weekend, far from settling the fierce debate over his confirmation, has inflamed the nation's political and cultural fissures for the midterm elections next month and well beyond. The repercussions from the most brutal battle over the high court's make-up in a generation could end up affecting all three branches of government: Which party wins control of Congress on Nov. 6, what issues define the White House contest in 2020, and whether Americans have faith in the Supreme Court not to mention the decisions that will follow from the court's new conservative majority. As senators voted on the confirmation of President Donald Trump's controversial nominee, angry protesters shouted from the gallery, ""Shame!"" Kavanaugh's lifetime appointment was approved by a narrow 50-48 vote. He was promptly sworn in at a private ceremony at the Supreme Court, and he is expected to be sitting on the bench for oral arguments Tuesday. Republicans are triumphant and Democrats enraged. ""The anger is real,"" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned on ABC's ""This Week."" But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Kavanaugh's combative and emotional response to allegations of sexual assault, and the argument that he was the victim of character assassination, had succeeded in galvanizing GOP voters in red states. The Kentucky Republican argued backlash to Democratic tactics and protests had increased the prospects that Republicans will hold control of the Senate. ""Our energy and enthusiasm was lagging behind theirs, until this,"" he said with a smile on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" More: President Trump seizes on Brett Kavanaugh confirmation as rallying cry in midterms More: Mitch McConnell's legacy is solidified with Brett Kavanaugh, but at what cost? One Democratic senator running for re-election in a state that Trump carried in 2016, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, became the only person in his party to vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination. Another Democratic incumbent running in a red state, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, acknowledged that her vote to oppose Kavanaugh had bolstered the odds that Republican challenger Rep. Kevin Cramer would defeat her on Election Day. ""The politically expedient vote here was a 'yes' vote,"" Heitkamp said on CBS' ""60 Minutes. "" Political strategists calculate that Kavanaugh's confirmation could boost Democratic efforts to gain control of the House, however, by rallying voters who believe the president and Senate Republicans refused to treat seriously women's accusations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. California professor Christine Blasey Ford alleged Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a house party when both were high school students in Maryland. Polls have shown particularly strong support for Ford among better-educated women voters, an important electoral force in suburban districts that are seen as in play this year. Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held seats to win a majority. ""Our country needs to have a reckoning on these issues, and there is only one remedy,"" Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York said on the Senate floor just before the roll call on Kavanaugh, a vote he knew his side would lose. ""Change must come from where change in America always begins: the ballot box. So to Americans, to so many millions who are outraged by what happened here, theres one answer: Vote. Trump also used the moment to rally voters to turn out in November. ""You dont hand matches to an arsonist, and you dont give power to an angry left-wing mob,"" he tweeted. ""Democrats have become too EXTREME and TOO DANGEROUS to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law - not the rule of the mob. VOTE REPUBLICAN!"" The outcome of the nomination has reinforced Trump's unchallenged standing as the leader of the Republican Party. He already has begun running for re-election in 2020. At a rally in Kansas Saturday night, he mocked his prospective Democratic challengers, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former vice president Joe Biden and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Democratic presidential hopefuls have declared their opposition to Kavanaugh's confirmation. ""I see the pain and the hurt,"" Booker said a few hours after the Senate vote. He was speaking at a major Democratic fundraiser in Iowa, site of the opening presidential caucuses. ""This is a time in our country when we need to stay faithful."" There are four weeks to go before the midterms, time enough for some additional disclosure or new catastrophe. That said, the consequences of Kavanaugh's confirmation seem guaranteed to deepen the demographic divisions between the two major parties that have fueled an increasingly fierce partisanship in American politics divisions by gender, by generation, by geography. Officials on both sides suggested there could be continuing legal and political fallout over Kavanaugh. If Democrats win the House, the Judiciary Committee will open an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury against the justice, according to New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who is in line to be the committee's chairman. He dodged questions about whether that might mean impeachment proceedings. And Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct by several women, said the women who stepped forward should face unspecified penalties for making what he derided as ""fabricated"" allegations. ""I think that they should be held liable,"" he said in an interview late Saturday on Fox News. ""You can't go around and whether it's making up stories about such an important position, you can't do that. You can destroy somebody's life."" Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan expressed concern about whether Americans would continue to have faith in the high court as independent and fair-minded. ""Part of the court's legitimacy depends on people not seeing the court in the way that people see the rest of the governing structures of this country now,"" she said at a Princeton University conference. ""In other words, people thinking of the court as not politically divided in the same way, as not an extension of politics, but instead somehow above the fray."" At the moment, that seems optimistic.

Larry Ferlazzo,"Here are three Holiday Gifts To Readers (that I give every year!): First, He understood not only what we did but what we were supposed to do is from The Los Angeles Times, and I think it’s the best newspaper story ever written about Christmas. Second, here’s one of my favorite education-related videos. It’s a great example of differentiated instruction. In the video, some ducklings were able to get over the curb on their own. However, several found that it was just too high. Look at how someone provides assistance to those having trouble, and how he doesn’t tell them what to do. Instead, he offers it as an option, as a choice they can make. It’s an example of an old community organizing axiom, “If you don’t give people the opportunity to say no, you don’t give them the opportunity to say yes, either.” And, third, several years ago I received a special Christmas gift from Mary Ochs, a good friend who gave me my first job as a community organizer thirty years ago and who was my mentor during my nineteen year organizing career. It was an older copy of a very small book titled “Axioms For Organizers” by Fred Ross, Sr. Fred Ross, Sr. was a legendary community organizer. While working for the Industrial Areas Foundation (which I worked for during most of my organizing career) he became Cesar Chavez’s key mentor and adviser. Ross was the author of an extraordinary book that is still available titled Conquering Goliath: Cesar Chavez at the Beginning. In fact, last year, he was selected for the California Hall Of Fame and this year a great biography was published, America’s Social Arsonist: Fred Ross and Grassroots Organizing in the Twentieth Century. Even though the little book that Mary sent me is long out-of-print, a quick Internet search found that it’s still available on a free online PDF. The book is directed towards organizers, but all of Fred’s axioms offer important advice to teachers, as well. I’d encourage you to review the entire PDF, which is very short, and here are a few of my favorites: Short-Cuts –Short-cuts usually end in detours, which lead to dead ends. Social Arsonist –A good organizer is a social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire. People – It’s the way people are that counts, not the way you’d like them to be.

Lauren O'Neil,"Police in Vaughan are looking for the driver of a white Mercedes who they believe to have broken the windows of local law office before dousing the place in gasoline and then setting it on fire.
Surveillance footage of the brazen crime, released by York Regional Police on Friday, shows the suspect getting out of a car in the otherwise empty parking lot of a commercial plaza near Rutherford Road and Highway 400 around 2 a.m. on January 7.
The hooded arsonist walks up to the front door of a business in the strip mall and, after arranging three gas cans on the sidewalk, throws what appears to be some sort of rock right through the glass.
The person then drops two full vessels of liquid into the office and pours a third one out in the entranceway. A single tossed match makes quick work of the job, sparking a fire that nearly swallows up the suspect as they jump away from the door.
The hooded arsonist then simply gets into their car and speeds away, leaving behind little more than what police called a ""strong smell of gasoline.""
It's clear upon watching the video how hard this person worked to pull off the crime without getting caughtnever once can you see any identifying details in the video, save for the suspect's licence plates, which police say were found to have been stolen from the City of Toronto.
Nobody was injured in the blaze, which was extinguised by Vaughan Fire and Rescue Services, but York Regional Police are very keen on learning the mystery arsonist's identity.
Anyone with information or who may have been around 3550 Rutherford Road at 2 a.m. on January 7 is asked to contact York Regional Police's #4 District Criminal Investigations Bureau at 1-866-876-5423, ext.7441.","Police in Vaughan are looking for the driver of a white Mercedes who they believe to have broken the windows of local law office before dousing the place in gasoline and then setting it on fire.

David Gee,"Authorities are investigating a possible hate crime at a Planned Parenthood facility in Columbia, Missouri that was intentionally set ablaze on Sunday morning.
The FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the arsonist. The building was forced to close after the suspicious fire, though, thankfully, no one was in the facility when the fire was set. The building’s sprinkler system put out the fire before firefighters even arrived on the scene. Still, the criminal remains at large.
An individual wearing dark-colored clothing was seen on surveillance video walking onto the clinic’s grounds, according to the FBI. The bureau said the same individual was captured on video leaving the grounds as smoke poured out of the building.
…In a statement it issued late Tuesday afternoon, Planned Parenthood Great Plains said it was clear that this was an intentional effort to damage our facility in order to disrupt services and block patient access to sexual and reproductive health care.
Make no mistake — we are committed to providing care in the Columbia community, and this crime will not deter us from our mission, it said. Our patients rely on us each day, and with a strong community of supporters beside us, we will reopen our doors as soon as possible.
If this was indeed a hate crime, it’s hard to know what the arsonist hoped to accomplish. It’s possible the person was so ignorant that he or she wrongly assumed the facility offered abortions. They don’t. In fact, there’s only one Planned Parenthood in the state that currently offers those services, and it’s in St. Louis.
Which means this criminal just tried torching a building that offers cancer screenings.

Perez Hilton,"Right on cue!!!

Larry Ferlazzo,"Here are three Holiday Gifts To Readers (that I give every year!):
First,He understood not only what we did but what we were supposed to do is from The Los Angeles Times, and I think it’s the best newspaper story ever written about Christmas.
Second, here’s one of my favorite education-related videos. It’s a great example of differentiated instruction. In the video, some ducklings were able to get over the curb on their own. However, several found that it was just too high. Look at how someone provides assistance to those having trouble, and how he doesn’t tell them what to do. Instead, he offers it as an option, as a choice they can make. It’s an example of an old community organizing axiom, “If you don’t give people the opportunity to say no, you don’t give them the opportunity to say yes, either.”
And, third, several years ago I received a special Christmas gift from Mary Ochs, a good friend who gave me my first job as a community organizer thirty years ago and who was my mentor during my nineteen year organizing career.
It was an older copy of a very small book titled Axioms For Organizers by Fred Ross, Sr.
Fred Ross, Sr. was a legendary community organizer. While working for the Industrial Areas Foundation (which I worked for during most of my organizing career) he became Cesar Chavezs key mentor and adviser. Ross was the author of an extraordinary book that is still available titled Conquering Goliath: Cesar Chavez at the Beginning. In fact, two years ago, he was selected for the California Hall Of Fame and last year a great biography was published, America’s Social Arsonist: Fred Ross and Grassroots Organizing in the Twentieth Century.
Even though the little book that Mary sent me is long out-of-print, a quick Internet search found that its still available on a free online PDF.
The book is directed towards organizers, but all of Freds axioms offer important advice to teachers, as well.
Id encourage you to review the entire PDF, which is very short, and here are a few of my favorites:
Short-Cuts Short-cuts usually end in detours, which lead to dead ends.
Social Arsonist A good organizer is a social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire.
People Its the way people are that counts, not the way youd like them to be.

Amanda Arnold,"In late July, an unidentified arsonist set fire to a California Planned Parenthood in the early morning — a criminal act that was fortunately captured on surveillance video that police recently released to the public in hopes of identifying the perpetrator. According to ABC News, video footage shows the arsonist dousing cardboard outside of a Planned Parenthood in Watsonville, California, around 4 a.m. local time on July 20. A local reportedly called 911 after noticing smoke coming from the building around 7 a.m., and firefighters extinguished the fire minutes after arriving; still, police said, the building sustained moderate damage. Abortion-providing clinics have long been the targets of hateful, disruptive attacks — and they’ve seen an increase in this sort of violence in recent years. According to a report from the National Abortion Federation, 2017 saw an increase in death threats, trespassing, and obstruction; NAF in part blames this escalation to the current political environment, as it has “emboldened” anti-abortion extremists. (Incidents of arson, conversely, have steadily decreased over the past three decades, as NAF counted only 13 attempts between 2010 and 2017, in comparison to 96 between 1990 and 1999.) Now that police have released the footage of the recent California incident to the public, the FBI is offering a hefty $10,000 reward for any information that could lead to the unidentified suspect’s arrest. While the arsonists face is concealed in the video, Watsonville police said in a statement that they’re “hoping someone will recognize this person based off of his/her physical description, clothing and mannerisms.” Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Ely Uretsky at 831-768-3356.","The FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for any information that could lead to the unidentified suspect’s arrest.",2018-09-10T18:32:12Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thecut.com'}",Arsonist Who Tried to Burn Down Planned Parenthood Caught on Video,https://www.thecut.com/2018/09/arsonist-who-set-fire-to-planned-parenthood-caught-on-video.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/09/10/10-planned-parenthood-arsonist.w1200.h630.jpg,,Thecut.com,arsonist,1
https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"A blaze which destroyed the £5 million former home of actor Basil Rathbone who was well known for playing Sherlock Holmes is being treated as suspicious by police.
Last night a fire started by a mystery arsonist ripped through Treetops in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire as 40 firefighters fought it vain to put it out. 
Hollywood legend, Rathbone played the super-sleuth created by Arthur Conan Doyle in numerous movies,  and lived at the now empty home for many years before his death in 1967.
The £5 million former home of Hollywood legend Basil Rathbone who was well known for playing Sherlock Holmes burned down last night. The smoldering wreck of the home is pictured 
Tree Tops had a list of wealthy owners including Mr Rathbone who played Holmes in numerous movies including blockbuster The Hound of the Baskervilles. He is pictured as Sherlock Holmes
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'We were called at 3.40pm yesterday by the fire service to a report that an empty building was on fire in Gillotts Lane, Henley-on-Thames.
'No-one was injured however the property sustained extensive damage. Officers assisted with a road closure in the area while the fire service attended.. The fire is being treated as suspected arson and inquiries are ongoing. Anyone who has any information about the incident should contact the 24-hour Thames Valley Police non-emergency number on 101.'
Police, forensic science experts and fire brigade specialists are combing the scene today.   
Fire crews from Berkshire and Oxfordshire fought the fire and the fire service also believe that it was started deliberately.
A spokesman for Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the fire was being investigated but experts were working on the belief that the fire was started deliberately as an unlawful act.
The spokesman said: 'At 3.25pm Thames Valley Fire Control Service received multiple calls detailing a house on fire opposite Gillotts School on Gillotts Lane, Henley on Thames. The first fire appliance, which was mobilised from Henley Fire Station, was on scene within minutes and found the building to already be fully involved in fire.
'Fire crews remained on scene throughout the night to deal with any hot spots and isolated pockets of fire that may have re-ignited.'  
Rathbone played Holmes in numerous movies including The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Neighbours said that the extensive property, built in 1915, had been the subject of numerous planning applications, including a scheme to build 47 homes on the six acre site, which had all been turned down.    
Mark Charter, head of estate agents Carter Jonas' Oxford office, said previously commenting on Tree Tops: 'It is full of natural light and space, it has lots of scope for someone to refurbish it to make it a fine country house in a super location.
'It has a colourful history with the great Basil Rathbone as one of its previous owners and also we understand one of the UK's top cigar importers, Melbourne Hart, once lived there too.'
Fire crews from Berkshire and Oxfordshire fought the fire in vain throughout the night
South Oxfordshire District Council has resisted planning applications to make changes or developments on the Tree Tops property.
The council stated that there will be a presumption against further development beyond the existing limits of Henley-on-Thames in order that the attractive countryside and landscape setting of the town be preserved.
In the grounds of Tree Tops are various outbuildings with a garage, stables, a former tennis court and swimming pool and an unfinished timber pool house. 
There was also a separate office and annexe accessed from the back of the house or via the alley leading from the kitchen.
The property, which had a galleried landing, has a gravel driveway sweeping up to the front of the house. 
Tree Tops House was owned by company director Robert Hale until his death in January 2015. 
It was then bought by its current owner, a Russian oligarch who neighbours say lives abroad.","Last night a fire started by a mystery arsonist ripped through Treetops in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire as 40 firefighters fought it vain to put it out.",2019-03-20T15:42:35Z,"{'id': 'daily-mail', 'name': 'Daily Mail'}",Sherlock Holmes star's former £5million Henley-on-Thames home is burned down,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6830939/Sherlock-Holmes-stars-former-5million-Henley-Thames-home-burned-down.html,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/20/15/11234010-0-image-a-26_1553095408276.jpg,daily-mail,Daily Mail,arsonist,1
"Louis Sahagun, Laura Newberry, Javier Panzar","Patrick Reitz can’t say his isolated, mile-high community of Idyllwild was fully prepared for the Cranston fire, a blaze authorities say was caused by an arsonist and which continued to burn out of control Friday. But in a place where fire authorities have been sounding alarms for years about the buildup of tinder-dry trees and brush on all sides, residents had learned that an important part of facing a wildfire is getting ready for it. “Idyllwild was saved by years of pre-planning,” said Reitz, chief of the Idyllwild Fire Protection District. “That includes removal of thousands of dead and dying trees, construction of miles of firebreaks, and evacuation plans” drafted by at least a dozen mountain camps that cater to thousands of young people, town organizations and fire authorities. “Before we pulled the cord on a formal mandatory evacuation shortly after the Cranston fire began,” he said, “most of the youth camp folks were already off the mountain.” Following close behind were an estimated 6,000 residents who found themselves on traffic-choked, two-lane roads that wind down the ragged northern flanks of the San Jacinto Mountains, where suburbia meets the wilderness — a classic Southern California landscape that has long lured people to build homes in forests and brushlands despite the threat of wildfires. The community’s disaster plan was based on a variety of fire scenarios that identified staging areas for firefighters, equipment and safety zones, as well as escape routes for evacuees, officials said. By Friday morning, the Cranston fire had scorched 11,500 acres, destroyed at least five homes and forced the evacuation of more than 4,000 residences. The fire is only 3% contained. Brandon N. McGlover, the Temecula man authorities say started the Cranston fire, was charged Friday with starting nine separate fires. All nine were set Wednesday in the Idyllwild, Anza and Sage areas. He faces 15 felony counts: one of aggravated arson, five of arson of an inhabited structure and nine of arson of forest or wildland. McGlover, 32, pleaded not guilty to all 15 charges and a judge set his bail at $3.5 million, according to the Riverside County district attorney’s office. If convicted on all counts, he faces up to life in prison. By Friday evening, the Cranston fire appeared to be spreading east of Mountain Center and into the San Jacinto Wilderness. The blaze was expected to keep growing, especially in the wilderness and the Rattlesnake Spring areas, according to Chad Cook, operations section chief with the California Incident Management Team. “The fire is laying down now,” Riverside County Fire Chief Dan Talbot said during a briefing Friday. But “it looked like that yesterday morning too, and then it roared back to life.” Response teams are keeping a close eye on the communities of Apple Canyon and Vista Ranch, which are threatened by the spreading flames. Fire-control efforts have been hampered by the extreme heat and low humidity, as well as resources stretched thin by other fires around the state. This isn’t the first time that Idyllwild — a community known for its schools, and art and music foundations — has been shaken by fire. The first time the town was totally evacuated was in July 1996, when the Bee fire crept up the mountain. Residents returned to their homes on the Fourth of July weekend and held a parade led by local firefighters. A decade later, the arson-caused Esperanza fire triggered an explosion of heat and flames that killed four local firefighters and critically injured another. Relatives and neighbors in Idyllwild responded to their loss with strong emotions, flags at half-staff and an army of volunteers to help the affected families. The town was evacuated again in 2013 because of the Mountain fire. Friday morning, authorities were cautiously optimistic that the Cranston fire “had moved on, away from the community and into sparsely populated areas,” Reitz said. “The preparations we did with the U.S. Forest Service, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, Riverside County and others enabled us to get defensive lines in place ahead of this fire.” He worried, however, about the safety of stragglers who defied the evacuation order to leave the tourism-driven community’s tightly packed cottages, modest chalets, gift shops, restaurants and watering holes. “We cut the power in Idyllwild due to the approaching fire,” Reitz said. “A few hours later, the main power lines into town were downed by the blaze. So, the whole community is without power, and we’re working off generators.” Fire authorities expressed guarded optimism Friday afternoon that the alpine resort had been spared three days after it was forced to evacuate. “In the next day or two, we should have full containment of this fire in the community of Idyllwild,” said Lee Beyer, a spokesman for the San Bernardino National Forest. “But we still have a ton of work to do before … residents and visitors can return safely.” He added: “Firefighters are doing heavy mop-up operations in hot spots. Power poles and power lines need to be replaced. Highway guardrails are in need of repair.” As he spoke, helicopters and air tankers doused flames on ridgelines a few miles north of Lake Hemet, and about 15 miles south of Idyllwild. Much of the black smoke that had filled the air a day earlier had turned to more benign shades of gray.","Patrick Reitz can’t say his isolated, mile-high community of Idyllwild was fully prepared for the Cranston fire, a blaze authorities say was caused by an arsonist and which continued to burn out of control Friday.

A man who pleaded guilty this week to setting fire to a speed camera using a sock doused in accelerant has been jailed for separate offences.
Key points:
Russell Terrance Weribone appeared in court for the second time in three days
He pleaded guilty to the theft of bottles of champagne and whiskey from Adelaide bottle shops
The 40-year-old will also reappear in court in March on unrelated charges
Russell Terrance Weribone appeared in the Christies Beach Magistrates Court today on two charges of theft and one charge of attempted theft.
Weribone pled guilty to stealing and attempting to steal alcohol from multiple locations last year, while on a suspended sentence for the theft of an air conditioner.
On Tuesday, he also pleaded guilty to separate charges relating to the arson attack on a Greenhill Road speed camera last year.
On November 14, 2018, the speed camera at the intersection of Anzac Highway and Greenhill Road in the Adelaide suburb of Wayville was smashed and set alight at about 12:30am.
Police said the fire was quickly extinguished but the suspect had driven away before patrols arrived.
Emergency services were then called back to the scene at about 3:45am when another attempt was made the set the camera alight.
Thefts occurred while on suspended sentence
The court heard Mr Weribone's theft charges were from last year and occurred at the same time he was on a suspended sentence.
In June 2018, he was given a suspended sentence bond for stealing an air conditioner.
The court heard he stole two bottles of Dom Perignon and one bottle of champagne from the Marion Hotel at Mitchell Park on August 24 last year.
On the same day he stole two bottles of whiskey, one bottle of scotch whisky and one bottle of champagne from the Victoria Hotel at O'Halloran Hill.
The court heard a week later on August 31, he attempted to steal two bottles of shiraz from a Para Hills bottle shop but was apprehended by a shop attendant.
His defence lawyer urged the judge to show leniency but admitted he knew the charges would result in a prison sentence. 
Weribone pleaded guilty to all three theft charges and will serve a total of 18 days in prison.
He will reappear in court in March on unrelated charges.

Clark has been charged with multiple counts of arson and accused of making threats prior to the blaze. From ABC 7 : Shane Sherwood with the Orange County Fire Authority said the evidence gathered led them to believe the fire was an intentional act, but are still working through the evidence to determine how it was started. Sherwood said no witnesses have come forward saying they saw Clark start the fire, but the area of origin is around his residence. Clark has reportedly had conflicts with his neighbors for years and sent an email warning, “This place will burn” to a volunteer fire chief last week… Of the 14 cabins in the area of the fire, Clark’s is apparently the only one still standing. Eric Lint, a neighbor of Clark whose cabin burned in the blaze, said he was not surprised by Clark’s arrest. “He was a constant problem,” Lint said. “We regarded him and the other gentleman as the Hatfields and McCoys.” Clark’s arrest was captured on video: RAW VIDEO: The man suspected of starting the massive #HolyFire stands shirtless in handcuffs as his neighbors' homes burn just feet away.

Edith Bevin,"Posted November 23, 2018 14:57:38 A volunteer firefighter who set fire to a Primrose Sands home east of Hobart has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail. Adam Daniel Patterson helped put out at least nine deliberately lit fires in the beach community in 2016. On May 15 of that year, he was also the first firefighter to respond to the call about a blaze which had engulfed a home valued at $250,000. The difference this time, he was responsible for lighting it. The now 33-year-old father of two initially denied he was involved but the court heard that as the evidence mounted against him, he confessed to police, telling them it was ""the worst mistake of me f***king life"". The beachside home had belonged to the same family for 35 years and they loved it. Patterson had parked his wife's car nearby and then walked up from the beach into the unfenced backyard of the property, deliberately starting a fire in a woodpile under the house. Patterson had been a volunteer firefighter in the area for the previous three years. He was not accused of starting the other fires during the spate of arsons attacks in 2016. The Supreme Court in Hobart heard that with his training and experience, Patterson would have known the fire would spread to the floor and walls of the weatherboard home. Responding firefighters, including Patterson, managed to contain and extinguish the blaze, but not save the home. The damage was so great it had to be demolished. Patterson told police he had no idea why he had done it. ""I don't know, I've got no idea, everything is blank, that's all it's just a bad dream, I wish it would all go away,"" he told police in an interview in June 2016. ""It was just a mistake, an honest mistake, I f***ked up. ""It just happened, I was driving along, I've got no explanation for it."" The court heard Patterson did not light the fire out of any malice towards the owners, nor for financial gain, fascination with fire or mental illness. His lawyer Philippa Morgan told the court Patterson had no memory of setting the fire and was going through marital and financial hardship at the time. She said it was also not the case Patterson had become a volunteer firefighter for untoward reasons. ""Mr Patterson's motive to volunteer for the fire service came from a very sincere place,"" she said. ""It's something that his father did, it's something that he derived some enjoyment from the engagement with the community. ""It wasn't a ruse or to cover some sort of attraction to fire lighting."" The Department of Public Prosecutions told the court the damage caused by Patterson's actions was ""significant"" and the potential danger to the health of firefighters and neighbours was great, as was the risk of the fire spreading to other homes and bushland. Justice Stephen Estcourt said Patterson's training and experience as a firefighter would have made him aware of the dangers and the impact of arson, not only to the home-owner but the whole community. He sentenced Patterson to two-and-a-half years' jail, ordering he not be eligible for release until he had served at least 15 months of that sentence. Patterson was also ordered to pay compensation to the home owner and the insurance company.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Screenshot/Pear Video Image caption A video circulating online showed bystanders watching as a three-storey building went up in flames A fire at a karaoke bar in the southern Chinese city of Yingde has killed 18 people and left five others injured. The fire broke out inside the three-storey building in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police have arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected arson. Reports allege he blocked the bar's only exit with a motorbike before starting the fire. Video circulating on social media showed bystanders watching as intense flames engulfed the bar. Police were first alerted to the fire at 00:30 local time on Tuesday (16:30 GMT Monday). It was extinguished by 00:55, according to a statement by Qingyuan police on micro-blogging site Weibo. Suspected arsonist Liu Chunlu, who according to the police suffered from burns as a result of the fire, was arrested the next morning. According to state broadcaster CCTV, he had blocked the only entry and exit point and then lit a fire. Authorities had offered a 200,000 yuan (£22,746; $31,665) reward to anyone who provided information leading to the suspect's capture. Last year, 22 people were killed after a fire broke out in a two-storey house in eastern China. Police later arrested a man for allegedly setting the residential building on fire. In 2016, 17 people on board a bus were killed in a suspected arson attack, with a man later arrested in connection with the incident.","Hindustan Times Fire in karaoke bar in Yingde, China kills 18 BBC News A fire at a karaoke bar in the southern Chinese city of Yingde has killed 18 people and left five others injured.

Dan Wickline,"The Arrowverse is filled with former cast members from Glee, including Grant Gustin, Melissa Benoist, Blake Jenner, Peter Facinelli, Charlotte Ross, Nolan Funk, Gregg Henry, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Victor Garber, and Darren Criss. You can now add one more name to that list, as Max Adler, who played David Karofsky, has signed on for an upcoming episode of The Flash. According to FlashTVNews, Adler will play Jaco Birch, an obsessive music fan who loves classic heavy metal. He’s a roadie for some of the newer, contemporary metal bands — and he likes to set things on fire. The name doesn’t directly tie to any existing DC character I can find, but that doesn’t mean he’s not one. The name Jaco might be an homage to the late jazz bass legend Jaco Pastorius, who died at the way-too-young age of 35. Besides his time on Glee, Adler’s credits include Switched at Birth and an episode of Criminal Minds. The most recognizable fire-related Flash villain is, of course, Heat Wave / Mick Rory, who is currently a part of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow and played by Dominic Purcell. There are also similar villains in Firefly, currently in use on Gotham (portrayed by Michelle Veintimilla ) and Firebug who has had three different versions over the years.

Kevin,"A 47-year-old Florida man was arrested last week after he “attacked two people with a ninja sword after discovering his socks were missing,” according to Fox 13 News. As is often the case in these circumstances (that is, circumstances involving Florida, ninjas, or socks, or any combination thereof), the report seems to raise more questions than it answers: Two questions definitely not answered by this report are (1) why is Gerard Depardieu living in a trailer in Hudson, Florida, under an assumed name; and (2) what kind of sword was he actually using? I found no information on the first, but enough to trouble you with on the second. The video does not show the sword in question, nor do any of the other reports I was able to find on this incident. Nor do the witnesses/victims (who are expected to fully recover) describe it in any detail. The female victim, who was cut on the leg, described it only as a “friggin’ big-ass sword,” but eyewitness testimony is notorious for exaggerating the size of the friggin’ sword a suspect was wielding, especially if it was being used to threaten the witness, and she provided no other details about the implement. The report’s use of the term “ninja sword” of course suggests it was a Japanese-style sword, but doesn’t tell us much more than that. There appear to have been approximately 37,000 different kinds of swords manufactured in Japan over the centuries, the best-known of which are the katana and wakizashi, but also including the tsurugi (“sword”), tachi (“big sword”), kodachi (“small big sword”), and ōdachi (“big big sword”), although it seems likely it’s these translations I found on Wikipedia that are ridiculous and not the names themselves. In any event, the Japanese have plainly long been masters of the art of making things to stab people with. There appears to be no good evidence, though, that they ever made something specifically for ninjas to stab people with. Again according to Wikipedia, though I would dearly love to research this in more detail, modern enthusiasts and popular culture have a tendency to wave around something called a ninjatō or ninjaken or even shinobigatana, which tend to be shorter and straighter than (for example) the katana. So this is a thing, sort of, but there is apparently “no physical evidence,” such as surviving contemporary examples, that can be dated earlier than the 20th century. (In fact, some experts believe the whole concept of “ninja” is an “invented tradition,” not a total fabrication but vastly exaggerated.) The upshot being that this could have been a “ninja sword” in the sense of this modern(ish) creation, but because it seems unlikely that these witnesses would have made any of these distinctions, all we can conclude is that this jackass had some kind of Japanese-style sharp implement. (If you think I’m giving the female witness too little credit, feel free to believe it was an ōdachi based on her testimony that it was one “friggin’ big-ass sword.” That seems to fit.) And that he was mad about socks. The suspect was charged with attempted murder and aggravated domestic battery with a deadly weapon. As of last Wednesday, he was being held in Pasco County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail. Of course, if he’s actually a ninja, no jail can hold him. But my guess is that he’s probably still there.

Reuters,"By Alex Dobuzinskis and Dan Whitcomb LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Southern California wildfire - which authorities say was set by an arsonist with a grudge against a neighbour - doubled in size overnight into Friday as crews built fire lines and fought to protect thousands of homes in a lakefront community. The Holy Fire, which broke out on Monday in Holy Jim Canyon in Orange County southeast of Los Angeles, has already destroyed 12 structures and was only 5 percent contained as of Friday. ""Extreme fire behaviour was observed to the north and east portions of the fire. Steep terrain, dry fuels, and inaccessible areas continue to be a factor in fire spread,"" the U.S. Forest Service said on the Inciweb fire tracking website. Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, who owns a cabin in Holy Jim Canyon, was arrested earlier this week after a standoff with police and charged with arson, making criminal threats and resisting arrest. A spokeswoman for the Orange County District Attorney's Office said Clark had previously made threats against a neighbour, but declined to elaborate. Volunteer Fire Chief Mike Milligan told the Orange County Register that Clark has long feuded with other cabin owners in the canyon and last week sent him an email warning: ""This place will burn."" More than 21,000 people have been evacuated in and around the city of Lake Elsinore, where flames and billowing smoke rose into the sky at the edge of the city of 60,000 near the Santa Ana Mountains. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the flames, which have charred more than 18,000 acres (7,280 hectares). Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for the area. The Holy Fire was one of several blazes burning across California that have displaced tens of thousands. Smoke from the western wildfires has reached the East Coast and beyond, the National Weather Service has said. About 5.4 million acres (2.2 million hectares) have been blackened in more than a dozen states during this year's extremely active wildfire season, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In Northern California, a mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire, burning around Redding, was killed in a car crash on Thursday, the eighth person to die in that conflagration. The 181,000-acre (73,250-hectare) Carr Fire has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. It was 51 percent contained on Friday. About 100 miles (160 km) southwest of the Carr Fire, nearly 4,000 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 307,000 acres (124,240 hectares) to become the largest fire on record in California.

https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"An arsonist killed a fire safety officer when he set a hotel ablaze in the middle of the night after hiding the fire extinguisher.
Damion Harris, 31, had been out drinking before he arrived back at the Ty Belgrave House in the early hours of the morning during the height of tourist season.
A court heard that all 16 guests at the sold-out boutique hotel in Aberystwyth, West Wales, were asleep when thick smoke began to fill the building after Harris started a fire in its basement.
Men, women and children were forced to climb to the hotel's roof and some even jumped from balconies to escape the flames in the early hours of July 25 last year.
Richard Simnett fell from the hotel's steep slate roof and suffered a number of serious injuries after he helped his partner and two sons aged five and four out of a window.
Damion Harris, pictured, killed a fire safety officer when he set a hotel ablaze in the middle of the night after hiding the fire extinguisher
Harris was caught on CCTV (pictured) removing a fire extinguisher from a wall in the reception area and hiding it on an upper level before returning downstairs to set a pair of net curtains on fire 
Juozas Tunaitis, 48, who was staying at the hotel while working as a fire safety contractor at Aberystwyth University, was the only guest who failed to escape and his remains were found underneath the collapsed building nearly two months later.
On Tuesday, Swansea Crown Court heard Harris used a cigarette lighter to set fire to a cupboard full of towels and sheets after he sneaked into the hotel around 2am after drinking in a pub and a nightclub.
Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'It was a hotel on the seafront during the summer at the height of tourist season.
'He must have known there were a large number of guests at the hotel at the time and were asleep.
'He carried out a clearly deliberate and obviously dangerous act. It was likely to result in serious injury or death, and that is indeed is what occurred.'
Harris was caught on CCTV removing a fire extinguisher from a wall in the reception area and hiding it on an upper level before returning downstairs to set a pair of net curtains on fire.
The flames on the curtains self extinguished but Harris entered the hotel's basement and then set fire to a cupboard containing linen before making his escape.
The court heard the the fire spread upwards and thick smoke woke up a number of the guests, including Mr Simnett, 42, who was on a family holiday with partner Caroline Latham and their two young boys.
The family escaped to the roof after Miss Latham made a 999 call to the fire service which was played in court.
Miss Latham said: 'Two children, four and five. We've tried to get down the stairs but we can't. There's thick smoke.'
Miss Latham is heard telling her son's 'Hold hands, boys, stay together' after they were lifted by their father to the hotel roof, and then instructed them to recite their five times table to distract them after their father slipped and fell.
Mr Simnett landed on a handrail which broke his fall some 12 to 14 feet above ground level, and he survived with fractures to his vertebrae, his collar bone, his sternum, seven broken ribs and suffered a broken right arm which has left him without sensation in some fingers. 
Men, women and children were forced to climb to the hotel's roof and some even jumped from balconies to escape the flames
Juozas Tunaitis, 48, was the only guest who failed to escape and his remains were found underneath the collapsed building nearly two months later
Miss Latham and her two children were helped down from the roof by firefighters who used a cherry picker.
Mr Tunaitis, the only person to die in the fire, was seen poking his head from his room's window on the second floor by his three colleagues after they managed to escape their own rooms into the street.
Fellow contractor Zydruna Sedys said he tried to wake up Mr Tunaitis but failed to get him out before he was forced to escape the building by sliding down a white support structure from a balcony.
All 16 guests at the sold-out boutique hotel were asleep when thick smoke began to fill the building 
He told police he shouted to Mr Tunaitis in Lithuanian to jump down from a balcony, but never saw him again after police moved him and others away from the scene.
Mr Tunaitis was found on September 10 by a forensic archaeologist, but his remains were so badly damaged he could not be identified until 16 weeks later on November 15.
A post-mortem examination could not determine whether he died from smoke inhalation or directly from the fire.
Shortly after the fire, Harris was found by a policeman slumped in the street with his t-shirt over his head and was described as 'heavily intoxicated' before he walked home.
Harris was later identified using CCTV and was arrested on suspicion of arson, denying to police ever entering the hotel, before saying he been threatened by an unknown man to set the hotel on fire or else his family would be harmed.
On Monday, Harris, from Llanbadarn, Aberystwyth, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, arson and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on the day his trial was due to begin.
He was originally charged with the murder of Mr Tunaitis, but his guilty plea to the alternative charge of manslaughter was accepted by prosecutors.
Judge Paul Thomas adjourned the hearing until Wednesday.","Damion Harris, 31, had been out drinking before he arrived back at the Ty Belgrave House in Aberystwyth, West Wales, in the early hours of the morning on July 25 last year.",2019-03-06T02:04:51Z,"{'id': 'daily-mail', 'name': 'Daily Mail'}",Aberystwyth arsonist killed fire safety officer after setting alight hotel,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6775837/Aberystwyth-arsonist-killed-fire-safety-officer-setting-alight-hotel.html,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/06/02/10631046-0-image-a-41_1551837888959.jpg,daily-mail,Daily Mail,arsonist,1
Rebecca Opie,"Posted January 25, 2018 12:59:42 An Adelaide travel agent who had her business burnt to the ground by a disgruntled ex-lover has labelled him as a ""coward"" who destroyed her livelihood in a ""devilish act"". Rosalie Stott's Inflight Travel business on the corner of Unley Road and Clyde Street at Parkside was destroyed by fire in the early hours of September 27 last year. Two other businesses, a chiropractor and a Pack and Send, were also severely damaged in the blaze. Ms Stott's former partner, Samuel Patton of Seaton, was arrested and charged over the attack later the same day. The 58-year-old pleaded guilty to arson for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. During a pre-sentencing hearing in Adelaide's District Court, Ms Stott read an emotional victim impact statement during which she yelled at Mr Stott as he sat in the dock. ""I've put my blood, sweat and tears into my profession and my business and Mr Patton's irreprehensible, despicable, unjustifiable, premeditated behaviour has destroyed my livelihood,"" she said. ""What you have done to me is the most devilish, wicked, evil act. ""It's only a coward who would strike at night thinking no-one would see you and you thought you would get away with it."" Ms Stott told the court she was once a happy person who was passionate about her career but now feels as if her soul and spirit have been damaged. ""I feel sad, heartbroken, ripped and torn apart,"" she said. ""How could a person, you, be so callous to destroy me, not only financially, but personally and humiliate me publicly?"" The court heard the travel agency had lost around $2 million in gross turnover as a result of the fire. The blaze caused $85,000 damage to the chiropractic clinic and $120,000 damage to the Pack and Send. ""I feel what Mr Patton has done is beyond comprehension, it's indescribable, inexcusable and I hope Mr Patton's sentencing is justified to his crime,"" Ms Stott said. Patton's lawyer, Craig Caldicott, said his client had consumed alcohol on the night of the arson attack, and Patton read an apology from the dock. ""I think about it every day and I still can't believe what I have done,"" he said. He said that Ms Stott and the travel agency ""meant a lot to him"" and that he was now taking anti-psychotic medication.

Conor Friedersdorf,"Last month, Mollie Hemingway, the Fox News contributor and senior editor at The Federalist, declared herself a Donald Trump supporter for the first time. “I wasn’t a Trump supporter,” the headline of her Washington Post op-ed stated. “I am now.” She cited his actions on judicial nominees, climate policy, regulatory reform, tax cuts, guidelines on how colleges should adjudicate sexual assault, and foreign policy. Large swaths of the Republican Party and the conservative movement have now reconciled themselves to supporting President Trump, including figures far more famous, powerful, and influential than any journalist. A strong case could be made that this particular endorsement didn’t really change anything, especially since its author was already openly anti-anti-Trump in her orientation. Still, if the GOP loses the ability to win elections during the next decade because its leadership has lost the trust of too many people in too many groups—Latinos, blacks, Asian Americans, Muslims, immigrants, anti-racists, anti-sexists, citizens who worry about the minimum civic virtues a republic requires to thrive—I will recall her endorsement as an illustration of how it happened. None of the beliefs she affirmatively endorses is deplorable. Indeed, if all Americans were like Mollie Hemingway, neither racism nor sexism would be a problem in America. But it matters that thought-leaders like her no longer consider deplorability a dealbreaker. They can no longer be trusted to oppose racism or sexism. With a civic arsonist in the White House, they decline to summon the fire department. In short, they have become irresponsible citizens. Were Hemingway oblivious to Trump’s least defensible qualities, or the damage that his comportment does to America’s civic fabric—matters to which many enthusiastic Trump supporters are oblivious—her posture would be less damning. Who can blame someone for failing to oppose that which they don’t see? But she saw his flaws clearly and chose to support him anyway. It is one thing to vote for Trump as the lesser of two evils, or to do too little to oppose him. It is quite another to support and extol Trump, despite his deplorable behavior, because he has advanced a domestic agenda that accords with one’s policy preferences. “My expectations were low—so low that he could have met them by simply not being President Clinton,” Hemingway declared. “But a year into this presidency, he’s exceeded those expectations by quite a bit. I’m thrilled.” Ponder what it means to be thrilled, knowing what she knows. Hemingway knows that Trump rose to power denigrating Muslims, praising authoritarians, and stoking violence at his campaign rallies. While criticizing Clinton, she acknowledged Trump’s rhetoric about Muslims is “extreme” and “also dangerous.” In office, Trump has retweeted anti-Muslim propaganda films posted by a far-right politician in Europe and imposed a travel ban targeted at Muslim countries that initially barred even existing visa holders from reentry. “The rollout was arbitrary and capricious,” Hemingway herself declared of that attempt at a travel ban, “and therefore a threat to the rule of law.” Why would Muslim Americans, or anyone who values their own liberty, trust a coalition that recognizes Trump’s campaign-trail bigotry, elevates him anyway, sees his subsequent disregard for the rule of law, and still feels thrilled at his tenure? Hemingway has written with clarity about Trump’s behavior on matters having to do with comportment, rather than policy, and their effect on American culture. “I fear the republic is lost,” she wrote after one of Trump’s debate performances. “We are an uneducated people that praise ignorance, celebrity, and entertainment over statesmanship. We are degenerates, immoral, and lost. We the people have not acted as those concerned about preserving the gift of self-government. The fraying fabric of society is putting the republic at risk.” Hemingway also called Trump “a narcissist who takes no responsibility for the negative consequences of his ill-conceived and incoherent verbal spews.” In office, Trump’s comportment has not changed. In fact, Hemingway’s recent declaration of support for him notes, “Like most people, I don’t particularly like Trump’s rhetorical style, juvenile insults and intemperate disposition—on full display in recent days.” But now that he has shown himself to advance a policy agenda more to her liking than she expected, his comportment and its consequences for the nation elicit a different reaction. “At the same time,” she declares, “having followed his career for decades, I am not surprised that he wakes up each morning as Donald Trump.” As if lack of surprise makes it better! “Yes, he lies or exaggerates. Yes, he insults people,"" she once said on Fox News. “Another great argument to deploy against Trump is that he plays fast and loose with the facts,” Hemingway wrote in the early days of his administration. “This is an easy argument to make because not only does everyone know this, they’ve known it for decades. There are hundreds of examples of his imprecision,” she added, “from claiming without evidence millions of fraudulent votes cast to a larger crowd size at his inauguration, to give two recent examples.” Why would anyone who values the civic virtues necessary to preserve the republic trust those who cease to care that it is fraying, throwing support to a man they see as a lying, juvenile insult-monger so long as they’re getting their way? Then there is Trump’s treatment of women. When he was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women during the 2016 campaign, Hemingway wrote, “None of it is particularly surprising for a man who spent decades bragging about his sexual prowess, adultery, handsiness, sexual entitlement, and so on and so forth. That this information is coming out is all so obvious that if you saw all these warning signs—and everyone saw these warning signs—and still supported Trump, you should look inward.” Will Hemingway now look inward the next time Trump mistreats a woman? Trump is “reprobate and immoral,” she wrote back then, adding that “he chose the wanton, unscrupulous lifestyle and bragged about it.” Even during his presidency she has referred to him as “ known perv Trump.” What does it mean for her to write that one month and declare her unsolicited support the next? It means that her standards have been corrupted. These are just a fraction of Trump’s flaws—the subset openly acknowledged by Hemingway, who spends most of her time on Fox News and The Federalist attacking the left, the media, and matters that don’t touch on the president. While it is more than sufficient to illustrate that a leading voice on the right has grown comfortable vesting extreme power in a man whose abysmal character is clear to her, a more complete reckoning with what Trump has done goes farther toward clarifying why being tied to him puts the whole Red Tribe in peril. It may be, for example, that Hemingway, who lives in the Washington, D.C., area and focuses on the culture war more than threats to liberty from police, does not devote a lot of thought to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who Donald Trump pardoned. But Americans who might be taken to be Mexican or Guatemalan or El Salvadoran by a passing cop may know that Arpaio presided over a law-enforcement agency that routinely violated the civil rights of people of Hispanic descent, including American citizens; that he was investigated by the Department of Justice, who declared that they found one of the worst patterns of racial profiling that they had ever seen; that he was ordered to stop violating the Constitution; that he continued to violate constitutional rights so flagrantly that he was convicted of criminal contempt of court; and that Trump pardoned him for that transgression. If you were an American of Hispanic origin, would you trust this president or the people who enthusiastically support him to protect your constitutional rights? That demographic had nothing to fear from Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, or George W. Bush, but they’d be wise to fear a Trumpist coalition, and justified in supposing that a commentator like Hemingway would never volunteer support for a politician who treated Christians like her the way that Trump treats Mexicans and Muslims, regardless of what domestic agenda was being pursued. Racism, sexism, and other bigotries will probably always exist in all of America’s major political coalitions. Misbehavior that undermines the civic fabric will never be eradicated, either. But in the past, most conservative pundits ensured that the Republican Party’s leadership rejected the bigoted pathologies that threaten to tear diverse, pluralistic societies apart. Today, many of the people who once would’ve kept deplorability in check opportunistically embrace a deplorable. “The Trump nomination may result in principled conservatives leaving the party or laying very low,” Hemingway wrote in 2016, “but if this election has shown anything, it’s that principled conservatives aren’t in nearly as abundant supply as they might wish.” The Trump presidency is showing that principled conservatives are in even shorter supply than they seemed on election day. Like all winning coalitions, the American right is having a hard time imagining how fleeting its political ascendence will be, or the consequences its lack of principle will have in the long term. I expect that its moral failures will echo across American politics for years, undermining the right’s ability to credibly advance its best and worst alike. When Trumpism ends, as every coalition built around a president must eventually end, will there be enough people on the right unsullied by his indefensible behavior to rebuild? As a fan of free markets and small government I fear not. I fear the right is discrediting itself for a generation, robbing America of the benefits of having two competing ideologies at their respective best. In the long run, the right’s best hope lies in the shrinking faction of politicians and pundits that is happy to note when it favors a discrete policy pursued by the president, but that remains perspicacious enough to assert the overall posture of Never Trump.","A case study in the political right’s capitulation to Trump, and the threat it poses to its political future.",2018-02-13T22:18:58Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",When Deplorability Is No Longer a Dealbreaker,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-donald-trump-supporters-cannot-be-trusted-to-do/551201/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/02/RTX4VS4L/facebook.jpg?1518525515,,Theatlantic.com,arsonist,1

Emma Grey Ellis,"Humans are pattern seekers. Its how weve always made sense of the world: Our ancestors wouldnt have survived if they hadnt realized that plants tend to flourish after rainfall or that sabertooth tigers tended to eat them. But sometimes were just a little too good at finding meaning in the noise, occasionally unable to separate real patterns from those of our own imagining. These days, your pattern matching skills will help you find Waldo, but they are also why celebrities faces keep popping up on tortillas. At their most paranoid and byzantine, these pattern-matching misfires are called conspiracy theories: unfounded, deeply held alternative explanations for how things areoften invoking some shadowy, malevolent force masterminding the coverup. What's a conspiracy theory? It's an unfounded, deeply held alternative explanations for how things areoften invoking some shadowy, malevolent force masterminding the coverup. Conspiracy theories thrive on the internet, but thats certainly not where they were born. The Flat Earth Society has existed since the 1800s, and people have been speculating about which people are secretly living or dead at least since 68 AD, when Romans werent convinced their arsonist emperor Nero had actually committed suicide. But conspiracies and the digital world do mesh well, probably because they scratch similar itches in our not-quite-domesticated psyches. Internet culture runs on people sinking huge amounts of effort into obscure and seemingly pointless undertakings. And conspiracy theories are to people what an unsupervised toddler is to a bored border collie: It may not look quite like a sheep, but when you nip at its ankles, your brain sure feels like its doing its job. The combination of the endless internet and your pattern-hungry brain has managed to spread webs of red string farther than was ever before possible. On the web, its often hard to distinguish real conspiracy theories from gleefully ironic acts of collective world buildingand either way, speculating about which celebs are immortal vampires and which are secretly lizards is mostly harmless fun (and excellent meme fodder). But because many dark and usually racist pre-internet conspiracies have found new homes on the web, youre always a digital hop and a skip from the mind-bending alternate universes controlled by many of the same people responsible for our fake news crisis. The History of Online Conspiracy Theories The kind of conspiracy theories that wreak havoc on the internet have knowable ancestors: the conspiracies that erupt every time theres a significant advance in communication technology. Take mass printing. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fictitious pamphlet cooked up in 1903 to spread the idea that a ghoulish Jewish cabal was bent on overthrowing the virtuous (Christian, white) nation state. Thanks to the high-speed rotary printing press, the conspiracists were able to slip it into libraries across Europe, and because people trusted their libraries, it was believed. The result: populations turning a blind eye to Russias Jewish pogroms, and, later, to Nazi concentration camps. Around the same time, the (also anti-Semitic) Dreyfus affair used newly cheap and reproducible lithographs to spread anti-Jewish imagery. Then came the radio. People heard ghosts in its crackles and echoes. Enigmatic number stations have fascinated conspiracy theorists since World War I. (Theres a station called the Buzzer thats been broadcasting a continuous pulse since the 1970sconspiracy fans think it might be part of an automated Soviet doomsday project, and that the world will end when it goes off the air.) Television was subjected to the same kind of scrutiny and symbol hunting: In the 1940s, some thought Tom and Jerry was Nazi propaganda ; footage of the moon landing has been checked and rechecked for evidence of fakery for decades. Classic Internet Conspiracy Theories The Berenstain Bears You remember reading the classic childrens books, The Berenstein Bears, right? Wrong. Those bears werent Berensteins at all, but rather Berenstains. Some Berenstein truthers are so sure of their childhood memories theyve become convinced they hail from an alternate universephotoshopped that pesky ai out of many an old snapshot to prove it. Immortal Vampire Celebrities A number of old paintings and high-contrast, low-resolution daguerreotypes kinda sorta look like Nicolas Cage. And John Travolta, Michael Cera, Peter Dinklage, Eddie Murphy, and, most of all, Keanu Reeves. So obviously: Jack Black is really Paul Revere! Travolta can time travel, or hes a vampire doomed to fight Cage forever! Reeves graceful aging is evidence of his immortality! Jet Fuel Cant Melt Steel Beams Its often hard to tell where online conspiracy theory ends and meme begins, and thats especially true of the 9/11 truther adage Jet fuel cant melt steel beams. For the record the statement is technically correctbut beams dont have to liquefy for a building to collapse. The phrase became such a popular comeback among conspiracy theorists (likely because it contains a kernel of truth, and refuting requires knowledge of the finer points of the structural integrity of steel) that it eventually morphed into a shorthand for the whole conspiracy theory mindset. Modern Flat Earthers We are all victims of a vast globularist conspiracy spread by elites who dont want you to know the truth: The planet is flat, gravity doesnt exist, the moon and sun are the same size and orbit the north pole, and every single astronaut is a gosh darn liar. Why? Because the US faked the moon landing, duh. Why is Earth the only flat planet? Its just unique! Why do objects fall if theres no gravity? Listen, things just fall, OK? Finland and Australia Dont Exist Forget the existence of 30-some million Finnish and Australian citizens. The internet knows the real truth: Those people are actors and bots, and their countries dont even exist. Finland, the theory goes, was invented by Japan and Russia after the Cold War to secure additional fishing rights for sushi-loving Japan. And as for Australia? The UK actually just offed those convicts rather than ship them halfway around the world. The Very Bad No Good Large Hadron Collider Well admit it: Smacking subatomic particles together in an underground complex does seem like supervillain behavior. In the years leading up to the collider being turned on, many became convinced its experiments would open an Earth-gobbling black holeand that the many delays in its construction werent due to its expensiveness, size, or mechanical complexity, but rather to time-traveling saboteurs trying to stop that black hole from destroying us all. Seth Rich Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in July 2016. The murder is unsolved, but law enforcement suspect Rich was the victim of a robbery gone wrong. Right-wing conspiracy theorists have a different idea: Rich was responsible for the DNC email leak, and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta had him assassinated. With new technology comes new gaps in the publics understanding of their world, and, for conspiracy theorists, new ways to manipulate those gaps. So the thing that makes the internet wonderfulthat it is a near-endless, low-cost repository of information accessible by billionsis also what makes its so fertile for conspiracy. Early internet users were a generation trained on in-person and over-the-phone communication. Digital slang was in its infancy, the emoji that give context to chats didnt exist, and users were faced with more information than theyd ever been exposed to before. Not only did you often confuse your peers with your ambiguous late-night typing, it was easy to wade into the web and emerge confused and overstimulated yourself. Which brought forth communities united by laser-focused citizen sleuthing. In 1996, a spate of anonymous word-salad jibberish posts, all entitled Markovian Parallax Denigrate, flooded Usenet groups. Internet sleuths noticed that one of these messages seemed to come from controversial (and conspiracy-minded) antiwar activist Susan Lindauer, who claimed to be a CIA asset and to have reliable intel that 9/11 was an inside job. The conspiracy engines started turning and suddenly phrases like refrigerate morphine napkin inland Janeiro nameable yearbook hark were seen as the CIAs digital-age take on the number station. At the same time, usenets devoted to Whitewater (a corruption probe focusing on Clinton real estate investments) sprang up and connected dots like Bill Clintons alleged cocaine habit, handwriting samples, and plane crashes to claim that White House deputy counsel Vince Fosters suicide was actually a murder. When video and easily manipulable images became more common, the landscape got loopier. Admit it, you were fooled by a Photoshopped image or two back in the day. (Remember Helicopter Shark ?) But you dont need to start shopping to fall down a photographic rabbit hole. Love (or hate) a celebrity? With a few keystrokes, you can comb through just about every paparazzi photo ever taken of them and watch videos of their interviews and public appearances for hours on end until youre positive theres some funny business going on. An alleged aversion to pens and emoji-heavy Instagram captions convinced some that Glee star Lea Michele cant read. A monomaniacal focus on Katy Perrys eye and eyebrow shape has led some YouTubers to believe the singer is actually murdered child pageant star JonBenét Ramsey all grown up. As internet access expanded, the massive scale of web conversation contributed to some weird delusions. Large groups innocently chatting about their childhoods have spawned some of the most enduring internet conspiracy theories. So many people are positive that they saw a nonexistent movie called Shazaam, in which comedian Sinbad supposedly played a genie. He has repeatedly denied ever starring in such a film. This collective misremembering is called the Mandela Effect because apparently heaps of people also remember Nelson Mandela dying in prison. (Its also responsible for frequently misquoted movie lines like Play it again, Sam and Luke, I am your father.) The same forces are at work on todays internet, too. We may have GIFs and emoji to bring affect to our text-based messages, but, partly due to the internets irony-soaked culture, its still almost impossible to tell who is being serious. (This phenomenon is so prevalent that its entered the internet rulebook and is now known as Poes Law, after a poster named Nathan Poe who was baffled by Creationists and those parodizing them.) Poes Law is how jokes and memes jump the fence to become full-blown conspiracy theories on todays internet. A decade ago, a satirical post citing some seemingly missing arm freckles and angsty lyrics, pronounced Avril Lavignelike so many celebs before herdead, and replaced by a dopplegänger named Melissa. In 2016, a quip about US senator Ted Cruz being the Zodiac Killer has blossomed into a mythology of its own, even though he was an infant during most of the killings. (Clues: Cruz sort of/not really looks like an old police sketch, and has a slightly unsettlingperhaps serial-killer-esque, apparentlyobsession with having a pantry well-stocked with cans of soup.) Citizen sleuthsor, as some call themselves these days, citizen journalistshave only become more prevalent as access to information continues to increase. And sometimes these conspiracies do turn out to be true, like the Pixar connected universe theory, which links together dozens of Easter eggs, like recurring brand names, and split-second cameos to conclude that all Pixar films take place in the same world. Disney finally confirmed the theory in 2017. At the most bizarre and all-encompassing, you get the internet edition of the now centuries-old obsession with the Illuminati: a secret cabal of (sometimes alien, sometimes reptilian, sometimes alien reptile) elites who control the world to suit their own ends by meeting in underground bunkers and operating a celebrity murder and cloning station headed by Queen Elizabeth II. Almost every major celebrity has been accused of being a member. Some have dealt with it skillfully by ignoring it. Others, like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg, who some believe to be an extraterrestrial lizard person because of his round eyes and awkward mannerisms, have played directly into conspiracy theorists hands by saying things like, I am not a lizard. Which, of course, is what a lizard would say. Q Who? Tracing the rise of the baroque criminal-political conspiracy theory known as QAnon. October 5, 2017: President Trump makes an ambiguous comment about a military dinner being the calm before the storm, sparking conspiracist speculation. October 28, 2017: An anonymous user who later claimed to be a high-level government informant writes a cryptic post bursting with far-right conspiracy bait about Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, and George Soros on 4chans infamous /pol/ board. The user is nicknamed Q, after the Department of Energys top-secret security clearance level. October 31, 2017: A post titled Bread CrumbsQ Clearance Patriot asks rhetorical questions about POTUS, Michael Flynn, Antifa, and others. November 2017: Calling themselves QAnon or the Storm, Q's followers spread a grab bag of Trump-era conspiracy tropespart Pizzagate, part Seth Richon 4chan and 8chan. November 1, 2017: A screenshot of Bread Crumbs is posted to the r/conspiracy subreddit, where it racks up nearly 600 votes and more than 500 comments over the next two months. November 20, 2017: Q posts are compiled and released on Google Drive as The Book of Q. December 19, 2017: New York magazine publishes an explainer on the conspiracy, noting that the QAnon hashtag had been tweeted so many times it had become untrackable. March 30, 2018: Roseanne Barr tweets support for the QAnon theory that President Trump is a mastermind saving children from pedophiles. Within a day, the post amassed more than 5,000 retweets and nearly 16,000 likes. March 30, 2018: Twitter posts a Moment about Barrs tweets. The Daily Beast publishes a QAnon explainer; the next day, CNN, Newsweek, and others follow suit. June 24, 2018: YouTuber Praying­medic posts a video titled Q for Beginners. The video has racked up more than 380,000 views. June 29, 2018: Snopes reports QAnon billboards appearing in Georgia and Oklahoma. July 23, 2018: The Daily Dot interviews sellers of QAnon merchandise on Amazon, Etsy, and TeeSpring. July 31, 2018: QAnon devotees attend a Trump rally in Tampa, Florida, holding ""We Are Q"" signs. August 24, 2018: Prominent QAnon promoter Michael ""Lionel"" Lebron poses for a photo with President Trump in the Oval Office. September 12, 2018: Reddit bans the main QAnon subreddit, r/­great-awakening, for inciting violence, harassment, and the dissemination of personal information. At the most disturbing, you get Pizzagate: the widely debunked theory that a secret society of pedophiles ran a child-trafficking ring out of a DC pizzeria loosely connected to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Pizzagate is a good example of a relatively new conspiratogenic process. Because these days the internet can foster conspiracy by shrinking your world rather than growing it: Between algorithmically reinforced filter bubbles and topic-focused communities, its easy to live your life almost wholly within a conspiratorial alternate universe. Speculation inside the Pizzagate echo chamber (which got even echo-ier after proponents of the theory were kicked off more mainstream platforms like Reddit) eventually reached such a pitch that a believer drove across multiple states to fire shots within the pizzeria. Fortunately no one was injured. But really, the worst is likely yet to come. Were facing a complete crisis of digital trust. Theories about paid crisis actors pretending to be disaster victims are nothing newthe black children integrating schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957 were also accused of being paid shillsbut these days, crisis actor conspiracies follow every protest, every riot, every shooting. Establishing what is real and what is fake is only going to get harder. New technology that relies on machine learning can manipulate video and audio to seamlessly simulate interviews and speeches that never occurred. Similar tech has been leveraged to create deepfakesnonconsensual pornography in which a victims face is digitally grafted onto an adult performers body. It doesnt take much imagination to see how this tech could be used by propagandists to spread misinformation about celebrities, world leaders, or, really, anyone. Seeing images hasnt been believing for a while now, but with AI-enabled fakery, nothing will be. The Future of Online Conspiracy So how do these things actually get started, and how do we stop them? Take the idea that liberal Jewish billionaire George Soros is actually an evil puppetmaster bent on selling out the interests of the average American for his own ends. Soros has been cast as the 21st century Elder of Zion. And if you ask certain (typically, ultra-far-right) corners of the internet, hes bankrolled everything from the Womens March to mass-shooting crisis actors to Pizzagate to the Snopes articles debunking these claims, for little other reason than his being liberal, a billionaire, and, of course, Jewish. So how does a swath of the internet find that credible? It starts with the actual puppetmasters: propagandists. In Soros case, thats the Kremli, and American nativists whose aims are (maybe or maybe not) coincidentally aligned with Russias. Soros actual beef with both groups goes back many decadeshe is a prolific funder of progressive political groups in both the US and in former Eastern Bloc nations. But really, the mythos of Soros the Boogeyman has very little to do with the man himself and everything to do with his supposed agenda: globalism. Russia wants to keep US influence away from its borders, and white supremacists and other purveyors of America First politics want a way to demonize their opposition. But they cant just come out and say that. Elements of a Conspiracy Theory The Beautiful Mind Multiparagraph screeds (or very long YouTube videos) connect ever-unlikelier dots to come to a scandalous conclusion. Every conspiracy theory needs one of these to refer back to as a kind of digital holy text. Example: the Flat Earth Society FAQ page. The Photo Comparison Photo collages are how conspiracy theorists try to prove that one of these things is (or isnt) like the other. The subjects tend to be pixelated, shot from odd angles, or straight up photoshopped. Example: posts claiming the grieving families of children killed in mass shootings are crisis actors because they look similar to the parents of other slain children. The Symbologist Of course, all these world-running secret societies need some way to communicate without being caught. Some conspiracy theorists specialize in spotting alleged secret symbols, and then posting guides so fellow sleuths can find the hidden meaning in that gesture, image, or hashtag. Example: the intense analysis of Jay-Z and Beyonce flashing triangle hand symbols representing the Eye of Providence and their Illuminati membership. Or, you know, Jay-Zs record label. The Constant Contrary Comment For every article or post about a major celebrity or organization, political entity or issue, there is bound to be someone down there calling you an idiot sheep blinkered to the harsh reality of your sheeply life. Example: Seriously, just about every comments section. But especially on articles making wild claims like: NASA has been to the Moon. The Alex Jones This form of conspiracy theorizingwhich can occur in either video or text format, though its most common amongst YouTubers and guests on Hannityneeds no evidence to support its outlandish claims. It just needs fervor. They are so furious/hurt/scandalized/righteous about this thing youve never heard of but definitely should care about. You should be too. This thing is BAD. Its SAD. Its UNAMERICAN. Thats all you need to know. Example: Infowars, Trump tweets ending in WITCH HUNT! Creating the illusion of populism, of being a true narrative put forth by everyday people who refuse to be hoodwinked anymore, is where their propaganda power lies. On the internet it is exceedingly easy to manufacture the illusion of popular support with bot armies and coordinated hashtag campaigns that can drive #soros and #globalism to the top of a platforms trending topics. People who are conspiracy minded and distrustful of authority want to hear from people like themselves, and internet users record for being able to distinguish human from bot, earnestness from irony, genuine grassroots movement from Russian-led bamboozlement campaign is dismal. What about folks who are a touch more skeptical? Well, credulity is context dependant. A wild story youd probably dismiss on a street corner sounds more plausible coming from a source you believe in. And slowly, over the past two decades, for both better and worse, the internet has won people over at the same moment that our collective faith in time-honored institutions is collapsing. Is it so outlandish to think the fluoride in the water supply is actually bad for you when stories about pharmaceutical companies paying doctors to endorse their products or Big Sugar funding organizations that demonize fat come out all the time? Even people who will dismiss whats trending on Twitter may believe the headlines flitting across their screensand, as you may have heard, the news ecosystem is flooded with Kremlin-linked fake news. The internet also makes it easy to find pseudo-experts to lend credibility to your theory. As celebrities, Soros-truthers like Roseanne Barr and Infowars Alex Jones statements automatically carry authority (and hence, truthiness) for many, and social media gives them unprecedented reach. Even if youre leery of celebrity endorsements, most people automatically trust people with PhDs and academic journal credentials. But between sketchy online journals willing to publish anything for a fee, sketchy professors willing to sound off on topics well outside their expertise for a fee, and the corporations and interest groups willing to pay them, it is very, very easy to get fooled. Propaganda experts call this information laundering"": By the time the information travels from propagandist to bot to veteran conspiracy theorists to authoritative spokesperson to Hannity to news articles from respected sources debunking the theory, the grimy manipulations of those first few cycles have already been washed away, drowned out by the volume of support and backlash created by the cycles following. That process has been recycled and reconfigured for hundreds of years, and probably millennia. Trying to stop people from making up stories to support their own agendas by flagging problematic social media posts would be like trying to halt the tides with a well-placed sand castle. Because running underneath the success of all of this is a social ill that long, long predates the internet: prejudice. The Soros conspiracy theory and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion before it (and tales of baby-eating, well-poisoning Middle Ages Jews before that) only work because people are suspiciousor really, fearfulof difference. The only antidote to such a time-tested, targeted strike is empathy and understanding. Fortunately, we have access to empathy engines centuries past didnt have: relatively unfettered access to other (yes, global) communities, and something approaching democratic access to education. In other words, we have the internet. Learn More Heres One Way to Reform an Internet Conspiracy Theorist There is really no arguing with a veteran conspiracy theorist. Any attempt to debunk their theories just gets incorporated into the theory itselfyoure either with the freedom fighters battling shadowy oppressors, or youre part of the coverup.

How Liberals Amped Up a Parkland Shooting Conspiracy Theory Too often, outraged tweeters just call more attention to the thing theyre trying to pillory. Thats what happened to liberals scandalized by the far-right conspiracy theory that the outspoken highschool students who survived the Parkland shooting were actually crisis actors hired to spread anti-gun propaganda. Repugnant? Absolutely. But the tsunami of criticism and debunkings just drove more people to the websites spinning that lie in the first place.

JOSH LEDERMAN and MATTHEW LEE / The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s prospects for brokering the Mideast peace “deal of the century” plunged ever deeper as the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem opened amid bloodshed in Gaza. The day fueled global concern that U.S. policies are tipping the broader Middle East into deeper, intractable conflict. At the same time, Trump is winning international support for his efforts to strike a deal with nuclear-armed North Korea. But his contentious decisions in the Middle East are roiling a region where U.S. administrations have traditionally sought perhaps their biggest diplomatic prize: an elusive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The embassy move, which Trump hailed a “great day” for Israel even as dozens of Palestinians were killed in Gaza, damaged Washington’s stature as a mediator between those parties. And it’s but the latest in a series of U.S. decisions that may have set off a domino effect of unpredictable consequences. “Traditionally we’ve tried to play a role of fireman in the Middle East. Now we’re playing the role of arsonist,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former State Department and Pentagon official who runs the Mideast program at the Center for a New American Security. Trump’s withdrawal last week from the Iran nuclear deal, against the protestations of European allies, appears to have emboldened both Israel and Iran to move more forcefully toward full-on confrontation. In Syria, Trump’s eagerness to pull out U.S. troops as soon as the Islamic State group is defeated has forced a reckoning by Iran’s enemies about the possibility that Tehran will fill the void. Dan Shapiro, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said Washington is not responsible for the fact that Iran acts as “the major source of tension and instability in the region.” But he said the question is whether Trump’s administration, having pulled out of the nuclear deal, has a strategy to deal with Iran in its absence. Shapiro, who is now at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel, said that while some U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia have celebrated the pullout, the reaction “will soon be followed by some degree of concern about whether the administration is sufficiently focused, prepared, staffed and able to devote the necessary attention when it’s also managing another major foreign policy challenge in North Korea at the same time.” U.S. officials insist the administration remains committed to restarting the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In a speech at the embassy opening, Trump’s son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, said the U.S. “is prepared to support a peace agreement in every way we can.” Left unsaid was the fact that Kushner’s team has had to shelve Trump’s long-awaited peace plan indefinitely amid the Palestinian uproar over the embassy move, several U.S. officials have said. Since Trump in December recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and announced the embassy would move, the Palestinians have effectively cut off all ties with the White House, a diplomatic chill that augurs poorly for the possibility that Trump can now introduce a plan the Palestinians would accept or deem fair. “We’re going through a rough-patch,” U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said Monday on Fox News. “It’ll last as long as it lasts. I can’t predict, but we will be back in a position I’m confident where we’ll be discussing peace.” White House spokesman Raj Shah said the peace plan will be released “at the appropriate time.” Israelis on Monday hold American and Israeli flags with the new U.S. embassy in the background in Jerusalem. Seventy years after Israel’s founding, images of victory and violence showcased the contradictions that bedevil the Jewish state. Deadly protests flared along the Gaza border, where troops killed dozens of Palestinians even as politicians feted the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem as a symbol of the ironclad alliance with Washington. ( Sebastian Scheiner / AP ) That time, by all accounts, is not now. Responding to the embassy opening, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat dismissed Washington as “no longer a partner and a broker.” “We will not sit with them,” Erekat said. “They have become part of the problem not part of the solution, a big part of the problem. Trump’s administration is the biggest problem.” The White House response to the deaths of dozens of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli troops on Monday during mass protests on the Israel-Gaza border won’t help. The administration called the deaths “tragic” but said they were the fault of Hamas, which controls Gaza and has fomented the protests. It voiced strong support for Israel’s right to self-defense. The renewed Gaza violence has created the unsettling but real possibility that Israel — far from enjoying a new era of peace with its neighbors — could soon find itself fighting wars on two fronts: with the Hamas militants who run the coastal Gaza Strip, and with Iranian troops and Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Already, fallout from the embassy opening has spread far beyond Jerusalem, illustrating how in the delicate Mideast, one point of conflict often begets another. Jordan’s King Abdullah II took to Twitter to say the embassy move would have “dangerous implications” for security and “provoke Muslims and Christians.” Thousands gathered in Turkey to protest the move. Several nations said they were pulling their ambassadors from Israel to protest the deaths in Gaza. And Erekat announced Monday that Palestinian leadership in the West Bank had decided to file a war crimes complaint against Israel with the International Criminal Court. “The U.S. has selected one of the most sensitive, one of the most difficult issues, to step in and put forward a position that it knows will be significantly damaging to its efforts,” said Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian pollster and head of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. He said Trump proceeded anyway “because of internal pressures and right-wing tendencies and evangelicals and others.” “I cannot see the U.S. being an honest broker, whatsoever, as far as the Palestinian public is concerned,” he added. ___ Associated Press writer Karin Laub in Amman, Jordan, contributed to this report.

Emma Baccellieri,"Off another strong start by David Price, Boston cruised to a 2-0 World Series lead over Los Angeles. Here are three thoughts on the Red Sox 4-2 victory in Game 2: For the second night in a row, L.A.s Ryan Madson looked more like an arsonist than a fireman. The 38-year-old was sharp through the NLDS and NLCScertainly better than hed been during the regular season, with a rough home run habit and a 5.47 ERA. But hes now pitched in nine of the teams thirteen postseason games, and this week, he hasnt held up well. In Game 1 of the World Series, he inherited two runners and allowed both to score. In Game 2, he inherited three runners, and you guessed it. Madson relieved starter Hyun-Jin Ryu with two outs, bases loaded, to face Steve Pearce. He proceeded to throw his fastball five times in a row, missing in the same spot with all fivea five-pitch walk that, really, should have been a four-pitch walk. Theres no such thing as a good bases-loaded walk to tie a game, of course, but this one looked especially bad. That was Madsons first run, and a deep single from J.D. Martinez brought in the next two. David Price didnt quite equal his last start6.0 IP, scoreless, with nine strikeouts and no walks, for his first-ever postseason win in Game 5 of the ALDS. But he was just about as close to that as he could get, and it was more than enough for Boston. Price went six frames, allowing two runs off three hits. But all of that damage was limited to one inningthe fourth, when he allowed three singles and a walkand he regrouped quickly. Three of Prices six innings were three-up-and-three-down, including the final two. The bullpen backed him up. Bostons relievers didnt allow a single baserunner, with Joe Kelly, Nathan Eovaldi and Craig Kimbrel taking an uneventful inning each to shut it down. The Red Sox entered tonight having scored exactly half of their postseason runs with two outs, 32 of 64. They boosted that figure in Game 2, with all four runs scoring after two men were already down. This isnt anything new for the team, which had baseballs strongest two-out offense in the regular season. (Of course, it helps when youre already baseballs strongest offense, in general.) Just how good are we talking? The Red Sox had a.766 OPS with two outs. The Athletics had a.764 OPS, period. The Red Sox had a little help here in Game 2three of those four runs came from the aforementioned meltdown by Madsonbut the pattern holds. And if they keep it up, they have a chance to chase history:",The Dodgers tallied only three hits in Game 2 and now trail the Red Sox by two games in the World Series.,2018-10-25T03:32:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Si.com'}",Red Sox Shut Down Dodgers to Take 2-0 World Series Lead,https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/10/24/red-sox-dodgers-world-series-game-2-david-price-highlights,https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/images/kimbrel-ws-gm2-win.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85,,Si.com,arsonist,1
"Cory Shaffer, cleveland.com","CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Video released Wednesday shows an admitted arsonist and domestic abuser punch his attorney in the face after a judge sentenced him to nearly five decades in prison.
The video, captured by a Cuyahoga County sheriffs deputys body camera, shows David Chislton sucker-punch lawyer Aaron Brockler during his sentencing hearing Tuesday in Common Pleas Court Judge Nancy Margaret Russos courtroom.
The two-minute video also captures the ensuing scrum as courtroom security pounced on Chislton to subdue him.
The incident, first reported by cleveland.com Tuesday, stunned those in the courtroom, and resulted in Brockler being taken to MetroHealth to be treated for a concussion.
Common Pleas Court Administrative Judge John J. Russo said in an emailed statement through a spokesman late Tuesday that he was thankful Brockler wasnt more seriously hurt and wished him a speedy recovery.
This incident is a reminder that the safety of our employees, citizens and anyone else in our courtrooms should be a top priority, he said. We thank the deputies and others who responded during the incident for their quick actions, and we encourage the sheriffs department to fully review safety protocols for court proceedings.
Witnesses in the courtroom told cleveland.com Tuesday that Chislton was cuffed with his hands in front of him, instead of behind him, as is more customary.
Chislton spurred an hours-long police standoff in 2017 when he pistol-whipped his girlfriend and set his apartment complex on fire after she accused him of sexually abusing a teenage girl. Chislton also is accused of killing a dog.
He later pleaded guilty to charges including aggravated arson, felonious assault, domestic violence and cruelty against a companion animal.
Russo sentenced Chislton Tuesday to 47 years in prison. He received credit for the two years hes spent behind bars since his April 2017 arrest.

The Associated Press,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Authorities say an arsonist started a massive Northern California fire that caused $55 million in damage to an apartment building under construction. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says the April 24 fire in Concord, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of San Francisco, is the latest in a string of arsons at construction sites in the San Francisco Bay Area since 2016. The ATF on Wednesday released surveillance video of a suspect entering the Concord site, then quickly fleeing as fire erupts. The agency believes three other fires that damaged similar multimillion-dollar projects were started by the same arsonist and is offering a $110,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. ATF spokeswoman Alexandria Corneiro didn’t say whether investigators believe the same arsonist started the recent fire.","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Authorities say an arsonist started a massive Northern California fire that caused $55 million in damage to an apartment building under construction.

RT,"Pyotr Pavlensky garnered international attention and support for being a vocal government critic. His shock stunts, including nailing his scrotum to the Red Square pavement and several acts of creative vandalism, made him famous in the West.
Pavlensky’s notoriety received a boost when he was fined 481,500 rubles (€6,500) by a Russian court for setting fire to the entrance of the Russian security service FSB. No prison sentence was issued though.
Apparently, that was the last straw for the notorious stuntman as he fled the ‘oppressive’ Russian regime and settled down in France. But French life became too idyllic (or miserable?) for Pavlensky, as he and his partner Oksana Shalygina repeated his arson stunt at the door of the Bank of France in October 2017.
French judges weren’t impressed by his creative genius. On Thursday, Pavlensky and Shalygina stood trial in Paris and faced up to ten years in prison for “dangerous destruction of property.”
Pavlensky’s defense tried to add a bit of artistry to the court hearing, arguing that he set the bank on fire because he was admired by the “vanguard [of] revolutionary France” which destroyed the Bastille Saint-Antoine fortress – a symbol of repression by the 18th-century French monarchy.
“We are not in a literary salon or at an art fair,” objected the prosecutor. “You can be an artist but also a delinquent.”
Despite Pavlensky’s innovative defense tactics, his arguments fell on deaf ears with the judge who ruled that his “artistic expression” amounted to nothing more than vandalism in the eyes of the law, an act which ruined the bank’s property and endangered the public.
The artist was sentenced to three years in prison, two of which were suspended. His partner was given a two-year prison term, 16 months of which were suspended. But because Pavlensky already spent 11 months in pre-trial detention, no prison time for him is enforceable at this time.
Adding to the prison term, the pair must pay €18,678 to Banque de France for material damage, in addition to €3,000 in moral damage. 
Also on rt.comShock artist Pavlensky sets Russian security service HQ door on fire“Never!” Pavlensky yelled out loud in Russian, making clear he has no intention of coughing up the cash for his ‘artistic expression.’
Pavlensky, a native of St. Petersburg, was granted political asylum in France in 2017 after fleeing Russia with his partner and their children following sexual assault allegations. Aside from the Red Square and FSB performances, he also sewed his mouth shut, laid naked in a cocoon of barbed wire and cut off a piece of his ear.

The investigation into a fire at an unfinished residential complex in West Oakland intensified Wednesday as federal agents arrived and officials revealed that an arsonist started an earlier blaze at the site. The massive fire broke out early Tuesday at a project called Ice House, a group of all-electric, solar townhomes. The construction site was targeted by an arsonist on April 29 in a smaller fire intentionally set in a stairwell, a city Fire Department official told The Chronicle on Wednesday. “Somebody came in there and set it,” the official said, adding that how it was started is still unknown. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives unit that arrived Wednesday was to be made up of as many as 20 agents as part of a national response. The team will likely include fire investigators, an accelerant-detection canine team, forensic chemists, electrical engineers, fire protection engineers and other agents versed in probing large-loss fires and interviewing witnesses, said Gregg Hine, a retired ATF agent who operates a private fire investigation firm on the East Coast. The federal team members will work with local authorities to determine the fire’s cause and origin. A criminal investigation could arise from the probe if the blaze is determined to be arson. “Two people can’t do all that needs to be done for this,” said Javan Smith, one of two investigators with the Oakland Fire Department. “ATF has the resources and manpower on standby.... You start from the outside and you work your way in.” The cause of the fire that broke out at West Grand Avenue and Filbert Street has not yet been determined. City Councilwoman Lynette Gibson McElhaney, who represents the West Oakland district, said she was pleased that the developer committed to rebuilding. Before the project began, the city block contained a row of closed and partially demolished commercial warehouses — a source for tagging and illegal dumping, she said. “If this is an act of arson it is not victimless,” McElhaney said. “People could have lost their lives but for the swift action of the Fire Department. Burning a building does not stop people from building. It doesn’t stop gentrification. It’s just a threat to lives and property.” After a series of arsons at housing projects throughout the East Bay, investigators and city officials have created reward funds and encouraged developers to increase their spending on security, including surveillance video, in an attempt to end the trend of construction site fires. Despite the effort, one expert said arson investigations rarely lead to prosecution. “Arson investigations are amongst the most challenging of all criminal investigations,” said Steve Carman, also a retired ATF agent and fire investigator. “The percentage of successful arson investigations and prosecutions are rather low.” The first step to any fire investigation is to figure out whether it was due to a criminal act, which can sometimes can take weeks. If the blaze is arson, investigators will then look for evidence to tie an individual similar to any criminal investigation, Carman said. ATF’s National Response Team “will look at the current situation as well as past incidents to examine the possibility of similarities,” he added. What usually makes arson investigations challenging is the lack of witnesses, Carman said. “Most investigations rely on some level of physical evidence,” he said. “When that is mostly destroyed in a fire, as you might imagine, the challenges increase.” Hine, who investigated a handful of arson cases involving construction sites, said the motives range from environmental concerns to aggrieved feelings of community members opposed to the project. “Was it a serial arson, random vandalism, target of opportunity? Finding a motive can help you get on track, so to speak, and narrow your investigation,” he added. On Wednesday, several ATF investigators and Oakland police officers walked through the wreckage of the 126-unit condo. Crime-scene tape surrounded the project that was charred and turned to ash. As part of their investigation, officials with the ATF will analyze smoke and fire patterns and pathways in hopes that it will give a better picture as to what occurred when the construction project started to burn, Smith said.

Kevin,"As we’ve discussed several times now, only on the rarest of occasions would it even be worth the effort to try to escape from the authorities in some way that involves a body of water. Just to recap, once you are in the water, you are necessarily going to be much slower than they are, and unless you are equipped to survive in the water for long periods of time (tip: you aren’t), it’s easy for them to wait you out. And this is setting aside the potential risks, such as primarily death, that stem from you trying to flee through a large quantity of liquid that you cannot breathe, eat, or drink, and which is known to be full of beasts that would gladly eat you. See, e.g., “ Bad Places to Hide: Atlantic Ocean ” (Sept. 5, 2017) (shark); “ Bad Places to Hide: Island in Alligator-Infested Lake ” (Mar. 30, 2016) (alligators); see also “ New Assault Charges for Rogue Canadian Golfer Who Tried to Escape on Ice Floe ” (Feb. 26, 2018) (whatever lives in the Petitcodiac River, also risk of freezing). But does anyone listen to me? Well, yes, they do sometimes, which is good because that’s part of what I get paid to do, actually. But do people thinking of trying to escape through bodies of water listen to me? Nope. This guy (see above) certainly didn’t. According to the Hood River News —which I will admit I first thought was the “Hoo Driver News,” based on its URL—he leapt into the Hood River in Oregon at the end of an unsuccessful attempt to flee from police in a vehicle. And as is virtually always the case, the attempt did not get any more successful once he left the vehicle and entered the water. “Authorities went to the south side of the Hood in case he swam directly across,” the article reports, “and stationed themselves on both sides of the swiftly moving river.” Yep, that’s how it works. You: immersed in water, mobility low. Them: not immersed in water, mobility therefore higher than yours. Outlook: poor. Especially poor here, because in addition to the huge and carnivorous salmon that I assume swarm just below its surface, yearning to feed on human flesh (I’m not real fond of deep water, as you may have noticed), the Hood is extremely cold this time of year. So is the Columbia, the much larger river into which the Hood feeds and into which the suspect was rapidly swept. Now, I am going to give the Hoo Driver News points for saying that the “suspect led law enforcement on a tense and watery half-hour chase,” although I’m not sure “chase” is the right word and I’m pretty sure “led” isn’t. He might have been ahead of them, but that verb’s too active for somebody who was just being neutrally buoyant: In a 30-minute drama witnessed by several law enforcement officers and members of the public, [the suspect] floated with the current, past the confluence with the Columbia and out into the main river channel. “He was really cold, the river temperature is probably below 60, and he didn’t have much time [left],” said Sheriff Matt English. Officers feared for the man’s safety, considering the strength of the current and how long he was exposed to frigid glacial water in the Hood. “You don’t want to get out in that channel!” Deputy Noel Princehouse called at one point while the man was still within earshot…. “Come on in, please don’t do this!” and “That water’s cold, just let us bring you in!” were other calls by officers. Nothing to see here, officers. Just a friendly local otter or salmon. (Photo: Kirby Neumann-Rea for Hood River News ) He does not seem to have been struggling or trying to reach officers, because like I said, people thinking of trying to escape through bodies of water never listen to me. I’ll just float quietly along here, he probably thought instead, on down the mighty Columbia and out into the Pacific, later to quietly paddle ashore at an isolated beach and live out my days as a free man, assuming the police don’t, like, have a boat or something, in which case I am screwed. They had a boat. (They almost always do.) Pro: they saved his life. Con: no escape, and in fact four additional escape-related charges on top of the probation violation that triggered the whole thing in the first place. For whatever reason, Oregon law refers to this as “eluding,” not “escaping.” I think those probably mean the same thing, but I assume Oregon’s use of the former is why the reporter insists on referring to this as a “watery elude,” or more specifically a “river elude.” That just seems very wrong, even if he’d clarified that it was just an attempted watery elude. On the other hand, maybe it’s unnecessary to say it was only an attempt, for the reasons explained above.

Kate Riga,"Louisiana Fire Marshall Butch Browning (pictured above) said Thursday at a press conference that the suspected arsonist, Holden Matthews, behind a series of recent church fires is believed to have been motivated by “black metal music,” which has a “history of church burnings.” “We are still vetting several motives, however we do have information investigators uncovered and that Matthews had offered, connecting him to black metal music,” Browning said. “It has an association in history with church burnings in other parts of the world.” Browning declined to elaborate further, saying that the investigation is still “extremely active” but that federal authorities will take the lead on determining if the arson was a hate crime. “A hate motive is in the federal nexus,” he said. Matthews, a 21-year-old white man from St. Landry Parish, the same area where the three historically black churches were burned, is also the son of a local police deputy. St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz, clad in a black tie emblazoned with gray handguns, dismissed any rumors that Matthews’ father, Roy, had a hand in his son’s arrest. “Holden Matthews’ father did not turn him in,” Guidroz said. “He was shocked and hurt as any father would be.” “I love Roy Matthews — he’s one of my best friends,” Guidroz added. “He knew nothing about his son’s activities.” Though the investigation is ongoing, Browning said that “we are extremely, unequivocally confident that we have the man responsible for these crimes,” adding that the quick arrest “averted what possibly could have been other crimes.” Matthews has been charged with three counts of simple arson of a religious building, eliciting a maximum punishment of 15 years in jail.","Louisiana Fire Marshall Butch Browning (pictured above) said Thursday at a press conference that the suspected arsonist, Holden Matthews, behind...",2019-04-11T15:58:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Talkingpointsmemo.com'}",Suspected LA Church Arsonist Thought To Be Motivated By ‘Black Metal Music’,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/suspected-la-church-arsonist-thought-to-be-motivated-by-black-metal-music,https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-11-at-11.34.55-AM-2.png,,Talkingpointsmemo.com,arsonist,1

Simon Kent,"The find came during an inspection of freight departing the airport. At least two “O rings” — which can be used to form seals in rockets — were detected, the Evening Standard reports. The suspect items were marked for use in the Iranian oil industry, however Border Force staff halted the shipment after becoming suspicious that the real intention was to use them in missile construction. Monique Wrench, the UK Border Force’s deputy director at Heathrow, told the Standard the suspected illicit items had been confiscated as part of staff “counter-proliferation” work. “We had a couple of O rings that we identified. O rings are pieces of rubber that go between tubes to stop leakage to seal them. They can be used in oil, but they can also be used for warheads and the like. Our staff stopped them from going to Iran. “It is a component part. It looked like it was going to an oil refinery. But the dots don’t quite join up here.” The “sale, supply, transfer or export of missile-related goods and technology” to Iran is banned under sanctions enforced by Britain and other countries. Last December, the U.S. displayed incontrovertible proof Iran has violated multiple U.N.

Michael Kaplan,"Back in the mid-1990s, if you were a Miami mobster seeking girls, guns, cocaine, the services of an arsonist, or muscle to beat down a deadbeat, Ludwig “Tarzan” Fainberg was your man. Garrulous and bearish, the dentist-turned-hood (practicing the former in the Soviet Union and training for the latter in Brighton Beach) routinely carried two pistols and operated out of his Hialeah, Fla., strip club, Porky’s: famous for a small motorized car that pulled up between the spread legs of dancers as they performed. He also owned the Russian restaurant Babushka, which was a magnet for snowbirding criminals from his homeland. A bartender characterized Porky’s as “the kind of place where you could get killed.” Babushka was so notorious that FBI agents — who described Tarzan as “a maître d’ for criminals” — bugged the booths there. They were concerned that Tarzan and his arriviste colleagues in crime would merge with Cuban mobsters — who already used brutal, bloody force to rule Miami’s underworld — and create a sort of supergroup of criminality. The fear was well founded, considering what went down when Tarzan linked up with Cuban outlaws Juan Almeida and Nelson “Tony” Yester. Almeida was a specialist in obtaining black-market goods for status-crazed drug dealers. He created a souped-up cigarette boat that went for $2 million and was presumably used to transport cocaine. Yester, a highly regarded affiliate of multiple cocaine cartels, opened European markets for Colombian narco-terrorist Pablo Escobar and went on the run in 1990 after being charged with cocaine trafficking. As chronicled in the new Showtime documentary “Operation Odessa,” the trio of cutthroat outlaws collaborated in 1996 to procure the ultimate weapon for Colombia’s money-minting Cali cocaine cartel: a military submarine. Ludwig “Tarzan” Fainberg Courtesy of SHOWTIME Tarzan, Almeida and Yester had previously teamed on multimillion-dollar deals for Colombian cocaine barons, snagging motorcycles and Kamov 32 military helicopters (with two rotors and capable of transporting 5,000 kilos of cocaine via hook). The goods came from sources in the freshly fallen Soviet Union, a place where everything seemed to be up for grabs at ridiculously low prices. The men were living large. ‘They’re nice guys [the cartel members], and I didn’t ask what they needed the submarine for.’ - Tarzan “If they woke up and were hungry, they would fly a private jet to Cancun for lunch,” says Tiller Russell, director of “Operation Odessa.” “Then they’d roll to Venezuela to check out a new casino. They went Maserati shopping by helicopter so they could look at the cars from the air. They had girls in every city. One can imagine they did plenty of drugs.” The submarine request, which came from Yester on behalf of the cartel, was not as outrageous as it now sounds. “They’re nice guys [the cartel members], and I didn’t ask what they needed the submarine for,” Tarzan tells The Post, speaking on a crackling phone connection from Russia. “I just called a friend who had a friend and asked if he could get us a sub. He was very serious and said he would look into it. Then my friend got back to me a couple days later and said there was just one question: ‘Do you want a sub with missiles or without?’ ” They opted for the latter. For all their camaraderie, though, the criminals’ opinions of one another were mixed. In describing Tarzan, Almeida says in the film, “He struck me as an oddball.” Tarzan classifies Almeida as a guy “who had two drinks and thought he was Tony Montana.” As for movie-star handsome, hooker-loving Yester’s first impression of Tarzan: “I said, ‘This f- -king guy is trouble.’ Thirty minutes later, I loved the trouble.” Tarzan (left) at the site of the submarine. Courtesy of SHOWTIME Abetted by the tumultuous state of the former Soviet Union — the ruble was completely devalued and state-owned resources went to whomever had the most firepower — gaining access to the submarine was surprisingly easy. “I flew to a little island near St. Petersburg, met with a retired Russian admiral, and he took me to the navy base,” says Tarzan. “There was nothing unusual about it. Everybody wanted to make money. I hoped to walk away from the deal with $10 million.” With little oversight, military leaders acted as if they were independent of the government. “The person they were going to pay for the submarine was the officer who let them [into the naval base],” says Russell. “As far as he was concerned, he owned the military base. He might have sold them the submarine, taken the money and walked away with the money.” Yester told the Colombians that they’d have to pay $35 million for the vessel, even though Tarzan had talked the price down to $5.5 million — plus just $600 for a crew to pilot it to Colombia. When traffickers balked at the price, Yester reminded them that it could hold 40 tons of cocaine and would pay for itself quickly. The trio convened in Russia, and snapshots of them aboard the football-field-size sub, posing with the captain, hamming it up with one another, were shown to cartel members to make clear that the submarine sale — closed with all parties naked in a bathhouse — was for real. It was a Foxtrot-class submarine, or Project 641 as the Soviets called it. Nearly 300 feet long with 10 torpedo tubes (empty in this case), it was diesel but could be converted to electric for silent running. Reuters According to Yester, the cartel provided an initial payment of $10 million. But the deal never happened. Between an undercover agent, a tap on Tarzan’s cellphone and the wiring of Babushka, federal law-enforcement agencies had enough information to shut down the sale. In January 1997, after he dropped his daughter off at school, Tarzan was arrested and hit with a 30-count federal indictment. Almeida, back in Moscow, trying to work out yet another deal and not realizing that this one had already soured, managed to temporarily elude arrest. Apparently knowing all too well how things would shake out, Yester decided to screw his partners and take off for Amsterdam with the first $10 million. As Yester laid low with the cash, cartel liaisons in the United States, aware that they had been burned, pressured Almeida to show them where Yester’s relatives lived in and around Miami. The message was that the cocaine traffickers would kill Yester’s family members. Juan Almeida Courtesy of SHOWTIME “Juan felt like he had no choice,” says Russell. “If he didn’t give them the information, he was afraid that he would have gotten killed, and he was probably right.” In the meantime, Yester may have been too in love with his eight-figure haul to really care — and there was ultimately no retribution against his family. “Ten million dollars really feels like 10 million dollars,” he gushes in the movie. “It’s a lot of f- -king paper. I said, ‘Thank you, Cali cartel. This looks great.’ ” Greed got the better of him. Even though Yester may have suspected that the cartel was after him, he couldn’t help but try to get his hands on the remaining $25 million. He called his cartel contacts and arranged to meet them in the pickup area of the Madrid train station. While out of sight, he phoned his guy and lied about being in a particular taxi cab. Upon seeing 10 thugs rush the vehicle and hijack it with the unsuspecting passenger in back, Yester realized that the remaining cash would not be forthcoming. He escaped with his life and went on the run, aiming to avoid the cartel, Interpol and US law enforcers. Tarzan managed to get light punishment for his 1997 conviction; he rolled over on Almeida and spent 30 months behind bars before being deported to Israel, where his family had immigrated, in 1999. Thanks to a successful appeal, Almeida served only 18 months for his part in the sub caper. Ludwig “Tarzan” Fainberg in 1997 AP Years later, Tarzan again found himself behind bars, this time in Panama; in fact, he was serving time in 2011 when Russell first approached him for the documentary. “I never got a straight answer [about why he was in jail there],” says Russell. “It was coke or pimping or messing with the wrong people.” Tarzan was released from the Panamanian prison in around 2016 and has since built a side career out of playing tough guys in gangster flicks shot in Russia, where he now lives. In January 2017, Almeida got federally charged by the Drug Enforcement Administration with conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to distribute. He was recently sentenced to serve around six years in federal prison. And last year, Yester was finally arrested in Rome on charges unrelated to the submarine while en route to a wedding. He was ratted out by Almeida and is currently being held in Italy. Of the $10 million, he said, “I cannot f- -king believe it how fast I spend it.” As for Yester taking a flier with the cartel money, Tarzan says he would have done the same himself if he could have and expresses no hard feelings. “One scammer stole from another scammer; of course I accept it,” he says. “Tony is my friend, and we’ll always love each other. Next time, I will steal it back from him.”","Back in the mid-1990s, if you were a Miami mobster seeking girls, guns, cocaine, the services of an arsonist, or muscle to beat down a deadbeat, Ludwig “Tarzan” Fainberg was your man.

Two cars were destroyed and two more were damaged in the fire, which broke out early yesterday at the front of the victim’s house located at the government quarters in Precinct 11 here. Nor Azman Mat Jin – a Customs senior assistant director in charge of the Goods and Services Tax – and the rest of his family were asleep when the fire broke out. A forensics team comprising police and Fire and Rescue Depart­ment personnel later found evidence of arson. “Investigators found a hammer on the bonnet of one of the cars and a lighter on the ground,” said Putrajaya OCPD Asst Comm Rosly Hassan. The case is being investigated under Section 435 of the Penal Code for mischief by fire. ACP Rosly said Nor Azman’s neighbours heard a small explosion when the fire started at around 3.30am. “It spread quickly and the entire front portion of the house was burnt, including the four cars parked there,” he said. The two destroyed cars belonged to the victim’s wife and daughter. The neighbours called out to the family, who managed to escape through the back door. There were six people in the house at the time, including two of Nor Azman’s grandchildren. The Fire and Rescue Department deployed personnel to the scene after being alerted at 3.54am. It took 30 minutes to put out the fire. Sources revealed that the victim had been threatened before. During a press conference in Dengkil yesterday, Customs deputy director-general (enforcement/compliance) Datuk Zulkifli Yahya said he was not aware if Nor Azman was indeed threatened, but this was a normal occurrence in their line of work. “We always receive threats, but that won’t stop us from performing our duties. We will not be intimidated,” Zulkifli said.","PUTRAJAYA: Evidence of arson has been found in a fire that damaged four cars belonging to a senior Customs Department officer, said police.",2018-01-23T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thestar.com.my'}",Cops: Arsonist behind fire at Customs officer’s house,http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/01/24/cops-arsonist-behind-fire-at-customs-officers-house/,http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2018/01/23/19/11/main_ni_2401_p4c_nurilyanna_1.ashx/?w=620&h=413&crop=1&hash=92E406C8850C845190A2FD023140F9E834837A40,,Thestar.com.my,arsonist,1
Edith Bevin,"Updated February 13, 2018 14:39:06 A Supreme Court jury in Hobart has rejected the claims of a 54-year-old man that he was criminally insane when he set fire to a Hobart mental health centre. David Leslie Chandler admitting setting fire to the Peacock Centre in Mount Stuart in December 2016. But in his week-long trial in the Supreme Court in Hobart, he argued that he was not guilty to arson by reason of insanity. On the day of the fire, Chandler had become agitated after calling a doctor and getting no response for more than half an hour. The court heard he had gone and purchased petrol and then travelled to the Peacock Centre, went inside the reception area and despite the presence of a receptionist, splashed petrol about and lit it. A psychiatrist hired by his legal team told the jury Chandler had schizophrenia that was resistant to treatment. Chandler had been admitted to the psychiatric ward of the Royal Hobart Hospital a number of times in the month leading up to the fire. The psychiatrist gave evidence Chandler was also suffering delusions, associated with his schizophrenia, that mental health staff were trying to kill him. But his treating psychiatrist told the court there was no delusion — rather a frustration with his treatment and its side-effects. He testified Chandler also had an anti-social disorder that made him act impulsively and without empathy. It took the jury less than two hours to return the guilty verdict. Chandler is currently being treated in the Wilfred Lopes Centre — the inpatient mental health service for offenders in Tasmania He will be sentenced in April.

Richard Winton,"Harry Burkhart told his mother he wanted to ""roast America"" after federal authorities arrested her in connection with a fraud case in Germany and threatened to deport her to answer the charges. During the holiday season six years ago, Burkhart sought to carry out his threat. Between Dec. 30, 2011, and Jan. 2, 2012, he terrorized Hollywood, West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, torching carports, garages and homes. On Friday, Burkhart was sentenced to 33 years and four months in prison for the spate of arsons, a few weeks after a jury found him sane at the time of the crimes. Prosecutors had implored Los Angeles Superior Court George G. Lomeli to sentence Burkhart to more than 60 years in prison based on his conviction for setting about 50 fires, noting that he had shown no remorse. Burkhart could have faced 89 years in prison. He is not getting a slap on the hand. He knew of his wrongdoing legally and morally. ""After he was taken to jail, he said, 'Death to America,' "" Deputy Dist. Atty, James Falco said. Besides the property damage, Falco said, Burkhart scarred many people's lives for years to come. None of the blazes resulted in injuries. But Lomeli said the sentence was substantial for the 30-year-old German national. While a jury found Burkhart sane during the crimes, he has a history of mental illness, the judge noted, and was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor. He expressed surprise that the defendant attended the sentencing. ""He is not getting a slap on the hand,"" Lomeli said. ""He knew of his wrongdoing legally and morally."" Burkhart sat in a wheelchair motionless, looking straight ahead, and showed no reaction as the judge handed down the sentence. Before sentencing, his attorney Steven Schoenfield told the judge that Burkhart had turned down a deal offered by prosecutors for a 23-year prison term because his mother told him to reject it. Dorothee Burkhart is believed to be in Germany. The status of her case there was unknown. His mother's influence and Burkhart's mental state have been at the center of the proceedings since his arrest. Burkhart has been hospitalized numerous times for psychiatric illnesses. He began setting the fires after his mother's arrest in connection with a fraud case against her in Germany. The fires were set during the night, putting residents on edge. Most were set under vehicles in carports or near homes. Residents turned to social media to get updates on the fires, with some peering out windows into the dark, keeping porch and garage lights on, and fixating on sirens in the distance. Police initially were stumped. Finally, a reserve sheriff's deputy spotted Burkhart's minivan in West Hollywood and stopped it near the Sunset Strip. The driver appeared to match a grainy video of the suspect. Officials found fire starter sticks, police said. Burkhart, who was born in Chechnya before growing up in Germany, was arrested in the early morning hours of Jan. 2, 2012. Police later retrieved videos of Burkhart buying the items and of him visiting the German consulate with materials in his possession. At the time of the arson attacks, Burkhart was already suspected of burning down his family home in Germany's Schwalm-Eder district, north of Frankfurt. His mother had escaped from handcuffs while in German custody on fraud allegations and fled with her son to Canada before entering the United States. Authorities captured her in Los Angeles.","Harry Burkhart told his mother he wanted to “roast America” after federal authorities arrested her in connection with a fraud case in Germany and threatened to deport her to answer the charges.

https://www.facebook.com/emilyheil,"Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman on Monday morning came more than prepared to make headlines during an appearance on ABC’s “The View.” “I suspect it is Pence’s chief of staff,” she said, fingering Vice President Pence’s top staffer, Nick Ayers, as the anonymous author of the now-infamous op-ed in the New York Times that portrayed President Trump as incompetent and dangerous, something she had previously suggested. Boom! A follow-up: Pence, she says, is already lining up donors and building a team to run for president. Pence has denied that he or anyone who works for him was behind the op-ed. “I’m 100 percent confident that no one on the vice president’s staff was involved in this anonymous editorial,” the vice president said during a Sunday interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I know my people.” Omarosa, though, was just warming up. She then discussed how she and other top staffers sort-of joked about Trump being removed from office, backing up a claim by the anonymous op-ed author. Omarosa said she and other White House staffers “coped” with their boss’s bad behavior by sending each other messages with orange emoji or the hashtag #TFA, an acronym for the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which deals with presidential incapacity and succession. She said she now regrets not sounding a warning earlier. “I was too close to realize how damaging it was,” she said. “Instead of hashtagging, we should have been calling our congresspeople... calling the Justice Department... putting America on alert.” Omarosa described how her look inside the workings of the White House, which she documented in her tell-all book “Unhinged,” caused her to turn against her onetime friend. “If you discover a friend is an arsonist, you’re not going to hand them gasoline,” she said. “I discovered Donald Trump was an arsonist trying to burn this country down.” [ Omarosa is good at getting fired. She’s even better at talking about it on TV. ] And that was all before she got around to airing a secret tape she recorded of President Trump, which “The View” had been hyping ahead of the sit-down. The audio recording turned out to be slightly less of the promised bombshell: It was Trump rambling about (guess who?) former rival Hillary Clinton during a meeting of White House staffers. Omarosa played an audiotape she said came from a meeting in October of the communications and press team, which had been about tax reform — at least until Trump crashed it. (When Trump “got bored,” she said, he would walk around the White House and sit in on meetings.) In the tape, Trump can be heard discussing Clinton and then-new reports that his rival’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped pay for opposition research by a former British spy. “I think Hillary’s getting killed on Russia stories,” he began, before launching into a convoluted discussion of how much he thought Clinton had paid, claiming Clinton had used a law firm as an intermediary. And he concludes with a hopeful analysis. “So the Russia thing seems to have turned around, don’t you think?” Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders can then be heard agreeing with him. “This was a meeting with the entire communications staff and the press shop, meeting to talk about tax reform,” said Omarosa, who has been doling out snippets of countless hours of tapes she secretly recorded during her White House tenure. “He crashed the meeting, he came into the meeting, he sat down and he starts rambling from topic to topic. None of it makes sense.” Omarosa’s day of dragging her former boss wasn’t over, though — she appeared later on MSNBC, where she unveiled another snippet of audio from the same meeting. In this recording, Trump can be heard discussing (again, in what sounds like a rambling aside) the attack in Niger earlier that month in which four U.S. troops were killed. “I don’t think I’d want to be a terrorist now,” Trump concluded, as his aides laughed. “It’s not a good life.” Omarosa said it was inappropriate for the president to turn a discussion of a deadly attack on service members into a punchline, noting that Trump’s condolence call to the widow of one of the troops killed in Niger later turned controversial after the widow said the president was insensitive and didn’t recall her husband’s name. “He’s making light of the situation,” Omarosa said. “It’s not a laughing matter.”",Washington Post Omarosa says she suspects Pence's chief of staff wrote anonymous New York Times op-ed Washington Post Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman on Monday morning came more than prepared to make headlines during an appearance on ABC's “T…,2018-09-10T17:14:39Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",Omarosa says she suspects Pence's chief of staff wrote anonymous New York Times op-ed - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/09/10/omarosa-says-she-suspects-pences-chief-of-staff-authored-anonymous-new-york-times-op-ed/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CnydDxH4WIqSsKx3RkMgzL2Apjw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O6HXLE3UEM6C5FWKJUYFMDZGEM.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,arsonist,1
Bruce Haring,"Fresh off a triumphant victory on his Supreme Court nominee’s confirmation, President Donald Trump was on the attack against Democrats at a rally in Topeka, Kansas on Saturday evening at the Kansas Expocentre. Trump was in the state stumping for Republican gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, the state’s attorney general, and Congressional candidate Steve Watkins. Although he was relatively restrained in his prior comments on the Kavanaugh confirmation, he now told the crowd what he really felt about the nomination process. Labeling the Democrats as “radical Democrats” in what may be his new marketing phrase for the opposition, Trump crowed to the crowd that he stood before them “on the heels of a tremendous victory,” and announced he had signed the judge’s commission on Air Force 1 on the way to the event. He added that he would formally swear in Brett Kavanaugh at a White House ceremony on Monday evening. Trump thanked Republican Senators for “refusing to back down” in the face of the “shameless campaign of political and personal destruction” against Kavanaugh. “From the moment we announced, radical Democrats sough to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy,” Trump said. He praised Kavanaugh’s “great character and intellect,” calling him a “totally brilliant scholar, loving husband and devoted father and faithful public servant, and he always has been.” Trump added: “What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable. In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob.” Trump said, “They threw away every notion of fairness and justice, of decency and due process.” Trump warned the boisterous crowd in Kansas that they would have their chance to “stop the radical Democrats, and that’s what they’ve become. You see the profound stakes. If Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, just imagine the destruction they would cause if ever obtained the power they crave.” Trump added there more Supreme Court vacancies may be looming, and Democrat opposition can cause things to change very fast. “We can’t let that happen. You don’t hand badges to an arsonist, and you don’t hand power to any angry, left-wing mob. And that’s what they’ve become. They have become too extreme.” He concluded, “We’re draining the swamp and want to beat the Democrats conclusively.”","Fresh off a triumphant victory on his Supreme Court nominee’s confirmation, President Donald Trump was on the attack against Democrats at a rally in Topeka, Kansas on Saturday evening at the Kansas Expocentre.

Kevin,"“They’re being called the worst robbers in Belgium,” the owner of an e-cigarette shop told the BBC last week, referring to the six men he convinced to come back and rob him at closing time instead, when he would have more money to give them. He didn’t say who was calling them that, or whether the person he was quoting actually has the official authority to make such a determination. In a federal system like the EU, of course, determinations like that are at least theoretically left up to local authorities, so in Belgium that would presumably be the Belgian Federal Police. But it looks like they don’t keep track of this, or if they do, it’s not available to the public. Their website does have a sort of “ Belgium’s Most Wanted ” page, but that’s not a list of the “worst” in the sense of “least competent.” I sent them an email asking if they were aware of any Belgian robbers who were worse than these six. I had to write in English, which probably makes it even less likely I will get a response, but if so I will certainly post it. Another possible source would be the European Police Office (Europol), if the owner’s source meant something like, “we keep a list of the worst robbers in each EU member state, and we wanted to let you know that the people who robbed you are the worst robbers in Belgium.” (Europol would be in a better position to evaluate whether these robbers are worse than, say, the worst robbers in Luxembourg or Malta, but that doesn’t seem to have been the issue.) Europol does of course have data pertaining to member states; for example, I found this recent press release about the dismantling of an organized-crime group that seems to have specialized in stealing portable gardening tools. See “ Garden Equipment Thieves Reap What They Sow: Seven Arrested in France and Romania,” Europol (26 Oct. 2018). These particular robbers (well, burglars) were probably not worse than the Belgians, because they are suspected of committing at least 65 burglaries, at least 64 of which I assume were temporarily successful. Also, unless they were captured after someone caught them burglarizing a place and told them they should come back later when there would be more portable gardening tools for them to steal, they were probably not worse than the Belgians. But they did choose to specialize in stealing portable gardening tools, which should put them somewhere on the list. Again, though, if Europol keeps track of this kind of thing, they haven’t posted it on their website. Europol has a Twitter page, so I used that to ask them the same question I asked the Belgians. The chances of a response may be very slightly larger, if only because English is one of the EU’s official languages. Again, any response will certainly be posted. Could the owner’s source have been me? I do run a website that purports to specialize in “legal humor” and includes a category called “ The Criminal Mind ” containing quite a few mentions of people who did not display any special aptitude for crime. Still, a search for “worst robber in Belgium” turned up nothing at all. (My sources there are limited, unfortunately.) Did I run a broader search for “worst robber” while I was there, and am I about to tell you the results? I am. At the top of the list was this item about a Portland man who tried to rob a coin-operated car wash, but dropped his gun, which “fell apart”; and when he tried to continue the robbery armed with only a fist, he was driven off with a car-wash hose by a guy wearing a Santa hat. Man, that was a poor effort. See also, e.g., “ I Bet That Finger Wasn’t Even Loaded ” (Nov. 1, 2014); “ Busy Bank Robbers Call Ahead, Place Order to Go ” (Mar. 24, 2010); “ Robbers ‘Overly Prepared,’ Says Guard Who Chased and Sat on Them ” (Jan. 12, 2009); “ Man Claiming to Be Armed With Mouth Bomb Fails in Robbery Attempt ” (Oct. 6, 2005). They all sucked, too. But none of them were Belgian. Oh, speaking of the Belgians, turns out the owner never intended to give them any money at all! He just wanted to get them out of the store so he could call the police. He didn’t think they’d actually come back, but they did. In fact, they came back twice, but the first time it was still an hour before closing. Guys, this isn’t what we discussed: “[The owner] told local media he saw one of the robbers at the door and told them it still was not end of business.” Also, the police apparently hadn’t arrived yet, though I assume he didn’t tell them that. But when the robbers came back yet again—this time at 6:30 sharp, as requested—the cops were there. According to the report, though, only five people were arrested, so there’s at least one Belgian robber who can still say he’s not one of “the worst robbers in Belgium.” Not quite.

Jennifer Griffin,"EXCLUSIVE – Iran has built another permanent military base outside Syria’s capital city complete with hangers used to store missiles capable of hitting all of Israel, according to Western intelligence sources. Exclusive satellite images from ImageSat International obtained by Fox News show what is believed to be the new Iranian base, eight miles northwest of Damascus, operated by the Quds Force — the special operations arm of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The photos show two new white hangars, each roughly 30 yards by 20 yards, used to store short- and medium-range missiles. On Capitol Hill Tuesday, the top U.S. military commander for American forces in the Middle East said Iran was “increasing” the number and “quality” of its ballistic missiles it was deploying to the region — when asked during a House Armed Services Committee by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., about reports Iran had moved more missiles into Syria. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said Iran has “enhanced” its funding to proxy forces in the Middle East since the landmark nuclear agreement in July 2015, including sending missiles, fighters and other arms to Yemen and Syria. But when asked by Cheney what the U.S. military’s role against Iran in Syria should be, Votel replied, “Countering Iran is not one of the coalition’s missions in Syria.” The focus of the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Syria remains the destruction of ISIS and prevention of the terror group from rising up again, Votel said. Votel said in the past five years Iran successfully had created a proxy network in Yemen similar to what it took them 20 years to create in Lebanon with Hezbollah. The new Iranian base, eight miles northwest of Damascus, is operated by the special operations arm of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. (ImageSat International) A base similar to the one revealed in these new satellite photos was built last year south of Damascus, before being destroyed in December by Israeli surface-to-surface missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Tehran a month prior to the strike against building any military bases in Syria. “Israel will not let that happen,” he said. Votel’s remarks to Congress come amid criticism from the White House of Russia and Iran’s continued support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the regime’s ferocious bombing campaign in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus where 400,000 civilians remain trapped. “Syria is terrorizing hundreds of thousands of civilians with airstrikes, artillery, rockets and a looming ground attack. The regime’s use of chlorine gas is — as a weapon — only intensifies this,” said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders Monday. Votel told lawmakers that Russia is standing in the way of any lasting ceasefire in Syria. In the past few days, 500 civilians have been killed in Eastern Ghouta — the same area where the regime used sarin gas in 2015. “Moscow is playing the role of arsonist and firefighter — fueling the conflict in Syria between the Syrian Regime, YPG, and Turkey, then claiming to serve as an arbiter to resolve the dispute,” said Votel, using an acronym for the Kurdish-led Syrian fighters supported by the United States. The satellite images show two new white hangars, each roughly 30 yards by 20 yards, used to store short- and medium-range missiles eight miles northwest of Damascus in Syria. (ImageSat International) The New York Times reported Tuesday that a 200-page United Nations report outlining how North Korea has been skirting sanctions and sending components to Syria for chemical weapons comes as the White House accused Syria of employing chlorine gas. It’s not the first time North Korea has been accused of supporting Syria’s weapons of mass destruction. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said he tried unsuccessfully in 2007 to persuade then-President George W. Bush to bomb a nuclear reactor in northeast Syria at al-Kibar, built with help of North Korea, casting the lone vote inside the president’s national security team. On September 5, 2007, eight Israeli fighter jets destroyed the nuclear reactor at al-Kibar, “which was the right answer,” Cheney said.

Three fires were reported shortly before midnight Saturday along the railroad tracks north of Hearn Avenue and south of Barham Avenue in southwest Santa Rosa. As firefighters were extinguishing those blazes, more fires were spotted along the Santa Rosa Creek Trail from Dutton to Fulton Road, said Paul Lowenthal, the assistant fire marshal for the Santa Rosa Fire Department. In all, 10 suspicious fires were reported. Although they were small — the largest was just under a quarter acre — they prompted a major response from firefighters still on edge after wildfires raged through Santa Rosa in October, destroying 5,143 homes and killing 23 people. “It’s very obvious given the timing and the sequence that they were intentional,” said Lowenthal, who believes the person responsible was on foot or riding a bicycle. “This is obviously something we take extremely seriously given what our community went through.

Kevin,"I had no idea what a “bull onesie” would look like, but I assumed it would be ridiculous, and I was right. And because a guy wearing one tried to burn down a trailer using a pot of spaghetti sauce and a washcloth, I assumed this happened in Florida. I was right about that too. According to News 6 in Orlando, two men are “accused of breaking into the home of a man they both dated, stealing several items, then leaving spaghetti sauce boiling on the stove with a washcloth placed near the burner in an attempt to start a fire.” The story gets even weirder, though, in ways that require you to watch the video below in order to fully appreciate. I will just give you the highlights. The report says that the victim, who wished to remain anonymous, called 911 Tuesday morning because “the security cameras in his home”—which appears to be a large-ish trailer home—”detected motion,” and he noticed that someone had put a towel over one of the cameras. Police “was there in no time,” said the man—who, as you will see, did agree to talk on camera, but apparently on the condition that only his shoes would appear, so he is represented by what look like a pair of talking Air Jordans. That’s not how I would have chosen to frame the shot, but I salute the reporter who agreed to it. One of many ridiculous examples (image: aFREAKa Clothing) Deputies stopped a Lincoln Navigator they saw attempting to leave the area. The two men inside admitted they had been inside the home, but claimed that one of them lived there (or until recently had, I assume) and that they were just stopping by to “pick up some clothes and other items.” Based on what deputies saw in the vehicle, the items included a window AC unit, a flat-screen TV, a marijuana grinder (though they might have had that with them to start with), and, oddly, an empty jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce. More oddly, one of the men is said to have been wearing a “bull costume onesie,” but it’s unclear whether he took that from the home or had brought it along as a disguise, not that either of those things makes a whole lot of sense. Deputies detained the men and investigated the home, which “reeked of smoke.” The smoke was emanating from a pot of spaghetti sauce on the stove (likely Ragu, but the lab is probably still working on that), with a white washcloth either placed or taped near the burner. The washcloth was the source of the smoke. This seems to have been an attempt to start a fire that would look accidental, but the shoes ridiculed that plan. “He was trying to make it look like I left the stove on,” the shoes said, “but who gets up at 2 a.m. and fixes sghetti?” That’s what they said: “sghetti.” News 6 spelled it “sketti,” and I guess there’s no approved spelling, but I like mine better. The timing of all this is unclear, as is whether the shoes were home at the time of the break-in. The report doesn’t make their whereabouts clear. And it says they made the 911 call at 7 a.m., not 2 a.m. But I guess we don’t have to solve that particular mystery, since nobody would get up at 7 a.m to fix sghetti, either. Sadly, this incident seems to have resulted from a failed relationship between one or more of the men. The shoes appeared to blame one of the suspects in particular, but expressed puzzlement as to why he would have done this. “I’ve let him use my car for four months,” the shoes said, sarcastically. “Maybe he’s angry about that. Or maybe he’s angry because I gave him $150 to fix his teeth.” No good deed goes unpunished, that’s what I always say. The suspects are charged with burglary, grand theft, and arson. The bull-onesie wearer was being held without bail, not because of the onesie but because he was already on probation, according to the report. Whether that crime was onesie-related, it did not say.

Susie Madrak,"I just have to wonder: What kind of world does Joe Scarborough live in, how small is the bubble? And how wilfully blind do you have to be to not see the racism that isn't just an isolated strain, but the foundation of your party? And how do you confuse Ronald Reagan's shining rhetoric for the reality of his war on the working class, in this country and in others? Is it upholding democracy to fund illegal wars and lie about it to Congress? I'm scratching my head. Watch as Scarborough and his guests struggle with the reality that was right in front of their faces for a long time. And if they were in such deep denial they couldn't see it, Hillary Clinton spelled it out for us! Your reaction? To attack her for talking about deplorables! ""It's like we can't be shocked by Donald Trump because we know who he is. We know what's in his DNA. But the way people react, turn the lens to those crowds after this horrific shooting, this tragedy,"" Charlie Sykes said. ""They're talking CNN sucks, chanting lock her up. The moral test to the Republican party that they have failed over and over again, the president has been a man who has stoked our divisions, has stoked the fear and the hostility, has created this toxic stew. and we're being reminded the number of people out there who take him both literally and seriously. ""So at one level you have people who are willing to rationalize and defend his behavior, but also you have the folks out there, the haters who draw oxygen from what this president has done, from the whistles that he has sent. That's what makes this such a dangerous time. the fact is the president of the United States is the arsonist in chief."" ""Rick Wilson, I'm naive,"" Scarborough said. ""I never believed what liberals said about us all along. I never believed there was this undercurrent in the Republican party of racism, nativism, anti-semitism. ( Editor's note: You grew up in Alabama and this never occurred to you? ) We spent our entire lives telling people it wasn't true. I'll be damned, I'm 55 years old. Bingo, they had us exactly right. They had the party exactly right. What are we to do now?"" Gee, Joe. Maybe have some real liberals on your show and listen to them? Just a thought! ""Joe, this is emblematic of the entire problem of the Republican party being bought out by Trumpism. It revealed a segment of our demographic, a part of our party we wanted to pretend was in the closet, we kept them in the basement and hosed them off once a year on Election Day, and unfortunately we now have to face the fact that that element feels empowered and emboldened,"" Rick Wilson said. ""They read tweets like today -- I'm sure that tweet sounded better in the original German --and they're not taking it as some sort of joking Trumpism. They take it as marching orders. And maybe it's only a tiny fraction, but it only takes a tiny fraction to march into a synagogue and kill 11 people. It only takes a tiny fraction to send out 14 bombs It's not a dog whistle, it's an air raid siren. ""But Rick, the problem is, 90% of Republicans support him. You have people chanting in the crowd. I would have never, ever, ever over five decades predicted this would happen. After people were targets of bombs, that you actually still have the president of the United States still attacking those people and people in the crowd more disturbingly chanting attacks at CNN and Hillary Clinton 'lock her up!' Where were they raised? Not in my neighborhood."" (Well, Joe, they were raised in the same neighborhoods most white people live in, the same ones that wouldn't allow black people to move in. Am I wrong in guessing you didn't have any black neighbors? Because that's how the hatred starts, and that's how it grows.) ""They were raised in the post-2010 era. They repeated over and over again conspiracy theories and stoked the sense of inferiority,"" Wilson said. ""The victim complex, 'I'm a victim, Hollywood doesn't like me, the media doesn't like me,' but hold on, I own the Supreme Court, I own the United States House of Representatives, I own the United States Senate, I open the United States presidency, I own the Justice Department, I own the DHS, I own everything but i'm still a little snowflake who gets their feelings hurt when Hollywood does a movie I don't like. Please explain that to me. They own the world and they're still victims?"" Scarborough said. ""This is a sign of how fundamentally weak Donald Trump is. The guy is a quivering blob of man-baby goo,"" Wilson said. ""He's a tantrum-throwing infant all the time, He knows his base loves that sense of alienation. They love being reminded that certain people can read and they don't read so good. And they love that sense of somebody who's going to be their champion and stoke their anger and tell them all their resentments are justified. That's part of what you and I fought against and Charlie fought against and Peggy fought against for so long, is the acknowledgment that there are people who want to have their fears stoked."" (So Peggy Noonan never heard of Lee Atwater, or the Southern strategy? Odd.) ""Donald Trump is an arsonist, as Charlie said, and in a whole spectrum of areas that we have to acknowledge that his unique social media power makes that arsonist incredibly dangerous for this country and this republic."" Yes, the arsonist in chief is happy to burn it all down. And the dirty hippies were right again.","I just have to wonder: What kind of world does Joe Scarborough live in, how small is the bubble?

Katherine Ramsland Ph.D.,"Just how separable fiction is from its author is an endless debate, but some literary expressions might be inadvertent autobiographical leaks. Still, should such peeks into an author's life become legal evidence? David Grann describes such a case in The Devil and Sherlock Holmes. Commissar Jacek Wroblewski, a detective in Poland, spotted a link between the unsolved torture murder of Dariusz Janiszewski in 2000 and an intellectual named Krystian Bala: Janiszewski’s missing cellphone. Janiszewski had been scooped out of a river near Wroclaw, his wrists bound behind his back and tied to a noose around his neck. Soon after he'd gone missing, Bala had sold the phone online. Wroblewski learned that Bala had published a sadistic pornographic novel, Amok, which hinted at the murder of a man and included the murder of a woman that had some similarities to Janiszewski. Bala’s former wife, Stasia, acknowledged that Bala had used facts from their relationship in his novel and that she’d once dated the victim, which had upset him. This suggested that Amok had autobiographical leaks. The main character was “Chris” and Bala had used this name for his own emails and online transactions. Maybe there was more to these parallels than some blurred lines. Under arrest, Bala protested that he’d merely used news reports for the plot. However, his character obsessed over the same philosophical themes as he did, had been similarly abandoned by his wife, had a similar run-in with police, had the same drinking problem, had gone through bankruptcy, and had Bala's narcissistic sense of superiority. Bala had known about his wife's date with the victim, and soon thereafter Janiszewski had disappeared. Then Bala had published the novel. A phone card held further incriminating evidence. During the trial, there was heated resistance to the idea that fiction could be used as evidence, no matter how realistically it depicted an actual person or event. Bala had vehemently argued that the author stands apart from his work. Still, he'd sometimes talked about his character as if Chris were him. The court heard witness reports that Bala was a control freak, ""pathologically jealous "" of his wife and inclined toward sadism. A psychological assessment confirmed his ""sadistic tendencies"" and his need to demonstrate his superiority – just like Chris. The behavioral evidence, including the novel, spun the circumstantial evidence against Bala. He was convicted. The idea of autobiographical leaks becoming maps to murder also showed up in the case of serial lust killer Gerard Schaefer. A former deputy sheriff in Florida, he peld guilty to the assault of two teenage girls in 1972 and was soon linked to the murders of two more. When police confiscated items associated with missing and murdered women from his room, he became a suspect in other murders. In addition, he’d written and illustrated a manuscript about hangings from a killer’s point of view that seemed to mirror what he'd done. Had more convictions been pursued, the manuscript might have become key evidence. Even more clearly tied to a crime was an arson investigator’s novel. The case began with a fire that leveled a store in 1987 in Bakersfield, CA. Arson investigators found a time-delay incendiary device made from matches and a cigarette. When two nearby craft stores burned down in the same manner, officials believed they had a serial arsonist. Plotting other recent fires along a map, they discovered that most had been set near interstates. The roster of a conference for fire officials in the area included participants who’d traveled through the fire zones. Yet the investigation went cold until several deliberate fires occurred near another such convention. Ten participants had attended both. Advanced technology on a fingerprint linked it to John Orr, one of the ten on the suspect list. An experienced arson investigator, he’d been seen at most of the fires. This suggested he might be getting a sexual thrill from setting fires. When Orr was arrested and charged, investigators found an extensive collection of home videos of the fires, as well as a draft of a novel he’d written, Points of Origin, about a serial arsonist named Aaron Stiles, who was a firefighter. Orr had aspired to become a bestselling writer and the manuscript mirrored many of the actual fires. This helped to build a case and Orr was found guilty of three counts of arson. He pled guilty to three additional counts and was sentenced to 30 years. But more serious charges were also filed. In 1984, an Ole’s Department Store had burned to the ground, fed by polyurethane foam inside the building. Four people had died, including a two-year-old boy and his grandmother. In Orr’s novel, he’d described an identical fire in a store called Cal’s, including the death of a fictional grandmother and her young grandson – a boy with the same name as the actual victim. Defense attorneys scoffed at the idea that evidence for a murder case could be found in a work of fiction, but Orr was nevertheless convicted of murder. Mark Twitchell also aspired to be a best-selling writer. Inspired by the TV series, Dexter, he’d lured two men, one at a time, to his amateur film studio in Edmonton, CA. He pressured them to participate in his feature about a sword-wielding serial killer. One man escaped, but the second targeted victim was not so lucky. Twitchell killed and dismembered him in the way he’d seen on the TV show. Soon, he was arrested. A key piece of evidence presented for first-degree murder was a document from his laptop called SK Confessions. It opened with: ""This story is based on true events. The names and events were altered slightly to protect the guilty. This is the story of my progression into becoming a serial killer."" Well, others have written fiction in first-person, posing as some type of homicidal offender, but Twitchell’s manuscript details closely matched the evidence from his studio and the witness report. It described his failed attempt just as the escapee told it. He had indeed used fake dating profiles to lure his victims and had treated one just as he describes it. Twitchell admitted to the killing but claimed it had been self-defense. He’d used the incident in the novel, he said, but had changed the facts to make it a more compelling read. He challenged his accusers to sort out fiction from fact. Apparently, his alternative version was unconvincing. In 2011, the jury convicted him. Although plenty of authors write dark fiction that has no connection to their actual lives or feelings, there are times when autobiographical leaks match criminal evidence sufficiently to help make a case. Investigators would be remiss to ignore it.","In some cases, ""autobiographical leaks"" in fiction helped to nail a real-life conviction.",2018-06-11T13:37:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Psychologytoday.com'}","Murder, They Wrote",https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shadow-boxing/201806/murder-they-wrote,https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_images/2018-06/writerkiller.jpg?itok=IEInWi37,,Psychologytoday.com,arsonist,1
J. HOBERMAN,"In his first Hollywood movie since creating the role of Norman Bates in Psycho (1960), Mr. Perkins plays a teenage arsonist, Dennis Pitt, newly paroled after years of institutionalization and given a job in a chemical factory in a bucolic Berkshires town. There he meets and seeks to impress Sue Ann Stepanek (Ms. Weld), a local high-school student who seemingly falls in line with his fantasy of being a secret agent for the C.I.A. Sue Ann who, as a drum majorette is herself a figure of fantasy, also nurses a major beef against her disapproving mother (the veteran B-movie performer Beverly Garland ). Covert antics become sinister once Dennis lose his job and decides to sabotage the factory that he believes is polluting the local river with colorful toxins. Thats one meaning of the movies title. The other refers to sprightly Sue Ann who, despite her infectious giggle, turns out to be far more pathological than her suitor. Before the movie ends Sue Anns turquoise Sunbeam roadster will seem as menacing as the Creature from the Black Lagoon. An underrated actress who began her career as a child model, Ms. Weld was particularly praised for her performance paradoxical considering her known dislike for the movie, itself striking in view of her animus toward her real-life mother. (I hate Mama! she told a Times interviewer while flashing her radiant childwoman smile.) Ms. Welds distaste notwithstanding, the stars are the movie including Ms. Garland, who steals each of her three big scenes, blithely undercutting Sue Ann in two and dying in the third. Pretty Poison also became an issue in the longstanding feud between New Yorks two most influential movie critics, Kael and Andrew Sarris. Newly installed at The New Yorker on the strength of her impassioned defense of Bonnie and Clyde, Kael fought to have Pretty Poison rereleased and, according to Brian Kellows biography, masterminded the movies New York Critics Circle award. Sarris began his Village Voice review with a dig: A covey of high-flying, high-sounding critics have managed to save Pretty Poison from a fate worse than death in the fleshpots of 42nd Street. Noting that the movie had reopened at the Eighth Street Playhouse, a showcase for European art films, he joked that unfortunately, Pretty Poison turns out to be too pretentious for 42nd Street but not pretentious enough for Eighth Street. Sarris viewed Pretty Poison as an inflated B-movie, tricked out with new wave shock cuts and imitation Alain Resnais flashbacks. Indeed, Mr. Blacks movie benefited from the au courant notion that B-movies could be a form of Pop Art. Reviewers naturally bracketed Pretty Poison with Bonnie and Clyde not least because Ms. Weld, who declined the role of Bonnie to spend time with her newborn, here showed what she might have brought to the part. More surprising in a review as knowledgeable as Sarriss was the lack of acknowledgment for the B-movie classic Gun Crazy (1950), a film he had praised as superior to Bonnie and Clyde in his 1968 history, The American Cinema.","Tuesday Weld in “Pretty Poison” and Peggy Cummins in “Gun Crazy” are fresh-faced, trigger-happy young women in two films that attained cult status.",2018-09-28T14:00:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Streaming: In ‘Pretty Poison’ and ‘Gun Crazy,’ Femmes Fatales With Deadly Firepower",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/movies/pretty-poison-film-tuesday-weld-anthony-perkins.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/30/arts/30hoberman1/30hoberman1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,arsonist,1

"Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN","(CNN)Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke likened President Donald Trump to an ""arsonist"" on immigration, suggesting the President's policies are worsening the migrant situation on the US southern border.
""Donald Trump is the arsonist who gets the credit for putting out the fire,"" the Texas Democrat said in an interview on David Axelrod's show ""The Axe Files"" that will air Saturday. 
O'Rourke argued that Trump's decision to cut off all US aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras will compound the migration crisis and asylum-seekers from Central America.
""What we need is someone who will not play games or politics with people's lives or the security of this country but will invest in the smart decisions and policies like investing in Central America to stop the outflow before it even begins,"" O'Rourke told Axelrod.
""We can try to address these problems at the US-Mexico border with walls or open arms, or we can address them in the countries of origin before they ever become a problem, and that's what I want to do,"" he continued.
O'Rourke told Axelrod that immigration is essential to economic prosperity, and that ""revitalizing rural America"" depends in part on ""ensuring that immigrants can find a home in rural America.""
""Our success as farmers, as an economy, as a country, as a democracy is necessitated upon new people coming in to reinvigorate this country,"" O'Rourke said.
As one of 18 Democrats seeking the 2020 nomination, O'Rourke has tried distinguishing himself from the pack by pointing to his time representing a border district in the US House. 
Trump ""says he's going to make immigration a centerpiece of his campaign and your answer is bring it on,"" Axelrod said to O'Rourke.
""Absolutely,"" O'Rourke replied. ""There is this community of El Paso-Ciudad Juarez that is the positive example of why immigration matters, why it makes us safer, why it makes our economy stronger, why it creates more jobs. So I'm looking forward to sharing that message and talking about safety and economic growth and jobs in a positive way that includes all of us.""","Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke likened President Donald Trump to an ""arsonist"" on immigration, suggesting the President's policies are worsening the migrant situation on the US southern border.",2019-04-12T17:58:51Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Beto O'Rourke calls Trump the 'arsonist' in migrant influx at US southern border,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/beto-orourke-trump-border-immigration-axe-files-cnntv/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190330155813-03-beto-orourke-rally-el-paso-0330-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,arsonist,1

The mat didnt catch fire, and Roman fled in his car to a nearby gas station, where police cornered him.
Police evacuated the area after spotting weapons in Romans pickup trucks, and they used a robot to deliver him a phone to use for communication with law enforcement officers. A standoff with the suspect lasted for six hours until he agreed to surrender if he could just smoke first.

What do we enjoy about villains? Or more accurately, what is it that makes us enjoy villains? Usually, if a villain is presented to us, fully formed and ready to kill or betray or do villainous stuff with a cackle, we arent going to be transfixed by their character. Lex Luther, for example: In almost every context we consume Lex Luther, he is already bald and already hellbent on destroying Superman. Boring.
No, with villains, we like a slow-burn from goodish to evil. Or a chaotic descent. We like to see elements of ourselves, ounces of humanity that can be severed and burnt and spat on so the not-yet-evil character becomes the nefarious soul the plot needs right in front of our eyes. That way, they become three-dimensional and to a degree, relatable. Thats exactly why Walter White has a place amongst televillan greats. He arrived a loving father; innocent school teacher; green-shirt and tan chinos wearer. Then, on account of the screaming cancer inside him and the financial burden associated with that, he became Heisenberg. Then Heisenberg became Walter White and vice versa and we all collectively lost our shit.
But Walter White almost became too villainous and powerful by the end of Breaking Bad, and as such, felt closer to comic book villain than flawed man. For me, what really makes a compelling evil character, is one who blends in amongst good people, seemingly no different, and yet never outwardly displays any sort of behavior that can be considered altruistic.
This is why The Offices Ryan Howard is televisions best villain ever.
Ryan Howard (B.J. Novak) appears in The Office pilot an innocent boy, fresh out of college and ready to take on the professional world. For a year or two he stumbles around, generally meaning generally well-ish, inadvertently striking up a romance with Mindy Kalings Kelly. Hes not a great boyfriend. He doesnt particularly enjoy Kelly and he lets her know that. But is he a villain at this point? Hardly, maybe just more the guy your mom warned you about. But a villain, no chance.
Then he burns down the office. And look: burning down the office doesnt ignite something in him. He doesnt get a taste and burn down every office space in Scranton, insisting people call him The Arsonist. That, my friend, is Basic Bitch Villainy. No, the fire incident simply leaves a chip on his shoulder. Hes now branded as a doofus, a fool, the office jester. Which he doesnt like.
Then, after a few twists and turns, he's promoted to Dunder Mifflins corporate office in season 4. This is when he gets the prowess he needs to take the next step in his character arc. He carries this newfound authority with pride, undermining anyone who dares speak to him, especially those in his former office. He strikes up a feud with Jim for no reason other than the fact Jim is lazy and perhaps in the same league, maybe even the one above, in terms of attractiveness. (This is a good reason to begin a feud with someone.) Kelly? Shes history. He broke up with her the second he got the promotion (when he dumps her he does this thing where he looks at the camera for literally a split second and in my opinion, this camera stare is actually better than Jims but thats a different argument for a different day.) 
Continuing this arc, Ryan would admittedly be no better than another seven out of ten villain. Funny, but obvious; simply a mean boss with vested interest in making peoples lives not as good as they could be. But a year later, Ryan is arrested for fraud and he is demoted back to being a temp.
But the thing is: His ego doesnt fall with him. Ryans scandal would cause any sane person to fall into themselves, a shell of what they once were, reminiscing about the good ol days (only when alone to avoid getting visibly upset in public). Not Ryan. He gets even more confident after his scandal, carrying around his criminal conviction and goatee with pride.
I feel sorry for anyone whos favorite character is Michael or Jim or Pam because whilst funny and objectively good, as individuals, their shtick can become slightly dull. Every moment we see Ryan take the center stage he blows the audience away. For example:
i) He pretends to be Kellys supervisor, lambasting her unrelentingly so the new boss (Will Ferrell) doesnt discover he hasnt actually had a job for years.
ii) He gives a baby whos barely 6-months-old and allergic to strawberries a strawberry so he can speak to Kelly who was previously occupied with looking after the baby.
iii) He scams Pam out of $50 for her wedding present.
iv) He conspires with Dwight to get Jim fired.
v) He ignores Michaels love, repeatedly, only ever using it for his own gain.
vi) Heand this is undoubtedly Ryans best in his oeuvre of bad guy momentsreturns from his corporate calamity to find Kelly in a relationship with Daryl. After a few thrusts of pseudo-masculinity, he has Kelly emotionally lassoed to the point where he can control her. Then he, off camera, types out a text for Kelly intended for Daryl essentially saying were over and gets her to send it.
Which is funny and pathetically evil enough alone. But after that, obsessed with the means and not the end, Ryan instantly realizes hes made a mistake. So he, unexpectedly, but very characteristically, announces he is going Thailand and thus needs to break up with Kelly. He also asks if he can have whatever she has in her savings and she obliges. And he says they should be adults and have sex one more time. She, again, obliges. It later turns out he actually went to Fort Lauderdale.
Every moment with Ryan as the focus is filled with a sordid richness that is just so clever and smart and well thought-out its genuinely one of the most enjoyable aspects of the show.
After his fall from grace, Ryan displays a more subtle, nuanced evil. The thing is: He hadnt actually achieved anything in New Yorkhe crashed and burned. But he comes back to Scranton somehow more confident, more entitled, more up himself, treating literally everyone as lesser and not worthy of his respect. 
Like a lot of the now-bald (and rich) assholes that you went to high school with, Ryan is Machiavellianism at its best. Although he doesnt commit much traditionally villain behaviorkilling, blowing up cities, taking over the worldyou know, if the situation played the right notes and his selfish tendencies were stroked a certain way, he would. Hed look literally anyone in the eye, tell them they look nice and then stab them in the chest without breaking eye contact for a second, simply waiting for their sense of being to float away.
This is the Ryan were sold; this is the Ryan I believe in. As a villain, his untapped potential, seemingly bottomless self-interest bubbling beneath the surface, is ultimately much more enjoyable than Mr. Burns or Walter White or Dexter or any other famous villain. This is because at the core he is painfully mediocre and despite how very bad and deceitful and up for chincary he is, he ultimately never achieves more than a low-tier position at a distinctly lackluster paper company.
Ryan Howard is the best ever villain because he arrives fairly nice and then becomes something larger and sinister. Hes the best villain ever because hes an amplified version of that guy you work with who got promoted despite being very shitty. He is the best ever villain because, like you and I, he spends 60 percent of his life in an office frying under artificial light. He isnt actually smart or clever enough to be exactly what he intends to be, but he tries, and it is funny to watch.

Twitter@husainhaqqani The remarks by Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's former Ambassador to the US, came as several American experts highlighted the role of the Army in the country's decision.

""Therefore, American and Pakistani interests in the region don't really coincide,"" Haqqani said.

David Aaro,"Former New Orleans Saints tight end Ben Watson may be retired but that isn't stopping him from helping his local community in Louisiana.
According to the New Orleans Advocate, Watson is assisting in the rebuilding efforts for the three Louisiana churches recently burned down in an arson attack.
SUSPICIOUS FIRES AT HISTORICALLY BLACK LOUISIANA CHURCHES 'NOTABLY THE SAME': LAWMAKER
The three Baptist churches, St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, were targeted over a 10-day span, from March 26-April 4.
On April 9, when there still wasn't a clear motive for the fires, Watson tweeted how he would follow the situation closely.
After monitoring the situation for a couple days, he decided to take action, reaching out to the pastors of the three churches, as well as the head of the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association, Pastor Freddie Jack.
""In speaking with these pastors I am in awe and inspired by their faith and courage, comforting their congregations and family members,"" Watson told The Advocate. ""Through sadness and shock they spoke of forgiveness for the arsonist and grace for tomorrow. Most importantly they spoke of being overwhelmed by support from people of goodwill and all religions from around the country. And they were humbled by what God has already done through this series of events.""
He is currently leading by example and called upon others to join him in supporting the rebuilding efforts, tweeting out a GoFundMe and address for donations.
Holden Matthews, the 21-year-old son of a local sheriff's deputy, was arrested on Wednesday on three counts of simple arson of a religious building.

Watson says he won't comment on whether or not Matthews is guilty until legal proceedings are completed.
""While I reserve judgement on the man arrested for this crime until proven guilty, the fact that black churches were burned to the ground is a reminder of the fear and pain so many communities have repeatedly experienced since emancipation,"" Watson said. ""This trauma resides deep within all of us, black and white, in America.""
The former 15-year NFL veteran tweeted how he wants the community, both black and white to come together, as brothers and sisters.

Mark Hand,"The odds of Michael Dourson getting confirmed to serve as the Environmental Protection Agency’s top chemicals regulator are growing slimmer by the day as Republican senators express reservations about the long-time industry consultant. Two Republican senators from North Carolina — Richard Burr and Thom Tillis — came out against Dourson on Wednesday, citing the nominee’s work to downplay the negative effects of a chemical that has been found in drinking water across their state. On Thursday, another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she is “leaning against” supporting Dourson’s nomination to serve as assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, The Hill reported. A vote against Dourson by Collins, combined with Senate Democrats unanimously opposing the nomination, would sink his appointment to serve as the nation’s top chemicals regulator. The downfall of a Trump nominee at the hands of Republicans would represent a major anomaly. Republican senators have voted in favor of other administration nominees with major conflicts of interest. Last week, on a party-line vote, the Senate approved William Wehrum to lead the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. Wehrum, an industry lawyer and lobbyist, has represented companies who regularly filed legal challenges to the EPA’s clean air regulations. Dourson is already working at EPA as a senior adviser to Administrator Scott Pruitt, a position that did not require him to go through Senate confirmation, E&amp;E News reported last month. It is unclear whether Dourson would remain at the EPA in his adviser role if his nomination fails. Richard Denison, lead senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, told ThinkProgress he would find it “enormously troubling” if Dourson chose to stay on “in the face of majority opposition in the U.S. Senate to his being at the agency.” Senators from many states “are hearing from their constituents about their deep concerns over Dourson, as was certainly happening in North Carolina,” Denison said. With Dourson facing intense opposition, industry-funded groups are running online advertisements in support of his nomination. The Center for Accountability in Science — a group tied to Richard Berman, a long-time industry public affairs official dubbed “Dr. Evil” by his opponents — is producing online advertising and opinion pieces in favor of Dourson, E&amp;E News reported Wednesday. On the opposite side, Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, tweeted late Wednesday that Dourson’s nomination “must be pulled” and that he should not remain in an unconfirmed role at the EPA as an adviser to Pruitt. “Dr. Dourson is too extreme and the wrong choice to oversee the chemicals Americans encounter every day,” Carper added. Dr. Dourson's nomination must be pulled, he should not remain in an unconfirmed role at @EPA and we must find a credible regulator who the American people can trust. — Senator Tom Carper (@SenatorCarper) November 16, 2017 If confirmed, Dourson, a University of Cincinnati environmental health professor, would head the division of the EPA responsible for enforcing the Toxic Substances Control Act. More than 20 years ago, Dourson worked for the EPA as a staff scientist, but his career took a very different direction when he left the agency in 1994 to found the Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, a group that has produced reports minimizing concerns about the safety of chemicals produced by companies like DuPont, Dow, and Boeing. Dourson has argued that children aren’t more sensitive to toxic substances than adults, a position far outside of the established scientific consensus. Fifteen years ago, he authored a paper paid for by the American Chemistry Council and CropLife America concluding that children over six months are no more sensitive to chemicals than adults, and may be less sensitive in some cases, Quartz’s Zoë Schlanger reported Wednesday. As head of the EPA’s chemical and pesticides office, he would oversee the agency’s regulation of industrial chemicals and pesticides — the same products manufactured by companies that funded much of Dourson’s private-sector work. “I will not be supporting the nomination of Michael Dourson,” Burr said in a statement Wednesday. “With his record and our state’s history of contamination at Camp Lejeune as well as the current GenX water issues in Wilmington, I am not confident he is the best choice for our country.” In a separate statement, Tillis’ office said the senator “has done his due diligence in reviewing Mr. Dourson’s body of work” and “still has serious concerns about his record and cannot support his nomination,” according to the Wilmington Star News. Documents uncovered by veterans groups suggested Marine Corps leaders were slow to respond when tests first found evidence of tap water contaminated with harmful chemicals at concentrations from 240 to 3,400 times levels permitted by safety standards. Camp Lejeune residents developed cancer and other ailments that were attributed to the contaminated water. DuPont and its spinoff company, Chemours, manufacture chemicals at a plant upstream of Wilmington, North Carolina. The plant produces a chemical called GenX, a potentially cancer-causing substance that is a byproduct of DuPont and Chemours’ manufacturing processes. In 2015, Dourson was paid to testify in DuPont’s defense in a lawsuit brought by an Ohio woman who alleged she contracted kidney cancer from drinking water contaminated by a toxic chemical emitted from a DuPont plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia. A federal jury in Ohio found DuPont liable and awarded the woman $1.6 million in damages. “No one who has spent decades arguing on behalf of the chemical industry for weaker safety standards should be charged with reviewing chemicals for the EPA. It would be like putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department,” Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement Wednesday. “We applaud Sens. Burr and Tillis for making public health their top priority.”",The odds of Michael Dourson getting confirmed to serve as the Environmental Protection Agency’s top chemicals regulator are growing slimmer by the day as Republican senators express reservations about the long-time industry consultant.

Beth Verge,"ANCHORAGE (KTUU) - Two Anchorage restaurants catch fire, both cases of arson. Add to that another recent arson nearby that even got the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives involved, and you might understand why local business owners in the area have been left feeling on edge.
""Since they came back twice, I am on pins and needles,"" said Donald Causey, owner of Silva Saddle Western Wear. ""I don't want my livelihood destroyed by an arson.""
Silva Saddle is a stone's throw from Yakitori Sushi and Noodle World, two restaurants housed in the same building and set on fire in Midtown Anchorage this week. 
Yakitori Sushi could be seen aflame on Monday morning, and Noodle World was lit up Thursday. Fencing was being put up the same day around the building that they and a local liquor store share.
[WATCH: Noodle World goes up in flames, caught on camera Thursday morning]
Both incidents have been deemed by officials as cases of arson, but haven't been said to be connected.
""I have heard questions in the community about, 'Is there a serial arsonist around?'"" said Fire Marshal Cleo Hill of the Anchorage Fire Department. ""And at this time, we have nothing that indicates that, at all.""
Still, those who own nearby businesses aren't at ease. All but one declined to comment for this story.
""I was upset Monday when we came to work, but wasn't concerned or nervous,"" Causey said, ""except when it happened again today.
""I was thinking about spending the night here,"" he said, ""just to watch the building.""

Sean Keane,"Ethan Hunt climbs the Burj Khalifa in Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol, one of the series' wild stunts that showcases a cool gadget. Paramount Pictures The adventures of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) have seen him and his Impossible Mission Force (IMF) teams employ some pretty wild gadgets and cutting-edge real-world tech as he hunts down the bad guys. Over more than two decades, the series has evolved from espionage-heavy conspiracy thriller into a globetrotting, stunt-driven action extravaganza for the information age. However, laptops, spy cameras and all manner of increasingly implausible gadgets remain as crucial to each fight as fists and firearms. With Mission: Impossible -- Fallout, the sixth movie in the franchise, out this week, let's look at how the gear in the films has evolved in the 22 years since the original. Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez) shows Hunt the explosive chewing gum that'll save him twice in the first Mission: Impossible. Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible (1996) The first movie was directed by Brian De Palma, and its convoluted plot centers on a mole trying to sell on the black market a disc containing the names of all the CIA's undercover agents, with Hunt framed for the crime. It's a little weird that all this sensitive data would be kept in one place -- the nonofficial cover (NOC) list -- but it certainly ensures that the stakes remain high. The film opens with a scene where Hunt tears off one of the series' signature latex masks, which look back to the TV show that inspired the movies. They're used on three occasions during the movie, but the first two are just Cruise wearing impressive latex masks (kudos to makeup artist Rob Bottin ), and the removal of the last one -- when Hunt impersonates Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) -- now looks like something out of a video game cut scene from this era. You can definitely trust Jim Phelps. For sure. Paramount Pictures We also get a little reminder of the past when Jim smokes on a plane to cover up the self-destructing of the mission briefing tape, which he receives after a coded conversation with a flight attendant. The movie's most famous scene sees Hunt being lowered into a secure mainframe room in the CIA headquarters to retrieve the NOC list, and the computer's old-fashioned trackball mouse stands out by a mile. This movie's last major gadget is explosive gum, which Hunt uses to blow up a fish tank in his escape from the IMF early on and later slaps onto the helicopter to kill two treacherous double agents after a spectacular chase sequence on a bullet train going through the Channel Tunnel. The Channel Tunnel, which connects Britain to France, was pretty fresh at this point, having opened in 1994. Hunt's team uses gadgets such as glasses that transmit unrealistically sharp video to remote watch display, floppy discs, phone booths and those chunky Nokia cell phones that we used to play Snake on (though the game didn't appear on phones until 1997 ). You know this scene, right? Paramount Pictures It also includes an early example of Apple product placement, with the PowerBook 5300c showing up several times in the movie. The company was struggling at the time (having just reported a quarterly loss of $740 million), but it set up a $15 million promotional tie-in for Mission: Impossible. This included a ""web adventure"" site, which is still viewable but sadly no longer playable. We also get a reminder of the internet's early days, when Hunt accesses Usenet -- a server protocol started in 1980 and used for sharing messages in groups based around common interests. In a Bible discussion group, Hunt uses coded language to contact arms dealer Max. This illicit exchange was mirrored in real life (in a less dangerous way) as Usenet became an ""under the radar"" file-sharing system in the early '10s. Also, Hunt doesn't even fire a gun in this movie. But that would change in... Things get a whole lot more... impossibler in the second movie. Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) This is the one with motorcycle jousting. Easily the most ""of its time"" entry into the series, Mission: Impossible 2 is the movie where Hunt transforms from spy into a near-superhuman action hero. It's directed by the legendary John Woo, and his trademarks -- doves, slo-mo and impractical-but-so-darn-cool dual pistols -- are all here. They're enhanced by a Limp Bizkit version of the theme song and Hans Zimmer's dramatic score. This ""extreme"" mentality is even evident in the gadgets, with Hunt getting his mission from a pair of Oakley Romeo sunglasses (with a HUD on lenses) that were fired to him by rocket from a helicopter as he's standing on top of a cliff in Moab, Utah. The masks become more effective with the addition of a voice changer strip that agents stick on their throat. It's a little ridiculous, but it allows them to blend in far more than they could in the previous movie and makes the reveals that much more dramatic -- and there are plenty of them. Nyah Nordoff-Hall and Hunt compete for the most beautiful hair. Paramount Pictures When femme fatale Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) is charged with infiltrating the bad guys' base, she has an untraceable transponder injected into her, allowing Hunt to creepily track her via satellite as she feeds IMF information about her evil ex -- rogue agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) -- and his diabolical scheme. Turns out he's trying to acquire the genetically modified Chimera virus, which kills victims horribly, so he can sell it to the highest bidder. The odd love triangle is one of the movie's similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious, as highlighted by ComingSoon. The movie might be more extreme, but there's some recognizable real-world tech in it too. Apple continued its partnership with the franchise and Apple Powerbook G3s are seen several times. We also catch sight of a Kodak DC290 Zoom camera and a distinctive, unidentified Motorola phone. We reached out to the company about this, but they had no info about it, so it's most likely an unreleased prototype or prop. Hunt uses the timer on a Casio G-Shock DW-6900-1V for the dramatic countdown after Nyah is infected with the virus. IMF must have upped its agents' conditioner allowance for the turn of the century, because Hunt's hair is pretty spectacular in this movie. The real impossible mission here is not getting hypnotized by it during the more balletic scenes. Keep a eye out for Dominic Purcell (who's since starred in Prison Break, The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow) as one of Ambrose's goons. Hunt's hair might be less beautiful, but he's found love with Julia. Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible 3 (2006) JJ Abrams took over as director and co-writer for the more grounded third movie. This is exemplified in how Hunt receives his mission -- from a disposable Kodak Power Flash camera with a retinal scanner -- and the focus on his personal life, with the introduction of his fiancee, Julia. The tech gets smaller too, from the microbombs the bad guys plant in people's heads to the microdot video that gives Hunt his first hint of a traitor working in IMF. Never stop running, Ethan! He's holding a Nokia N92. Paramount Pictures This traitor is helping ruthless arms dealer Owen Davian (a terrifying Phillip Seymour Hoffman) acquire the Rabbit's Foot -- a WMD he plans to sell to terrorists. Davian is a particularly effective villain, especially in the chilling precredits scene. We get a better sense of the tech behind the masks in this movie, when they make one midmission. After mapping Davian's face with multiple covert photos, they 3D print a mask and spray paint the skin tone. When Hunt puts the mask on, a clever camera pan hides the transition from mask to CGI to Hoffman's actual face. The voice changer strip is explained too -- Hunt forces Davian to read a phrase that's transmitted to Luther, who remotely uploads the voice match to Hunt's strip. It's nuts, but it creates a nice moment of tension as he waits for his voice to change. Luther Stickell returns in the third movie, which also introduces Benji Dunn. Paramount Pictures This movie also features some remote-controlled gadgets. IMF computer hacker Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) operates several sentry machine guns with a trackerball mouse early in the movie, and drones are used in the spectacular bridge sequence. In terms of real-world tech, this is the first movie in the series without any Apple products. Luther uses a heavy duty Getac 5128 laptop during the Vatican operation and several characters use Nokia N92s. This movie reveals IMF headquarters -- hidden under the Virginia Department of Transport -- for the first time and during his escape from this location, Hunt steals a Motorola DTR650 walkie talkie. The agency must have cut its conditioner budget too, as Hunt's hair is much shorter and more practical in this movie. Also, check out a pre-Breaking Bad Aaron Paul as Julia's clueless brother. Benji explains the dangers of Hunt's electro adhesion gloves in Ghost Protocol. Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) It looks like someone told Hunt to eat an Apple a day, because they are back in a big way in the fourth movie, which was director Brad Bird's first live action project -- his previous work included The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille. This movie takes a fresh approach to gadgets as entire IMF is disavowed -- Ghost Protocol -- after a rogue nuclear strategist frames Hunt and his team for bombing the Kremlin. Left without their usual support network, their equipment isn't so effective. Our first hint of this comes early, when Hunt gets his mission from a screen hidden in a grungy phone booth (protected by a retinal scanner) -- he is forced to hit it when the usual self-destruct sequence fails. The gadgets continue to fail when the team goes to Dubai and their plan is ruined by a malfunctioning mask-maker. In fact, the only mask we see in this movie is worn by the villain, Kurt Hendricks, in a slightly bewildering bait and switch. Agent Jane Carter gets ready to light the fuse. Paramount Pictures As a result of mask failure, Hunt must engage in the movie's most famous sequence. He climbs up the outside of the Burj Khalifa -- the tallest structure in the world -- using a pair of electro adhesion gloves to reach a server room on the 130th floor. The audience is primed for something to go wrong when Hunt learns that a blue indicator means the gloves are sticking (blue is glue) while red means they aren't (red is dead) When they start to malfunction, we get one of the series' most engaging stunts as he must make do without them. In a nice throwback to the second movie's sunglasses, he wears a pair of clear Oakley Wind Jacket goggles during the climb. This movie introduces high tech contact lenses that allow agents to scan crowds and identify faces, as well capturing images of nuclear launch codes and sending them to a briefcase printer (with scrambled numbers). As part of the effort to stop Hendrix, Agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must levitate by donning a magnetic chain mail suit held aloft by remote control robot as he tries to deactivate a satellite. Things get heated when Hunt confronts William Brandt. Paramount Pictures After this, Hunt drives a BMW i8 hybrid sports car with a HUD and collision detector, ahead of his final battle with Hendrix in an automated car park -- which was purpose built for the movie -- in Mumbai. The inspiration came from Volkswagen's Autostadt, in Germany. Looking at the real world tech, Apple products save the day when the IMF team infiltrates the Kremlin archives. Hunt uses an iPhone 4 to generate codes that get them through doors, then he and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) use an iPad 2 and camera attachment to project an image of an empty corridor onto a screen -- fooling a guarding into thinking there's nobody there (and offering a few visual jokes). We also see Benji using MacBook Air -- with a protective cover -- several times. Ghost Protocol gets fancy in Mumbai. Paramount Pictures It's not all Apple though -- Agent Jane Carter (Paula Patton) gathers intel with a Canon VIXIA-HV40 camcorder (which she later links to a balloon), while LG monitors can be seen in the IMF train safehouse in Moscow and Hunt tracks Hendrix through Dubai with a Dell Streak phone/tablet hybrid. Things even take a luxurious turn when she uses a Vertu Constellation Ayxta phone in Mumbai. The IMF returns to Apple for the movie's conclusion, when Hunt offers his allies iPhone 4s containing their next mission, which they choose to accept. This gives us our first hint of the Syndicate, leading directly into... Hunt and Brandt spring a trap in Rogue Nation. Paramount Pictures Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015) … the one that opens with its biggest stunt, in which Hunt hangs off the side of an Airbus A400M military transport plane. The fifth movie is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who rose to fame as co-screenwriter of The Usual Suspects and previously teamed up with Cruise as director of Jack Reacher. After the high-octane pre-credits scene, we go old school for Hunt's briefing, which he receives in a London record store after going through an elaborate jazz music trivia Q&amp;A. Using hand print authentication on the turntable, his vinyl briefing has a suitably warm, scratchy sound until it takes a sinister turn. We learn that his briefing has been sent by the aforementioned Syndicate -- an ""anti-IMF"" shadow organization committing acts of terror -- just before Hunt is gassed and his contact killed in front of him. Ilsa Faust can match Ethan at every turn. Paramount Pictures He later encounters disavowed MI6 agent Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who proves to be his match in every way as they play a cat-and-mouse game to take down the Syndicate, led by ex-MI6 agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The situation isn't helped by CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), who sets out to dismantle the IMF and deconstructs Hunt as being ""both arsonist and fireman"" for his wild stunts over the years -- he has a point! He doesn't believe the Syndicate exists, so the IMF is shut down. Early on, we're treated to a slick, gadget-rich sequence at a Vienna opera house where an on-the-run Hunt is trying to identify Lane. Deep breathe … Benji is briefed via glasses with a HUD, scrambles security with a tiny device he attaches to the main power circuit and then uses a twinned device to transform an opera brochure into a monitor that taps into security -- with a Kindle-style monochrome screen. Benji is surrounded by gadgets in Vienna. Paramount Pictures Hunt later realizes that an assassin trying to take out the Austrian chancellor has the same kind of contact lens connected to remote camera, hinting that the Syndicate has the IMF's tech. The chancellor is later killed by a car bomb hidden in a briefcase, suggesting that the bad guys have a crazy system of redundancies. When the team goes to Morocco, Isla has a cool timer with a massive display on her wrist, hinting at the underwater sequence to come. This movie only has a single instance of the mask being used (beyond Benji's fantasy infiltration) but it's extremely surprising and effective. The branding of the real-world tech shifts in this movie, with the IMF favoring Nokia Lumia 930 phones and Microsoft Surface tablets. Members of the Syndicate use Dell XPS 15 laptops. Ethan and Ilsa confront a trapped Solomon Lane, who'll appear in the next movie. Paramount Pictures When we first meet Benji, he's playing a Microsoft Xbox One on a trio of Dell monitors -- a pretty sweet gaming setup -- and we catch sight of the non-existent Self-Destruct Edition of Halo 5: Guardians (it's unlikely that real-world gamers would appreciate such an edition) before he makes a call on a Cisco phone. In Hunt's safehouse, he shows Benji the presumed dead government agents who've joined the Syndicate on a TCL monitor. When we reach the movie's climax, the IMF captures Lane in a bespoke, bulletproof glass cell, where he's gassed in a neat mirror of what happened to Hunt at the start. However, this also means that Lane is the series' first villain to survive and he shows up (with a big old prison beard) in the trailer for Mission: Impossible - Fallout -- which also brings the series' first returning director in McQuarrie. We don't know what capacity Lane appears in yet, but we'll find out about that, Henry Cavill's mustache and the IMF's choice of phones when the movie opens on July 27 in the US and UK, and Aug. 2 in Australia.","Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to join us for this retrospective ahead of Mission: Impossible -- Fallout.",2018-07-12T21:02:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Mission: Impossible gadgets, real-world tech show how far we've come since '96 - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/mission-impossible-movies-gadgets-and-real-world-tech-showcase-how-far-weve-come-since-1996/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/bp66wrqu8X7w4T3QV8GMPeBppGo=/670x503/2018/07/12/2ad6afea-236a-40a8-97e8-c3e567bcc7e9/mi4-still-5.jpg,,Cnet.com,arsonist,1

In Louisiana, three churches burned in 10 days, and police have finally arrested a suspect; Nigerian women fight back against sexual harassment. 
Suspect arrested in black church fires 
Gerald Herbert/Associated Press
Three historically black churches were set on fire in the span of 10 days, and Louisiana police have finally arrested a suspect: Holden Matthews, 21, who happens to be the son of a deputy sheriff in the district. [Daily Advertiser / Ashley White]
The fires are now confirmed as intentionally set and related. Matthews has been arrested on three counts of simple arson, each carrying a maximum 15-year penalty. [NBC News / Erik Ortiz and Phil Helsel]
Police said they identified Matthews as the arsonist by tracking down the purchase history of a gas can that was found in the debris. According to his phone GPS, he was also in close proximity to two of the fires. [The Advocate]
Police think Matthews was influenced by black metal, a music genre that has been associated with church burnings in the past. Matthews spoke favorably about a movie on the Norwegian black metal scene that features Kristian Varg Vikernes, a controversial musician who went to prison for setting churches on fire. [BuzzFeed News / Stephanie K. Baer and Brianna Sacks]
All the churches Matthews allegedly targeted have been in the community for more than 100 years. The fires are especially disturbing because they are reminiscent of the attacks on black churches in the South during the Jim Crow era. [NYT / Alan Blinder, Richard Fausset, and John Eligon]
Although police have yet to determine if the arson counts as a hate crime, the NAACP has called the burnings domestic terrorism and expressed concern over the growing racial tensions in the country. [CNN / Josh Campbell, Samira Said, and Ray Sanchez]

Nigerian women protest harassment at street markets
Women in Lagos, Nigeria, mobilized to protest the sexual harassment they face at a local market in the Yaba district. The women wore yellow T-shirts and held signs that said enough is enough and stop touching us. [NPR / Kelechukwu Iruoma] 
The Market March happened in December, with about 20 women protesting at Yabas Market. The word Yaba and Market March became hashtags on Twitter that led to thousands of people showing their support. Even an online petition for better law enforcement on sexual harassment has gained around 23,000 signatures. [Guardian / Linus Unah] 
Sexual harassment is common in large markets in Nigeria to the point of being almost normalized. Once the demonstrations began, merchants reportedly pelted the protesters with stones and water. They also hurled insults at the women, calling them jobless and prostitutes. [WMC / Valentine Iwenwanne] 
According to the Guardian Data Desks online survey, market harassment in Nigeria is most prevalent among women ages 21 to 25, and the harassment is highest in the afternoon. [Guardian Nigeria / Torinmo Salau] 
Movements against sexual harassment that involve social media have spread across Africa in recent years. For example, female university students in Kenya, Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria have used social media to protest sexual violence by their lecturers. [Reuters / Nita Bhalla and Inna Lazareva]

"Bukola Adebayo, CNN","Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)Two Nigerian electoral commission offices housing voting materials were burned down within the space of a week -- just a few days before the country's presidential election, the nation's electoral body said Sunday.
Nigeria's Independent Electoral Electoral Commission said more than 10,000 permanent voters' cards and 755 ballot boxes were destroyed in two fire incidents in Abia and Plateau states last week.
The INEC did not say who was responsible for the fires, but it said it had notified the Acting Inspector General of Police on the ""emerging trend of burning the electoral commissions' offices"" days before the February 16 vote.
Elections will go as ahead as scheduled in the affected states, the commission said, adding that it had made arrangements to print new voter cards to replace those destroyed in the fire.
""The Commission wishes to assure Nigerians that it will not succumb to the antics of an arsonist whose motive might create fear in the minds of voters and sabotage the conduct of the 2019 general elections,"" said INEC spokesman Festus Okoye.
Nigeria is in the middle of a major campaign season leading up to the presidential polls on Saturday and general elections later this month.
The lead-up to the elections has been marked by violence, prompting warnings from the UK and US governments to say they would deny visas and likely prosecute those found inciting violence during the February 16 vote.
On Sunday, President Muhammadu Buhari alleged that corrupt politicians planned to use laundered funds to buy voters during the elections.
""The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has raised concerns over laundered money being funneled into vote buying,"" Buhari said in a post on Facebook.
Buhari, 76, is standing for re-election, and will be running against 71 other presidential candidates for the country's highest office. His main challenger is Atiku Abubakar, 72, a business tycoon and former vice president.","Two Nigerian electoral commission offices housing voting materials were burned down within the space of a week -- and just a few days before the country's presidential election, the nation's electoral body said Sunday.",2019-02-11T12:06:18Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Electoral offices burn down days before Nigeria's presidential election,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/africa/nigeria-election-offices-burned-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190211093457-nigeria-election-office-burned-down-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,arsonist,1
Robert Mackey,"Richard Grenell, the new United States Ambassador to Germany, formally took up his post in Berlin on Tuesday and immediately got to work as Donald Trump’s representative, by offending the German people with a tweet. As @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately. — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) May 8, 2018 Grenell’s inaugural Twitter address to his hosts, a stern command to German companies doing business in Iran to obey the American president’s decision to sabotage the nuclear arms control agreement that opened the way for Western investment, or face U.S. sanctions, did not go over well. As Germany’s leading financial daily, Handelsblatt, reported, the tweet drew thousands of comments, “many of them from angry Germans basically telling the ambassador, a longtime critic of the Iran deal, to butt out.” Among the more temperate replies was one from Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States, who advised the novice diplomat to avoid issuing “instructions” to his hosts. Ric: my advice, after a long ambassadorial career: explain your own country’s policies, and lobby the host country – but never tell the host country what to do, if you want to stay out of trouble. Germans are eager to listen, but they will resent instructions. — Wolfgang Ischinger (@ischinger) May 9, 2018 Grenell’s comments sparked anger across the political spectrum, and were followed by a pledge from Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, to protect German businesses from any U.S. sanctions, possibly through a European Union statute that would block the implementation of any American penalties. Fabio de Masi of the far-left party, Die Linke, called on the German foreign ministry to make it clear to Grenell that his threats on behalf of “the arsonist in the White House” were inappropriate. Rolf Mützenich, an arms control expert who represents the Social Democrats in Germany’s parliament, suggested that Grenell appeared to be imitating his boss. That, however, is a sign that the German lawmaker is unfamiliar with the new American ambassador’s previous work as a noted Twitter troll. Grenell, who once served the Bush administration as United Nations Ambassador John Bolton’s spokesman, resigned from Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012 after deleting hundreds of sexist, rude comments from his Twitter feed. Reports at the time suggested that hiring Grenell, who is gay, might also have alienated Republican homophobes, but the uproar over his tweets was clearly a factor in his resignation. In addition to mocking the physical appearance of female political figures, Grenell often uses his Twitter account to harass journalists, badgering them to the point where many eventually tire of his inane arguments and block him. when a reporter calls you a troll, they mean you have made them uncomfortable about their bias and they have no comeback. #TrollAwayTweeps — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) July 29, 2013 (In the interest of full disclosure, I am one of the legion of reporters who resorted to the block button to escape Grenell’s harassment. In my case, the final straw was his claim that I was secretly working for the 2012 Obama campaign based on the fact that I had shared video of Richard Nixon bowing to a foreign leader, four decades before such a greeting became a political issue.) Calling Grenell a troll is perhaps not entirely accurate, though, since his reputation for being disagreeable far predates social networks. During his tenure as spokesman for the U.S. delegation at the U.N. members of the press corps described him to The Village Voice, in 2003, as “rude,” “arrogant,” “unbearable,” and a “bully.” It is unclear what sort of vetting process Grenell went through before being dispatched to Germany as a diplomat, but it did not, apparently, include consulting Irwin Arieff, who covered the U.N. for Reuters during the Bush administration. In 2012, during his brief tenure as Romney’s foreign affairs spokesman, Arieff told The Huffington Post that Grenell was “the most dishonest and deceptive press person I ever worked with.” “He often lied, even more frequently offered half answers or withheld information that would weaken his case or reflect poorly on his ideological point of view,” Arieff added. For the first time in American history, a Twitter troll has been made an ambassador. There is hope for all you eggs and bald eagles. https://t.co/tCp7KyYQIs — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) April 26, 2018 Grenell’s abrasive start to his tenure in Germany comes as that nation is searching for ways to keep the deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program in place, which could make it necessary to pass legal measures to protect German companies with investments there against U.S. sanctions.

Luke Darby,"When I saw the news, I thought, This could have very well been at a mosque or a Hindu temple.' Donald Trump has shown repeatedly, through his tweets, his immigration policies, and the people he chooses to empower and surround himself with, that he's openly antagonistic to American Muslims. And his tacit endorsements of George Soros and ""globalist"" related conspiracies (both terms are polite company shorthand for ""Jewish"") show that he's willing to promote anti-Semitism if it gets him votes and rally attendance. It's not surprising, considering Trump's rhetoric, that the number of hate crimes committed nationally has spiked since his election. But in the wake of the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in modern U.S. history, Pennsylvania's Muslim communities are rushing to support Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue. One online campaign, organized by Muslim-led nonprofits, has already reached nearly $120,000. Per the Washington Post : The shooting, which claimed the lives of 11 people Saturday during a morning service, “made me sick to my stomach,” said Tarek El-Messidi, a Muslim American speaker and activist who started the fundraising effort as soon as he heard about the attack. In the first six hours, the effort, called Muslims Unite for Pittsburgh Synagogue, reached its initial goal of $25,000. “When I saw the news, I thought, ‘This could have very well been at a mosque or a Hindu temple,’ ” he said. “We live in a time where so much bigoted rhetoric is being amplified.” El-Messidi plans to distribute the funds by partnering with the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, which is organizing with Tree of Life. Executive director for the Center, Wasi Mohamed, told TIME, ""Those who were stolen from us by this hateful person were like family."" He added, ""We feel obligated to follow this Prophetic tradition on standing up for the Jewish community."" Instances of interfaith support between Muslim and Jewish communities in the U.S. isn't new, but it's noteworthy that the support has continued as Trump-era hate crimes have skyrocketed. After an arsonist set fire to a Florida mosque in February of last year, Jewish donors pledged money in multiples of 18, an auspicious number in Jewish numerology. The same year, Muslims families raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for repairs after vandals desecrated Jewish cemeteries in Pennsylvania and Missouri.

Benn Bathgate,"A 43-year-old South Korean woman has appeared at Rotorua District Court on Saturday charged with arson in the wake of Friday's blaze in Taup. The woman who was granted interim name suppression is jointly charged with a 24-year-old man who appeared the Auckland District Court. Defence lawyer Wiremu Te Are sought the name suppression as he said her family in South Korea were unaware of the charges, but acknowledged that continued suppression at her second court hearing, scheduled for December 12 at Taup District Court, would be ""untenable"". He also requested an interpreter for her second appearance, citing the complexity of the legal issues. The rooves of the Hamills Taupo retail store and Taupo Sushi collapsed during the town centre fire, making investigations difficult. The woman, who wore a yellow hoddie in the dock with 'One Love Manchester' on it, was remanded in custody without plea until her second appearance. The blaze, which took hold at shops in Taup's town centre, needed around 50 firefighters to get under control, with Police closing down Tongariro St, after the commercial block opposite the riverside domain went up in flames at 1.15am on Friday. Fire engulfed three shops in the block between Tamamutu St and Horomatangi St, Northern Fire Communications shift manager Craig Dally said. The fire stretched about 30 by 10 metres and was ""well alight"", he said. The 43-year-old, who has interim name suppression, appeared before a Justice of the Peace at Rotorua District Court. A total of 10 crews from Taup, Rotorua, Kinloch and Tokoroa were called with around 40-50 firefighters on site at the peak. A special canteen vehicle travelled from Ngruawhia to feed the firefighters as well. Fire Emergency NZ Lakes District assistant area manager Hamish Smith, who had been on site through the night, said at 6am that the fire was now contained. It appeared the fire had been contained to two of the three shops, causing extensive damage to a food outlet and retail store.

DAVID CLARKSON,"A firelighter's comment that she enjoyed her offending was described as ""alarming"" by her lawyer before the woman was jailed at a Christchurch District Court sentencing.
 Repeat arsonist Angela Maree McDonald, 37, cried in the dock as the judge discussed her mental health condition diagnosed as schizo-affective disorder before sending her to prison for two years.
 The prison term will mean a comprehensive management plan can be prepared for her before she is released, with a current assessment that her risk of further firelighting is high.
 McDonald has a 1998 conviction for the arson of a haybarn, and previous convictions for wilful damage.
READ MORE: Woman admits lighting fire at Princess Margaret Hospital
 In November, McDonald admitted a charge of arson for lighting a fire on the bed of a fellow patient at the Seager Clinic, at Princess Margaret Hospital, while she was out of her room on October 10.
 The fire damaged the woman's bed, bedside cabinet, and possessions. There was also smoke and water damage from the sprinklers. Damage totalled $6553, but no-one was hurt. 
 Defence counsel Tony Garrett said the potential consequences were extreme because there were people with disabilities in the clinic.
 He said McDonald offended when she felt aggrieved or slighted. It was an anger management issue, but it was her gross over-reaction which was a real concern. Some of McDonald's replies when questioned were alarming, he said. She had expressed enjoying her offending.
 The pre-sentence report includes the probation officer's assessment that McDonald was a low risk of further general offending but the risk of further firelighting was high.
 Judge Garland said sentencing of offenders with mental health issues was a ""vexed issue"", but health assessors said McDonald did not show symptoms of a current mental illness and there did not appear to be a link between her mental health and the arson offending.
 She had a long history of contact with mental health services and was assessed as having an under-lying schizo-affective disorder. She had a ""limited ability to emotionally self-regulate"", and a tendency to resort to damaging property, threatening behaviour, or fire setting. A psychologist said she needed to take responsibility for her behaviour.
 The judge imposed a two-year jail term and said home detention would not be considered. He made no reparation order because there was no ability to pay it.","A repeat arsonist offended when she felt slighted and enjoyed her offending, her lawyer said.",2019-03-07T03:17:12Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Stuff.co.nz'}",Christchurch woman jailed for two years after lighting hospital bed on fire,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/111112442/christchurch-woman-jailed-for-two-years-after-lighting-hospital-bed-on-fire,https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/u/5/j/2/o/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1u5iwq.png/1551928632965.jpg,,Stuff.co.nz,arsonist,1
"Seth Ferranti, Matt Taylor","Defendants and family members in the courtroom celebrate after the jury passes down a not-guilty verdict during the Willie Earle Lynching Trial at the Greenville County Courthouse, Greenville, South Carolina, May 21, 1947. (Photo by Ed Clark/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images)He took my cab and my money, T.W. Brown told a Liberty, South Carolina, cop as he lay bleeding just after 10 PM on a cool February night. Brown had been stabbed three times, severely beaten, and left to die off old Liberty-Pickens Road in suburban Pickens County, the Greenville News reported in 2003, some 56 years later. A 24-year-old African-American man, Willie Earle, was quickly arrested for the crime and held at the Pickens County jail. But even though lynching as an entrenched form of racist-vigilante justice had diminished in the state and, to some extent, the country, by 1947, the mindset wasn't going anywhere.
Soon after the arrest, dozens of white men, mostly fellow cab drivers of Brown determined to avenge the attack, abducted Earle from the jail and lynched himbeat him, stabbed him, shot him to death. But in this case, 31 of them were actually indicted for the crime, with the FBI having been sent in to investigate. Some form of justice for a despicable racist mob seemed at least vaguely plausible. 
Then, after a nine-day trial that was covered by the national press, every remaining defendant was found not guilty by an all-white jury. 
In his new book, They Stole Him Out of Jail: Willie Earle, South Carolinas Last Lynching Victim, University of Denver Professor Emeritus William Gravely, a native of Pickens County, explores the morose chapter in American history. VICE caught up with him to discuss how flaws in the investigation and prosecution helped bring on the acquittals, what the outcome meant for white supremacy in what might now be described as the waning days of Jim Crow, what notorious US Senator Storm Thurmond had to do with the case, and how this tragic event speaks to America's enduring history of racism and systemic corruption.
VICE: Why do you think the attack on T.W. Brown caused such a swift and violent uproar? He wasn't actually dead at the time of the lynching, right?William Gravely: The official story had him picking up one, possibly two fares in Greenville, South Carolina, Saturday night, February 15, 1947. He was found by a Liberty, SC, farmer on the side of the road outside town. The pre-dawn abduction of Willie Earle from the Pickens jail occurred before Brown diedhe was taken to St. Francis hospital in Greenville in critical conditionand before Earle had been questioned and charged. Brown died a few hours after the lynching. It was the attack on Brown and the seriousness of his injuries that triggered the mens desire for revenge. Since the attack on Brown occurred late Saturday night, it was not even in local news until after the lynching.
Thered been no general uproar in public, only among Browns fellow-drivers (28 of the 31 defendants charged) who were aware of his precarious condition leading to his death. A number of contributing factors were at play: post WWII racial tensions with the return of African American soldiers, perennial tension between Greenville taxi drivers, city authorities, and police. And resentment among drivers in Browns Yellow Cab company about the electrocution of one of their coworkers in 1945: He'd been charged with rape and [they believed the case had been] contaminated by the prosecutors statement to the jury that if the cabman had been black, he would have been convicted in 15 minutes. 
Was this kind of lynch mob really unexpected given the time and South Carolinas history of racism? Was there any local pushback you came across in your work?Defenders of the mob and the local press exaggerated the number of attacks on taxi operators beyond the facts on record. Earles being black contributed to the rage and desire for revenge. [But] for the mob to distrust law enforcement and the South Carolina criminal justice system, that was what was unexpected.
It seemed like Willie Earle was characterized in a way that might not be totally unfamiliar in bogus narratives about black men and crime today. Did he actually fit any of those negative stereotypes?He had a limited education. He had health issues. He had a tendency to get drunk, which led to minor skirmishes with the law. I disconfirmed rumors that he was an arsonist, that he had a fight with his supervisor, and ended up in the state penitentiary. I contend that the rumors about Willie Earle beyond what I found emerged from an inclination to draw upon a stereotype of a violent black malein this case [a] murderer, [though] more often it would have included a sexual offense. The public projected on to Earle behavior that he did not exhibit, as when Rebecca West [at the New Yorker] told the penitentiary story, perhaps from a local source mistakenly thinking of Frank Earls violence some months before. The specter of the black male criminal was common in South Carolina. 
 What flaws in the investigation and prosecution contributed to the acquittals, in your view? The long history of how lynching was investigated, where arrests occurred, when trials took place, and the [general] absence of convictions shaped the worldview of everyone responding to these events. I emphasize the irony that what became the last lynching in South Carolina of its kind was only possible by repeating the historic pattern one final time. Four and a half days of intense interrogations of the accused was a highly celebrated event that led many to expect that a new day had come that February in the regions and countrys response to lynching. But there were complex dynamics behind the scenes.
The FBI withdrew from the investigation within a week, leaving a long list of undeveloped leads and a claim that no civil rights violations had occurred under color of law, that is, connected to law enforcement and the Pickens jailer. The Justice Department expected that it was more important to identify the lynchers and to try them at the state level than to engage in a problematic pursuit of federal violations. The history of failed civil rights cases of this sort haunted the Bureau and the Attorney General. 
There was little witness testimony. There was little evidence beyond the confessional statements read into the record and the conflicting and sometimes contradictory versions of the lynching were confusing. And there were no female or African American jurors. The case was tried in a segregated courtroom where the black press reporters had to go to the colored balcony.
To what extent did the acquittal represent a victory for white supremacy more generally at this point, before the Civil Rights Movement had really gained postwar traction?In South Carolina, the 1940s was a roller-coaster experience for civil rights-oriented black citizens. They won lawsuits, even if their victories did not convert into reality for school-teacher equal pay, or to end the white primary that excluded black voters. They failed despite heroic attempts to unseat the all-white delegations to the Democratic conventions of 1944 and 1948. South Carolina created legal segregation and bolstered it by custom to maintain good race relations from the point of view of white folks. It took over two more decades to achieve successful school desegregation.
 I guess I shouldn't have been, but I was surprised to see Senator Storm Thurmond involved with this caseand the way he was. Can you talk about that?Thurmond had been inaugurated [as governor] the month before the lynching, but as a former circuit judge, state senator, and army veteran hero, he was not inclined to remain silent about the necessity to condemn lynching. He was forthright, a ""law and order"" man, and he promptly sent the state constables to aid the investigation. Thurmond remained silent after the verdicts came down and then echoed the anti-Yankee, neo-Confederate nationalism that was dramatized in the trial summations. Dixiecrat politics and presidential campaigning came natural to him.
I interviewed Thurmond in 1989. He was not comfortable calling what happened a lynching. He was more interested in talking about the cases he tried that required capital punishment. It was particularly valuable to have the accounts of his biracial daughters experience of his inauguration and private visits in Orangeburg during which she [at] first was proud of his anti-lynching stand. They argued about how he handled the outcome. His becoming the leader of the Dixiecrats soured her attitude. 
 How do you draw a line between a case like this one and what's going on in the so-called Trump era with racist violence, mass shootings, and white nationalism on the upswing?""You rape our women and are taking over our country,"" Dylann Roof claimed [upon] murdering nine innocent people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, he was reiterating the classic false claim that dates back to the late 19th century: that black-on-white rape justifies violence. Lynchs law was at one time a defense against the alleged epidemic of black-on-white rape. The long trajectory of White Over Black as detailed in Winthrop Jordans 1968 book still exists in America. 1865 ended slavery, but not racism. 
White privilege still exists, even though one has to take account of the intersection of economic class, gender, and sexual orientation in dealing with diversity and inclusion. The color codes of race are not in the Declaration of Independence or the US Constitution. White is the only unchanged category in the census. The embracing of white nationalism, the Klan, anti-Semitism, and the demonization of refugees and immigrants has only recently publicly resurfaced, but these ideas are not new. Racism is not a harmless attitude or dislike of whoever the other is deemed to be. Racism is grounded in the commitment that the other is somehow defective, not in behavior or character, but in being alive.

IANS,"An Indian-origin family of five, including three children, has been killed in South Africa after their house was allegedly petrol-bombed by an unknown arsonist, police said. Aziz Manjra, 45, who had been living in South Africa for the past 25 years, his South African wife Gori Bibi and their three children -- Muhammad Rizwan, 10, Mairoonisa, 14, and Zubina, 18 -- were found dead in their Pietermaritzburg home on Thursday morning, the South African media reported. A source close to the investigation told Independent Online that police, who gained entry to the house by breaking burglar guards on a window, had found a bottle containing petrol in the house. The family had moved into the double-storey house on Larch Road, Willowton, less than two weeks ago. The older victims suffered severe burn wounds while the children, who were sleeping upstairs, died of smoke inhalation, police said. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said that Manjra and his wife were working at a local wholesaler. The woman told the Mercury daily that her sleep was broken around 2 a.m. when she heard what sounded like footsteps on her roof. ""I heard a man shouting 'Allah'. This was followed by screaming. I was terrified too scared to even go and check what was happening."" She said she realised that the screams were coming from the top floor of her neighbour's house. ""I alerted another neighbour and asked her to phone the police."" Although firemen arrived and put out the blaze quickly, it is believed that the family succumbed to smoke inhalation because of limited escape routes as all windows and doors were covered with iron bars. The original homeowners, Fabian and Ronwyn Visagie, told the paper that they had been in the final stages of selling the house to the Manjras. The deal had been signed and sealed. The family had just been waiting for the transfer of the property to be finalised. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said they were investigating five cases of murder and a case of arson. ""The community is shocked. We cannot say much at this stage until the investigation is completed, but we are definitely investigating arson,"" Ngobese said. --IANS soni/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",Indian-origin family killed in S.

By William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),"An arsonist allegedly started a fire Thursday night at Comet Ping Pong, the Washington, D.C. pizzeria that was targeted by internet hoaxers as part of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. 
According to a police report, an unidentified person set a curtain in the back of the restaurant on fire around 10:45 p.m. Thursday. Comet staffers used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire, and no injuries were reported. 
Arson investigators discovered burned matches and a bottle of charcoal lighter fluid next to the curtain, leading to a unanimous decision that the fire was caused by arson, according to police. 
Several prank calls were made to the restaurant earlier in the night, the Washington Post reported.
Internet conspiracy theorists claimed in 2016, without any evidence, that the restaurant was a front for a pedophile sex ring run by Hillary Clinton and other top Democrats. In Dec. 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, from North Carolina, fired several shots inside Comet after conspiracy theories online convinced him that restaurant housed a child-sex dungeon. 
Comet owner James Alefantis confirmed the fire in a statement. Customers and staff were safe at all times and no one was hurt, he said.
Its unclear what motivated the arson, and police have not released a description of any suspects.
The Pizzagate theory, which flourished on pro-Trump internet forums and social media during the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, was based on internet theorists misconstruing emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta by Russian hackers. 
The conspiracy theory set off a wave of death threats and other harassment against Alefantis and Comet staffers, with amateur Pizzagate investigators showing up to the restaurant to badger customers and employees.","Jonathan Ernst/Reuters An arsonist allegedly started a fire Thursday night at Comet Ping Pong, the Washington, D.C. pizzeria that was targeted by internet hoaxers as part of the “ Pizzagate ” conspiracy theory.

RT,"The Court of Appeals for Western Sweden has overruled another court’s decision concerning a deportation of a Palestinian man, who was earlier convicted of staging an arson attack on a synagogue in the city of Gothenburg. The man was sentenced to two years and prison and expulsion over what was classified as a hate crime, the Swedish media reported. While upholding the prison sentence, the court of appeals still said that, since the perpetrator could be “perceived as a threat to other Jews” and Israel “might have an interest in the matter,” Sweden “cannot secure the man’s fundamental human rights” in case of his deportation to Palestine. The convicted Palestinian has been previously granted asylum in the Nordic country. The decision immediately provoked angry response from some Israeli officials. The court “ has shown blatant ignorance regarding Israel’s independent Judiciary that has gained international reputation, ” Ilan Ben-Dov, Israel’s ambassador to Sweden said in a Facebook post as he maintained that “Israel is a democratic country, based on Rule of Law.” The envoy slammed the court ruling by calling it a “ highly prejudicial and politicized verdict,” which “ excuses, and therefore legitimizes, the actions of a violent Anti-Semite as acceptable political criticism. ” Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon also lambasted the court’s decision by saying that this “shameful ” verdict “ gives legitimacy to violent anti-Semitism and defames the State of Israel.” Some Swedish and international pro-Jewish organizations also joined the wave of outrage sparked by the court’s decision. Maria Halkiewicz, chairman of the Sweden-Israel Friendship Association office in Stockholm told the Swedish Nyheter Idag newspaper that the Jews in Sweden are already concerned about the anti-Semitism in the Swedish society and the latest development only further contributes to this fear. ""The fact that such a man gets to stay in Sweden on the grounds that he is guilty of crimes against Jews is really hard to grasp. It is bizarre that anti-Semitism can save a criminal from expulsion,"" Halkiewicz said. ""We are afraid that the anti-Semitism from the Arab world will become a mortal threat to us. In Sweden, there is no longer any religious freedom for us Jews,"" a Swedish writer of Jewish descent, Salomon Schulman, wrote in an opinion piece for the Swedish Expressen newspaper titled “How could you not expulse the synagogue arsonist.” The nationalist Sweden Democrats Party also contributed to the outpouring of criticism as it apparently pursued its own goals. “A great political signal: ‘Are you a Palestinian worried about being expelled [from Sweden]? Attack some Jews and stay…” an MP and the Sweden Democrats’ spokesperson on migration, Paula Bieler, said in a Twitter post. Some international Jewish organizations also weighed in on the issue. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) called the court’s decision a “dangerous precedent rewarding terrorist violence.” ""This is an offensive moral outrage rewarding … anti-Semitism and criminal behavior,"" the WJC CEO, Robert Singer, said, commenting on the matter. WJC calls a decision by the Swedish court of appeals not to deport a Palestinian migrant who was convicted of hurling firebombs at a synagogue in Gothenburg a ‘dangerous precedent for rewarding terrorist violence.’ The Jewish community also sent a letter objecting the decision. pic.twitter.com/tPxicvrHay — WJC (@WorldJewishCong) September 13, 2018 The US-based pro-Jewish Anti-Defamation League (ADL) also slammed the verdict as an openly anti-Semitic and discriminative act. “ Swedish community tells us: Had the Palestinian thrown a firebomb in the street, he would have been deported. Because he targeted a synagogue, he won’t be. The court cares more about attacking Israel than protecting Jewish community of Sweden,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the former Special Assistant to the former US President Barack Obama and the ADL CEO, said in a tweet.

The incident resulted in no casualties, although a group of Jewish teenagers, who were attending a celebration in the building, had to briefly take shelter in the synagogue cellar. The man was later arrested and convicted of a hate crime alongside with two other assailants, who were identified as a Syrian and a stateless man of Palestinian descent. The Palestinian, however, was the only one, who was due to be deported as the other two had Swedish residence permits. The attack on the synagogue took place just three days after the US President Donald Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, sparking massive anti-Israeli and anti-American protests that erupted across the Muslim world. Israel then launched a brutal crackdown on the protesters in the Occupied Territories. Around a dozen Palestinians have been killed and hundreds injured as Israeli security forces violently suppressed demonstrators in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. Sweden, meanwhile, has been the first EU member in the western Europe to officially recognize the State of Palestine back in 2014.

Natalie Weiner,"B/R Since its founding in 1990, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, hadn't had any serious issues with vandalism—until last week, when its Buck O'Neil Education and Research Center was flooded after a water line on the second floor was cut and the water was turned on, dousing not just the second floor, but the first floor and basement as well. One month prior, another Kansas City Negro Leagues landmark faced similarly catastrophic crime: A suspected arsonist set the home of pitching legend Satchel Paige on fire in late May, leaving potentially irreparable damage. Both incidents were far more serious than the graffiti tagging that typically plagues out-of-use buildings. At the O'Neil Center, the museum staff responded to a series of alerts from the fire alarm panel early Friday morning, only to find water gushing down stairwells and seeping through ceilings, causing significant damage to a renovation that had begun in 2011 and was about a year from completion. The building's first floor—the area most damaged by the flooding—was just months from opening to the public. ""There has been a community investment in this project that goes beyond finance,"" says Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick of the renovation that so far has cost $4 million. ""This was an investment of sweat equity. When we first started cleaning the building up, ordinary people from the community would come in, put their boots on and start gathering debris. A lot of people in Kansas City are hurting right alongside the Negro Leagues Museum, as we think about this very heinous attempt to damage the center."" The Buck O'Neill Education and Research Center. Photo courtesy of Bob Kendrick The Buck O'Neil Center is an initiative more than a decade in the making. O'Neil was a first baseman and manager for the Negro American League's Kansas City Monarchs. Later in life, he became one of the Negro Leagues' most visible spokesmen as well as one of the founders of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. Fundraising for the education and research center, one of O'Neil's pet projects, was supposed to be spurred by his election to the Hall of Fame—but he controversially missed his last shot to make it to Cooperstown in 2006. O'Neil died later that year. ""Seeing all that water, my heart just dropped in my stomach,"" says Kendrick. ""It was one of the most empty feelings I think I've ever had. The closest thing I can think of is when I had to tell Buck he didn't have enough votes to get into the Hall of Fame."" The site's significance goes beyond the man it's named for. The center is housed in the Paseo YMCA, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. But it had been derelict since the 1970s until an NLBM board member purchased and donated it to the museum. The building is where the Negro National League was founded February 13, 1920. Beyond that, it was one of the oldest black YMCAs in the country, opening in 1914, and it served as a gathering place for the 18th and Vine district, now recognized as a vital destination in the history of American sports, music and culture. Joe Louis trained there, and Jackie Robinson spent time in the building. ""It was the primary meeting place outside of the church, and it was one of the few places African Americans could swim in Kansas City,"" says Kendrick. The museum staff approached renovation incrementally, knowing that between O'Neil's death and the financial crisis, a capital campaign to raise the $15 million needed to complete the project in one fell swoop would be nearly impossible. In doing so, the staff avoided debt, but it now has to pay heating and cooling costs for the space even though it's still not operable. The building's event space, converted from the old gymnasium (and keeping its old elevated track) was supposed to open soon and generate income from rentals. ""It is imperative for us to get this renovation process expedited so we can start using that space to help offset some of the costs that we have been incurring and will have to continue to, even as we now may have to redo that first floor,"" says Kendrick. They're still assessing the damage to the space and have to wait for mold and mildew experts to ensure the building is safe before embarking on any construction. Kendrick is still not sure whether insurance will cover the cost of repairs. Jason Gould @OvernightPhotog The former home of Baseball Hall of Famer and Kansas City Monarch Satchel Paige went up in flames overnight near 28th &amp;amp; Benton Blvd. Nobody was inside. House has been vacant for some time. https://t.co/z6Pc6GcxVh About a five-minute drive south of the Buck O'Neil Center sits the home where Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige—the first black pitcher to play in the World Series (1948)—lived from the early 1960s until his death in 1982. The house, also located in a historically black neighborhood, was a haven for Kansas City legends inside both baseball and jazz: Count Basie, among others, was a frequent guest. Now the house lies abandoned and, since late May, charred almost beyond recognition. A fire destroyed the top two floors and put a serious hurdle in front of museum staff members who had hoped to one day restore the home and help it become an officially designated historical site. It's still unclear whether the house, which is owned by an individual outside the Paige family, can be salvaged at all. Investigators found traces of accelerant used to start the fire, and Jacob Becchina, an investigator with the Kansas City Police Department, confirms it's being treated as an arson, though they have no suspects. ""My gut tells me that there's not a connection between the two, but I don't really know,"" says Kendrick. ""Maybe it's because the human side of me says that surely nobody would target those two names intentionally to do something of this nature."" ""Why?"" is the question that remains for police, and for the Kansas City community. Neither incident is being investigated as a hate crime, partially because of the lack of evidence. ""Break-ins are very difficult, absent a witness, surveillance footage or physical evidence,"" says Becchina, which is the case in both the Buck O'Neil Center and Paige house cases. Those with any information are urged to contact the Kansas City Police Department. The museum is looking for silver linings, though: The delayed grand opening might mean the center's official debut will coincide with the centennial of the Negro National League: February 13, 2020. ""Rest assured that this project is not going to die because this crazy incident occurred,"" says Kendrick. ""It makes us even more resolved to get this thing moving so that the community can start using it. Right now, we're just dealing with the reality that someone would do something like this.""","Since its founding in 1990, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, hadn't had any serious issues with vandalism—until last week, when its Buck O'Neil Education ...",2018-06-27T17:12:38Z,"{'id': 'bleacher-report', 'name': 'Bleacher Report'}",Who's Trying to Destroy Negro League Landmarks in Kansas City?,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2783181-whos-trying-to-destroy-negro-league-landmarks-in-kansas-city,https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/749/619/908b6a1fb2b479369a9bc58ec59ba8d5_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75,bleacher-report,Bleacher Report,arsonist,1

During the trial, prosecutor Sharad Khandelwal said it was Perez's ""rabid hatred"" of Muslims that led him to set fire to the mosque.","An arsonist who set a South Texas mosque ablaze last January has been convicted of hate crime and federal arson charges.Marq Vincent Perez, 26,...",2018-07-17T16:24:12Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Dallasnews.com'}",Arsonist with 'rabid hatred' for Muslims convicted in Victoria mosque fire,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2018/07/17/arsonist-rabid-hatred-muslims-convicted-victoria-mosque-fire,https://dallasnews.imgix.net/1531839054-16195998_1296166490477781_8680123458070272917_n.jpg?w=1200&h=630&format=jpg&crop=faces&fit=crop,,Dallasnews.com,arsonist,1
Melissa McEwan,"[Content Note: Islamophobia; terrorism; arson.]The Dar-ul-Arqam mosque in Escondido was attacked by an unknown arsonist who ""left behind graffiti referencing the deadly New Zealand terrorist attacks."" 
No arrests have yet been made, and authorities ""have launched investigations into suspected arson and a hate crime.""
Yusef Miller, a member of the Muslim community in Escondido, said: ""We're not surprised by this incident... But, we're very on edge right now."" Police revealed the suspect left a message in graffiti in the mosque's parking lot that referenced the New Zealand shooting, but didn't say exactly what it said. Seven people were inside the mosque at the time of the fire and were able to put it out with a fire extinguisher before firefighters arrived. ""We're going to stay vigilant. We're not going to close down this mosque yet. People are still going to come pray,"" said Miller. 
Just awful. I'm so glad no one was hurt.And I'm so scared that things are going to get much worse. 
That Donald Trump responded to what he claims is an ""exoneration"" by Special Counsel Bob Mueller by doubling down on his campaign of stochastic terrorism, braying in an email to supporters that ""Democrats and the Fake News Media have proven that there is no line they won't cross, so we need to fight back BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE

Ryan Browne,"Washington (CNN) Russia is playing the role of ""both arsonist and firefighter"" in Syria, Gen. Joseph Votel, who oversees all US troops in the Middle East, said Tuesday. ""Diplomatically and militarily, Moscow plays both arsonist and firefighter: fueling tensions among all parties in Syria, the Syrian regime, Iran, Turkey, the Syrian Democratic Forces, the United States and other coalition partners, then serving as arbiter to resolve the disputes, attempting to undermine and weaken each party's bargaining positions,"" Votel told a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. US officials have previously criticized both Russia's military efforts in Syria as well as several diplomatic efforts that American officials have seen as attempts to circumvent the UN-backed Geneva process, which seeks to bring about an end to the Syrian civil war. The UN Security Council passed a resolution Monday demanding a 30-day cessation of hostilities throughout Syria, and Russia announced that it was working with the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad to establish a daily five-hour ""humanitarian pause"" for the Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta. The pause seemed to have little impact Tuesday, as shelling and artillery fire continued. US and UN officials have accused the Russian-backed Syrian regime of carrying out an indiscriminate aerial bombardment of the area. Votel said continued regime aerial attacks in Eastern Ghouta appeared to show that Russia is incapable of or unwilling to hold the regime to account. ""As we look at the UN-sanctioned ceasefire that was put in this place, one that they helped draft and agreed to implement and to cause the regime to comply by it -- they have failed to do that,"" Votel said. ""I think either Russia has to admit that it's not capable or it doesn't want to play a role in ending the Syrian conflict here,"" Votel added, saying, ""I think their role is incredibly destabilizing at this point."" Votel said Moscow was pursuing its own interests in Syria and was also undermining the fight against ISIS. ""Despite the key role that our partners on the ground, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and the coalition have played in dealing defeat to ISIS, Russia has placed this progress at risk with their activities, which are not focused on defeating ISIS but rather on preserving their own influence and control over the outcome of the situation,"" Votel said. ""It is clear that Russia's interests in Syria are Russia's interest and not those of the wider international community,"" he added.","Russia is playing the role of ""both arsonist and firefighter"" in Syria, Gen.

BRET STEPHENS,"That, however, is something the ZOA has seemed unwilling to do, on the theory that Bannon is a self-declared, and possibly even sincere, supporter of the Jewish state. On Sunday he called himself a “Christian Zionist,” and praised Israel as “one of the greatest nations on earth and the foundation of the Judeo-Christian West.” But just as there are anti-Zionist Jews, there are also anti-Semitic Zionists. The Nazis initially endorsed the idea of getting German Jews to shove off to Mandated Palestine. Spencer calls himself a “white Zionist,” on the factitious theory that Israel is the sort of ethno-nationalist state he’d like to see America become. Simply put, support for Israel is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a friend to Jews. (Richard Nixon, who was nothing if not an ally of Israel in its time of need, was known to tell aides that “most Jews are disloyal” and that “you can’t trust the bastards.” ) That distinction may not trouble the right-wing ZOA audience that gave Bannon a standing ovation, but it should profoundly alarm all Jews who call themselves pro-Israel. Why? Two reasons. Unlike Nixon, whose anti-Semitism seems to have been of a knee-jerk and atavistic variety, Bannon’s alt-right views — his opposition to free trade, a liberal immigration policy, “international bankers,” “corporatist global media” — are consonant with a sinister worldview that always finds a way to get back to a certain class of rootless cosmopolitans. His is not a personal bigotry so much as it is an ideological obsession. Its potential for destructiveness is that much greater. The second reason is that political support for Israel is too important to tarnish through association with the likes of Bannon or European kindred spirits such as Holland’s Geert Wilders or Hungary’s Viktor Orban. Israel is not a latter-day Crusader kingdom holding out against a 21st-century Mahometan horde. It is a small democracy trying to uphold a set of liberal values against autocrats and religious fanatics sworn to its destruction. Zionists love Israel because of the way in which it brings together the values of individual freedom and Jewish civilization, not because of some blood and soil nationalism. If Israel is going to retain mainstream political support, it cannot allow itself to become the pet cause of right-wing bigots and conspiracy theorists. That requires putting serious distance between Bannon and every pro-Israel organization, to say nothing of the Israeli government itself, by refusing to provide a platform for him and his ilk. Personal and national reputations alike always depend on the company one keeps. Not every would-be supporter deserves consideration as a friend. That thought may have dawned on Sheldon Adelson, who skipped Sunday’s dinner and seems belatedly to have realized — too late for much comfort — how destructive Bannon and his brand of arsonist politics have become to the Republican Party and the causes it used to champion. The thought needs to dawn, too, on right-of-center Jews who have become so attuned to dangers from the woke-left that they have tuned out dangers from the alt-right. Anti-Semitism is both the socialism of fools and the conservatism of creeps. If the past century holds a lesson for Jews, it’s to beware every form of illiberalism, including the illiberalism of those who purport to be on our side. Repair of the world may not the central teaching of Judaism. But it’s always wise to stay far from those who wish to tear it asunder.

"Ray Sanchez, CNN","(CNN)The debit card used to purchase the two-gallon gas cans hours before the first Louisiana church burned down bore the full name of the suspected arsonist -- Holden James Matthews, according to a court affidavit.
State and federal investigators obtained surveillance photos of the man who -- along with the Scepter-branded gas cans -- also purchased a 10-pack of automotive cloths and a lighter at a Walmart store in St. Landry Parish. The cashier recorded the 21-year-old suspect's birth date on the receipt, the affidavit said. 
Not much is known at this time about Matthews. He is the son of a St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputy and may have been influenced by ""black metal"" music and its ""associated history with church burnings,"" State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning said. But Matthews left a long trail of clues that ultimately led to his arrest on Wednesday. 
""We are extremely, unequivocally confident that we have the person who is responsible for these tragic crimes,"" Browning said. 
A pickup truck believed to have been driven by Matthews was captured by surveillance cameras leaving the parking lot of Greater Union Baptist Church moments before it went up in flames on April 2. 
The affidavit said the pickup was later captured driving by the fire scene and stopping in front of the church. A firefighter also reported seeing the pickup near the burning church, the affidavit said. 
A Walmart surveillance photo showed Matthews in a similar pickup outside the store. The Walmart purchase was made late on March 25, less than three hours before the first blaze. A Ford pickup like the one Matthews was seen driving was registered to his father, Roy. The suspect's cell phone was traced to the area of the fires.
""This case was solved with boots on the ground and butts in the air,"" said St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz, adding that Roy Matthews helped direct his son away from his home to facilitate the arrest.
The motive for the fires is still under investigation, and federal officials are looking into whether a hate crime was committed. Matthews is charged with three counts of simple arson on a religious building. 
""Information investigators have uncovered, and that Matthews has offered, suggests a possible connection with a genre of music called 'black metal' and its associated history with church burnings in other parts of the world -- which have been documented in movies and books,"" Browning said.
Pressed on the possible ""black metal link, Browning said: ""We believe there is a relation there with that. That is still being vetted. ... That is a piece that we're looking at.""
Matthews was active in Facebook groups that focused on black metal and heathenism and Nordic religious beliefs, according to posts seen by CNN. In one post he wrote of his Asatru beliefs, which center around Norse gods. 
In two Facebook posts in October, he appeared to admit he illegally carries a handgun -- in addition a knife and dagger.
""I carry this,"" he wrote with the photo of a handgun. ""Maybe not legally but I only truly follow the law of Odin..... which says as you said, arm yourself.""
On the day that authorities said Matthews allegedly set fire to Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, he wrote, ""I'll take Arson/assassin/bard"" when a group member asked people to choose between a wizard, fighter, sniper, assassin, guardian and warrior. 
Guidroz, the sheriff, spoke of the difficulty of informing deputy Roy Matthews about his son's alleged involvement in the fires. The deputy broke down. 
""I love Roy Matthews,"" Guidroz said. ""Roy Matthews is one of my best friends. A great deputy. He knew nothing, nothing about his son's activity.""
Guidroz said the elder Matthews, shocked and heartbroken, arranged for his son to leave the house and go to a location where he was be arrested without incident.
Asked about the suspect being the son of his deputy, Guidroz said: ""That's tough. That should tell the country that no matter who you are, there are consequences to the things that you do.""

Ash,"Reviewed on Nintendo Switch.
On the surface, Mages of Mystralia (developed and published by Borealys Games) is a charming little game. The graphics are lovely, the story is well written, and the world is packed to the brim with whimsical charm. However, beneath its shiny exterior, the game starts to fall apart.
Mages of Mystralia is set in a world where magic is outlawed after a series of incidents involving a king abusing his magical powers. We pick up shortly after a young girl, Zia, discovers that she is actually a mage and that she’d probably make quite a talented arsonist. Zia is exiled from her village (which seems like a sort of underwhelming punishment seeing as magic is outlawed and the game strongly implies she accidentally killed a guy). After coming across a mysterious man in the woods who says he’ll mentor her, resolves to right her wrongs by helping the kingdom of Mystralia.
As the game progresses, Zia is tasked with preventing a war between trolls and Mystralia. Naturally, because high fantasy is always delightfully packed with twists, it soon becomes apparent that there’s something even more sinister afoot than an all-out war. I won’t explain the plot any further for fear of giving away spoilers and major plot points, but know that you’re in good hands as the story was written by Ed Greenwood, the original creator of the Forgotten Realms game world.
Now, Mages of Mystralia has two main problems: pacing and refusing to tell you what’s going on. While the story is strong, it unfolds in such a way that it tends to lose a lot of its impact and too many things happen way too fast. As for not telling you what to do: you don’t get told what the shiny objects you can pick up actually do. I worked out that, logically, the little hearts replenished your health and the blue fuzzy things replenished your mana, but it took me way too long to work out that the green glowing things were currency.
Alongside this, tutorials flash by in an instant, and there’s no quest log to let you know what you need to do next. The map only tells you your overall goal and not what you’re currently doing. There’s no mini-map or quest markers to let you know where you’re going. It’s a mild inconvenience at the best of times and downright frustrating at worst.
However, if you can look past the strange pacing and fact that you might forget what you’re doing, it’s a beautiful game to get lost in. The graphics are colorful and well polished, and both the in-game graphics and the menus look wonderful regardless of whether you’re playing in hand-held mode or on a larger screen. There’s also the added bonus of three difficulty levels which vary based on whether you want to focus on the plot, focus on combat, or challenge yourself with perma-death.
Out of every other word in my critical lexicon, the only one that I can use to describe Mages of Mysteria is straightforward. Combat is just the bare essentials; firing spells at enemies is only really enjoyable due to the delightful accompanying spellcrafting system. With this, spells can be customized by mixing and matching elemental attacks, adding buffs, and even modifying the trajectory of the spells themselves. It’s a bit of a power trip (pun intended) and the definitive high point of Mages’ gameplay.
While the combat is basic but enjoyable, the in-between seal puzzles end up dampening the experience. They’re simple on the outside – occasionally you’ll stumble across a seal which requires you to rearrange a certain pattern. If you arrange the right pattern correctly, something happens. However, much like the majority of its systems, Mages never actually tells you what to do. The first seal puzzle is very simple, but the person who presents it to you doesn’t give you any instructions – it’s an extreme case of trial and error.
At its core, Mages of Mystralia is fun and appealing. If you can get past the lack of instructions and the poor pacing, it’s a fun little journey into a well-built world. The $19.99 price tag is the perfect price for a game like this and I would definitely recommend getting it if you’re into magical action-adventures. Just be prepared for a bit of guesswork in parts.

Rift,"A Korean high school student hospitalized for game addiction ended up trying to burn down the hospital so he could sneak out and get his gaming fix. The 19-year-old male high school student, hospitalized for “gaming addiction” on the 6th floor of a medical center in South Korea’s Daegu City, is thought to have set his pillow on fire using a lighter – causing an uproar that led to about 50 people in the ward being evacuated, though no one was harmed in the chaos. Investigations revealed that the culprit pulled the fire alarm after starting the blaze, triggering the sprinklers and allowing him to escape; the student then called for a taxi (while still wearing hospital clothing) and returned to his home in the east of the city. The addicted gamer than slipped into casual clothes and went to a nearby net cafe to at last play his beloved games, until a police officer eventually tracked him down an hour after the incident occurred. The meddlesome arsonist has since been arrested by police for setting fire to an inhabited building.","A Korean high school student hospitalized for game addiction ended up trying to burn down the hospital so he could sneak out and get his gaming fix.

Now Carlos Daniel Diaz-Cruz is charged with first-degree arson for the blaze that engulfed the Islamic Center of the Eastside the afternoon of March 21. Authorities determine that fire was not a hate crime. The fire at the mosque, located at 14700 Main Street, extended from the first floor to the roofline and damaged every room in the building, according to fire investigators. The mosque had been boarded up and fenced in since a January 2017 arson. It was structurally unsafe for anyone to enter the building, authorities claimed. Investigators found evidence of people breaking into the building, including bedding, pizza boxes, drink containers and clothing, police reports say. They believe the fire originated within 15 feet of where the 2017 fire was set. The lack of drywall and damage from last year's arson allowed the fire to spread rapidly, documents indicate. RELATED: Fire damages Bellevue mosque for second time Witnesses told Bellevue police that teens frequented the location every day. Traffic cameras and assistance from the Bellevue School District led police to identify three people captured leaving the mosque around the time the fire was set. Officers arrested the three teens March 27. One of the teens told detectives that Diaz-Cruz set the fire. The group had allegedly been in the mosque to smoke and some of the teens broke windows throughout the building, reports say. But Diaz-Cruz piled up toilet paper and tried to set fire to it several times, he claimed. The teen stamped out his first two fires, but the third fire grew too quickly for anyone to extinguish it, according to police records. Other teens brought in for questioning corroborated the story, Bellevue police say. They each claimed that Diaz-Cruz was not against Islam, but said he was ""crazy."" RELATED: Charge: Bellevue mosque arson suspect confessed at the scene For his part, Diaz-Cruz claimed ""he didn't have anything against God,"" but didn't elaborate on what happened the afternoon of the fire. Police determined Diaz-Cruz was the only person responsible for starting the fire, according to the incident report. Diaz-Cruz remains jailed on $250,000 bail.

The Associated Press,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A serial arsonist convicted of causing a massive blaze that gutted a central Ohio thrift store warehouse has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. The Columbus Dispatch reports 33-year-old Aaron Callicoat was sentenced Thursday for his role in the Columbus Volunteers of America warehouse fire last June and several other fires. He pleaded guilty earlier this month to aggravated arson and arson. The warehouse fire destroyed donated items valued at around $450,000. Callicoat lived in a nearby storage locker and called 911 multiple times to report the fire. Prosecutors say Callicoat began setting fires as a boy. He told investigators fire was all he had and that it never judged him. A judge told Callicoat a long prison sentence was the only way to protect the public from harm. ___ Information from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com","COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A serial arsonist convicted of causing a massive blaze that gutted a central Ohio thrift store warehouse has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.

JFrater,"We think of firefighters as heroes who rush into dangerous situations that the rest of us desperately try to escape. And most firefighters are true heroes who deserve our respect and thanks. But some firefighters are obsessed with fire, and they are not content with the number of naturally occurring fires. They feel the need to start their own infernos, and most of them love to help extinguish the flames. Many of these firefighters do not care about the buildings, homes, and people that their fires consume. They just want to watch things burn. 10 Caleb Lacey Caleb Lacey was proud to become a Long Island volunteer firefighter, and he yearned to be a hero. Months passed, and Lacey grew frustrated. He had answered 90 emergency calls, and none of them were active fires. In February 2009, Lacey decided to create his own opportunity to be a hero. He splashed gasoline on the staircase of a neighbor’s home and lit it on fire. Lacey ran 0.8 kilometers (0.5 mi) to his firehouse and put on his gear. He was long ready by the time the alarm sounded. Lacey and his crew rushed to the fire. As Lacey was new, he was not allowed to enter the burning building. He held the hydrant secure for his colleagues as they fought to control the flames. [1] Lacey had lit the fire in the worst possible spot. The staircase he burned was the second floor’s only exit. Several of the residents survived by jumping from windows. However, a mother and her three children died in the blaze. Less than two weeks later, Lacey was arrested and charged with arson. After being found guilty of manslaughter and arson, he was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 9 John Orr In Glendale, California, John Orr was a 17-year firefighting veteran who received national acclaim for his investigative work. He was also an arsonist. Orr liked to set fires in the back of occupied businesses using a signature time-delay device consisting of a cigarette, matches, a rubber band, and a piece of paper. Orr spent years undetected as an arsonist. The respected fire captain seemed immune from suspicion. However, people began to notice that fire followed Orr. Arson rates rose wherever Orr went—even arson investigator conventions. Arson investigators could no longer ignore the evidence against Orr, so they stuck tracking devices on his car. After a few months, they had enough evidence to arrest him. Police discovered a manuscript— Points of Origin —in his home. The novel described the activities of a firefighter-turned-arsonist who used his knowledge to outwit the authorities. The novel’s protagonist used a slow-burning incendiary device to burn a hardware store, killing a woman and her grandson. The crime mimicked one of Orr’s own. Orr wrote in the manuscript, “The deaths were blotted out of his mind. It wasn’t his fault. Just stupid people acting as stupid people do.” Orr was convicted of 20 cases of arson, including a firestorm in which 67 homes sustained damage or were completely destroyed. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. After he was imprisoned, brush fires around his area near Los Angeles declined by 98 percent. Authorities believe that Orr was responsible for close to 2,000 fires over a seven-year period ending in 1991. [2] 8 Leonard Gregg Part-time firefighter Leonard Gregg lived with his girlfriend and her five children in Cibecue, Arizona. The family was low on money. However, there were no jobs nearby and Gregg was only paid when he fought a fire. In 2002, he decided to light a fire in hopes that he would land a job with the Bureau of Indian Affairs on the quick-response fire crew. Gregg used matches to set dry grass on fire, but it was quickly put out. He decided to light another. The new fire spread quickly. Gregg was one of the first people called to fight the blaze. However, the firefighters could not contain the fire. Gregg’s wildfire merged with another fire, which had been started by a stranded hiker who was trying to signal a news helicopter. These wildfires formed a “wall of fire” that threatened several communities, and 30,000 people needed to be evacuated. It took thousands of firefighters nearly a month to contain the blaze. By the time the fire was extinguished, it had destroyed 463,000 acres, at least 423 homes, and the local timber industry. Gregg was found guilty of two counts of arson, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was also ordered to pay $27.9 million in restitution. [3] 7 David Plante In Stoddard, New Hampshire, volunteer firefighter David Plante used a flint to start a small brush fire in April 2016. It burned 16 acres before firefighters controlled it. The next day, Plante started another fire using a glass bottle and sunlight to spark the flames. The fire quickly burned through the undeveloped woodland. As Plante ran away from the fire, he came across two firefighters. He told them that he had seen two people light the fire before they fled on an ATV and a motorbike. Plante then asked the firefighters to use his cell phone to take a picture of him standing in front of the fire. The firefighters were suspicious of Plante, and they reported both him and his suspects to the police. Plante’s fire spread. It burned through nearly 200 acres of land, and residents from 17 homes had to be evacuated. Firefighters from around the state came to put out the fire. It took more than 100 to tame the flames. Police confronted Plante and asked him to take a polygraph. It showed that his story was false, and he confessed during the post-examination interview. He pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and was sentenced to 2.5–7 years in prison. He also had to pay more than $600,000 in restitution. [4] 6 David Clifton Parks In Virginia, David Parks was an accomplished career firefighter. Unfortunately, he had a problem with alcohol. When he was drunk, he developed a fascination with fire. One evening, Parks downed 15–18 beers and several mixed drinks. Then he went on a two-hour arson spree that damaged a car and four buildings. Police observed Parks’s drunken driving and pulled him over. They watched him hide matches under his front seat, and they discovered a 4-liter (1 gal) plastic container of gasoline in the back seat. As police attempted to arrest Parks, they had to forcibly remove him from his car. Parks pleaded guilty to arson and was sentenced to eight years in prison. [5] Shortly after his release, Parks got drunk and lit a barn on fire. He confessed and admitted that he had “a problem with setting fires.” Parks was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to undergo mandatory alcohol and mental health counseling. 5 Ryan J. Campbell In Monroe County, Pennsylvania, volunteer firefighters Ryan Campbell and Daniel Dreisbach decided to leave high school early in September 2002. They and Campbell’s girlfriend, Amanda Eckert, went to a nearby field and smoked marijuana. Dreisbach complained that the fire company had not responded to a fire in a long time. He suggested that they burn a nearby abandoned house so that they could extinguish the flames. After the teens drove to their firehouse, Campbell and Dreisbach went inside and stole road flares. They drove to the trailer home, and the boys set it on fire. Then they dropped Eckert off and sped to the firehouse to respond to the expected alarm. Campbell was speeding and lost control of his car. It bounced off a pole and crashed into a wooded area. Dreisbach died, and Campbell suffered serious leg and hip injuries. Eckert told police of the teens’ involvement in the arson. Campbell pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 months to five years in a county jail. [6] 4 Robert Eric Eason Robert Eason was a captain at his California firehouse, and his colleagues regarded him as a top-notch firefighter. However, Eason enjoyed starting fires more than fighting them. He created time-delay incendiary devices from mosquito coils, slow-burning spirals of claylike insect repellent. Eason was able to throw the devices out of his moving car. He would often return with his crew to extinguish the flames. Although most of his fires were small, one was a 1,000-acre blaze that killed 200 sheep. Fire officials began to suspect an arsonist, and they set up surveillance cameras. The cameras showed Eason driving past 12 spots where fires later started. Police obtained a search warrant and discovered pieces of incendiary devices in Eason’s garbage can and car. In 2006, Eason was arrested and convicted of starting a dozen wildfires. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Police suspect that Eason had started many more fires. Similar incendiary devices had been found at the sites of other fires since 1988, the year Eason had become a firefighter. Officials believe that he may have set as many as 143 fires throughout his 18-year career as a firefighter. [7] 3 Peter Waraksa Peter Waraksa set dozens of fires during his time as a volunteer firefighter in Connecticut. Few of the fires caused significant damage, although one killed married couple Orie and Assunta Weeks. No one suspected that the 1986 fire had been caused by arson, and Waraksa continued his career as a firefighter. He always arrived at the fires first, reported several of them, and found grass and wood fires that no other firefighter could. Waraksa’s colleagues became suspicious and nicknamed him “Pyro Pete.” Waraksa’s bosses asked him to leave, and he started working with his town’s emergency management response team. About 20 years passed, and Waraksa was arrested for sexually assaulting five boys. He was sentenced to five years in prison. A detective attempted to talk to Waraksa about the molestations. Instead, Waraksa admitted to setting fires in the 1980s, including the one that had killed Orie and Assunta Weeks. Waraksa told the officer that the fires calmed his anger and provided a way to get revenge. After Waraksa was charged with arson murder, he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison. [8] 2 Benjamin Cunha Benjamin Cunha found his job as a volunteer firefighter with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection boring. There were few fires and little opportunity to make money. In 2006, he decided to remedy this by lighting several fires. He planned to help fight the flames and wanted to impress his colleagues with his skills. Fire investigators discovered Cunha’s involvement with three wildfires, and he confessed to setting at least 30 fires. Cunha told investigators that he had used his knowledge as a firefighter to create the incendiary devices. He had wanted to “create fires big enough that significant firefighting resources would be required to extinguish the fires.” [9] He pleaded guilty to arson and was sentenced to a year in jail. Cunha had to register as an arsonist for the rest of his life and wear a tracking device during the fire season. After he was released, he was identified as the prime suspect in two more fires. At least one was started with a time-delay device, the same tool he had admitted to using years earlier to ignite more than two dozen wildfires. In 2016, he pleaded guilty to felony arson and was sentenced to five years in prison. 1 Ryan G. Scharber In Babbitt, Minnesota, fire chief Ryan Scharber was having trouble at home. He and his wife had recently had a second son, and the infant cried more than usual. Eventually, the baby was screaming nonstop day and night. Scharber wanted a break from the crying infant, so he decided to start lighting fires in vacant woodland areas. He was always one of the first responders who fought the fires and investigated the suspicious circumstances. His fires caught the attention of federal agents. While no one was injured in the blazes, the area was facing unusually dry conditions and the authorities were afraid that the fires would spread. They could not find a suitable suspect. As months passed, they began to suspect that the arsonist was a firefighter, although they had no leads. Scharber drove to a remote area and attempted to start another fire. He was caught by Don Mattila, the owner of a nearby fishing resort. Scharber claimed that he was just there to urinate, but Mattila did not believe him. Mattila asked Scharber to leave and then followed Scharber’s tracks in the snow. When this led to a half-full can of gas, Mattila called the police. Arson investigators began following Scharber and tracking his every move. They secretly installed surveillance cameras in various locations, obtained cell phone records, and put a GPS tracking device on his vehicle. In December 2012, they confronted Scharber. He denied responsibility and tried to steer the investigation toward other suspects. The investigators showed Scharber the evidence against him, and he confessed to setting nine fires. Scharber explained that he set fires as “an excuse to get out of his house for a few hours to get relief from his newborn child’s acid reflux issues.” [10] After pleading guilty to arson, he was sentenced to five years in prison.

"AFP, AFP, Qadeer Tanoli, News Desk, AFP, News Desk, Riazul Haq, News Desk, Our Correspondent, News Desk","PHOTO: AFP WASHINGTON: Russia is acting as “both arsonist and firefighter” in Syria, where it claims it wants to settle the civil war even as it stokes the conflict, a top US general said on Tuesday. General Joe Votel, who heads the US military’s Central Command (Centcom), blasted Moscow for its role in Syria’s seven-year-old war that in recent weeks has morphed in unexpected ways — including an incident that saw apparent Russian mercenaries killed after they attacked US advisors and Kurdish forces. “Diplomatically and militarily, Moscow plays both arsonist and firefighter, fueling tensions among all parties in Syria,” Votel told lawmakers. Russia calls daily truce in battered Syria enclave Moscow then serves “as an arbiter to resolve disputes, attempting to undermine and weaken each party’s bargaining positions.” Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped into Syria’s civil war in late 2015, when Moscow began assisting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, while a US-led coalition separately battled the Islamic State group in the country’s north. More than two years later, with momentum on Assad’s side, Putin ordered the partial withdrawal of Russia’s troops from Syria in December, saying their task in the war-torn country had been largely completed. Observers question how much of a withdrawal has actually taken place, and Votel said Russia is using its presence in Syria to test and exercise new weapons and tactics, “often with little regard for collateral damage or civilian casualties.” While the United Nations in Geneva is trying to find a solution to the bloody conflict that has claimed more than 340,000 lives, Russia is leading a separate peace process in the Kazakh capital Astana, along with Turkey and Iran. “Moscow continues to advocate for alternate diplomatic initiatives to Western-led political negotiations in Syria and Afghan-led peace processes in Afghanistan, attempting to thwart the UN’s role and limit the advance of American influence,” Votel told the House Armed Services Committee. “Either Russia has to admit it is not capable or it does not want to play a role in ending the Syrian conflict. I think their role is incredibly destabilizing at this point,” he added. In Syria, the US-led coalition is backing a largely Kurdish group called the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is fighting IS. US blasts Russia over strikes on Syria rebel enclave The coalition on February 7 struck a formation of pro-regime forces attacking an SDF position accompanied by US advisors east of the Euphrates river in eastern Syria, killing about 100 people. Many Russian mercenaries were reported killed in the strike, according to their relatives and paramilitary groups, as well as political organizations that published information about the casualties. Votel declined to publicly comment when asked if the men were in fact Russian, but said he would tell lawmakers in a classified setting. “We have characterized them as pro-regime forces, at this point,” is all he would say on the matter. Russians killed in clash with US-led forces in Syria, say associates While IS has lost almost all the land it once held in Syria, Votel warned that the fight is not yet over. Still, he said he didn’t not want to see the anti-IS mission broaden to take on militias backed by rival Iran, which supports Assad.

Kevin,"That headline is a little misleading, I suppose, because as at least one well-respected and probably award-winning legal expert has concluded, it is not illegal in New York to drive with an axe embedded in the roof of your car. See “ It Is Not Illegal to Drive With an Axe Embedded in the Roof of Your Car ” (July 26, 2017). Doors are apparently optional there as well. But here are some things that are illegal in New York, based on the fact the same guy was charged with all of them in connection with that single incident: Price was charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs, driving while ability impaired by the combined influence of drugs, no license plates, unregistered motor vehicle, uninspected motor vehicle, operating without insurance, no front windshield, and no safety glass. And here are some other illegal things: burglary, violating a protective order, contempt, larceny, resisting arrest, criminal mischief, and attempted escape. Because he did those the following week : Price was arrested on Friday [Aug. 4] when police responded after he broke a protection order. He fled the home but was found by a state trooper nearby. The investigation that followed led to him being charged with burglary, criminal contempt, and attempted petit larceny. In addition, Price was not cooperative during his arrest, at one point kicking out the rear door window of a patrol car in an attempt to escape. As a result, he was further charged with resisting arrest, criminal mischief, and attempted escape. Police say Price also bent the rear seat in order to access the wiring. This caused damage to the patrol vehicle in excess of $3,000, according to police. That was actually the second time he had violated the protection order—the first time was on July 18, just four hours after it was issued. And two days after that, he was arrested on marijuana charges, although who cares. But, just to recap, between July 18 and August 4, 2017, Mr. Jared Price was arrested for and/or charged with: violating a protective order, unlawfully growing cannabis, unlawfully possessing marijuana, driving while ability impaired by drugs, driving while ability impaired by the combined influence of drugs, no license plates, unregistered motor vehicle, uninspected motor vehicle, operating without insurance, no front windshield, no safety glass, burglary, violating the protective order again, contempt, larceny, resisting arrest, criminal mischief, and attempted escape. Result: probation. Five years of probation, but that’s still a perplexingly light sentence even if he did plead guilty to … well, to some permutation of those many charges, I’m not going to figure that one out. Especially given the apparent need for a protective order, and his tendency to ignore it, under what scenario does it not seem like Jared should spend at least a little time indoors? In some place where he can’t get hold of an axe? Maybe even more perplexing, though, is this: I have read maybe a dozen reports about Jared’s exploits, and so far as I can tell, not one reporter has ever asked him what the deal was with the axe. Not that his explanation was likely to make any sense, but I’d have enjoyed reading it. His probation would theoretically expire in 2023, but I’m sure he’s already violated it.

NICOLE LAWTON AND CATRIN OWEN,"NICOLE LAWTON AND CATRIN OWEN Last updated 15:46, January 23 2018 Fire crews at the scene of Monday's fire at the Parks Residence building in the Auckland CBD. An Auckland building has been set alight by a suspected arsonist for the second time this week. The building, Parks Residences on Albert St, is still under construction but due to open in a month. On Monday, 15 fire crews were called to put out several fires that lit up on multiple levels throughout the building. Fire and Emergency NZ communications shift manager Scott Osmond said six fire crews were called to the ""suspected arson"" incident on Tuesday at 2:52pm. He said fire crews were checking the whole building but believed there was only the one fire. ""It was just a piece of paper on the stove, it hadn't spread to the rest of the building."" It had been extinguished by people working on site, possibly the construction workers, he said. ""It's a concern for us, what's going on in this particular building - we have no idea what's going on. Hopefully police and fire investigators will get in top of it."" It was similar to the suspected arson attempts on Monday, he said. Fire and emergency teams were called twice over the course of Monday to the high-rise apartment building. Between 50 and 60 firefighters were called to tackle the Monday afternoon blaze. Fire and emergency area commander Geoff Purcell told Stuff on Monday there were several fires on multiple levels. It was believed the fires were deliberate, Purcell said at the time. Construction company Naylor Love is the main contractor for the high-rise building. Chief executive Rick Herd said police and fire investigators continued to make inquiries. ""Considering the number of people coming and going on the site it would be easy for a person to get through wearing a high-vis and hard hat,"" Herd said. However, the site did have security guards, he said. Fire investigator Jason Goffin said the site was been treated as a crime scene and had been handed over to the police. The building met all the fire regulations and was up to date, he said. Auckland central police areas investigations manager senior sergeant Nina Pederson said police were investigating Monday's fires. ""Each fire was caused by a flammable substance being left on the stove-stop,"" Pederson said. The fires were still being treated as suspicious, she said. ""Nobody was injured however, there was some localised damaged in the apartments where the fires broke out and some surrounding apartments, including water damage from the sprinklers being activated."" Police were looking at CCTV footage, Pederson said. Police want to hear from anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area around the time the fires were reported.

"Nasir Butt, Reuters, Our Correspondent, Khalid Mahmood, AFP, News Desk","Missing eyewitness tells court he was in hiding due to threats to his life. PHOTO: FILE
KARACHI: An important development took place in the proceedings in the Baldia factory fire case on Tuesday. A witness, who had not appeared before the court earlier due to threats to his life, came forward and recorded his statement. The special anti-terrorism court hearing the case issued notices to the judicial magistrate after the counsels for the accused completed cross-examination of the witness.
Special public prosecutor Sajid Mehbood Sheikh presented the eyewitness before the court. The witness, whose name was not disclosed due to security concerns, recorded his statement before the court and identified accused Zubair Charya.
The witness stated that he was present at the Baldia factory on the day of the incident. He said that Zubair Charya and his accomplices came to the warehouse on that day. They smoked hashish outside the warehouse bathroom after which Zubair Charya threw packets of chemicals on the clothes in the warehouse which immediately caught fire, said the eyewitness. Zubair Charya then did the same at the second floor, he added.
‘Six years after Baldia factory fire, working conditions still not changed’
According to the witness, Charya was smiling as the fire broke out. “I can identify the accomplices of Zubair Charya,” claimed the witness.
Public Prosecutor Sheikh said that accused Abdur Rehman alias Bhola had confessed in his statement that he had given the chemicals to Zubair Charya, to put the factory on fire.
The counsels for Charya and Abdur Rehman cross-questioned the witness over his statement. They asked why the witness was recording his statement after such a long time.
“I had threats to my life which is why I went to Punjab,” replied the witness. “The joint investigation team (JIT) summoned me and took responsibility for my security which is why I came and recorded the statement,” he added.
The eyewitness also recorded the statement under Section 164 before the judicial magistrate.
The court issued notice to the judicial magistrate for his statement on the next hearing, and adjourned the hearing.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, prosecutor Sheikh said that accused Rehman had confessed that he was also present near the factory at the time of the fire and had witnessed the entire incident with his eyes.
The case
Over 250 workers were burnt alive when the multi-storey garment factory building was set on fire in Baldia Town in September, 2012.
In February last year, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) had finally indicted Muttahida Qaumi Movement – Pakistan (MQM-P) lawmaker Rauf Siddiqui, former sector incharge Abdul Rehman alias Bhola, Zubair alias Charya, Abdul Sattar Khan, Umar Hassan Kadri, Iqbal Adeeb Khanum and four gatekeepers of the ill-fated industrial unit – Shahrukh, Fazal Ahmed, Arshad Mehmood and Ali Mohammad – for their alleged involvement in the tragic incident.
Sindh govt disputes compensation figure for Baldia fire victims
According to the prosecution, Bhola, during interrogation as well as before a magistrate, had disclosed that he along with Zubair and others had set fire to the factory on the instructions of then chief of the MQM organising committee Hammad Siddiqui because the factory owners had refused to pay the demanded ‘protection money’.
In February, earlier this year, another eyewitness had identified Zubair Charya as having been present at the factory when it was set on fire. People were burning in the fire inside the factory and Zubair Charya was smiling, the eyewitness had told the court.
Twists and turns
Initially, the police had charge-sheeted the owners – Abdul Aziz Bhaila and his sons Arshad and Shahid – as well as some employees of the ill-fated industrial unit in the tragic incident. However, reinvestigation of the case was ordered in March 2016 through a joint investigation team after an earlier JIT report, which was submitted in the Sindh High Court in February 2015, revealed that the factory was set on fire after its owners failed to pay ‘protection money’.

Dan Wickline,"Jaime Murray has done a lot of genre television, most recently appearing on Once Upon A Time. But she’s also had major roles on Defiance, Warehouse 13, Ringer, Hustle, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, and Valentine. But the role I always think about her for was arsonist Lila Tournay on Dexter. We appeared in the same episode… sure, I was a dead body no where near her, but that still counts. Now she’s adding vampire to her resume as she joins the final season of the CW series The Originals. TVLine is reporting the Murray will be playing Antoinette, a beautiful, old-school vampire who meets Elijah just after he loses his memories. She is flirtatious and free-spirited, but it hides a past full of dark secrets. She is set to make her first appearance in episode three, which will be directed by series star Joseph Morgan. Also joining the series for the final season are Torrance Coombs ( Reign ) as Declan and Jedidiah Goodacre ( Descendants ) as Roman. Candice King (aka Caroline Forbes), who will reprise her Vampire Diaries role for several episodes of the spinoff’s final run. As of right now, no premier date for the fifth season of The Originals has been set.

Beatriz E. Valenzuela,"Firefighters battling the Cranston fire near Idyllwild planned to make a stand in the populated Pine Cove area on Thursday night, hoping the flames lay down as they often do when the sun sets. “That’s their main concern. That’s where the homes are,” said Lyn Sieliet, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. Fire crews were aiming to hold the flames at the south ridgeline on the mountain. The strategy emerging late Thursday came at the end of a long day in which more than 1,000 firefighters endured triple-digit temperatures as they worked to slow the spread of the blaze, which grew to 7,500 acres, with 5 percent containment. The possibly arsonist-sparked fire has destroyed five homes, forced 6,000 people to evacuate and cut power to several mountain communities. Almost 5,000 structures remained threatened. Officials also were working to restore power to hundreds of residents as the flames damaged the region’s infrastructure.

(Photo by Watchara Phomicinda, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) The severity of the fire and its effects prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency, an act that eases some of the governmental regulations that might impede efforts at recovery and allows for special assistance. By early Friday, fire officials were likely to find themselves in a good news-bad news situation. The flames are pushing to the southeast toward an unpopulated federally designated wilderness area. The bad news: Because of the designation, no motorized vehicles are allowed on the land, Sieliet said. That means the fire will be fought from the air and by crews on foot who will battle the flames with whatever they can carry on their backs. “We have to adjust our tactics a little bit, but we are still going to fight this fire aggressively,” Sieliet said. Flames continued to run up steep, rugged terrain Thursday through various types of extremely dry brush, including manzanita, which burns more ferociously because of the oil content. The 5 percent containment by day’s end represented the percentage of the perimeter that firefighters have determined the fire will no longer spread beyond. There were no new reports of homes burning; five were damaged or destroyed Wednesday, the day the fire ignited off Highway 74 between Hemet and Mountain Center. Two firefighters suffered unspecified injuries. The communities under mandatory evacuation orders are Pine Cove, Fern Valley, Cedar Glen, Idyllwild, Apple Canyon, Mountain Center, Lake Hemet, northern Garner Valley and Hurkey Creek. Pine Cove residents had been allowed to return Wednesday night before the permission was rescinded. Residents of southern Garney Valley were warned that evacuations are possible should conditions change. Many campgrounds and trails in Mt. San Jacinto State Park and the San Bernardino National Forest are closed. The Pacific Crest Trail, north of Highway 74, is among them. Those who remained behind were trying to make the best of it. The Red Kettle restaurant stayed open despite running on a generator and offering a limited menu. A man checked on neighbors’ pets. Idyllwild Bake Shop and Brew put out food and drinks for firefighters. And Idyllwild Chevron stayed open long past normal business hours to fuel up residents’ vehicles and fire engines. The man suspected of setting the fire, Brandon N. McGlover, 32, of Temecula, is expected to be arraigned Friday. He was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of five counts of arson to wildland, and Thursday the jail log newly included five counts of arson to a structure and one count of aggravated arson. Capt. Scott Visyak of Cal Fire spoke about McGlover on Thursday morning at the command center set up at Lake Hemet. “It makes you angry, and it makes you mad,” he said. “But we have a job, and that is our focus now.” Visyak said firefighters don’t have enough trucks to defend every home, and they are giving priority to places that comply with the recommended 100-foot defensible space perimeter, an area where plants, grass and shrubs are managed to minimize fire danger to the home. “We are going to evaluate each structure and the ones that are very easily defendable, as well as the surrounding ones, are the ones we are going to take priority on,” he said. “The ones that haven’t had their defensible space or have a lot of overgrowth — it’s just a recipe for disaster … But we are going to try and save every house that we possibly can,” Visyak said. #CranstonFire AM Operational Briefing by CIIMT1 Operations Section Chief Chad Cook pic.twitter.com/nxYSDnfYl0 — San Bernardino National Forest (@SanBernardinoNF) July 27, 2018 The fire was doing more than burning homes and brush; the infrastructure and area residents’ health were being affected as well. Power outages throughout the Cranston fire area interrupted cell phone and internet service for residents of the San Jacinto Mountain communities, where electricity delivery to thousands has been either damaged from the blaze or purposely shut off for safety. Southern California Edison reported more than 9,000 customers in the Cranston fire area were without power Thursday. The number from Edison includes 4,000 of its own customers, plus 5,200 Anza Electric Cooperative customers. The cooperative is fed from Southern California Edison’s system. Smoke and ash have resulted in unhealthy air quality for residents in the San Jacinto Valley and mountains, prompting the local air district to issue a smoke advisory through Friday morning. Areas that may be directly affected by smoke and unhealthful air quality are all in Riverside County and include Perris Valley, Anza, Hemet, San Jacinto Valley and parts of the Coachella Valley, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Any resident that smells smoke or sees ash falling from the fire should stay indoors with the windows and doors closed and avoid any vigorous physical activity, said Patrick Chandler, a district spokesman.

ANDRE CHUMKO,"ANDRE CHUMKO Last updated 14:33, January 3 2018 Police are appealing for sightings of a man after a house in Flaxmere was ravaged by a suspicious fire. A trail of blood can be seen running up Tracey Hibbs driveway and on the fence that an alleged arsonist leapt over as he fled a burning house. Police are investigating the fire that ravaged the house, on Holmes Place in the Hastings suburb of Flaxmere at about 3pm on Tuesday. Detective Sergeant Daryl Moore said there was evidence suggesting someone had entered the house shortly before the fire, and left before emergency services arrived. Police are investigating a suspicious house fire in Flaxmere. (File photo) ""There is a trail of blood leading from the house down to Boston Crescent which is over 200 metres away,"" Moore said. Hibbs, who lives in a property opposite the burned house, said her family was at home when the blaze happened, but they did not hear anything. ""The neighbour next door called out my name, she said 'Tracey, keep the kids inside' and then I noticed the smoke and the flames,"" Hibbs said. Pictured, blood left on the back side of neighbour Tracey Hibbs' fence. ""You could feel heat, if you stood at the end of the driveway, you could feel the heat coming."" Hibbs then took her neighbour's child, as well as her own daughter, inside, before coming back out and checking that the man who lived behind the ravaged property was alright. She then noticed a trail of blood on her driveway. It is believed a non-English speaking couple from Samoa, along with their 1-year-old baby, were living in the house, however they were out for the afternoon when the blaze occurred. ""We thought it was one of the kids' bleeding nose, but then we realised that the blood trail had gone from [the burned house] then it came up here, and it's gone right the way through our property and over the fence,"" she said. On Tuesday night, Hibbs and a friend went for a walk and found more blood at the car park of a nearby school, Kimi Ora Community School, which is on the other side of a field at the back of Hibbs' house. ""We reckon they've got into a getaway car and they've driven off. But the person has lost a lot of blood."" A trail of blood, thought to be from the perpetrator, was left behind on Hibbs' driveway. Hibbs said a non-English speaking Samoan couple and their 1-year-old baby lived in the ravaged property, but they were out for the afternoon when the fire happened. Stuff understands the man who lived behind the burned property lived alone, and was the first person to notice the blaze, as smoke started filling his house. Hibbs said the fire had made her ""nervous"". Hibbs believed the perpetrator fled the scene by jumping over her back fence and running across this field, to a getaway car parked in a school car park. ""It's still scary that someone could do that to such a nice family,"" she said. ""They don't speak English, they're the nicest neighbours in the world and they have a baby, and it was just Christmas not too long ago, so all the Christmas presents are gone. It's just scary."" She said the family was ""in shock"" on Tuesday afternoon, after being called home to the blaze. She did not know where they were staying now. Moore said police would like to speak to a ""person of interest"" who was seen in Boston Crescent shortly after the fire. He said the person was a man believed to be 25-30 years old. He was described as Polynesian, approximately 175 to 180 centimetres tall, about 85 to 95 kilograms and of an athletic build. He had a scraggly afro of dark hair, about two inches long, with stubble on his face. He was wearing a navy blue T-shirt and spoke English with a strong accent. Moore said he was likely to have a fresh injury to one of his hands or arms that will be bandaged or covered with some plasters. Anyone who has seen this man, or has any information, is asked to call the Hawke's Bay Police CIB on 06 873 0531 or call Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. - Stuff",A trail of blood can be seen running up Tracey Hibbs driveway and on the fence that an alleged arsonist leapt over as he fled a burning house.,2018-01-03T01:33:18Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Stuff.co.nz'}",Neighbour finds trail of blood leading from house destroyed in suspicious fire in Flaxmere,https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/100302431/Neighbour-finds-trail-of-blood-leading-from-house-destroyed-in-suspicious-fire-in-Flaxmere,https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/n/p/x/3/f/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1nptun.png/1514943201931.jpg,,Stuff.co.nz,arsonist,1
Matt Webb Mitovich,"This week on The CW’s Arrow, Oliver was subject to the unexpected perils of Level Two, while Felicity and Dinah each found themselves forming surprising alliances. Meanwhile in the future, Roy and William returned to Star City — for better or for worse. THE SINS OF THE FATHER In perhaps the least compelling part of the episode, Oliver arrived on Slabside’s ominous Level Two, only to not meet Demon but instead be subject to the psychobabble of a Dr. Jarrett Parker. In a series of scenes that to me covered much of the same ground as his torturing by Prometheus, Oliver was pressed to revisit that moment that the playboy billionaire became Green Arrow. Hearing the story of what happened on the raft after the Queen’s Gambit ‘s sinking, Parker argued that Oliver was not saved by his father’s dying words but condemned — and that he in turn may commit William to a murderous life. Parker eventually uses “the machine” (a table with wires!) to make Oliver envision him and William on the raft instead. And what would Oliver tell his own son in that sitch? “You’re gonna get off this raft and have an amazing life, destined for great things…. Forget about me and go live your life.” Finally and seemingly “cracked,” Oliver says what Parker has been wanting to hear: “My name is Inmate 4587.” BLONDE LEADING THE BLONDE In the boiler room where Rene chained up Silencer, Felicity was warned by the Longbow Hunter that Diaz is only getting stronger (literally true!), and the good guys have “no idea what’s coming.” With Rene unwilling to cross the line into torture, Felicity recruits Laurel to do the heavy, brutal lifting. Alas, Silencer keeps mum even when faced with Laurel’s particular set of skills. Laurel counsels Felicity not to employ worse tactics, saying that she wishes someone had stopped her back on Earth-Two before she got the first blood on her hands. Encouraged to use her big brain, Felicity sets up Silencer to “escape,” though with a tracker on her. Laurel commends her unlikely ally, noting that on Earth-Two, everybody knows Felicity… as the ruthless leader of a business empire. ALL FIRED UP As Rene tried to help police captain Dinah reach out to the overlooked and underserved Glades community, they crossed paths with a serial arsonist who lit up Zoe’s school — though the new Green Arrow arrived in time to save Rene’s daughter. Later, Rene purposely stopped Dinah from getting the drop on this Green Arrow, owing the vigilante a solid. The two NTA alumni quarreled about their current ideologies (as well as Mayor Pollard’s anti-vigilante priorities), though they teamed up in the end — with a big assist from Green Arrow — to capture the arsonist and his sidekick. After she and Rene established a new, informal partnership, Dinah paid Zoe a visit, gifting her with a … canary pin. Hmmmm …. AFTER THE FALL In the future, Roy and grown William arrived in Star City to find it in shambles. Even Smoak Tech is vacant and dilapidated. William manages to crack open a high-tech safe in the wall, just as vigilante-hunting cops arrive on the scene. They get KO’d by an older (but still smokin’) Dinah, who explains that “Star City fell when the Glades rose” up and erected a wall around itself, using SCPD to keep outsiders at bay.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia: ""You are playing with fire and you will be sorry"" Russia has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" and ""playing with fire"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning. Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia told a meeting of the UN Security Council: ""We have told our British colleagues that you are playing with fire and you will be sorry."" The UK claims Russia is behind the attack. Moscow denies responsibility. Britain's UN representative Karen Pierce said the UK's actions ""stand up to any scrutiny"". She likened Moscow's requests to take part in the investigation to an arsonist investigating his own fire. Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on 4 March. Ms Skripal, 33, is recovering in hospital and has released a statement saying her ""strength is growing daily"". Her father, 66, remains critically ill but stable. Moscow called the special meeting of the Security Council in New York to discuss the attack, saying Britain had ""legitimate questions"" to answer. Mr Nebenzia said the accusations were ""horrific and unsubstantiated"", and claimed the UK was waging a ""propaganda war"" against Russia. He said Novichok - the group of nerve agent used in the poisoning - is ""not copyrighted by Russia, in spite of the obviously Russian name"" and has been developed in many countries. ""It's some sort of theatre of the absurd. Couldn't you come up with a better fake story?"" he asked. In his statement to the 15-member council, Mr Nebenzia questioned why Russia would eliminate someone using a ""dangerous and highly public"" method. He contrasted the use of a chemical with the ""hundreds of clever ways of killing someone"" shown in British series Midsomer Murders. Image caption Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital Responding, the British Ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, accused Russia of seeking to ""undermine the international institutions that have kept us safe since the Second World War"". She said Russia came under suspicion for several reasons, saying it had ""a record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations"" and that it ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"". Ms Pierce told delegates that Russia's request to visit Ms Skripal had been passed on and ""we await her response"". ""Ms Skripal's own wishes need to be taken into account,"" Ms Pierce added. Meanwhile, US representative Kelley Currie said Russia was attempting to use the Security Council ""for political gains"", adding: ""This is not a tactic that is appropriate for this body."" It comes amid an escalating diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West as 60 expelled US envoys left Russia on Thursday. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. The UK government has constantly maintained Russia was behind the attack, claiming there is ""no other plausible explanation"". On Wednesday, Russia proposed a joint investigation into the poisoning but the idea was voted down by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In a press conference, Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said it marked a vote against ""transparency"". Meanwhile on Thursday, UK police issued a statement on behalf of Yulia Skripal in which she said her strength was ""growing daily"". It came shortly after Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Ms Skripal and her cousin.","The Guardian Spy poisoning: Russia says UK is 'playing with fire' BBC News Russia has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" and ""playing with fire"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning.

Kevin,"According to the Panama City (Florida) News Herald, a man recently sued the “Gulf Coast Jam” music festival and its security contractor for injuries he suffered in a fall in 2014. The complaint reportedly alleges that the defendants “should have known that the conditions they presented to attendees in the VIP area — unlimited free alcohol, insufficient lighting and an ill-constructed platform — could result in an injury.” For some reason the report does not provide the complaint itself, but based on said report I still foresee difficulties for the plaintiff here. According to the report, the VIP area contained a “multi-level elevated platform” with stairs between each level. The platforms were surrounded by railings but the stairs allegedly weren’t. The plaintiff alleges that a security guard told him to sit down on one of the stairs—why the guard might have done that is not explained—and that when the plaintiff tried to do this, he “lost his balance and fell through the opening and [in?] the handrail [ sic ] causing him to suffer severe and permanent injuries resulting in loss.” So there wasn’t a handrail, or if there was, it had an opening in it, or something like that. The lawsuit also does not explain what injuries the plaintiff suffered, exactly. So, maybe bad lighting and/or platform design were to blame. But if so, the emphasis on “unlimited free alcohol” is odd—especially since the plaintiff doesn’t actually allege he drank any of it: [Plaintiff’s] lawsuit does not explicitly admit that he consumed the “free alcohol” but states that Gulf Coast Jam furnished unlimited quantities for festival-goers with VIP credentials, including himself. By doing that, “it was reasonably foreseeable that alcohol would be consumed by some to the point where normal faculties might be impaired,” the lawsuit states. Emphasis added. That certainly is foreseeable, especially since a desire to impair normal faculties is more or less the reason people drink alcohol to begin with. But it’s hardly relevant unless the plaintiff alleges he drank it himself, which he does not. So that is a bit of a puzzler. But then it looks like it’s not relevant anyway in Florida, where the law says this: A person who sells or furnishes alcoholic beverages to a person of lawful drinking age shall not thereby become liable for injury or damage caused by or resulting from the intoxication of such person, except that a person who … knowingly serves a person habitually addicted to the use of any or all alcoholic beverages may become liable for injury or damage caused by or resulting from the intoxication of such … person. Fla. Stat. § 768.125. Some states have what are called “ dram shop” laws that make alcohol sellers or furnishers liable for injuries caused by someone they “over-served.” But it appears Florida does not, except in cases where someone knowingly served an alcoholic or a minor. But since the plaintiff apparently doesn’t allege he is either of those things, the defendants seem to be on pretty solid ground here, at least as far as the “unlimited free alcohol” claim is concerned. Though alcohol is frequently involved in events mentioned here, it looks like I have only mentioned “dram shop” laws once before, in an item on an even dumber case. See “ Your Drinks Made Me Beat My Wife, Says Plaintiff ” (Dec. 28, 2008). That case involved a non-gentleman (coincidentally, also from Florida) who hit his wife not long after they got off a plane in San Francisco, something he later blamed on United Airlines’ insistence on serving him drinks he asked for during a flight from Japan. I was pretty sure at the time that the case would go nowhere, and having just followed up, it turns out I was right. In fact, it turns out that the plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed the case five days before I wrote about it, so I was even more right than I knew.

TT/The Local,"The man was suspected of arson and attempted murder, reports TT. Emergency services and police responded to alarms of a blaze at an apartment building in Luleå at around 6:30pm on Saturday. A “serious situation” arose at the scene, according to police. A man in his thirties was shot and at around 11:30pm died of his injuries in hospital, police in Luleå confirmed. “When he was shot he was suspected of attempted murder and serious arson at the property,” Johan Aitamaa of the police regional command told TT. “We received information by telephone about what was happening at the scene, and that information, along with what happened after we arrived, caused us to suspect [the man],” Aitamaa added. But reports on Sunday suggested the exact reason police opened fire remains unclear. “I cannot release any more information at this time,” police spokesperson Peder Jonsson said to TT on Sunday. The police were not the target of the attempted murder, which they said took place before they arrived at the scene. “I don’t know exactly how many were involved, but the actual attempted murder was not aimed at the police patrol and occurred prior, while the apartment was on fire,” Aitamaa said. A second person was taken to hospital with smoke-related injuries caused by the blaze. That person is reported to be one of the residents in the building to have raised the fire alarm, TT writes. The fire was extinguished around an hour after the initial alarm, with the area around the building sealed for forensic examination. The police decision to open fire will be investigated by the Department for Special Investigations ( Avdelningen för särskilda utredningar ), which is responsible for internal police investigations.

Sputnik,"On February 27, US Army General Joseph Votel blamed Russia for “playing both arsonist and firefighter, fueling tensions among all parties in Syria… then serving as an arbitrator, to resolve disputes, attempting to undermine and weaken each party's bargaining positions."" The United States has always introduced itself as a Messiah with the responsibility to protect. But has anyone invited Washington to demonstrate its destructive… oops, defensive strategy? So, here's a blast from the past with Sputnik's special selection of four countries where Washington had taken on the roles of ""arsonist and firefighter,"" fanning the flames and then trying to extinguish them (not so much). Afghanistan In 2001, in response to the horrifying 9/11 attacks in the United States, then-president George Bush announced the Global War on terrorism and the beginning of the operation, codenamed ""Enduring Freedom,"" to target al-Qaeda and the Taliban movement in Afghanistan. Washington has been mired in the never-ending war for over sixteen years, and despite its initial advances during the campaign, today the Taliban controls about one-third of Afghanistan, ""more territory than at any point since the US-led invasion."" But has the plight changed a bit since the launch of ""Enduring Freedom""? READ MORE: Terrorists Continue Offensive in Aleppo, Latakia, Daraa Provinces — Russian MoD The US strategy in Afghanistan was in theory to train an Afghan army that could fight the terrorist groups in the country and then to withdraw. After almost seventeen years of continuous warfare, the country is still devastated, and now the situation has deteriorated further due to relentless airstrikes, a dire economic and humanitarian situation; Afghanistan has been a hotbed of terrorism and drug trafficking, and that has not changed since the Western invasion. While Barack Obama pledged to pull troops from the war-torn country in 2014, drawing them down to 8,400 by the end of his term in December 2016, forces nonetheless remained there. And it seems that his successor Donald Trump couldn't just let Afghanistan go, going even further in his decision to retain forces in Afghanistan and to increase the number beyond 8,400. Former US ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald E. Neumann believed that it was Obama's announcement that the US was ""no longer at war with the Taliban"" that eventually gave the movement a chance to retake control of over 70 percent of the territory, thereby prompting the Afghan government to propose to recognize the movement as a legitimate political party to quell the violence. READ MORE: US Threatens Russia With Guerilla War in Syria – Analyst And – surprise, surprise – Daesh has reached Afghanistan, too, having gained a foothold ""under the watch of US military and intelligence forces,"" former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said. He blamed the US for supplying weapons to the group in the country, insisting that military action by foreigners would not bring peace, but would foment extremism instead. ""Military action, especially by foreign forces, will not bring peace. Afghans need to evolve a consensus to reach out to everybody, including 'sons of the soil' Taliban, to seek a settlement,"" he suggested in October 2017. Iraq In 2003 the George Bush Administration justified the Iraq War on the grounds that Saddam Hussein had acquired weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and thereby put in peril the whole Middle East region. The official rationale for the invasion was the need to remove ""a regime that developed and used weapons of mass destruction, that harbored and supported terrorists, committed outrageous human rights abuses, and defied the just demands of the United Nations and the world."" Now, it is a well-known fact that the alliance backed by the US and the UK was accused of faking the evidence of WMD presence in Iraq in order to justify the invasion. Having toppled Hussein and brought the Shiites to power, the United States spurred chaos in the country that, just like Afghanistan, became a cradle of terrorism; the so-called Sons of Iraq, a group of trained rebels, sponsored by the United States, at some point became members of the most violent terrorist group in the history of humankind – Daesh, thus making the West confront a ""weapon"" it had created itself.

Probably, Washington is still dealing with the fire it started up itself. Rumor has it the US is going to relocate its troops from Iraq to Afghanistan to curb the Taliban…Déjà vu? Libya In the wake of the Arab spring on March 17, 2011 the UN Security Council passed a US-drafted resolution authorizing military intervention in Libya in order for Washington and its allies to save people from the dictator Muammar Gaddafi and establish democracy in the country. ""We knew that if we waited one more day, Benghazi—a city nearly the size of Charlotte—could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world,"" Barack Obama declared, having chosen the most eloquent words to appeal to people and reassure them that he was doing the right thing. Later, in a Fox News interview, the former president admitted that it was his ""worst mistake,"" referring to the aftermath of the intervention. ""Probably failing to plan for the day after, what I think was the right thing to do, in intervening in Libya."" The overthrow of Gaddafi, who had controlled all signs of extremist discontent at home with an iron fist, a swift regime change and his brutal murder, opened a Pandora's box of Islamist militancy, destroying the country's statehood and turning it into a ""failed state."" READ MORE: Western Media Coverage of Syria: A Big, Bright Shining Lie What struck people the most was the reaction to the death of Gaddafi from the then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said ""we came, we saw, he died."" As a result of the West's intervention in Libya, the country has lost its sovereignty and has been divided into several parts, with some of them flooded with militants from various groups, including Daesh; thousands of war-weary people have been displaced, others flee for Europe in their quest for a better life abroad, with many being killed in shipwrecks on their route to safe haven; while the United States, with its helpful hand, is reluctant to deal with the mess it has left behind. Syria Since 2014, the US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Daesh targets in Syria without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. Needless to say, Daesh has taken deep roots in Syria, having spread there from Iraq, which was also devastated by Washington. The United States has been repeatedly accused by Syrian media and Damascus itself of targeting civilians and supporting the rebels. “The Syrian Arab Republic urges the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility regarding establishment of international peace and security, and act immediately to stop the war crimes being committed by this alliance against the Syrian people, and ensure that they do not occur again,” two separate letters by the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates addressed to UN Secretary General António Guterres and rotating President of the UN Security Council Mansour Ayyad al-Otaibi read. What is more interesting is that while the US claims it has been supplying the rebels with weapons and military equipment, those arms have occasionally wound up in the hands of terrorist groups that eventually use them against members of the international coalition, or Russia and pro-Damascus forces. Washington's decisions have serious repercussions for the whole region; having announced the beginning of training a 30,000-strong border force, comprised of the Syrian Democratic Forces allegedly linked to YPG and PKK, in Syria's Afrin, the US triggered another crisis in an already war-weary country. Turkey has launched a full-fledged military operation, expressing its strong opposition to the creation of what it described as a ""terrorist army."" At the same time, the developments in Eastern Ghouta showcase Washington's reluctance to deal with rebels it has trained itself that have been shelling Damascus from the area, and contribute to international efforts in providing civilians with a safe escape from the war zone.","On February 27, US Army General Joseph Votel blamed Russia for “playing both arsonist and firefighter, fueling tensions among all parties in Syria… then serving as an arbitrator, to resolve disputes, attempting to undermine and weaken each party's bargaining …",2018-02-28T18:56:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sputniknews.com'}",Top 4 Countries Where US Was 'Arsonist and Firefighter',https://sputniknews.com/us/201802281062091205-four-countries-us-arsonist/,https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/106008/29/1060082963.jpg,,Sputniknews.com,arsonist,1
