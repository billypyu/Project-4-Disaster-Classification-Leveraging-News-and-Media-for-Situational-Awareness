ALAN BLINDER,"The presidents trip came three days after he approved a disaster declaration for Lee County, where residents are eligible for grants for temporary housing and home repairs and loans for uninsured property. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already approved more than $42,000 in assistance in the county. The agency said five applications had been approved and that more were being processed.
FEMA and American presidents have long grappled with the aftermath of severe storms in the South, where hundreds of deaths in the last decade alone have been attributed to tornadoes. Mr. Trump is the fourth consecutive president, at least, to visit Alabama to survey tornado damage.
But as Mr. Trump and the Beauregard community mourned the dead, the state was preparing for the possibility of more severe weather. Although forecasters have gradually become more concerned about dangerous weather in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, experts said that Alabama remained in some jeopardy.
While the setup through the weekend is not as potent as what we saw last weekend, we still have to be vigilant with severe storms as we are now in our spring severe weather season in Alabama, Scott Martin, an Alabama meteorologist, wrote in an analysis on Friday.

Shannon Connellan,"Central Illinois endured several tornadoes on Saturday, resulting in fascinating footage of the funnels spinning through the state. According to ABC News, a total of 22 tornadoes were reported to the National Weather Service, appearing across counties including Christian, Mason, Fulton, Cass, and Macoupin among others. SEE ALSO: Photos of collapsed, cracked roads show the power of Alaska's earthquake The storms reportedly caused injury to at least 20 people and significant structural damage. No reports of fatalities have been recorded in Illinois, although one person has been killed in neighbouring Missouri as a result of the storms. The National Weather Service reportedly deployed teams on Sunday to assess the damage and measure the strength of the twisters. Outgoing Gov. Bruce Rauner activated Illinois' State of Emergency Operations Center on Saturday. ""We activated the State Emergency Operations Center so that we could closely monitor the situation, keep in contact with local officials and quickly mobilize any state assets that may be needed,"" Rauner said in a statement to AP. ""If state assistance is need, we are well-positioned to provide it quickly and efficiently."" Sitting about 25 miles southeast of the state capital of Springfield, the Christian County town of Taylorville was among the hardest hit areas, with major damage to at least 100 buildings reported. The town received a 41-minute advance warning from the National Weather Service. ""It was one of those storms that just blew up,"" Christian County sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp told reporters on Saturday. ""It just kind of came out of nowhere."" Residents across Illinois captured footage and photos of the tornado, with images posted to Twitter over the weekend.

Marcus Gilmer,"Central Iowa was the scene of a ""sudden"" tornado outbreak on Thursday, resulting in some breathtaking videos and photos capturing the terror of multiple funnels that spun through the state. SEE ALSO: This super clear video of a nearly perfect tornado is stunning The town of Bondurant, just northeast of Des Moines, saw multiple funnels caught on camera, including one amazing image from a passenger on an incoming flight taken through their airplane window. Thursday's outbreak even caught forecasters with the National Weather Service by surprise. Rod Donovan, with the National Weather Service in Des Moines, told the Des Moines Register, “we were surprised by the unexpected strength of these. The numbers and the strength of these were a little more than we expected.” Forecasters had predicted some strong storms possible with hail and wind being the primary threats. But multiple supercells fired off throughout the afternoon, spawning the damaging tornados. More footage of the dual twisters was captured near Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. Marshalltown, about 55 miles northeast of Des Moines, was one of the hardest hit communities as a powerful tornado ripped through the downtown area, causing ""catastrophic damage"" to many buildings, including City Hall, and prompting a state of emergency. Pella, Iowa, about 40 miles southeast of Des Moines, was also slammed hard as a tornado destroyed homes and a Vermeer Manufacturing plant. While there was heavy damage to structures and over a dozen injuries reported throughout the area, so far there have been no fatalities reported.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately. Oklahoma — a state synonymous with tornadoes — didn't have a single twisters through April 30, a new record. Instead, states from Texas north to Nebraska have been dealing with dust storms and sprawling, fast-moving grass fires as unusually dry weather has taken its toll on the region. That tornado and precipitation drought changes on Tuesday, as a complex series of storm systems unleashes several rounds of severe thunderstorms across the region. SEE ALSO: Epic deluge in Hawaii may have broken all-time U.S. rainfall record, with 4 feet in 24 hours The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) — the arm of the National Weather Service responsible for issuing severe thunderstorm outlooks — issued a ""moderate risk"" outlook for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday. In the outlook, the SPC highlighted a small area of Kansas at greatest risk of storms that could bring large hail, damaging winds, and a few potentially strong tornadoes. Plot of annual tornado count, adjusted to remove overcounting from multiple sightings of the same tornado. 2018 is in black. Image: noaa spc. ""Tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong, very large hail, and damaging winds will be possible,"" the SPC stated on its website. Severe thunderstorms are also expected to flare up in Nebraska and Iowa on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Other areas, outside of Kansas, are also at risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday, even if forecaster confidence is lower. These places include Texas and Oklahoma, northward into Iowa. One limiting factor for storms, and a forecasting wild card, is the recent dryness that has contributed to the dire fire weather conditions in the past several weeks. Fires singed more than 350,000 acres in Oklahoma, killing more than 1,000 cattle. Fires are still burning in Oklahoma and Kansas today, at the same time the atmosphere is threatening to unleash a totally different type of hazard. While moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has flowed northward into the heart of what is commonly referred to as ""Tornado Alley,"" the dryness of soils in these states could act to inhibit the formation of severe storms. The threat of severe weather will ramp up on Wednesday and linger into Thursday as a series of storms dives into the Southwest, and moves across the Plains and Midwest. By Friday, it's quite possible that Oklahoma will have recorded its first tornado of the season. While tornado season usually peaks during the next few weeks, the same weather pattern responsible for the extraordinarily chilly April across much of the U.S. helped put a lid on severe storm activity up until now. Mother Nature has a lot of catching up to do if the season is going to turn out to be close to average.","The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately.

Second Severe Weather Season Although the threat of tornadoes is generally highest in the spring, fall is considered the second severe weather season. The highest threat of tornadoes in November is from eastern Texas into Alabama, which is included in the area to watch this week. This is due to southward dips in the jet stream and cold fronts that track across the South and Midwest, where warmer temperatures and higher dew points are more likely to be found in November compared to areas farther north. The average number of tornadoes in the U.S. in November from 1991-2015 is 56.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - A pair of tornadoes killed at least 23 people on Sunday in Alabama, causing infrastructure damage with at least 150 miles per hour (241 kph) winds in the deadliest twister to hit the United States in almost six years. 
The following is a list of some of the deadliest single tornadoes and tornado outbreaks in the United States over the last quarter century: 
* A so-called Super Outbreak of 362 tornadoes hit the southeastern United States over three days in April 2011, killing an estimated 321 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Three of the tornadoes were rated EF-5, the top of the five-step Enhanced Fujita scale that meteorologists use to measure tornado strength. The system struck Alabama the hardest, wrecking Tuscaloosa and Birmingham and causing about $11 billion in damages across 12 states. 
* The deadliest tornado to hit the United States in the last several decades struck Joplin, Missouri on May 22, 2011 and killed at least 158 people, NOAA said. Damage from the storm exceeded $3 billion, the most of any single tornado in U.S. history. 
* The so-called Super Tuesday Outbreak of 87 tornadoes in the southeastern United States on Feb. 5, 2008, killed 57 people, according to NOAA. It had the longest footprint of any tornado in U.S. history, according to private forecaster Accuweather, touching down continuously for 122 miles (196 km) through Arkansas. 
* A tornado outbreak in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area on May 3, 1999, spawned 61 tornadoes and killed 55 people, with one single tornado responsible for 36 deaths, according to the Weather Channel. 
* An outbreak of seven tornadoes in central Florida in February 1998 killed 42 people and injured 260 others in the state’s deadliest tornado outbreak since 1962, the National Weather Service reported. 
* In April 2014, an outbreak of dozens of tornadoes stirred up by a powerful storm system hit the Southeast and Midwest over a three-day period and killed 32 people in Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, according to NOAA. 
* A tornado killed 24 people on May 20, 2013 in Moore, Oklahoma. The tornado had winds over 200 miles per hour (322 kph), giving it the most severe rating of EF-5. It lasted about 40 minutes, and caused billions of dollars worth of damage, according to NOAA.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Alabama search and rescue teams on Tuesday were combing through the wreckage of houses flatted by weekend tornadoes, looking for seven or eight people who remained unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. twister outbreak since 2013. 
The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, was beginning to mourn the 23 people confirmed killed by the storms, which included four children and seven people from one family, officials said on Tuesday. 
The victims ranged in age from 6 to 93 years old, Bill Harris, coroner for storm-ravaged Lee County, told a morning news conference. 
“Just keep these families in your prayers,” Harris said. 
Most of the deceased were found in close proximity to their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, officials said. 
County Sheriff Jay Jones said on Tuesday that search crews had narrowed their scope down to “the most affected areas” after scouring much of the county on Monday. He said he hoped the search and rescue effort would become a recovery effort by the end of the day. 
The tornadoes, stirred up by a late-winter “supercell” thunderstorm, toppled mobile homes and uprooted massive trees on Sunday with 170 mile-per-hour (274 km-per hour) winds. Forecasters ranked the worst of the outbreak at step four of the six-step Enhanced Fujita scale of tornado strength. 
The Beauregard community in the twister’s path might have had as few as eight or nine minutes to seek shelter from the time the warning was issued, National Weather Service chief meteorologist Chris Darden said. 
In addition to 23 confirmed deaths, more than 50 people were reported injured, authorities said, making this the deadliest tornado outbreak since a massive tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, killing 24 people and injuring 375 others.

Cynthia Fodor,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowans in three communities are starting to clean up after several tornadoes tore through central Iowa Thursday. Among dozens of homes and several businesses that were damaged, miraculously there were no lives lost and there are no reports of serious injuries. Gov. Kim Reynolds and Lt. Gov. Adam Gregg, along with Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Acting Director Joyce Flinn, will tour areas impacted by severe storms and tornadoes on Friday. National Weather Service experts will also be assessing tornado damage. They confirm 27 tornadoes were reported in Iowa Thursday, and 5 are confirmed to have touched down. MARSHALLTOWN Sky8 video shows Marshalltown tornado damage from the air Marshalltown appeared to have been hit the hardest. Brick walls collapsed in the streets and roofs were blown off buildings. The only hospital in Marshalltown was damaged and patients were being transferred. Thousands of people are still without power after tornadoes that struck Marshalltown and other Iowa communities. On Friday Alliant Energy was working to restore electricity to nearly 6,400 customers in the Marshalltown area, which appeared to have been hit the hardest Thursday afternoon. The Marshall County Courthouse, several businesses and dozens of homes damaged, but few injuries and no deaths have been reported. The Red Cross has set up an emergency shelter for those impacted by the tornado that hit Marshalltown. It is located at the Meskwaki Conference Center at the Meskwaki Hotel/Casino in Tama. Anyone displaced can stay at the shelter. The tornado hit Marshalltown just as clothing shop owner Stephanie Moz, her husband and their 2-month-old baby were taking a late lunch break. She says the storm broke out the shop's window, ruined the clothing and hats they had on display and destroyed her husband's vehicle, but she's relieved. She says, ""We went through a tornado and survived. I'm happy."" Moz says she heard a storm siren and her mother texted her to seek shelter, so she and her 2-month-old son, Fredy Jr., rushed to the basement. Her husband looked outside and then ran back, shouting ""Get in the basement. It's right over us."" They could hear booms and crashes, and a gust of wind blew through the basement, but they emerged safely. Moz says, ""We're OK. Not a scratch."" The baby? He barely noticed. Moz says, ""It didn't really bother him. He wanted to sleep."" The damage from the Thursday afternoon tornado severely damaged many of the buildings in the city of 27,000, about 50 miles northeast of Des Moines. There were no reports of deaths from the tornado that slammed into the city, but the brick buildings that surround the 132-year-old courthouse were severely damaged. The city's wide streets were littered with bricks and downed trees. The courthouse also was hit hard, as the tornado caused its cupola to tumble about 175 feet to the ground. A spokeswoman for UnityPoint Health says that 40 patients are being evacuated from its hospital damaged by a tornado. UnityPoint Health spokeswoman Amy Varcoe, who is based in Des Moines, says it was unclear how severely the UnityPoint hospital in Marshalltown was damaged, but all of its patients are being transferred to the health system's hospitals in Waterloo and Grundy Center. Marshalltown officials provide damage update Lennox Industries’ manufacturing facility in Marshalltown sustained tornado damage. There were no reported injuries to on-site employees. The extent of damage to the facility is currently being assessed. Some buildings at the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown sustained roof damage when the tornado hit Thursday. Commandant Timon Oujiri says the facility housing nearly 500 residents lost power, but that no residents or staffers were injured. He says generators are now powering the buildings. Alliant Energy says more than 5,800 customers remain without power in Marshalltown, and that natural gas service has been shut down in part of the city. Crews have been dispatched to repair damage and assess which areas can have gas service safely restored. Police ask that you not drive to Marshalltown to view the damage. A curfew was set in place Thursday night at 9 p.m. There are still downed power lines and dangerous debris in streets in Marshalltown. PELLA Seven people inside a Pella manufacturing plant when it was struck by a tornado have been treated for injuries at the local hospital and released. Pella Regional Health Center spokeswoman Billie Rhamy confirmed Thursday evening injuries were minor and all patients had been discharged. Vermeer Manufacturing, which has about 2,800 employees manufacturing industrial and agricultural equipment, was hit by a tornado around 4 p.m. Vice President of Operations Vince Newendorp says the east half of the company's campus, which includes seven manufacturing buildings, sustained extensive damage. He says the plant activated its storm warning system, and workers were in shelters when the storm hit. The company makes agricultural machinery including hay balers and mowers and equipment for the pipeline and forestry management industries. BONDURANT The storm struck Bondurant first, but did perhaps the least amount of damage there. An official says four or five homes are destroyed on the northeast edge of the city of Bondurant. Fire Chief Aaron Kreuder says several other homes in the city just northeast of Des Moines have significant damage but appear to be repairable. A collapsed wall in one of the damaged homes ruptured, causing a major gas leak for more than an hour until a hole could be dug in the yard to shut off the line. Kreuder says a tornado dropped to the ground, rose back up and then dropped again. He said minor injuries were reported but nothing requiring emergency transportation to the hospital. ""The Polk County Sheriff’s Office will be opening the roadblocks in Bondurant shortly. There will be intermittent traffic control for emergency and clean up vehicles. We are still asking that, if you don’t live in Bondurant, please avoid the area during the clean up. There will continue to be an increased PCSO presence during this time.""

Associated Press,"Residents in central Illinois on Sunday assessed the damage after rare December tornadoes, including one the day before that was a half-mile-wide, ripped roofs off homes in Taylorville, downed power lines and injured at least 20 people. The severe weather in Illinois was part of a line of thunderstorms that raked areas of the central U.S. late Friday and into Saturday, killing one person in Missouri. The National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes in Illinois, Missouri and Oklahoma. At least three tornadoes were confirmed in northwest and southwest Arkansas, which largely caused property and structural damage. No injuries or fatalities were reported. Peak months for tornadoes in much of the Midwest are April and June, according to the weather service. But at least 12 tornadoes were reported in Illinois on Saturday, including the Taylorville tornado, which has been confirmed. If the majority are confirmed, that would be the most tornadoes in Illinois in a December storm since Dec. 18-19, 1957, when there were 21. The weather service sent crews Sunday to survey the hardest-hit areas in Illinois, which included Taylorville, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Springfield. Photographs and video from Taylorville showed several houses flattened, with residents wading into debris to salvage what they could. Some homes remained standing but with gaping holes in the roofs or with no roofs at all. The tornado was on the ground for around 10 miles (16 kilometers) before it thundered through Taylorville, and the weather service was able to warn residents of its arrival 41 minutes before it actually struck, Chris Miller, a meteorologist at the services Lincoln office, said in a phone interview Sunday. That advanced warning gave people critical time to take cover and may have saved lives. Assistant Fire Chief Andy Goodall, speaking to reporters Saturday night shortly after the storm pounded the city of 11,000, said at least 100 homes had major damage, including his own, Springfields State Journal-Register reported. A Taylorville Memorial Hospital spokesman said 21 people, from age 9 to 97, arrived for treatment Saturday. Most were released within hours. Miller said three people remained hospitalized as of Sunday afternoon. Miller said preliminary estimates are that the Taylorville tornado may have been an EF2, which indicates wind speeds as high as 135 mph. It could take several more days to know for sure. The weather service said Sunday that a strong tornado that developed from severe thunderstorms Friday night touched down in Van Buren, Arkansas. It was rated an EF2. About 10 minutes later, a second weaker tornado was confirmed less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away near the town of Rudy, Arkansas. Damage surveys for the two tornadoes are ongoing but officials said dozens of homes were damaged. Early Saturday morning a third tornado with estimated peak winds of 107 mph traveled about 8.5 miles (13.5 kilometers) through Spring Hill in southwest Arkansas. Its path was intermittent and mostly caused damage to trees and to some structures. ___ Associated Press writer Hannah Grabenstein in Little Rock, Arkansas, also contributed to this report.","HuffPost December Tornado Outbreak Hits Central US, Leaving At Least 1 Dead HuffPost Residents in central Illinois on Sunday assessed the damage after rare December tornadoes, including one the day before that was a half-mile-wide, ripped roofs off homes in T…",2018-12-03T05:31:00Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}","December Tornado Outbreak Hits Central US, Leaving At Least 1 Dead - HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/illinois-central-us-tornado-outbreak_us_5c04be4de4b0a173c02459ef,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c04bf2f2400006f0499bdfe.jpeg?cache=et6avtgx2u&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,tornado outbreak,1

The confirmed tornado is part of an outbreak of severe weather that was forecast to hit portions of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey on Tuesday afternoon. Several tornado warnings were in effect across northern parts of Pennsylvania. A tornado watch is in effect for almost the entire state of Pennsylvania, the National Weather Service said. This means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form. The watch is in effect in cities such as Pittsburgh, State College, Allentown and Scranton.

James Spann,"From James Spann and the ABC 33/40 Weather Blog: SUNSHINE RETURNS LATER TODAY: A weakening band of storms is pushing through Central and East Alabama this morning the tornado watch that was in effect much of the night has been cancelled for all counties as of 5:30 a.m. There is a marginal risk (level 1/5) of severe storms for parts of Southeast Alabama later today, but the overall threat there is low. The sky will begin to clear later today, and most North/Central Alabama communities will enjoy a good supply of sunshine by afternoon with a high in the 68-74 degree range. Tonight will be fair and cool with a low between 48 and 54 degrees. REST OF THE WEEK: The surface front to the south will move slowly northward as a warm front tomorrow clouds move back in and we will forecast a few periods of rain, mainly during the afternoon and evening hours. The high will be close to 70. Then, rain remains possible at times Thursday and Friday with a cooling trend; the high Thursday will be in the low 60s, and close to 60 degrees Friday. Additional rain amounts of around one inch are likely tomorrow through Friday. The sky should clear Friday night. THE ALABAMA WEEKEND: Very cool air settles into the state; we expect a sunny sky Saturday and Sunday, but temperatures will be below average. The high Saturday will be in the mid 50s, and close to 60 Sunday. Morning lows will be well down in the 30s widespread frost seems likely by early Sunday morning. Colder pockets will see lows in the 20s Saturday and Sunday morning. NEXT WEEK: Even colder air arrives by the middle of next week; sure looks like highs could drop into the 40s, with lows in the 20s by Wednesday and Thursday. Easily the coldest air so far this season and most of the week looks dry. See the Weather Xtreme video for maps, graphics, and more details. LAST NIGHTS STORMS: Several counties in North and West Alabama were placed under a tornado warning, and there were a number of reports of tree and power line damage but thankfully no major structural damage was reported in our state. To the north, a woman died and two others were injured when a possible tornado ravaged a neighborhood in Rutherford County, Tennessee. The deceased womans identity was not revealed, but police said her home collapsed when the severe weather hit the Midland area of Christiana, Tennessee. Two others were injured in a mobile home that was damaged and rolled over during the storm. BEACH FORECAST: Click here to see the AlabamaWx Beach Forecast Center page.

Daniel Manzo,"A very dangerous weekend lies ahead for much of the South -- with especially severe storms expected in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi on Saturday.
The new storm organized Saturday morning and was moving across Texas. In addition to a widespread severe weather outbreak from Texas to parts of the eastern U.S., this storm will likely bring an outbreak of tornadoes across parts of the southern U.S. on Saturday.
The severe weather outbreak already began Saturday morning in parts of the South with reports of large hail in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
A tornado watch was issued for extreme southwest Texas until 9 a.m. local time Saturday morning. A severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of western Texas through 9 a.m. Flood alerts are also being issued for parts of the southern U.S. due to torrential rainfall.
Radar is showing quite a bit of storm activity developing Saturday morning from Texas to Alabama, with the most intense storms in western Texas and near the Arkansas-Louisiana-Texas region.
Severe storms will develop later Saturday in eastern Texas, Louisiana and western Mississippi that will likely tap into strong wind shear and develop dangerous supercells in the afternoon hours. The High Resolution Rapid Refresh model is showing numerous discrete supercells developing during this time frame and the potential for strong tornadoes. The intense thunderstorms will move across this region beginning in the afternoon and last into the evening hours.
There is a moderate risk for severe weather from Lufkin, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, including much of northern Louisiana. In the moderate risk region, dangerous, long-track tornadoes are possible. Additionally, destructive straight-line winds and very large hail are possible from eastern Texas to western Alabama.
Intense thunderstorms will continue through the overnight hours in parts of this region. There is a possibility of ongoing severe weather early Sunday morning, with night-time tornadoes and destructive winds.
On Sunday morning, storms will congeal into a line that will likely stretch from the Florida Panhandle to Ohio. The main threat will be straight-line, damaging winds. However, embedded tornadoes could develop in the line of thunderstorms.
The line of storms will impact the Appalachian Mountains on Sunday evening as they begin to lose their severe potential. Nonetheless, numerous severe thunderstorms, with damaging winds, large hail and a couple of tornadoes, are possible as the storms move through the region.
There is an enhanced risk for severe weather on Sunday from Georgia to Ohio, including Atlanta; Charlotte; and Charleston, West Virginia. Damaging winds, a few tornadoes and large hail are possible in the risk region.
In addition to the severe weather threat, storms will bring torrential rainfall over parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi. Rainfall over 4 inches is possible in that region, which makes flash flooding a concern with the ongoing storms this weekend.","Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The severe weather is calming down from earlier in the week, and the system is sliding off to the east where it may bring harsh conditions today. Strong to isolated storms are moving toward Dallas, Waco and Austin this morning, with strong winds and hail likely threats. Heavy rain is moving out of Wisconsin although some of the storms could bring flash flooding to the Milwaukee area. The severe weather from earlier in the week has mostly calmed down. Parts of Pennsylvania and New York are most at risk for hail and strong winds. As the system moves off into southern Canada, cooler air behind it will clash with the record-breaking heat in the Northeast, which poses a slight risk of severe weather in areas including Pittsburgh, Scranton and Syracuse. Damaging hail is possible. The regions most likely to see severe weather are northern Pennsylvania and New York state. A slight risk for severe weather has been designated for much of the Northeast. By early afternoon, the cold front begins to tap into the summer-like heat, with discrete cells moving through the western Great Lakes. Storms will move across the Appalachians during the early evening, reaching cities from Washington, D.C., up through Boston after sunset. Record highs from Thursday: New York City, 92 Newark, 94 Hartford, 94 Atlantic City, 93 Philadelphia, 91 Trenton, 91 Record highs are expected today along the East Coast. Today will be another hot day in the Northeast, with high temperatures from Virginia to New Jersey again passing 90 degrees. New York City and Hartford, however, are unlikely to top 90 again, decreasing the chance of an official heat wave. Spring temperatures are returning this weekend. Behind the cold front, temperatures will slowly cool off, with much of the Northeast seeing conditions 20 to 30 degrees cooler on Sunday than on Friday.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","A tornado rips through a residential area after touching down south of Wynnewood, Okla., on May 09, 2016. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) It's been the quietest start to a tornado season ever recorded in Oklahoma, one of the nation's most twister-prone states. But a severe weather outbreak is possible next week. As of Friday, not a single tornado has been reported in the state so far in 2018. That's the longest Oklahoma has ever gone without a tornado to start the year, AccuWeather said. The previous record for the latest start to tornado season in Oklahoma was April 26, which occurred in 1962, the Weather Channel said. On average, the Sooner State gets 56 tornadoes per year, with May typically the most active month. Kansas also has not reported any tornadoes in 2018, the National Weather Service reported, but that state's record earliest tornado was in late May. And it's not just Oklahoma and Kansas that have been quiet: Across the U.S., only about 229 tornadoes have been reported in 2018, the Storm Prediction Center said. That's about 100 fewer than in a typical year. Warm, humid air is one of the ingredients need for tornadoes to form, and that's been lacking in the central U.S. this year. Frequent rounds of chilly air from Canada, thanks to a persistent southward dip in the jet stream over the eastern U.S., helped to keep temperature and humidity surges to a minimum, AccuWeather meteorologist Richard Schraeger said.

Severe storms, including the risk of tornadoes, are forecast to blast Oklahoma, Kansas and other parts of the Plains, South and Midwest during the first few days of May. The Weather Channel calls it ""a classic early May setup for severe thunderstorms in the nation's heartland.""

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Residents used shovels and snow blowers to dig out of one of the biggest snow storms of the season that dumped more than a foot of precipitation accross parts of the northeastern U.S. overnight Monday. (March 4)
 AP
While the main weather story Sunday and early Monday was the deadly and violent tornado outbreak in the South, the other big weather news was the ongoing record cold that's spreading across the central and eastern U.S.
How cold? Some 189 million Americans awoke to temperatures that were at or below freezing Monday morning, weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue said. And some 220 million will shiver with similar freezing temperatures Tuesday morning.
""Highs on Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to be roughly 15 to 30 degrees below early March averages for most locations east of the Rocky Mountains,"" the National Weather Service said.
Monday, dozens of record lows were set all the way from Washington state to Texas.
The temperature bottomed out at 46 degrees below zero at Elk Park, Montana, Monday morning, which was likely a new all-time March low for the entire state of Montana, the National Weather Service in Great Falls said.

Temperatures across the state in many cases were as much as 50 degrees below the early March average. 
Wind chills were also unimaginably cold across the northern Plains, dipping to almost 60 below zero in some spots. 
Maue also said that the temperatures in Texas on Monday were record cool for early March. 
The cold, though less intense, will spill toward the East Coast and Southeast on Tuesday. A few records are again possible.
When this freakish cold spell is done, several hundred new record-low temperatures will have fallen, according to Capital Weather Gang. meteorologist Ian Livingston.
Due to the cold, the snow that hit the Northeast Sunday and Monday will stick around for a few days. Boston saw about 10 inches of snow, but parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts saw up to 16 inches, according to the National Weather Service. 
About 5 inches of slushy snow fell in New York City. 
Meanwhile, in the West, yet another storm will unleash torrential rain across the state, potentially leading to more mudslides and flooding.
Some of the heaviest rain is expected near coastal locations between SanFrancisco and Los Angeles, the weather service warned. ""Many of these locations have received above average precipitation over the past several weeks which has left the area be more susceptible to flooding.""
According to AccuWeather meteorologist Maggie Samuhel, ""with the ground already saturated and 1-3 inches of rain expected, flooding will be an issue.""
More heavy snow will again plaster the Sierra Nevada, with up to 4 feet possible in some areas. 
Looking beyond this week, chilly and unsettled weather can remain the theme in California and most of the West for the middle of March, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Anderson.

JILL COLVIN / AP,"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — President Donald Trump surveyed damage on Friday from a deadly tornado that devastated a small Alabama town, killing nearly two dozen people.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump, flew south to Georgia and then took a helicopter to Alabama, landing at a regional airport in Auburn. The Trumps greeted people awaiting their arrival before departing by motorcade.
The president was expected to tour rural Lee County in eastern Alabama, where 23 people died Sunday in a massive EF4 tornado that carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide with 170 mph (270 kph) winds. Air Force One first landed at a military base along the Georgia border, where Trump boarded a helicopter for an aerial tour of some of the damage.
It was one of at least 38 tornadoes confirmed to have touched down across the Southeast in a deadly weekend outbreak.
As he left Washington, Trump said he expected to meet with Gov. Kay Ivey and people who “got hit very hard by the tornadoes.” He also planned to thank first responders.
Trump has said he’s instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give Alabama “the A Plus treatment” as the state recovers.
The Alabama damage was officially deemed a disaster on Tuesday, with Trump ordering federal aid to supplement ongoing state and local recovery efforts.
Ivey has also signed a disaster assistance agreement with FEMA and ordered state flags flown at half-staff until sunset Sunday.
The Beauregard, Alabama tornado was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
The dead included four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family. Several people in Georgia were also injured by twisters that also extended to Florida and South Carolina, according to the National Weather Service.
Trump had said earlier this week that the country was “sending our love and prayers to the incredible people of Alabama” and that “whatever we can do, we’re doing.” He was traveling to politically friendly territory for him: Alabama supported Trump by a wide margin in the 2016 presidential election.
The area where the tornado struck is generally Trump country: He carried about 60 percent of the Lee County vote in 2016, and blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent sight in Beauregard.
Standing amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother’s home, Renee Frazier waved at Trump’s helicopter as it passed overhead during an aerial tour of the destruction. Minutes before, she was arguing with relatives who opposed Trump’s visit, calling it more about politics than compassion.
“I want the president here to see what happened to my mom’s house,” she said. “I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity.”
Just down the road, where several people died, Trump supporter Bobby Spann said he hoped the president learned “how to be a Southerner, and how to respect people” during his brief visit.
Spann, 63, said he also hoped Trump realizes how much help is needed. The roof of Spann’s mobile home was partially peeled away.
“Houses need to be replaced. You can’t help the dead folks, but you can try to help the ones that’s still living,” said Spann, chewing on a yellowroot twig.
Trump’s reaction to natural disasters at times has seemed to vary with the level of political support he’s received from the affected region.
In the months after wildfires ripped through California, Trump threatened to cut off federal aid unless the state embraced forest management policies he championed.
He also engaged in a sustained back-and-forth with lawmakers from hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico, repeatedly blaming the territory for its problems and noting how much money recovery efforts had cost the federal government.
The administration at one point considered redirecting disaster aid from places like Puerto Rico and California to pay for the president’s long-promised border wall. The administration ultimately chose to target other sources of federal dollars.
Trump had already been scheduled to fly south Friday for a weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club and will be heading there after the tour.

In Alabama, authorities confirm that The Poarch Band of Creek Indians donated $180,000 to cover all costs for funeral services and interment for the 23 people killed in Sundays tornado in Lee County.
The county coroner announced this news on Thursday.
From AL.com:
The coroners office received word that they wanted to help and reached out to them and they agreed. Their first commitment was for $50,000. Later they called back and ask me what it would take to cover the costs and I gave them a figure and they graciously made it happen, said Lee County Coroner Bill Harris. The monies will be deposited with the East Alabama Medical Center Foundation to be dispersed to the funeral homes to cover the cost of the funerals. I am so thankful for them to step up in this manner and help the families of this tragedy.
In Alabama, search and rescue teams were still combing through the wreckage of houses flatted by weekend tornadoes this week. On Tuesday, they were looking for seven or eight people still unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. tornado outbreak since 2013.
The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, was beginning to mourn the 23 people confirmed killed by the storms, which included four children and seven people from one family, officials said on Tuesday.
Most of the people who died were found near their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, said officials.
It looks like that's the community being addressed by today's announcement. Such terrible loss.
About the economic power of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, from the tribal website:
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians is the only federally recognized Indian Tribe in the state of Alabama, operating as a sovereign nation with its own system of government and bylaws. The Tribe operates a variety of economic enterprises, which employ hundreds of area residents. Poarch Creek Indian Gaming manages three gaming facilities in Alabama, including: Wind Creek Casino &amp; Hotel, Atmore; Wind Creek Casino &amp; Hotel, Wetumpka; and, Wind Creek Casino &amp; Hotel, Montgomery. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians is an active partner in the state of Alabama, contributing to economic, educational, social and cultural projects benefiting both tribal members and residents of these local communities and neighboring towns.
They step up regularly. Here's a previous example of the tribe donating 100,000 for disaster relief, just one month before in the area [PDF Link].

"USA TODAY, Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","The death toll is expected to rise as authorities continue recovery efforts in Lee County, Alabama, after the deadliest tornado outbreak in years.
 USA TODAY
The tornado that devastated rural parts of eastern Alabama on Sunday left behind a deathly trail, compared by one observer to a giant knife scraping the ground.
Early reports put the number of casualties at 23, but that figure could rise as rescuers search amid the destroyed homes for victims.
The town of Beauregard, an unincorporated community of about 10,000 in Lee County, took a major hit from the twister, whose winds were estimated at 160 mph.
All we could do is just hold on for life and pray, said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their Beauregard trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. Its a blessing from God that me and my youngns are alive.
Identities of the victims are starting to emerge.

The Lee-Scott Academy, a Christian school in Auburn, Ala., reported on its Facebook page the passing of its fourth-grade student, saying Taylor was welcomed into the arms of Jesus as the result of the severe weather event in Lee County yesterday.
Our hearts at Lee-Scott Academy are broken this morning. Please pray for the Thornton family, our students, faculty, and staff during this difficult time.
The posting mentions that a GoFundMe page has been established on behalf of Taylors family. The page, which had already surpassed its goal of $15,000 by raising nearly $21,000 as of midday Monday, identifies the girls parents as Ashley and David Thornton of Auburn.

Words dont even come close to imagining the pain they are enduring, it says on the page, which requests donations to cover funeral expenses and/or prayers for the family. Taylor was an amazing example of a child of God. She brought so much joy to all that knew her. She was loved dearly and will forever be missed.
Our hearts are mourning with you Ashley and David. You raised an amazing daughter that fulfilled her purpose on this earth and it now with her creator. This community loves you both, and baby McCrae so much and will continue to walk through this by your side.

AP,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Fathers Day note to her husband reading, Daddy, I love you to pieces. But the storm took the 53-year-old husband and father.
Dean was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband was home in Beauregard. As forecasters warned stormy weather was heading toward the Alabama-Georgia line, she said, David Wayne Dean sent a text message cautioning a friend to keep up with the weather on the news.
Then the storm hit and David Dean didnt make it out. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbors yard.
Our son found him, Dean said between sobs Monday. He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.
The tornado that struck the area where the Deans lived packed winds estimated at 170 mph and chewed a path of destruction nearly a mile wide. Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half.
On Monday, the storms toll stood at 23 people dead in this rural community in Lee County. According to the sheriff, dozens remained missing after the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years. Rescue crews using dogs and drones searched for victims amid splintered lumber and twisted metal.
Im not going to be surprised if we dont come up with some more deceased. Hopefully we wont, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference. He said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academys Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.
An unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, Beauregard is in the same county as Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway.
On the day after the disaster, volunteers used chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers. Neighbors and friends helped one another sift among the ruins.
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the remnants of Morrisons home, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage the couples safe, her husbands motorcycle boots and her embossed Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub her husband jumping in at the last minute as the twister lifted their house off its foundation and swept it into the woods.
We knew we were flying because it picked the house up, Morrison said, figuring that the showers fiberglass enclosure helped them survive.
The National Weather Service said one and possibly two tornadoes struck the area. A powerful EF-4 twister was blamed for most of the destruction on a path about 24 miles long, meteorologist Chris Darden said. Darden said the monster tornado was the deadliest twister to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF-5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground, Sheriff Jay Jones said. Most of the fatalities occurred with a square-mile area, he said.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was pretty sure tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings. But authorities were busy with the search-and-rescue and had not yet looked into the question.
The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
An early March tornado outbreak in the Alabama-Mississippi area is not unusual, tornado experts said.
The weather services Storm Prediction Center posted forecasts for higher tornado activity in the region Thursday, three days before the disaster. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters were all over it.
An EF-5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people. And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama.
For Beauregard, days of mourning lies ahead. The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.
After the storm, Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to her husband, a man others called Roaddog for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriffs deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husbands body lay.
They took me down to him, Dean said, and I got to spend a little time with him before they took him away.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","The death toll is expected to rise as authorities continue recovery efforts in Lee County, Alabama, after the deadliest tornado outbreak in years.
 USA TODAY
People in the path of the deadly tornado that ripped through Lee County, Alabama, had 8 to 9 minutes of warning before touchdown, according to Holly Allen, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service in Birmingham.
This is below the national average: Typically, the tornado warning lead time the time between when a warning is issued and when the tornado hits ground is about 14 minutes, the weather service has said. (The longer the lead time, the better, of course.)
On average in Alabama, theres about a 15 minute lead time for warnings, according to National Weather Service data.
This is a vast improvement since 1990, when the national lead time was 5 minutes. 
Though Sunday's tornado had an 8-9 minute lead time, the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, posted forecasts for higher possible tornado activity in the region on Thursday, three days before the killer twister struck.
Also that day, the weather service in Birmingham issued its first forecast about possible tornadoes on Sunday. 
At least 23 people were killed by a tornado in Alabama, near the Georgia line.

On Saturday afternoon, one day before the twister hit, both the weather service and the prediction center upgraded the risk for severe weather.
Finally, Sunday morning at 11:04 a.m. CST, about three hours before the tornado hit, the weather service issued a tornado watch for south-central Alabama, Allen said. Awatch means conditions are ripe for tornadoes to form.
The specific warning for the deadly tornado was issued at 1:58 p.m. CST. At about 2:06 to 2:07 pm CST, the tornado roared between Marvyn and Beauregard, Alabama, producing EF-4 (170-mph wind) damage and killing dozens of people.
University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd praised the warnings from the weather service and its prediction center, saying they were all over it in the days and hours before the storms.
As for tornado sirens in Lee County, there are still conflicting reports as to whether or not they sounded. More information about sirens will come in the days ahead.

Stunned residents of a small Mississippi city were picking up the pieces Sunday after a violent tornado ripped through town, leaving one person dead and marking the first tornado death of 2019. 
The tornado in Columbus, which was triggered by a line of intense thunderstorms on Saturday evening, was confirmed by the National Weather Service in Jackson.  The twister, part of a severe weather outbreak that battered the South, toppled trees and shattered businesses and homes in the city of 24,000 on the eastern border of the state. 
Ashley Glynell Pounds, 41, of Tupelo died after a building collapsed on her and three other people, the office of Columbus Mayor Robert Smith confirmed in a Facebook post. Smith said 12 other people were injured.
Pounds' death was the first tornado death of 2019, according to the Weather Channel.

""So far one fatality has been confirmed and damage assessments are now underway. We are saddened by the loss of life but thankful it was not much worse. We are grateful this Sunday morning,"" he said.
The tornado seriously damaged a school, two community center buildings and other warehouses and businesses, city spokesman Joe Dillon said.

The building was a total loss, Blaylock said. But he said the church would still hold a Sunday prayer service and a scheduled baptism, using a borrowed portable baptismal pool.
We will rebuild. Weve got a good church here, Blaylock said. It will be a testimony of God.
Residents described a harrowing rainstorm and powerful winds Saturday evening.  
The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close, Lee Lawrence told the Associated Press. Lawrence said four buildings on his used car lot were destroyed, car windows were blown out and uprooted trees were flung across vehicles.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations. First, there's the cold. The first two weeks of April have been the coldest on record for the Upper Midwest, and even some areas to the south, such as Little Rock, Arkansas, have seen temperatures during this period that are far below average. Such extreme cold is noteworthy given trends in the opposite direction related to global warming. The cold set the stage for a blizzard that slammed the Upper Midwest over the weekend. This storm was so severe that it set all-time records, not just milestones for the heaviest spring snowstorm. SEE ALSO: Researchers hit back at climate change deniers twisting polar bear science A staggering 24.2 inches of snow fell in Green Bay, Wisconsin, making it the heaviest April snowstorm on record, and the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm on record at any time of year. Similarly, Wausau, Wisconsin, picked up 20.7 inches of snow, setting an April snowstorm record and making it the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm of all-time at that location. The snowfall jackpot was Amherst, Wisconsin, where 33 inches fell, according to the National Weather Service. Minneapolis, which is no stranger to snow and cold weather, picked up 14.9 inches of snow, making it their heaviest April snowstorm on record. Thundersnow was reported in and around the Twin Cities as the storm intensified, leading to snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour at times. Another, weaker, snowstorm is slated to move across the Midwest during the next 2 days, bringing several inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The thick spring snowpack is raising fears of flooding if temperatures suddenly warm up and heavy rain were to fall in the coming weeks. Then there are the fires. In association with strong storm systems, massive walls of wind-driven flames have swept across the Plains, particularly in Oklahoma, where at least 300,000 acres went up in flames during the past week. Another ""Extremely Critical"" fire weather day looms in the Southwest on Tuesday, including parts of Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, with temperatures soaring into the 90s, winds gusting above 40 miles per hour, and relative humidity plunging to an arid 2 to 5 percent. Average temperature during the first half of April (top) and departures from average (bottom) during the same period. Image: NOAA CPC. The National Weather Service forecast office in Amarillo Texas warned Tuesday morning that ""A regional outbreak of dangerous wind-driven wildfires is possible."" Third, there's the severe weather and flooding. The same storm system that brought blizzard conditions to the Upper Midwest spawned at least a dozen tornadoes across the Southeast on Sunday and Monday, including an EF-2 tornado that struck Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday night. At one point on Monday, a nasty squall line stretched from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic, and rainfall was so intense in New York City that water came pouring into the aging subway system. Air travel was disrupted along the busy East Coast on Monday, particularly at the three major New York City area airports. In Boston, a heavy rain and cold onshore wind challenged runners of the Boston Marathon. And let's not forget the extreme weather whiplash that aggravated millions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic over the weekend, when temperatures in the 70s and 80s Fahrenheit suddenly plunged to the 30s and 40s within a matter of several hours between Saturday and Sunday, thanks to a ""backdoor"" cold front that moved from the northeast to the southwest. Such fronts are most common in the spring, when the temperature difference between the ocean and the land is at its peak. There are some signs of a warmup ahead late in the month and into May, though computer models have shown such glimmers of hope before, only to yank it away at the last minute, in favor of a colder, snowier solution.","The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon and Nick Siano and Alyssia Pacheco, USA TODAY","At least 23 people are known dead and more are injured after a tornado struck southeastern Alabama on Sunday. Crews are still searching for more dead and wounded. (March 4)
 AP
First responders in Lee County, Alabama, were picking through the rubble Monday of a devastating tornado that killed at least 23 people and injured dozens more.
The tornado smashed homes and toppled power lines and a massive steel cell tower. The twister was part of a brutal system packing strong winds that also roared through parts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
The devastation is incredible, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said. Jones said several people were missing, but that it was not clear whether they actually had fled the area without telling all of their concerned friends and family members.
Here is what we know about the storm so far:
How strong was the tornado?
The National Weather Service in Birmingham said the initial tornado to hit Lee County was ""at least"" an EF-3, considered a ""severe"" tornado with winds 158 to 206 mph. The storm cut a path at least a half-mile wide, the weather service said. The information was pending further investigation in coming days, the weather service added.

How many people were injured and missing?
The numbers were not firm, but East Alabama Medical Center said it had received more than 40 patients as a result of the tornado. Some patients have also been sent to surrounding hospitals, the medical center said. Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said two people were in critical condition. Harris also said he knew of at least six people who were not accounted for, but that he had heard that the number could be as high as 20. 
More: 'This just came on so quick': Alabama tornado kills at least 23
Was there any warning?
A warning had been issued for the deadly tornado in Lee County about 20 minutes before it hit, said Bryan Wood, a meteorologist at Assurant. And for tornadoes in general in that area, the Storm Prediction Center had given a head's-up about 90 minutes prior to touchdown. 
How severe is the property damage?
Rita Smith, spokeswoman for the Lee County Emergency Management Agency, said numerous homes were destroyed or damaged in Beauregard, about 60 miles east of Montgomery. A massive cell tower collapsed. Smith said about 150 first responders are aiding the rescue effort and assessing damage.
Was this the deadliest tornado in years?
It was the nation's deadliest tornado outbreak in six years, since May 20, 2013, when a tornado killed 24 people in Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center said.

(Photo: Johnny Tribble, AP) Weatherwise, it's already been a disastrous start to the year in the U.S., even before the tornado season ramps up and long before any direct hits from hurricanes. In just the first three months of year, the U.S. has endured three separate weather disasters that each caused at least $1 billion in damages, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Friday. The events included a severe storm outbreak in the Southeast in March and two winter storms in the central and eastern U.S. in January and March. At $1.8 billion in damages, the costliest event so far was the nor'easter that walloped the Northeast on March 1-3, killing 9 people. The damage from the storm was due to high winds, heavy snow and coastal erosion, NOAA said. A winter storm that hit the central and eastern U.S. in early January caused $1 billion in damages and killed 22 people. The severe storm outbreak in mid-March, which killed 3, brought more than 20 tornadoes across Alabama and Georgia and also widespread hail damage from Texas to Florida. The average number of billion-dollar disasters in the U.S., based on data from 1980 to 2017, is six. 2017 had a whopping 16 separate disasters, which tied 2011 for the most ever. ""More notable than the high frequency of these events was the cumulative cost, which exceeded $300 billion in 2017 — a new U.S. annual record,"" NOAA said. March was unusually cool across much of the nation, In fact, some locations had March temperatures that were cooler than February, an ""unusual but not unprecedented occurrence,"" NOAA said. One spot that was unusually warm was Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, which had its warmest March on record. So far, through March, the average U.S. temperature for 2018 was 36.8 degrees, which is 1.6 degrees above average, placing it among the warmest third of the climate record. It's also the USA's coldest start of the year since 2014.

KIM CHANDLER and JEFF MARTIN / AP,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Father’s Day note to her husband reading, “Daddy, I love you to pieces.”
Her husband was “done and gone,” she said, one of 23 victims of what one National Weather Service meteorologist called a “monster tornado.”
She was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband, David Wayne Dean, was home in Beauregard. He had heard the forecasts warning that stormy weather was heading toward their rural community. He sent a text message cautioning a friend to pay attention to the news.
Then the storm hit. Dean, 53, didn’t make it to safety. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbor’s yard.
“Our son found him,” Dean said between sobs Monday. “He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.”
The tornado packed winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and chewed a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama for nearly 27 miles (43 kilometers), the weather service said Tuesday after its crews surveyed the impact. The weather service said 90 people were injured.
Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half.
Surveyors found that the twister’s intensity peaked in Beauregard, a rural Lee County community, where it demolished multiple manufactured homes, emptying their contents into the woods. The tornado swept up and scattered the debris so widely that the metal frames of two of those homes could not even be located.
By Tuesday morning, authorities reduced the count of unaccounted-for people from dozens to about 7 or 8, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Law enforcement teams have been searching amid splintered lumber and twisted metal from the air and by foot using cadaver-sniffing dogs, finding no more bodies since Monday.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academy’s Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.
An unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, Beauregard is in the same county as Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway.
Volunteers responded in force, using chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers, helping neighbors and friends search the wreckage, and gathering donations.
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the remnants of Morrison’s home, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage the couple’s safe, her husband’s motorcycle boots and her embossed Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub — her husband jumping in at the last minute — as the twister lifted their house off its foundation and swept it into the woods.
“We knew we were flying because it picked the house up,” Morrison said, figuring that the shower’s fiberglass enclosure helped them survive.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was “pretty sure” tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings.
The weather service found evidence that two tornadoes struck the area. Meteorologist Chris Darden said the one that did most of the destruction was a “monster tornado” classified as an EF4. He said it was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
“It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground,” the sheriff said.
The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
Tornado outbreaks in early March aren’t unusual in the Alabama-Mississippi area, tornado experts said — in fact, the weather service’s Storm Prediction Center had warned people three days before the disaster to be on the lookout for higher tornado activity in the region. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters “were all over it.”
An EF5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people. And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama.
For Beauregard, the mourning has only just begun. The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.
After the storm, Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to her husband, a man others called “Roaddog” for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriff’s deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husband’s body lay.
“They took me down to him,” Dean said, “and I got to spend a little time with him before they took him away.”

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","In the world of weather forecasting, the battle for supremacy is generally being waged between the Euro and American weather models maintained by U.S. and European Union governmental agencies.But there are tons of other options to choose from, and a new one emerged on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
IBM and its subsidiary The Weather Company (TWC) have created a model that aims to offer a wildly detailed view of weather around the world. If proven accurate, the model could change forecasting, particularly in the developing world where a paucity of data makes good predictions hard. But it could also invite controversy by relying on cell phone data from the Weather Channel app, which the city of Los Angeles recently sued over for misleading users about how much data it collects. 
More than a couple weather apps have recently come under fire for their handling of user data,
Read more Read
The new model, dubbed the Global High-Resolution Atmospheric Forecasting System (or the oddly-acronymed GRAF), has a couple of things going for it, but the most impressive is its resolution. The model builds off of MPAS model framework that was created by the federally-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research. Using that framework and powerful supercomputers (more on that in a sec), GRAF spits out forecasts at 3-kilometer resolution in places like the U.S. with a plethora of data. In the developing world where data is less available, that resolution scales to 15 kilometers. GRAF also updates every hour.
 In comparison, the European model offers a flat 9-kilometer resolution while the American model runs at 13 kilometers. These models are only updated a few times a day.
One of the goals of... running at higher resolution is to bring standards for weather forecasting [in the developing world] up to other standards in the rest of the world, Todd Hutchinson, a computational meteorological analysis and prediction lead for TWC/IBM, told Earther.
The super-high resolution allows the model to resolve intimate details in the atmosphere, showing not just a big storm coming but singular thunderstorm cells embedded in it. Having that type of information could be useful for a host of people from emergency managers preparing for a tornado outbreak to air traffic controllers worried about turbulence. 
But higher resolution doesnt immediately guarantee a better forecast. The model has to, you know, actually get the weather right. Hutchinson said GRAF has run relatively smoothly on the whole, but that there are still challenges in forecasting storms where the model segues from 3-kilometer to 15-kilometer resolution. That happens gradually, and the shifting algorithms from one area to the next are complex conga line that will hopefully go smoother as Hutchinson and his team gather more model runs to compare to the actual weather happening in the real world. 
None of this would be possible without massive computing power. The system runs on a supercomputer setup similar to Department of Energys Summit and Sierra supercomputers, which are among the beefiest in the world (although its not necessarily as fast). To process all the data, the system has 3.5 petabytes of elastic storage, equivalent to roughly 55,000 64-gigabyte iPhones.
The reason all this computational power is needed is that in addition to traditional forms of weather data from balloons and weather station observations around the world, GRAF also draws on atmospheric data collected by planes and ground pressure data from millions of cell phones that have the Weather Channel app. 
Most smartphones have a barometer inside, which is used to help your phones fitness tracker figure out how many stairs you climbed. Its been a holy grail for meteorologists for years, because pressure provides clues about storms. But while accessing a network of tiny pressure sensors opens up a world of forecast improvements, it also raises privacy concerns, especially in this instance. Just last week, the Weather Channel app came under fire for allegedly deceiving users and collecting a ton of their data for TWC to profit off of. 
At CES, IBM said users can opt-in to provide this new type of data collection once the model gets ramped up later in 2019. But its yet another reminder of the tradeoffs users increasingly face as they weigh privacy versus whether they should grab that umbrella before running out the door.","In the world of weather forecasting, the battle for supremacy is generally being waged between the Euro and American weather models maintained by U.S. and European Union governmental agencies.

President Trump traveled to Alabama Friday to comfort those who had been devastated by the tornado outbreak last weekend that killed 23 people. During the trip, the president raised eyebrows for what appeared to be an unusual gesture as he signed some Bibles. He didnt do this out of the blue though. It seems a 12-year-old boy got the ball rolling when he handed Trump his Bible and asked him to sign it at a Southern Baptist church in Opelika. A 10-year-old also asked him to sign her bible. He doesnt appear to have been the only one. Video posted online seems to show first lady Melania Trump also signed bibles.

The critics immediately pounced, with some pointing out that the only person who usually signs a book is the author. Others called it offensive for someone to sign their own name on a bible. Growing up in a religious home, it wouldve been seen as blasphemous as having someone signing your own name, Jamie Aten, an evangelical and psychologist at Wheaton College, told the Washington Post. Maybe you penned your own name so people knew it was yours, he added. Ive never seen anything like it.

Atten may have been shocked by the move, but it isnt as odd as you might think. The Post talked to Peter Manseau, the Smithsonians curator of religion, who said many past presidents have signed Bibles, including President Barack Obama. And its not like Trump was handing out stacks of signed bibles but rather he was doing what some people asked of him. Presidents seem to sign a lot of random things put in front of them, Manseau added.

The move was also very on-brand, notes the New York Times, considering Trumps appeal with evangelicals. A pastor who is a prominent Trump supporter said the signings were very appropriate and people ask him to sign their bibles all the time. It isnt just presidents, other stars in the evangelical world are also often asked to signed bibles, such as Tim Tebow. Beyond the act itself though many pointed out that what seemed particularly strange wasnt just that Trump signed the bibles but that he chose to add his massive signature to the covers.

"Jennifer Hijazi, PBS NewsHour","Three massive hurricanes, severe storms and wildfires across the U.S. caused more than $306 billion in damage last year, making 2017 the most expensive year for climate disasters on record. According to data released by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), which tracks the nation’s major weather and climate events, there were 16 “billion dollar” disasters in the United States in 2017, tying the record set in 2011 for most billion dollar disasters in a single year. The total cost of each disaster includes insured and uninsured losses, including physical damages to buildings and infrastructure, along with factors like costs for businesses and damages to crops. Sources of data include federal and state agencies, the U.S. Army corps and the Insurance Services Office. What the study doesn’t account for, says study author Adam Smith, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are health care-related expenses and the costs associated with loss of life. Smith told the PBS NewsHour over email that because of this omission, the study’s “estimates should be considered conservative with respect to what is truly lost.” Smith also said that the data could change as recovery relief moves forward in harder hit areas. Costs in California in particular may increase slightly in the coming weeks as more information emerges. Michael Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, said there is no doubt the sharp increase in weather disasters is an effect of human-caused climate change. “The impacts of climate change now are no longer subtle,” he said. “We see them play out and in real time in the headlines, on our television screens.” Many experts agree that although climate change is a factor in the formation and severity of these events, many other factors also contribute to extreme weather events, including urbanization and natural weather patterns. (Smithsonian Magazine dives into what we can and can’t attribute to climate change here ). Smith said his study is not meant to tease out event attribution, and that for many of last year’s weather events, it will take months for scientists to determine which variables are linked to certain parts of climate change. But Mann thinks that expensive disasters are catching the attention of big businesses who can’t afford to ignore an issue that could increase their costs in a big way. He said studies have found that choosing not to act on climate change is becoming more expensive than introducing policies or changes to fight it. “They’re seeing their bottom line impacted, industry is paying the price,” he said. “The severe cost of extreme weather that disrupts supply chains, it creates havoc for markets.” Here is a look at all 16 record-setting disasters and why the damage was so expensive. The Southern Freeze: $1 Billion When: March 14 to 16, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: Though freezes in the south around this time aren’t uncommon, unusually warm temperatures caused crops to bloom weeks early, severely damaging farmers’ bottom lines. The Washington Post called it a “massacre” for fruit crops, with South Carolina and Georgia feeling the brunt of the damage, with record temperatures in the 20s. Southern Tornado Outbreaks and Western Storms: $1.1 Billion When: Jan. 20 to 22, 2017 Deaths: 24 The damage: Southern states were pummeled by 79 confirmed tornadoes in January, sending strong winds as far west as San Diego. It was one of the largest tornado outbreaks for any winter month, outpacing a previous record set in the 1950s. Midwest Severe Weather: $1.4 Billion When: June 27-29, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: Nebraska, Illinois and Iowa saw hail, wind and tornadoes in June, with more than a dozen tornadoes touching down in parts of Iowa. California Flooding: $1.5 Billion When: Feb. 8 to 22, 2017 Deaths: 5 The damage: Heavy rainfall—and the subsequent high water, fallen trees, avalanches mudslides and sinkholes—caused severe property damage in Northern and Central California from. Damage to the Oroville Dam spillway forced 188,000 residents downstream to evacuate. And overflow from the Coyote Creek forced the evacuation of 14,000 residents from San Jose. Midwest Severe Weather: $1.5 Billion When: June 27 to 29, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: Severe hail, winds and tornadoes caused damage in 10 states across the midwest. Missouri and Arkansas Flooding and Central Severe Weather: $1.7 Billion When: April 25 to May 7, 2017 Deaths: 20 The damage: Storms dump 15 inches of rain in states across the Midwest, causing historic levels of flooding. Missouri, Arkansas and southern Illinois saw the worst damage, including from burst levees and flooded towns. Central/Southeast Tornado Outbreak: $1.8 Billion When: Feb. 28 to March 1, 2017 Deaths: 6 The damage: Seventy tornadoes ripped through central and southern states in what was the most severe weather outbreak ever to occur over a period of 48 hours. Midwest Tornado Outbreak: $2.2 Billion When: March 6 to 8, 2017 Deaths: 2 The damage: Eleven midwestern states were impacted by a tornado outbreak. Nearly one million people lost power in Michigan because of the accompanying high winds. Minnesota Hail Storm and Upper Midwest Severe Weather: $2.4 Billion When: June 9 to 11, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: Minnesota and Wisconsin saw widespread damage from severe hail and high winds. North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana Drought: $2.5 Billion When: March 1 to Dec. 31, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: A “flash drought” characterized by extreme high temperatures and little rainfall hit North and South Dakota and Montana beginning in March. In addition to the increased wildfire risk, losses of cattle and agriculture spurred states to declare certain counties disaster areas. South/Southeast Severe Weather: $2.7 Billion When: March 6 to 28, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: Southwestern and southern states incurred widespread damage from large hail and high winds. Colorado Hail Storm and Central Severe Weather: $3.4 Billion When: May 8 to 11, 2017 Deaths: 0 The damage: Enormous, powerful hail pelted parts of Colorado and other southwestern states in May. Denver was hit with baseball-sized falling ice, which alone caused losses exceeding $2.2 billion. Western Wildfires, California Firestorm: $18 Billion When: June 1 to Dec. 31, 2017 Deaths: 54 The damage: Wildfires burned more than 9.8 million acres of western U.S. territory in 2017, with cumulative costs triple that of last year’s fire season. California’s historic firestorm left 54 people dead and destroyed more than 15,000 homes and businesses. The combined destruction of all the California fires represents the most costly fire event on record and the most deadly since the 1930s. Paul Steblein, wildland fire science coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey, says these fires have also created challenges for future recovery. The increasing prevalence of invasive, quick-burning vegetation increases the likelihood that blazes will burn out of control. Additionally, the suppression of these large firestorms makes it difficult for natural, low-intensity fires—which help reset ecosystems that need to undergo periodic, controlled burns— to occur. This “ makes [recovery] increasingly difficult,” Steblein said. Hurricane Irma: $50 Billion When: Sept. 6 to 12, 2017 Deaths: 97 The damage: The Florida Keys, U.S. Virgin Islands and parts of the Caribbean were destroyed by Irma, which reached category 5 force by the time it reached St.John and St. Thomas. Mann says that the intensity is a result of rising ocean temperatures. With every one degree Fahrenheit increase in ocean temperatures, there’s a roughly 10 mile per hour increase in hurricane wind force, he said. “And we’ve warmed more than a degree Fahrenheit over the past century. That translates to more than 10 mile per hour increase in the strength of these very strong sort of category 4 category 5 storms.” Hurricane Maria: $90 Billion When: September 19 to 21, 2017 Deaths: 65 The damage: The costs of damage caused by Hurricane Maria are still being estimated as slow recovery continues on the island. Maria made landfall as a category 4 hurricane, decimating much of Puerto Rico’s agriculture, infrastructure and communication and transit systems. Mike Byrne, FEMA’s federal coordinating officer in Puerto Rico, told NewsHour that FEMA’s commitment to Puerto Rico has reached $5.9 billion. When asked what the biggest challenge to recovery is, he said he “wishes there was just one.” Complex, rough terrain and slow-moving delivery of necessary building materials are among the largest challenges Byrne names. But he’s encouraged by the resilience of his fellow citizens and the progress of new technology, including microgrids that are bringing electricity to Puerto Rico’s most remote locations. Hurricane Harvey: $125 Billion When: Aug. 25 to 31, 2017 Deaths: 89 The damage: Houston saw unprecedented amounts of rainfall—up to 60 inches—by the time Hurricane Harvey had run its course. Damage exceeded $125 billion, second only to Hurricane Katrina’s level of damage. More than 30,000 people were displaced and 200,000 structures destroyed as a result of the flooding. According to John Nielsen-Gammon, regents professor at Texas A&amp;M’s department of atmospheric sciences, Harvey was beyond the scope of what anyone could have imagined in terms of rainfall and severity. “Harvey was just so outside of the box it isn’t even something that we would expect to see again for quite some time,” he said.

The storm will move very quickly. By around noon it will be heading out of the Northeast with the sun coming out and melting snow in most areas. Snow is falling on Monday morning across the Northeast. Snow accumulations will be the heaviest from the Poconos in Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey and into the lower Hudson Valley, where locally 2 to 6 inches is possible on grassy areas and elevated surfaces. Snowfall totals will be heaviest in northern New Jersey from Monday's fast-moving storm. Behind Monday's system yet another storm is already forming in the Rockies this morning. It will move into the Northern Plains and upper Midwest by tonight and spread heavy snow from the Dakotas into Minnesota, northern Iowa and Wisconsin. Another storm system is forming in the Rockies and Great Plains on Monday evening. By Tuesday afternoon and evening, the storm system will move into the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and all the way down to the Gulf Coast. To the north, heavy snow will fall from Minnesota to Wisconsin and into Michigan. In the South, severe weather will break out, with damaging winds, tornadoes and hail. The storm forming in the Great Plains on Monday night will stretch from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast on Tuesday night. The storm system will move into the Northeast by Wednesday bringing spring-like thunderstorms from New York to Florida. Some of these storms could be strong to severe with damaging winds and hail. An isolated tornado is not out of the question. Snow is not expected for the Northeast with this system. Snowfall accumulation from the Tuesday through Wednesday storm system will be heaviest for Minnesota and northern Iowa and into Wisconsin and northern Michigan, where locally 6 to 12 inches of heavy, wet snow could accumulate. Heaviest snow totals from the midweek storm will be across Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Michigan. After this storm, winter is not done with us yet. Another arctic outbreak is expected for the central United States. Wind chills could dip below zero in the upper Midwest on Wednesday morning. Some of the cold air will move into the Northeast by the end of the week.

A tornado outbreak hit the South on Sunday, leaving damage in several states.
At least 22 deaths have been reported in Lee County, Alabama.
Reports of damage stretched across both states Sunday evening.
More than 42,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in Georgia and Alabama.
Officials said at least 22 people were killed in Alabama as a vicious tornado outbreak ripped across the South on Sunday.
The violent storms left debris strewn across southern Alabama and Georgia, the Florida Panhandle and into parts of South Carolina.
The Lee County Sheriff's Office told local media that no fewer than 22 people were killed when at least two tornadoes hit the southern Alabama county. The sheriff later said some of the victims were children; the National Weather Service said the first twister was at least EF3 in strength and was a half-mile wide or more.
Sunday was the deadliest day for tornadoes in the United States in nearly five years.
""Weve still got people being pulled out of rubble,"" Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told AL.com. ""Were going to be here all night.""

About 3:15 p.m. EST, the NWS issued a tornado emergency after a large and destructive tornado was confirmed near Smiths Station, in Lee County, Alabama. 
Calling it a ""life-threatening situation,"" the NWS warned residents of Smiths Station, Bleecker, Monterey Heights and Bartletts Ferry Dam to take cover immediately as part of the tornado emergency declaration.
The same warning was given in Georgia for northern Muscogee County and southern Harris County. Smiths Station Mayor Bubba Copeland told The Weather Channel that at least 12 houses were flattened.
""We have a lot of mobile homes turned upside down,"" Copeland said.

He said Lee County schools are canceled Monday because there are ""several huge holes are on top of the (elementary) school.""
""I'm begging people to stay home ... and stay off the roads,"" Copeland said, so search and rescue efforts can continue.
The Lee County storm warnings were two of several tornado warnings issued for Alabama and Georgia on Sunday afternoon.
Reports said multiple homes were damaged in Dupree, Alabama, south of Dothan. Other reports said the airport and a fire station were damaged in Eufala, Alabama.
Georgia
Some 30 miles north of Tallahassee, the town of Cairo and its 9,500 residents suffered a direct hit from what appeared to be a tornado on radar. Shortly after, authorities reported widespread damage in the town, but it was unclear if there were any injuries.
Damage is seen to a structure in Cairo, Georgia, on Sunday, March 3, 2019.

Speaking with Cairo Mayor Booker Gainor, Tallahassee Democrat reporter Jeffrey Burlew tweeted that dozens of structures were damaged or destroyed and some residents were trapped in their homes after the storm struck the town Sunday night.
""Its pretty bad,"" Gainor told the Democrat. ""We have a lot of trees down, debris and power lines. We have trees completely through houses. You would think a hurricane came after this, the way it looks.""
Several towns in Georgia reported damage earlier Sunday from several tornadoes that were confirmed on radar by the NWS. In the town of Talbotton, located some 35 miles northeast of Columbus, several people were injured when a damaging storm rolled through the area, Talbot County Emergency Management Agency director Leigh Ann Erenheim told the Associated Press.
""The last check I had was between six and eight injuries,"" Erenheim said in a phone interview with the AP. ""From what I understand it was minor injuries, though one fellow did say his leg might be broken.""
Social media was also sharing reports of damage in Perry, Georgia. 
Peach County Sheriff Terry Deese said trees were down and some houses were damaged, the Macon Telegraph reported.
While following the storm, Peach County Sheriffs Sgt. Shane Brooks told the Macon Telegraph he was nearly hit directly by the tornado as he drove down Duke Road in Byron.
""It was moving so fast I didnt have time do anything but just sit there and hold on,"" he told the Telegraph. ""It was not something I would want to experience again.""
Crawford County Fire Chief Randall Pate said a tornado destroyed four homes. Pate also reported one injury: a woman whose ankle was broken when her home was damaged.
Florida
A radar-confirmed tornado spread debris across Interstate 10 in Walton County, Florida, the AP reported. The eastbound lanes of the interstate had to be closed for cleanup.
South Carolina
Storms caused numerous reports of damage in and around Columbia Sunday night. The NWS said possible tornadoes caused damage to a church in Red Bank, and ripped a roof off a home and blew recreational vehicles onto their sides near Lexington.","'OUTBREAK OF TORNADOES' RIP THROUGH SOUTH...

ABC News,"The major storm system that brought flash flooding and a record-breaking blizzard is moving east Sunday morning. The storm will bring another round of severe weather for nearly the entire Southeast -- including several tornadoes -- and will spread more snow and ice from Minnesota to Maine through Monday. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Additionally, very heavy rain is heading to the Northeast for Monday morning when flooding is possible. So far there have been 18 reported tornadoes in five states across the South since the outbreak began. There have been over 290 reports of severe weather from Texas to Wisconsin to Alabama. The storm spreads from Minneapolis south to Pensacola, Florida, on Sunday morning. Heavy snow is still falling Sunday morning across parts of the upper Midwest with 1 to 2 inch per hour snowfall accumulation being reported. An icy mix is now extending across Michigan and into parts of New England. An ice storm warning has been issued for western New York state. In the South, a tornado watch remains in effect for parts of Florida, southern Georgia and southwest Alabama Sunday morning as a line of storm moves through that region. Very heavy rain is falling with this line of storms, including rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour. The radar is estimating that 7 to 10 inches of rain has fallen near Mobile, Alabama. Therefore, the flood risk continues this morning along parts of the Gulf Coast. Tornadoes pose a threat to the Southeast coast on Sunday. While the storms are losing their intensity, they will strengthen later Sunday as they head toward the Southeast coast. Storms are expected to be widespread from Florida to Virginia. A slight risk for severe weather has been issued from Miami to Roanoke, Virginia, with the threat being damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes. Damaging winds, hail and tornadoes are possible along the Southeast coast on Sunday. The tornado threat is locally enhanced in parts of the interior Carolinas and southern Virginia -- including Charlotte and Winston-Salem. A few tornadoes are likely in this highly populated area of the country and the impacts from severe storms could be notable. The Carolinas and Virginia will be most at risk for tornadoes on Sunday. The slow-moving nature of the storms will also re-ignite a flash flood risk across nearly the entire Southeast coast -- with rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour likely. Ice, rain in Northeast Dangerous blizzard conditions caused a travel nightmare in parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin on Saturday with multiple counties having to ban travel altogether due to whiteout conditions. Minnesota State Police reported on Saturday night there had been over 400 crashes, 738 spinouts and 16 jackknifed semis. The snow fell so fast on Saturday that motorists all over the region became stranded due to rapidly accumulating snow. With 13.7 inches of snow in Sioux Falls, it is now the snowiest April day on record, and also has pushed April 2018 into the snowiest April on record. Snow and ice pose a threat to the northern U.S. and Great Lakes on Sunday. The storm will move to the east Sunday and Monday spreading snow and ice from Minnesota to Maine. The heaviest snow will move into Wisconsin and Michigan on Sunday. On Sunday and early Monday, rounds of an icy mix are expected to stretch into parts of the interior Northeast. Sleet and freezing rain are expected from Buffalo to Boston. Travel will be treacherous in upstate New York -- especially near Buffalo and Syracuse -- due to icy roads. Icy roads are expected in parts of New England through Monday morning. Locally, half an inch of ice is expected. Heavy rain is likely in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City on Monday. On the warmer side of this system, heavy rain and isolated strong thunderstorms will move over the Appalachians on Sunday and could bring flash flooding from Pittsburgh to Asheville, North Carolina. Then on Monday morning, the heavy rain will hit New York City and Philadelphia. Localized flash flooding is possible. Some isolated gusty thunderstorms will also be possible with a line of storms from Washington, D.C. to New York late Sunday into Monday. Another temperature drop After reaching the upper 70s on Saturday and 80s on Friday, the wind chill in New York City on Sunday morning is 40 to 50 degrees colder. Wind chill readings will be 30 degrees colder on Monday morning than it was Saturday across the Northeast. Behind the major storm, temperatures are plummeting in yet another return to winter. Wind chills through much of the central U.S. are in the teens and 20s Sunday morning.

WTM,"Neatorama readers may recall the 2017 feature article concerning the Tri-State Tornado, wherein it was stated that the nickname of that storm was The Forgotten Storm, for the simple reason that it has largely disappeared into history, obscured by the passage of annual killer tornadoes. Case in point today marks the 40th anniversary of the Red River Outbreak, a weather event in which 13 tornadoes were spawned in and around the Red River Valley between Texas and Oklahoma on April 10, 1979. And these werent just ordinary tornadoes; one was the Seymour Tornado, which was the first tornado ever successfully chased and analyzed by the NSSL. It was a symmetrical funnel/cylindrical tornado, with measured top wind speed of only 205 mph, but what else sets it apart from others occurring that day was the ear-piercing shriek it emitted that could be heard for miles.
However, the tornado by which everyone remembers this date is the 1979 Wichita Falls Tornado (pictured above), which at the time was the largest tornado ever observed, being at one point over two miles in diameter. It was also a strong F4 wedge tornado, with winds estimated at 230-250 mph. Whereas the Seymour Tornado caused little damage, being mostly confined to open farmland, the Wichita Falls Tornado took dead aim at its namesake city, and besides causing 45 deaths, its damage was incredible, making it at that time the costliest tornado in US history.
This site documents the Red River Outbreak in exquisite detail, with many photographs and running commentary. There is also a YouTube video concerning the Red River Outbreak, and it is embedded below. April is now well upon us, which means Tornado Alley has again become active for 2019, so you may wish to brush up on the subject before the thunder begins rolling in your own neighborhood.","Neatorama readers may recall the 2017 feature article concerning the Tri-State Tornado, wherein it was stated that the nickname of that storm was The Forgotten Storm, for the simple reason that it has largely disappeared into history, obscured by the passage …",2019-04-10T18:18:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Neatorama.com'}","Terrible Tuesday – April 10, 1979",https://www.neatorama.com/2019/04/10/Terrible-Tuesday-April-10-1979/,https://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/614/105/105614/Terrible-Tuesday-April-10-1979_0-x.jpg?v=9221,,Neatorama.com,tornado outbreak,1

The forecast. I went back to examine the National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlook two days before the outbreak (graphic below). It was clear meteorologists knew that region was going to be threatened Sunday afternoon. &amp;nbsp;The NWS SPC mesoscale discussion on the morning of March 3rd&amp;nbsp;was also aggressively discussing potential tornadic activity in a region that included southeastern Alabama, south-central Georgia, and northern Florida. Here is the text from that mesoscale discussion at 9:50 am CST:
NWS SPC Outlook 2 days before the outbreak.NWS SPC
In summary, as moderate&amp;nbsp;buoyancy and strong/veering flow through the profile combine with&amp;nbsp;moist low levels, the threat for strong low-level mesocyclones&amp;nbsp;associated with the discrete storms will increase, along with acorresponding risk for tornadoes of which a few may be strong.
In other words, the atmosphere was very favorable for the formation of rotating storms (graphic below). &amp;nbsp;Matthew Cappuci wrote a great meteorological breakdown in the Washington Post Capital Weather Gang.
The technology works. The models sniffed out likely tornado regions well. Doppler and dual-polarization radars functioned properly.&amp;nbsp;Doppler radar detects changes in the frequency of a pulse of energy reflected back from the cloud volume. Slight shifts in frequency can be used to determine if rotation exists in the cloud. Tornado warnings are often issued based on radar-indicated rotation. On March 3rd, I looked at all of the rotation signatures on radar and said to my wife, &amp;quot;this is going to be bad.&amp;quot;

The dual-polarization aspect of the radar allows meteorologists to see something called the &amp;quot;tornado debris signature or ball.&amp;quot; While this signal is not available until the tornado is traversing the ground lofting debris into the air, it is quite useful for warning other locations within the pathway of the tornado.

A good forecast is not good if it is not received and acted upon.&amp;nbsp;Even as meteorologists point out how good the forecast was, the sad reality is that people still died. We are in the business of saving lives and property; not self-affirmation. While cliche &amp;quot;It Came Without Warning Headlines&amp;quot; are hyperbole, an individual that did not receive or understand the message may feel exactly that way. &amp;nbsp;What happens once the warning information leaves the National Weather Service, your Phone Alert App, or the TV meteorologist break-in?
There is a percentage of people who never get the warnings. I am very weather-aware, but many people are not. They are simply battling the challenges and routines of daily life. How do we reach them? There is a percentage of people who complain about TV shows being interrupted. James Spann, the legendary Birmingham-based meteorologist, has written about this in the past. How do we overcome this notion that if a person is not affected then there is no emergency (&amp;quot;survivor bias&amp;quot;) or no need to interrupt my show? There is a percentage of people who got the message and were likely sufficiently alarmed but were not certain what to do.&amp;nbsp;These points&amp;nbsp;highlight continued focus on the social science aspects (communication, message interpretation, perception, psychology, color schemes, words, tendencies) of the weather forecast continuum. Ari Gerstman of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research tweeted it very bluntly,
Maybe we need more funding for social science and actually integrate it into prediction and forecasting research?
Vulnerable structures. Many of the fatalities and injuries from the outbreak were associated with mobile homes. Sadly, this is a reality that has long been of concern and is well-studied. Professors Stephen Strader of Villanova University and Walker Ashley of Northern Illinois University published a recent study in the journal Weather, Climate and Society entitled &amp;quot;Fine-scale assessment of mobile home tornado vulnerability in the central and southeast U.S.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;They write in the abstract:
Tornado-mobile home impact potential is 4.5 times (350%) greater in Alabama than in Kansas because Alabama, in comparison to Kansas, is represented by 1) a greater number of mobile homes and 2) a more sprawling mobile home distribution. Findings reveal that Southeasts mobile home residents are one of the most socioeconomically and demographically marginalized populations in the U.S. and are more susceptible to tornado impact and death than illustrated in prior research.
Dr. Daphne Ladue, a senior research scientist at the University of Oklahoma, further highlighted this challenge by tweeting the graphic below. She points out that in the affected parts of Alabama, there are relatively few tornado shelters. Research by Strader, Ladue, Ashley, and others can be useful in saving future lives if it is utilized by decision-makers.

https://www.facebook.com/sarahpulliambailey,"Residents of a small Alabama city, still reeling after deadly tornadoes devastated their corner of the state, said President Trumps visit Thursday was a godsend.
He punctuated his trip at a Southern Baptist church in Opelika, Ala., with another religious overture, one that was distinctly on-brand: when asked, the president signed several of the churchgoers Bibles.
After adding his unique, frenetic signature to a 12-year-old boys Good Book, the crowd of onlookers erupted in applause, a pool report noted. One church volunteer, Ada Ingram, told the reporters that Trumps visit was a blessing. Hopefully, it brings the community together, she said.
I enjoyed him coming, Ingram said. I think its a godsend.
Another volunteer, Emily Pike, said the president and first Lady Melania Trump signed her 10-year-old daughters Bible, which was already decorated with pink camouflage.
She just reached out there and said, Mr. President, would you sign this?"" the Associated Press reported.
At the church, Providence Baptist, Trump addressed dozens of residents and victims families, and recounted some of the damage he saw there, days after one of the worst tornado outbreaks in recent years killed 23 people.
Ive never seen anything like it, Trump said, according to the pool report.
In keeping with his vow to the state, Trump confirmed that officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency are indeed doing an A-plus job The crowd there praised Trump, who, in turn, told them, We couldnt get here fast enough ... We love the state of Alabama.
But the Presidents critics were quick to chide him for his impromptu book signing, an act usually reserved for the author or authors of the book in question.
In Trumps defense, he wrote as much of the Bible as Art of The Deal, one commenter tweeted, referring to the first of more than a dozen books for which Trump has hired a ghostwriter.
Others took a darker, more critical view, contrasting the Bibles teachings of Christ-like virtue with Trump administration policies they deemed inhumane.
Donald J. Trump is signing Bibles, wrote Peter Daou, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, on Twitter. The man whose vicious and inhumane border policy violates the fundamental teachings of Jesus is signing Bibles.

The presidents signature, on its appearance alone, may be an admittedly odd adornment to any sacred text. Its been described as resembling the EKG of a tachycardia patient or a failed polygraph test. One handwriting analyst who has been following Trumps writing style since the 1990s told The Boston Globe that Trumps signature portrayed power and control and rigidity.
Theres absolutely no softness in his signature, its just mean and tough and rigid, and there is no room for anybody else, the analyst, Sheila Lowe, said. Hes not interested in anyone elses opinion.
Some experts said that any signature in a Bible, no matter the penmanship, would be frowned upon.
Growing up in a religious home, it wouldve been seen as blasphemous as having someone signing your own name, said, Jamie Aten, an evangelical and psychologist at Wheaton College.
Aten, who specializes in the effects of disasters on the religious mind, said its common for disaster survivors to use the Bible to help make meaning of what happened. Though hes never seen survivors bring Bibles for someone to sign.
Maybe you penned your own named so people knew it was yours, Aten said. Ive never seen anything like it.
But Peter Manseau, the Smithsonians curator of religion, said past presidents have signed Bibles, including George W. Bush and President Ronald Reagan.
If this was an organized effort where the president was giving out stacks of signed Bibles that would strike me as odd to say the least, but from what I can tell the event today wasnt outside the norm, Manseau said. Presidents seem to sign a lot of random things put in front of them.
Trump actually has some personal experience with signed bibles. Charismatic televangelist Paula White recounted a request Trump made in 2005 for a Bible signed by the late evangelist Billy Graham, one of the most popular American spiritual leaders of the last century. White managed to procure it for Trumps 60th birthday. The inscription read: To Donald Trump, God Bless you always. Billy Graham.
John Fea, a historian at Messiah College, a Christian school in Pennsylvania, said hes also never heard of any president signing Bibles before. But, Fea said, Trumps actions do fit his appeal to many white evangelicals in the South.
The fact that people are bringing Bibles to him says a lot about them, Fea said. It seems to imply that they see him not only as a political leader but a spiritual savior for the nation.
Trump, who is typically seen at church on Easter and Christmas, has dropped many Bible references since declaring hed run for president. On the campaign trail, he nodded to the Bible when he spoke to thousands of students at Liberty University in Virginia.
Two Corinthians, 3:17, thats the whole ballgame, Trump said. Many in the crowd laughed because he said two, instead of second Corinthians.
In 2015, he even dubbed The Bible his all-time favorite book, before listing The Art of the Deal as runner-up. (However, a year, later he listed The Art of the Deal first.)
That year, Trump told David Brody, a reporter for the Christian Broadcasting Network, he liked the Bible verse that read never bend to envy, but it was unclear which verse he was identifying.
""The Bible is special, Trump said. The Bible the more you see it, the more you read it, the more incredible it is. ... I dont like to use this analogy, but like a great movie, a great, incredible movie. Youll see it once, it will be good. Youll see it again. You can see it 20 times and every time youll appreciate it more. The Bible is the most special thing.
Bloomberg reporters later asked him whether he was an Old Testament guy or New Testament? He responded, Probably equal.

A radar image of the lethal tornado moving through Columbus, Mississippi, on February 23, 2019.NOAA/NWS/Gibson Ridge
An EF-3 tornado killed one person in Columbus, Mississippi, on February 23, 2019. The forecast issued ahead of that tornado called for a widespread severe weather outbreak that didn't materialize.&amp;nbsp;The lethal-but-underperforming severe weather outbreak that occurred in the southeastern U.S. this weekend fell right at the intersection between adhering to hard science and adjusting to the public interest.&amp;nbsp; Was the forecast wrong even if a killer tornado developed?
An outbreak of severe thunderstorms across Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia on Saturday, February 23, 2019, led to seven confirmed tornadoes across the three states. Most of the tornadoes were relatively weak, but a tornado that made a direct hit on Columbus, Mississippi, received an EF-3 rating due to the damage it left behind in the town near the Alabama border.
The Columbus tornado killed one person and injured eleven more, demolishing at least one home&amp;nbsp;and causing significant damage to numerous other homes and businesses along the tornados ten-mile track.
The SPC's severe weather outlook for February 23, 2019.Dennis Mersereau
Columbus was right on the edge of a moderate risk for severe weather issued by the Storm Prediction Center earlier in the day. A moderate risk is a four out of five on the SPCs ascending scale measuring the risk for severe weather in a particular area. Forecasters rang the alarm for a significant tornado and wind damage event given the environmental setup heading into the day. As it turns out, the sloppy nature of Saturday's thunderstorms prevented many of the storms from taking full advantage of the environment around them. However, a storm was still able to produce a lethal tornado that produced significant damage.
A bust is a term used to describe a forecast that was wrong. Busts are commonly discussed in cases where a snowstorm or severe weather outbreak doesnt pan out as expected. Forecasters issued the moderate risk for the Deep South on Saturday in anticipation of strong, long-track tornadoes and widespread damaging winds.
Technically, two significant (EF-2 or stronger) tornadoes did form within 25 miles of the moderate risk zone, so despite the lack of windthe storms only generated 31 reports of wind damage and 3 reports of large hailthe forecast was justified even if the overall extent and intensity of the storms didnt live up to their full potential. However, the isolated nature of the most intense storms, and the relative lack of storm reports, would strongly back up the assertion that the forecast a bust. After all, the severe weather didnt materialize on nearly the scale expected.
But was it really a bust if it helped people in harms way? Balancing hard science with practical applications is one of those lines that meteorologists have a hard time straddling with when they look back on forecasts and determine what they could do better. The thunderstorms didnt live up to expectations, but people in the path of the storms had plenty of advanced notice and that advanced warning likely kept the casualty count low. The point of a weather forecast is to keep people safe. I would argue that the forecast wasnt a bust at all if it saved even one person from injury or death. The crying-wolf effect could harm trust in future outbreaks, but its better to warn people of a large-scale threat that doesnt materialize than keep them uninformed and taken by surprise by an approaching storm.

Dave Dildine,"WASHINGTON — The ghost of weakening Tropical Depression Florence is expected to bring showers and a chance of thunderstorms to the D.C. area on Monday, exactly 14 years after another tropical cyclone gave rise to the largest tornado outbreak on record for Virginia. Florence has produced rainfall totals in excess of 20 inches since it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, as a Category 1 hurricane. After tormenting the Carolinas, the stalled tropical system responsible for widespread flooding will finally gain forward speed as it begins to track north and eastward. As the decaying storm lumbers toward the Appalachians and the mid-Atlantic, scattered showers are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the day on Monday. The threat for flooding is expected to be highest west of the metro area, near the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah Valley. Any showers and storms that develop could produce heavy rain. More than 50 tornado warnings have been issued by National Weather Service offices in three states since Florence forced its way inland. There is a slight chance of an isolated, weak tornado or two on Monday although it is unclear how favorable weather conditions will be for spin-ups. Landfalling tropical systems are known for their ability to produce tornadoes, some more than others. In 2004, the remnant circulation of Hurricane Ivan spawned more than 100 twisters across several states, including Maryland and Virginia. The tropical cyclone’s strongly sheared winds spread over the D.C. region on September 17, 2004. By the midafternoon hours, dozens of rotating thunderstorms had formed. Several of the day’s tornadoes were strong, with winds up above 100 mph. More than three dozen twisters touched down in Virginia, including a violent F3 tornado in Fauquier County. Dozens of homes sustained damage in Remington. It was the Commonwealth’s largest tornado outbreak in recorded history. An F2 tornado tracked due north from Chantilly past Dulles International Airport into western Montgomery County, where numerous structures were damaged in Poolesville before the twister lifted.

Al Jazeera,"The number of deaths caused by two back-to-back tornadoes which smashed the southern state of Alabama in the United States on Sunday is likely to rise.
The search for dozens of missing people was focussed in the area around Beauregard, about 100km east of Alabama's capital Montgomery, where so far 23 people are known to have died in the deadliest US twisters in nearly six years.
Rescue crews using dogs and drones searched for victims amid splintered lumber and twisted metal, while volunteers used chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers.
""It looks almost as if someone took a giant knife and scraped the ground,"" Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County told the AFP news agency.
""We have several people who are still unaccounted for,"" Jones said. ""Unfortunately, we anticipate the number of fatalities may rise.""
A powerful EF-4 ""monster tornado"" was blamed for most of the destruction on a path about 39km long, meteorologist Chris Darden said. The deadliest, an EF-5, killed 24 people in Oklahoma in 2013.
More than 6,000 homes were left without power in Alabama, according to PowerOutage.us, while 16,000 suffered outages in neighbouring Georgia.
The twisters were part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
An early March tornado outbreak in the Alabama-Mississippi area is usual, experts said.","Search operation still under way after twin twisters rip through Alabama in southern US on Sunday, killing 23 so far.",2019-03-05T10:41:58Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}","US tornadoes cause deaths and loss, toll likely to rise",https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/tornadoes-deaths-loss-toll-rise-190305081512367.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/3/5/366df3acfecf472ea2823fce87f0d59e_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,tornado outbreak,1
Leigh Morgan,"All of Alabama will run the risk of seeing severe weather this weekend, starting late tonight and lasting into Sunday.
And just about everything is on the table this time, including tornadoes, large hail, damaging winds and heavy rain, according to the National Weather Service.
The weather service in Birmingham cautioned that a strong tornado will not be out of the question, either.
Weather experts continued to urge Alabamians to have not one but several ways to get severe weather alerts -- especially overnight.
A NOAA weather radio is one option (make sure to have batteries in case the power goes out).
There are multiple smartphone apps available as well that can alert you if a warning is issued for your location.
One thing NOT to do is rely on outdoor sirens to wake you up at night. Those arent designed to be heard indoors and will be even more difficult to hear if youre asleep.
Those in mobile homes will have to be especially vigilant and have an alternate shelter at the ready should a storm threaten.
That is an inconvenience, but it may save your life: Recent reports indicate most of the victims of the EF4 tornado in Lee County last month were in mobile homes.
Theres no threat of severe weather this morning, but there is some rain.
A stalled cold front was bringing rain and a storm or two to parts of Alabama on Saturday morning, but those storms arent expected to be severe.
In addtion, a strong storm or two may be possible later this afternoon.
But the storms that concern forecasters the most are expected to arrive starting late tonight and will bring the whole array of severe weather hazards with them.
The weather service expects supercell storms to develop to the west in Louisiana this afternoon and track eastward, reaching Alabama late tonight.
Forecasters said that the atmospheric dynamics in place could allow those storms to maintain their intensity, and they could arrive in Alabama as a semi-broken line with embedded supercells.
We want to emphasize that these potential tornadoes will NOT just be quick QLCS spin-ups but more super cellular in nature, the weather service in Birmingham said in its morning forecast discussion.
The storms are expected to push through the state from west to east, exiting the state by Sunday afternoon.
Rain and storms could redevelop later Sunday afternoon when the actual cold front moves into the state, but the weather service doubted that the atmosphere could recover quickly enough to produce more severe storms. However, showers and isolated thunderstorms will be possible.
NOAAs Storm Prediction Center has placed more than half of the state under a severe weather risk from today through 7 a.m. Sunday, with the best chances for bad weather in parts of west Alabama, where there is an enhanced risk in place.
An enhanced risk means numerous severe storms will be possible.
All of the rest of west Alabama will have a slight risk which means scattered severe storms will be possible. A marginal risk for isolated severe storms extends to the east of that.
The severe risk continues into Sunday. The severe weather outlook for Sunday, which begins at 7 a.m., has an enhanced risk for the northeast part of the state and a large slight risk area over most of the rest of east and central Alabama.
The cold front is forecast to pass through Alabama by Sunday afternoon.
Once the front passes the severe weather threat is over, forecasters said.
And Monday morning will be on the cool side, with lows dipping into the 40s for much of Alabama.
But the calm may not last all that long. The weather service was continuing to monitor another chance for potential severe weather by Thursday:
The Storm Prediction Center has already outlined an area that could see severe weather later next week. This is the severe weather outlook for Thursday.","Tornadoes possible with storms expected late tonight and Sunday, weather service says AL.com Southern US to be in the crosshairs of a dangerous severe weather, tornado outbreak AccuWeather.com Severe storms expected late Saturday night and Sunday morning WHNT…",2019-04-13T13:11:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Al.com'}","Tornadoes possible with storms expected late tonight and Sunday, weather service says - AL.com",https://www.al.com/news/2019/04/tornadoes-possible-with-storms-expected-late-tonight-and-sunday-weather-service-says.html,https://www.al.com/resizer/rDn3NqY8CZX9DwWp2iPhI829Ds0=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D2KG3TLIOFBNZHOZ6UM74EUOXM.png,,Al.com,tornado outbreak,1
Chip Brownlee,"At least 23 people are dead after a series of severe storms and a potential tornado hit a rural area of Lee County south of Auburn and Opelika on Sunday afternoon.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said the number currently stands at 23, but could potentially rise as search crews are able to comb through areas severely damaged and destroyed by the storms.
“I’m afraid we may see more just based on the destruction,” Jones said.
The tornadoes slammed areas from Beauregard to Smiths Station, Alabama, in rural Lee County. The damage is widespread, but the most severe damage is to a mobile home community near Beauregard.
“The devastation is just catastrophic,” Jones said.
Search and rescue operations were called off Sunday evening at 10 p.m., when the darkness and cold made it too dangerous to sift through ripped up metal and wood. Cars were flipped, homes ripped from their slabs and trees snapped in half.
Search and rescue will continue Monday as the sun rises.
State resources, law enforcement, fire and search resources from neighboring emergency agencies and others have been called in to help. Unmanned drones with heat-seeking equipment and other aircraft are being used.
Auburn and Auburn University were spared from the storm.
East Alabama Medical Center, a local hospital in Opelika, said they treated at least 40 patients with injuries resulting from the storm. Other hospitals also received patients. The number of injured is unknown, but is likely above 50.

Ryan Hanrahan,"Hail in Connecticut, 10 inches of snow on Mount Washington, and at least three tornadoes in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Tornadoes weren't in the forecast but the atmosphere was primed for tornadoes. Plentiful low level instability and wind shear produced a swarm of very shallow supercells that starting spinning almost immediately. Waterspout Forming in Sandwich, Mass Based on radar, storm surveys, and eyewitness video I'm able to confirm tornado touchdowns in North Providence/Lincoln, RI, Norton, Mass. and Sandwich, Mass. There may have been more. To measure instability we use something called CAPE which is an acronym for Convective Available Potential Energy. Values about 2,000 or 3,000 get our attention but today they were almost 10% of that! What was different, however, was that all the instability was in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere. We can look at just the CAPE in the 0-3km layer and that was between 100 and 200 units which is very impressive. When coupled with strong low level shear we were set for supercells and tornadoes. Here's the explanation for today's tornado outbreak in New England. Very little instability in total but A LOT of instablity in low levels (0-3km CAPE of 100-200 j/kg). Coupled with over 200 units of SRH (wind shear) the stage was set for a number of rotating storms. #nbcct pic.twitter.com/NMIMDusxRQ — Ryan Hanrahan (@ryanhanrahan) October 24, 2018 Two of these tornadoes we were able to confirm in real time as lofted tornado debris was detected by Doppler Radar. A Tornado Debris Signature is a confirmation that a tornado occurred as lofted tornado debris has a distinct signature that's different from rain, snow or hail. We noted two large, but brief, tornado debris signatures in Lincoln, RI, and Norton, Mass. Quite confident we had a tornado in North Providence/Lincoln, RI and also in Norton, MA. Significant damage in both locations as well as tornado debris signatures on radar. For all intents and purposes these are as good as ""confirmed"" tornadoes based on radar. #nbcct pic.twitter.com/aXRZEl50WH — Ryan Hanrahan (@ryanhanrahan) October 23, 2018 Today's tornado event was extremely unusual.

'It hurts my heart'
The death toll remains at 23, however, the number of missing individuals remains in the double digits as the sun rose on Monday morning in Lee County following Sundays tornados.
Search-and-rescue teams are expected to be out most of the day, starting in the hardest hit areas and working their way out, said Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones early this morning.
We have a lot of our first responders are completely committed to helping locate anyone who may be out there still, Jones said in a Monday morning news conference. Unfortunately we anticipate the number of fatalities may rise as the day goes on.
Jones expects nearly 200 individuals will be out assisting with the search and rescue efforts throughout the day. Jones added that he expects search and rescue efforts to extend into Tuesday due to the extent of the damage, which he described as catastrophic.
I have not seen this level of destruction ever in my experience, he said.
The hardest hit area, according to Jones, is the area around Alabama Highway 51 from Lee Road 42 to Highway 80.
This is where most of the fatalities are located, he said.
Among the dead are several children but the exact number is not known, according to Jones.
It hurts my heart, said Jones. I love this county. Its extremely upsetting to me to see these people hurting like this.
Multiple injuries were reported on Sunday as well. Jones said the injuries ranged from minor to severe injuries.
Power crews will be out throughout Lee County helping to restore power to those who are still without it, said Jones.
Crews have also helped clear the roads in the area and most are now open, however, Jones urges people to continue to avoid the area.
Were asking folks that are not residents of the area, please do not come to the area, he said. We dont want folks coming down and literally getting in the way.
For those needing help, or shelter, the main shelter area is the Providence Baptist Church. Lee County Sheriffs Office staff will be assisting with identifying people and helping with the relief effort at the shelter, said Jones.
Updated, 5:30 a.m. Monday
The American Red Cross has opened a shelter in Opelika in response to Sunday's tornadoes.
Located at the west campus of the Providence Baptist Church, the shelter has food and water available to those who are in need.
Meanwhile, power is still out for more 1,900 customers in Lee County. According to poweroutage.us, 1,977 Alabama Power customers were without power at approximately 5 a.m. Monday as a result of Sunday's severe weather.
Updated, 11:15 p.m. Sunday
Officials have confirmed that the death toll has risen to 23 from Sunday's tornadoes, with most search efforts suspended until daybreak Monday.
Meanwhile, the Church of the Highlands in Auburn will be accepting donations Monday morning. Some of its members posted the following:
The Auburn Dream Center on 1103 Donahue Drive will be open Monday from 6:00-11:00am to receive donations for those affected by the tornado in the Beauregard area.

Dennis Mersereau The odds of a tornado hitting any one spot are pretty low. Most people and most things will remain untouched by physical harm during even the most violent tornado outbreak. But there are oddities out there. A tornado can hit the same spot twice. They can cross mountains and rivers with ease. And yes, tornadoes can hit cities no matter how hard residents argue that they can’t. But it takes an incredible amount of luck for a tornado to hit a weather station, and it just happened for the fourth time this decade in Oklahoma. Meteorologists have gotten quite good at observing tornadoes with Doppler weather radar. Scientists even put radar dishes on trucks to get an in-depth look at tornadoes from just a short distance away. One of the last frontiers in getting up close and personal with a tornado is getting weather instruments right inside of the funnel. It’s hardly a novel idea—after all, a research project in the 1970s and 80s that tried to do just that was the basis of the blockbuster hit Twister. Oklahoma’s geographic location leaves it prone to just about every natural disaster the atmosphere can throw at it, making it a prime target for meteorologists seeking to study the weather. The state has one of the most robust mesonets in the entire country. A mesonet, short for mesoscale network, is a collection of ground-based weather stations grouped together to get a detailed look at the weather across a relatively small area—in this case, the state of Oklahoma. Mesonets are a great tool for studying small-scale weather features, including, as it turns out, tornadoes. The Oklahoma Mesonet, operated by the University of Oklahoma, consists of 120 stations spread across every county in the state. Given the number of weather stations in the state and the average number of tornadoes reported in Oklahoma each year, it’s hardly a surprise that there are some close calls. Close calls are one thing, sure, but there have been four direct strikes this decade. The odds of that happening are astronomical when you think of the size of an individual tornado compared to the size of an individual weather station. The first strike came on May 24, 2011, during the infamous El Reno tornado west of Oklahoma City. The tornado that hit El Reno was the widest tornado ever recorded, at one point growing to an immense size of 2.6 miles wide. Nearby weather radar measured wind speeds that easily exceeded 200 MPH—the strength of a scale-topping EF-5—but the National Weather Service made the controversial decision to downgrade the tornado's rating to an EF-3 based on the limited structural damage it left in its wake. The data recorded by the mesonet station a few miles outside of El Reno is a testament to the sheer strength of the tornado. The anemometer recorded a peak wind gust of 151 MPH and a pressure drop of 10 millibars as the outer circulation of the tornado passed overhead. Some instruments were destroyed, and a piece of debris wrapped itself around the steel support tower, but the station surprisingly remained intact and continued recording data after the storm. The mesonet station in Tipton, Oklahoma, destroyed after a tornado on November 7, 2011. Oklahoma Mesonet A few months later, an unusually potent tornado outbreak on November 7, 2011, spawned several strong tornadoes in southern Oklahoma, two of which hit two separate mesonet stations dozens of miles apart. The station in Tipton measured a 91 MPH wind gust before an irrigation pipe blew into the station and destroyed most of its equipment. Farther north in Fort Cobb, the station there measured an 86 MPH wind gust before tornado debris tipped the station over and prevented it from gathering more data. After three rare tornadic encounters in one year, the Oklahoma Mesonet went almost seven years without another direct strike. A small and weak tornado hit the Inola mesonet station near Tulsa on August 19, damaging the rain gauges but otherwise leaving the station intact. The station recorded a maximum wind gust of 98 MPH near the surface and a pressure drop of 12 millibars as the EF-1 tornado passed overhead. The network could go years (or even forever) without seeing another direct strike from a tornado. But the sheer density of weather stations across Oklahoma, and the fact that they've been hit so many times by the worst weather nature can throw at us, is a testament to the value of these mesonet projects in collecting valuable weather information we would otherwise miss.

Pelmorex Weather Networks Inc.,"SEVERE | Tornadic Outbreak Erin Wenckstern Meteorologist Thursday, April 26, 2018, 4:41 PM - Severe thunderstorms erupted across eastern Canada on a weekend in June of 2017, sparking tornado warnings from the Greater Toronto Area through southern Quebec. Now, nearly a year later, a newly released study has uncovered this to be Quebec's largest tornado outbreak ever recorded and, consequently, one of the nation's largest. On June 18th, 2017, supercell thunderstorms tore through southern Quebec, producing large hail, violent winds and an initial report of 4 tornadoes across the province. But a team consisting of wind engineering experts at Western University and severe weather scientist Dr. Dave Sills from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) believed this number to be grossly underestimated. WATCH: TORNADO CAUGHT ON CAMERA NEAR HEBERTVILLE, QUEBEC ON JUNE 18, 2017 The team from Western and ECCC has embarked on a challenging and far-reaching study called The Northern Tornadoes Project, focused on exposing and documenting unknown tornado cases across Canada, in particular northern and rural regions. Through extensive aerial and ground surveys across Quebec, the group exhaustively studied a region spanning over 400 km, uncovering 7 previously unknown tornadoes from that eventful day, raising the total number to 11. A particularly strong tornado recorded in the Ste Anne du Lac area completely levelled two homes on its destructive 30 km track and through further investigation, the tornado was upgraded from an EF2 to EF3 tornado, with estimated wind speeds of 230 km/h. It was the strongest reported tornado from the outbreak. Aerial and ground survey reveals extensive damage to a home and trees. The tornado tracked on the ground for over 30 km, produced wind speeds up to 230 km/h and at its maximum, was a width of 1300 m. Image courtesy: UWO and ECCC. ONTARIO TORNADOES While the latest press release from Western University focuses on the Quebec outbreak, the team also discovered two undetected tornadoes in the Dryden area of northern Ontario; one from June 14, 2017 and the other from July 25, 2017. CHALLENGE WITH CONFIRMING TORNADOES Canada is large -- 9,984,670 square kilometres, to be exact. The challenge arises because tornadoes, in comparison to our country, are infinitesimally small, forming on scales of hundreds of metres, quickly producing hyperlocal damage. The fact that most of our civilians live in densely-populated southern areas and our radar network outside of it is sparse leads to the underrepresentation of tornado formation in these regions. TIMELAPSE: SEVERE THUNDERSTORM FROM JUNE 18, 2017 It's similar to the age old saying: ""If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?"" Well in the case of severe weather in Canada, the saying can be morphed into ""If a tornado touches down in a rural area, does it leave any damage?"" Of course the answer is yes, but discovering and confirming that damage is quite challenging in these radar and population sparse regions, especially if there is no one to spot or report it. RELATED: Current tornado drought could mean strong ones later WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT “Many Canadians don’t realize that we can have intense tornadoes in the northern regions of the country,"" says Greg Kopp, a Western Engineering Professor and Associate Dean (Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies), who is the the lead researcher for the Northern Tornadoes Project. ""The goal of our project is to identify as many of these as we can, so that we can better define the true risk in those areas."" Understanding the true distribution of tornadoes is crucial for severe weather climatology. A study involving all confirmed Canadian tornadoes from 1980 through 2009 revealed our national average to be roughly 62 tornadoes per year. Canadian tornadoes and intensities from 1980 to 2009. Image courtesy: ECCC, David Sills et al. Tornado 101: Everything you need to know about staying safe But a more recent analysis, also led by Dr. Dave Sills from ECCC, which included The Weather Network's meteorologist Brad Rousseau, concluded that this average poorly represented tornadoes that form in northern communities. Through statistical methods and global lightning data, the team revealed a more realistic Canadian average... around 230 tornadoes per year! That's why research being conducted by The Northern Tornadoes Project is crucial.

Associated Press,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. Forecasters are upgrading the likelihood that severe storms and strong tornadoes could strike parts of the South less than a week after a twister killed 23 people in Alabama.
A region that includes parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri will be at heightened risk of severe weather Saturday, the national Storm Prediction Center reported Friday. The area is home to 2.6 million people, and includes the Memphis, Tennessee metropolitan area.
A broader area that includes more than 10 million people — stretching from east Texas to Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky — is at a slightly lower risk of severe storms and tornadoes.
The storms will be fast-moving, racing to the northeast at 50 to 60 mph (80 to 97 kph), said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.
""It means you have to take action when warnings are issued and not wait until you see the threat visually,"" he said. ""If you wait until you see an approaching tornado with damaging winds, it's going to be at your location within seconds.""
As the sun rises Saturday, storms and possibly tornadoes will likely be moving through east Texas and parts of Louisiana and Arkansas, the National Weather Service is projecting.
Saturday night, the threat will likely continue after dark as the storms move east into Alabama, forecasters said. That poses a particular danger as many people are often asleep.
""It can be more difficult to reach people at night,"" Bunting said. ""Just make sure you know how to the get the warnings if it's in the middle of the night.""
Forecasters across the region were studying computer models and tracking the system's progress. Some characteristics, such as strong wind shear, have them concerned.
""It's sort of like making a cake — if the ingredients can all really come together we could certainly have multiple tornadoes across the broad region,"" said Andrew Pritchett, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama.
Rain could help cool the atmosphere and block the heat that fuels severe storms. But that could also exacerbate flooding in the region, where rivers are already running very high, Prichett said. Up to two inches (5 centimeters) of rain is expected in northern Alabama.
""So it's a very delicate balance — we don't need the rain, but we're hoping that maybe the atmosphere will stay more rain-cooled throughout the day and help mitigate the severe weather threat,"" he said.
President Donald Trump planned a Friday visit to Lee County, Alabama, where a tornado outbreak across the Southeast last Sunday wreaked its worst havoc, killing 23 people. It was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore.
The National Weather Service has confirmed at least 38 tornadoes touched down in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina as punishing storms crossed the region Sunday.

Bradford Betz,"A deadly tornado ripped through Alabama on Sunday, killing at least 23 that was part of a severe storm system that caused catastrophic damage and unleashed other tornadoes around the Southeast.
Among the other fatalities was an 8-year-old girl, according to rescue officials. Her identity was not released. Unconfirmed reports identified a 6-year-old boy as another victim.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told WRBL-TV that the tornado traveled along a state road in Beauregard and that the path of destruction appeared at least a mile long and a quarter mile wide. He said single-family homes and mobile homes were destroyed, adding some homes were reduced to slabs. He had told reporters earlier that several people were taken to hospitals, some with ""very serious injuries.""

Describing rescue efforts Sunday night, a local mayor told Fox News: ""We had to cut our way in with chainsaws and tractors to get to these people and make sure everyone was okay. We had some elderly people that were trapped in their houses.
""Words cannot describe it. Trailer homes turned upside down, the damage is unbelievable,"" he added.
""So I grabbed my dog and went and got in the closet and I'm sitting there holding the door just in case because it didn't close all the way. And a few minutes later, that's when I could hear all the wind and the house moving,"" another woman told Fox News.

The East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika treated 63 people in the aftermath of tornadoes that devastated the Southeast, and about 12 people were sent to other hospitals, according to AL.com.
""We conduct disaster drills at least twice a year, and most times they involve a tornado because that's one of the most likely disaster scenarios we all face in Alabama,"" said John Atkinson, the medical center's marketing director. ""Those certainly prepared us for the quick influx of patients.
""But no event in the past 50 years or so compares to what Lee County experienced,"" he said.
The Southeast was hit with multiple tornados over the weekend. Central Alabama had its first tornado warning in the early afternoon March 3, and the storms that followed resulted in at least 23 reported deaths in Lee County, as well as destruction in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, according to The New York Times.
The 340-bed East Alabama Medical Center is about 9 miles from Beauregard and about 20 miles from Smith Station, two Alabama communities where tornadoes hit.
AL.com reported that some physicians and part of the hospital's workforce were watching the weather and arrived at the medical center shortly before patients started arriving.
By the morning of March 4, four of the 63 patients treated at the medical center  remained hospitalized.

Richard Defendorf,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Rescuers prepared Monday to tear through the rubble of mobile homes and houses in search of survivors of a powerful tornado that rampaged through southeast Alabama and killed at least 23 people.
The trail of destruction was at least half a mile wide and overwhelmed rural Lee County's coroners' office, forcing it to call in help from the state.
""The devastation is incredible,"" Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Drones flying overheard equipped with heat-seeking devices had scanned the area for survivors, but the dangerous conditions halted the search late Sunday, Sheriff Jones said. Rescuers planned to resume the search at daylight Monday.
The Sunday tornado was part of a powerful storm system that also slashed its way across parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
Levi Baker, who lives near the hard-hit area in Alabama, took a chain saw to help clear a path for ambulances and other first-responder vehicles. He said some houses were demolished and trees were uprooted or snapped in half. One house was swept off its foundation and was sitting in the middle of the road.
""It was just destruction,"" Baker said. ""There were mobile homes gone. Frames on the other side of the road.""
Jones said the twister traveled straight down a county road in the rural community of Beauregard reducing homes to slabs.
The National Weather Service confirmed late Sunday a tornado with at least an F3 rating caused the destruction in Alabama. Although the statement did not give exact wind estimates, F3 storms typically are gauged at wind speeds of between 158-206 mph (254-331 kph).

After nightfall Sunday, the rain had stopped and pieces of metal debris and tree branches littered roadways in Beauregard. Two sheriff's vehicles blocked reporters and others from reaching the worst-hit area. Power appeared to be out in many places.
In a tweet late Sunday, President Donald Trump said: ""To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!""
Rita Smith, spokeswoman for the Lee County Emergency Management Agency, said about 150 first responders had quickly jumped in to help search the debris after the storm struck in Beauregard. At least one trained canine could be seen with search crews as numerous ambulances and emergency vehicles, lights flashing, converged on the area.
No deaths had been reported Sunday evening from storm-damaged Alabama counties other than Lee County, said Gregory Robinson, spokesman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. But he said crews were still surveying damage in several counties in the southwestern part of the state.
Numerous tornado warnings were posted across parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina on Sunday afternoon as the storm system raced across the region. Weather officials said they confirmed other tornadoes around the region by radar alone and would send teams out Monday to assess those and other storms.
In rural Talbotton, Georgia, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Atlanta, a handful of people were injured by either powerful straight-line winds or a tornado that destroyed several mobile homes and damaged other buildings, said Leigh Ann Erenheim, director of the Talbot County Emergency Management Agency.
News footage showed smashed buildings with rooftops blown away, cars overturned and debris everywhere. Trees all around had been snapped bare of branches.
""The last check I had was between six and eight injuries,"" Erenheim said in a phone interview. ""From what I understand it was minor injuries, though one fellow did say his leg might be broken.""
She said searches of damaged homes and structures had turned up no serious injuries or deaths there.
Henry Wilson of the Peach County Emergency Management Agency near Macon in central Georgia said a barn had been destroyed and trees and power poles had been snapped, leaving many in the area without power.
Authorities in southwest Georgia were searching door-to-door in darkened neighborhoods after a possible tornado touched down in the rural city of Cairo, about 33 miles (53 kilometers) north of Tallahassee, Florida, on Sunday evening. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
Authorities said a tornado was confirmed by radar in the Florida Panhandle late Sunday afternoon. A portion of Interstate 10 on the Panhandle was blocked in one direction for a time in Walton County in the aftermath, said Don Harrigan, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.

'It hurts my heart'
The death toll remains at 23, however, the number of missing individuals remains in the double digits as the sun rose on Monday morning in Lee County following Sundays tornados.
Search-and-rescue teams are expected to be out most of the day, starting in the hardest hit areas and working their way out, said Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones early this morning.
We have a lot of our first responders are completely committed to helping locate anyone who may be out there still, Jones said in a Monday morning news conference. Unfortunately we anticipate the number of fatalities may rise as the day goes on.
Jones expects nearly 200 individuals will be out assisting with the search and rescue efforts throughout the day. Jones added that he expects search and rescue efforts to extend into Tuesday due to the extent of the damage, which he described as catastrophic.
I have not seen this level of destruction ever in my experience, he said.
The hardest hit area, according to Jones, is the area around Alabama Highway 51 from Lee Road 42 to Highway 80.
This is where most of the fatalities are located, he said.
Among the dead are several children but the exact number is not known, according to Jones.
It hurts my heart, said Jones. I love this county. Its extremely upsetting to me to see these people hurting like this.
Multiple injuries were reported on Sunday as well. Jones said the injuries ranged from minor to severe injuries.
Power crews will be out throughout Lee County helping to restore power to those who are still without it, said Jones.
Crews have also helped clear the roads in the area and most are now open, however, Jones urges people to continue to avoid the area.
Were asking folks that are not residents of the area, please do not come to the area, he said. We dont want folks coming down and literally getting in the way.
For those needing help, or shelter, the main shelter area is the Providence Baptist Church. Lee County Sheriffs Office staff will be assisting with identifying people and helping with the relief effort at the shelter, said Jones.
Updated, 5:30 a.m. Monday
The American Red Cross has opened a shelter in Opelika in response to Sunday's tornadoes.
Located at the west campus of the Providence Baptist Church, the shelter has food and water available to those who are in need.
Meanwhile, power is still out for more 1,900 customers in Lee County. According to poweroutage.us, 1,977 Alabama Power customers were without power at approximately 5 a.m. Monday as a result of Sunday's severe weather.

WIBW,"TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - It’s been a cool and calm season - and while you might be grateful for the lack of severe weather, now is the time to practice your emergency plan. That’s because tornadic storms can pop up at any moment. “In Kansas, we've seen tornadoes every month of the year. I remember one year we had tornado watches and warnings across the area on Christmas Day,” said WIBW Chief Meteorologist Jeremy Goodwin. But so far this year, we've seen no tornadoes anywhere in the state. ""It's extremely uncommon to see no tornadoes in Northeast Kansas, but also anywhere in Kansas. No tornadoes in 2018. I'm almost hesitant to say that because you know as soon as you even recognize that fact, it will change quickly and that's likely gonna be the case this year,"" Goodwin explained. According to the National Weather Service, the latest first tornado ever reported in the state in one season was May 28th, 1980, which means there's plenty of storm season left.

The death toll remains at 23, however, the number of missing individuals remains in the double digits as the sun rose on Monday morning in Lee County following Sundays tornados.
Search-and-rescue teams are expected to be out most of the day, starting in the hardest hit areas and working their way out, said Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones early this morning.

I have not seen this level of destruction ever in my experience, he said.
The hardest hit area, according to Jones, is the area around Alabama Highway 51 from Lee Road 42 to Highway 80.
This is where most of the fatalities are located, he said.
Among the dead are several children but the exact number is not known, according to Jones.

Melissa Breyer,"Last year, the US suffered an astounding $306 billion in damage, shattering all records to date. 2017 was definitely one for the books. If you felt like natural disasters in the United States were descending with unusual fury, you were correct. In fact, according to a new report by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, 2017 was the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country. From the parade of hurricanes and hailstorms to freezes and fires, the succession of calamities came with a price tag of $306 billion in damage. The year saw 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage. As Kendra Pierre-Louis reports for The New York Times, “In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were only three such disasters, adjusted for inflation,” notes Pierre-Louis. “This year’s $306 billion in damage broke a record set in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina contributed to a total of $215 billion in damage, also adjusted for inflation.” And of course even more tragic than the amount of money is the number of deaths; NOAA counts 362 human deaths (not sure how the Puerto Rico numbers fit into that) and countless injuries. Is climate change to blame? Much of the weather’s behavior fell in line with predictions of what to expect with a warming planet, though as Pierre-Louis points out, “scientists cannot always say with certainty how a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change.” Given that last year was the country's third-warmest year in 123 years of record-keeping – with a temperature average 2.6 F degrees above the average year during the 20th century – well, it doesn’t look very good. Below are the disasters with the unfortunate distinction of causing at least $1 billion in damage, according to the NOAA report. © NOAA Southeast freeze, March: $1 billion, 0 deaths While freezes in March across the southeastern states are not that unusual, many of the crops were blooming more than three weeks ahead of schedule thanks to unusually warm temperatures, resulting in heavily damaged fruit crops. Southern tornado outbreak, January: $1.1 billion, 24 deaths Southern California suffered high-wind damage, which was followed by 79 confirmed tornadoes across many southern states all the way to South Carolina. It was the third highest number of tornadoes to occur in a single outbreak during a winter month since 1950. Midwest severe weather: Nebraska, Illinois and Iowa, June: $1.4 billion, 0 deaths The three states suffered severe hail and high wind damage, with more than a dozen tornadoes touching down in Iowa alone. Widespread midwest severe weather, June: $1.5 billion, 0 deaths In a tremendous swatch of states from Iowa to Texas to New York, severe hail, high winds and numerous tornadoes tore across a large part of the country over the course of several days. California flooding, February: $1.5 billion, 5 deaths Following record-breaking drought, the rains came. And came and came and came. Heavy, persistent rainfall across northern and central California resulted in significant property and infrastructure damage from flooding, landslides and erosion, including severe damage to the Oroville Dam spillway. Missouri and Arkansas flooding, May: $1.7 billion, 20 deaths 15 inches or heavy rainfall swamped a multi-state region in the Midwest, causing rivers to flood at historic levels. Missouri, Arkansas and southern Illinois were hit the hardest with breached levees. Tornado outbreak in Central and Southeast states, March: $1.8 billion, 6 deaths The second largest outbreak in early 2017, this one delivered 70 tornadoes across central and southern states causing significant damage, including widespread straight-line wind and hail damage. Midwest tornado outbreak, March: $2.1 billion, 2 deaths Happening a week before the first March outbreak, this spate of tornados and storms swept across the country from Arizona to New York. Missouri and Illinois were affected by numerous tornadoes while Michigan and New York were hit with destructive, straight-line winds behind the storm system. Minnesota hailstorm, June: $2.4 billion, 0 deaths Severe hail and high winds were to blame for significant damage across Minnesota and Wisconsin, especially the Minneapolis metropolitan area that suffered from large, destructive hail. Drought in N. Dakota, S. Dakota and Montana, spring through autumn: $2.5 billion, 0 deaths Extreme drought in North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana had far-reaching impact; crops like wheat were severely damaged which led to hungry cattle and the subsequent need to sell off off livestock. The lack of water has also set the stage for the increased potential of severe wildfires. Severe weather in the South and Southeast, March: $2.6 billion, 0 deaths Large hail and high winds north of Dallas were responsible for widespread damage to buildings and vehicles; other states in the region also suffered from a mix of high winds, hail and tornadoes. Colorado hailstorm, May: $3.4 billion, 0 deaths Hellacious hail and wind damage ripped across a number of states, with Colorado faring especially poorly. Baseball-sized hail fell upon the Denver metropolitan area, making it the most expensive hail storm in Colorado history. Western wildfires and California firestorm, autumn: $18 billion, 54 deaths While southern states were being drenched in hurricanes, the west was on fire. An historic firestorm savaged over 15,000 homes, businesses and other structures in northern California in October, with the combined destruction of the Tubbs, Atlas, Nuns and Redwood Valley wildfires ringing in as the most costly wildfire event on record. In December, Los Angeles wildfires consumed hundreds of homes; while more fires raged across other western and northwestern states, totalling a mind-boggling 9.8 million acres consumed, easily topping the 10-year annual average of 6.5 million acres. Hurricane Irma, September: $50 billion, 97 deaths Category 4 Irma landed at Cudjoe Key, Florida after striking the U.S. Virgin Islands - St John and St Thomas - as a category 5 storm. Twenty-five percent of buildings were destroyed in the Florida Keys, with 65 percent suffering significant damage. Severe wind and storm surge affected other states as well. NOAA notes that Irma maintained a maximum sustained wind of 185 mph for 37 hours, the longest in the satellite era. Irma also was a category 5 storm for longer than all other Atlantic hurricanes except Ivan in 2004. Hurricane Maria, September: $90 billion, 65 deaths Puerto Rico took the brunt of the Category 4 Maria, which made landfall in the southeast part of the island after whalloping the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix. NOAA describes the wreckage: ""Maria's high winds caused widespread devastation to Puerto Rico's transportation, agriculture, communication and energy infrastructure. Extreme rainfall up to 37 inches caused widespread flooding and mudslides across the island. The interruption to commerce and standard living conditions will be sustained for a long period, as much of Puerto Rico's infrastructure is rebuilt. Maria tied Hurricane Wilma (2005) for the most rapid intensification, strengthening from tropical depression to a category 5 storm in 54 hours. Maria's landfall at Category 4 strength gives the U.S. a record three Category 4+ landfalls this year (Maria, Harvey, and Irma)."" Hurricane Harvey, August: $125 billion, 89 deaths With echoes of hurricane Katrina, the Category 4 Harvey made landfall near Rockport, Texas unleashing epic rainfall resulting in historic flooding across Houston and nearby environs. ""More than 30 inches of rainfall fell on 6.9 million people, while 1.25 million experienced over 45 inches and 11,000 had over 50 inches, based on 7-day rainfall totals ending August 31,"" notes the report. Along with the 89 deaths, the flooding displaced over 30,000 people and damaged or destroyed over 200,000 homes and businesses.

WSFA Staff,"LEE COUNTY, AL (WSFA) - The death toll has jumped to 23 and could go higher after at least two tornadoes hit southern Lee County Sunday afternoon, according to Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones.
The sheriff said people are still reported missing, and a more organized search will be conducted in the morning.
Weve done everything we feel like we can do this evening. The area is just very, very hazardous to put anybody in to at this point in time - debris everywhere and its just...just some mass damage to structures and residences in the area, Jones said.
He didnt give any details about the locations or exact circumstances of the deaths.
Family members on the scene identified one of the victims as an 8-year-old girl.
Its unclear how many people are injured. Sunday afternoon, East Alabama Medical Center said it had received more than 40 patients as a result of the tornado and more were expected. Some of the patients were sent to surrounding hospitals. EAMC officials said elective procedures at the hospital for Monday have been cancelled.
The hardest hit area is Lee Road 38, which is south of Beauregard.
The Lee County EMA is asking residents to avoid the damaged areas, especially Lee Road 38 and Lee Road 39. Also, Lee Road 166 at Lee Road 40 and Lee Road 165 at Lee Road 40 are closed and will remain closed until damage assessments are made. Lee Road 721 will be closed indefinitely.
The coroner said Sunday night there were still areas that authorities hadnt reached. He added that injured victims were having to be transported by trucks out of some of the damaged areas because ambulances couldnt get through the debris.
He said they were still working to identify the victims who had been recovered and notify families. Coroners from around the state were coming to assist.
This is a day of destruction for Lee County. Weve never had a mass fatality situation, that I can remember, like this in my lifetime, Harris said.
Anyone who has a missing family member can call his offices 24-hour phone number at 334-737-3620. You can also go to the Lee County EMA website.
The National Weather Service in Birmingham says the first tornado that impacted Lee County Sunday afternoon was at least an EF-3 and at least half a mile wide. The NWS will be sending survey teams to do more detailed assessments in Autauga, Macon, Lee, Barbour and Butler counties Monday.

Kelsey Driscoll,"Auburn football coach Gus Malzahn and several members of the Tigers football team delivered supplies on Monday to help those affected by the numerous tornadoes that devastated parts of Alabama and Georgia this weekend.
At least a dozen tornadoes touched down in Alabama and Georgia on Sunday, according to CNN. One tornado touched down in Lee County, Alabama where Auburn University is located and killed 23 people, including three children, according to the Opelika-Auburn News. The tornado, which was recorded as an EF4 tornado with 170 mph winds, was the deadliest in the United States since 2013 and cut a path of at least 24 miles long.
Malzahn and nearly 30 players helped deliver supplies to the Providence Baptist Church in Beauregard, Alabama, and the Greater Peace Baptist Church in Opleika, Alabama, on Monday afternoon, according to 247Sports.
Well our guys really wanted to help any way they could, Malzahn said, via WVTMs Kyle Burger. Its a tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.
Auburn is currently working with local authorities to plan more ways to aid in relief efforts, according to athletic director Allen Greene and basketball coach Bruce Pearl who said he lives near one of the hardest-hit areas.
I know that Auburn and its leadership both in athletics and the university are working diligently right now to form some action plans to be able to respond, not only short-term but long-term to help our community to rebuild and to heal, Pearl said, via WVTM. The devastation is real. I live up on the side of town probably closest to the area ... so obviously it hits home.

Pearl and the Tigers will take on Alabama in Tuscaloosa on Tuesday night. Alabama coach Avery Johnson said Monday that both the Crimson Tide and Auburn are working to find a way to help victims of the storm through that game.
Were in the process of coming up with a game plan to see how we can help those affected by this tornado, Johnson said Monday. I think at the appropriate time theyll have an announcement. (Its) just very, very sad for a lot of families, people and probably fans of both universities that are going to be playing in this game tomorrow night. Prayers go out to all those affected by this devastating tornado.

William Laws,"Touring the area where a violent tornado touched down earlier in the week, President Trump signed Bibles for supporters who gathered to see him at a Baptist church in Opelika, Ala.
A local television reporter, Sally Pitts, posted video of the visit.
Ada Ingram, a volunteer at the church, said Trump signed several hats and Bibles, and praised the president for taking the time to travel to Alabama.
I enjoyed him coming, said Ingram. I think its a godsend. Im sorry. The situation is bad. And there are going to be people who will say, Why did he come to my town? I dont know why. I dont know why the hurricane happened [either]. But there is a reason.
Twenty-three people were killed Sunday after an EF4 storm laid waste to the rural Alabama countryside.
I saw this and its hard to believe, Trump said Friday of the destruction. You saw things that you wouldnt believe.

While still robust, Trumps support among evangelical voters has dipped in recent months. A Marist poll released at the beginning of December found 73 percent of white evangelicals approved of the job he was doing. Six weeks later, the same polling organization found that the number had dropped to 66 percent.
Trump has long courted the evangelical vote, proclaiming in a 2015 interview that the Bible is his favorite book, while declining to identify his favorite verses.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made headlines in January by proclaiming that Trumps election was a matter of divine intervention.
I think God calls all of us to fill different roles at different times and I think that he wanted Donald Trump to become president, and thats why hes there, Sanders said in an interview with CBNs David Brody and Jennifer Wishon.
At his rallies and speeches, the president is often asked to sign a variety of items, including Bibles and copies of his second-favorite book, The Art of the Deal, which he wrote.
Among the other items he has signed are numerous executive orders, various bills and at least one blank sheet of paper purporting to be a piece of legislation. At a ceremony recognizing family members of Americans killed by immigrants, he signed a photograph of one victim:

NBC12 Newsroom,"RICHMOND, VA (WWBT) - Chesterfield police confirmed one death at Old Dominion Floor Company after the building collapsed there Monday during a severe weather outbreak. Monday night, Chesterfield Fire and EMS confirmed a man’s body - identified by family Tuesday as Ronnie Bishop - was recovered from the collapsed building on Speeks Drive that houses the business. The moment the tornado tore the building’s roof off was captured on video. Debris swirled overhead as the twister moved through the area along Hull Street near between Genito and Courthouse roads. A GoFundMe page has been set up for Bishop’s family as they prepare for his funeral. For the people who work and live in the area, it was both a scary and devastating day as the storm moved through the area around 3:45 p.m. A nearby furniture store also sustained damage from the strong wind. More than a dozen employees were able to safely get out of the building. In addition to the one death, another person was transported to the hospital with minor injuries.

Jeff Morrow,"BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - A First Alert Action Day remains in place for Saturday. The Storm Prediction Center has raised the risk level for the local area. 
The NW corner of the WAFB viewing area is now under a Moderate Risk (4 out of 5) while the remainder of the WAFB viewing area is now under an Enhanced Risk (3 out of 5). 
We expect the worst of the weather to arrive by late afternoon into the evening between 5 - 11 p.m. 
The WAFB First Alert Storm Team expects the local area to be under a Tornado Watch by late afternoon into the evening. Remember that a Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for the possible development of tornadoes. It remains to be seen whether warnings will be issued, but at this time it appears multiple warnings will be likely as well. 
(2/) The tornado threat has also been upgraded. The hatched area, which now includes Baton Rouge, represents areas where the Storm Prediction Center gives at least a 10% chance of a ""significant tornado"" within 25 miles of a point. A significant tornado is EF-2 or stronger. #LAwxpic.twitter.com/sU1Rk9XdDC

All modes of severe weather remain possible. The most likely: 
Here are a few things you can do to prepare:
Saturday is expected to be a windy day with sustained winds of 15-25 mph and gusts of 35 mph possible. This alone could cause small tree limbs to snap creating power outages before storms even arrive. The severe weather threat will come to an end once a cold front pushes through the area late Saturday night into early Sunday morning. 
The remainder of the weekend will be gorgeous. 
Temperatures will start out cool and most will stay in the mid 60°s for afternoon highs Sunday. Skies will gradually clear through the day. Winds will stay breezy for at least the first half of Sunday. 
It will be chilly for the morning bus stop as temperatures dip into the mid 40°s Monday morning. A warming trend will begin by Monday afternoon and continue until our next cold front arrives Thursday. 
The Storm Prediction Center is already highlighting another threat for severe weather Wednesday afternoon and Thursday. Showers and thunderstorms appear most likely Thursday as the front pushes through the area. 
The front will move through quick enough to leave a nice Good Friday forecast and the nice weather looks to last through Easter Sunday.","Severe weather, tornado threats upgraded ahead of Saturday storms WAFB Watches Issued: Severe Weather Outbreak Expected This Weekend in the South, Including Threat of Strong Tornadoes The Weather Channel Severe storms could strike Houston area Saturday mornin…",2019-04-13T13:41:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wafb.com'}","Severe weather, tornado threats upgraded ahead of Saturday storms - WAFB",http://www.wafb.com/2019/04/13/severe-weather-tornado-threats-upgraded-ahead-saturday-storms/,http://www.wafb.com/resizer/b2-RX8CtP_8sVlRjqqFuAiL_II4=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-raycom.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VFL4XVOBJZBYJOHS265JFXKUTU.jpeg,,Wafb.com,tornado outbreak,1

'It hurts my heart'
The death toll remains at 23, however, the number of missing individuals remains in the double digits as the sun rose on Monday morning in Lee County following Sundays tornados.
Search-and-rescue teams are expected to be out most of the day, starting in the hardest hit areas and working their way out, said Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones early this morning.
We have a lot of our first responders are completely committed to helping locate anyone who may be out there still, Jones said in a Monday morning news conference. Unfortunately we anticipate the number of fatalities may rise as the day goes on.
Jones expects nearly 200 individuals will be out assisting with the search and rescue efforts throughout the day. Jones added that he expects search and rescue efforts to extend into Tuesday due to the extent of the damage, which he described as catastrophic.
I have not seen this level of destruction ever in my experience, he said.
The hardest hit area, according to Jones, is the area around Alabama Highway 51 from Lee Road 42 to Highway 80.
This is where most of the fatalities are located, he said.
Among the dead are several children but the exact number is not known, according to Jones.
It hurts my heart, said Jones. I love this county. Its extremely upsetting to me to see these people hurting like this.
Multiple injuries were reported on Sunday as well. Jones said the injuries ranged from minor to severe injuries.
Power crews will be out throughout Lee County helping to restore power to those who are still without it, said Jones.
Crews have also helped clear the roads in the area and most are now open, however, Jones urges people to continue to avoid the area.
Were asking folks that are not residents of the area, please do not come to the area, he said. We dont want folks coming down and literally getting in the way.
For those needing help, or shelter, the main shelter area is the Providence Baptist Church. Lee County Sheriffs Office staff will be assisting with identifying people and helping with the relief effort at the shelter, said Jones.

Lee Southwick,"MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) - Strong storms are rolling across parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi today, bringing multiple Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Warnings. These storms will work their way east throughout the rest of the day and could arrive to western Alabama as early as 1 a.m.
As these storms work their way across central and south Alabama, theyll bring a risk of tornadoes, hail and damaging wind gusts. Youll need to have multiple, reliable ways of receiving weather warnings; ways that will wake you up in the middle of the night. Weather radios and the First Alert Weather App are great tools for this.
Storms will continue to work their way across the state and exit eastern counties by early afternoon. That means that those of you in the eastern half of the state need to stay aware during the morning and early afternoon hours. If you plan to head out, perhaps to Palm Sunday services, keep an eye on your First Alert Weather App and think of where your safe space would be wherever you go.
Sunday afternoon, some more showers and thunderstorms will develop, but these will likely not be severe. Monday will be sunny and cooler in the low 70s.","FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY: Severe storms possible late tonight and tomorrow morning WSFA Southern US in the crosshairs of a dangerous severe weather, tornado outbreak AccuWeather.com Southern states brace for severe weather; tornado warnings issued Fox News Ver…",2019-04-13T15:53:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wsfa.com'}",FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY: Severe storms possible late tonight and tomorrow morning - WSFA,http://www.wsfa.com/2019/04/13/first-alert-strong-severe-storms-possible-late-tonight-tomorrow/,http://www.wsfa.com/resizer/UvzuWUlvoxwKKX2fn9kMS9nAcYc=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-raycom.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DD4AFTL7TNB7PDNQ7HTAVXH33I.png,,Wsfa.com,tornado outbreak,1

R. Kelly in court after being charged for criminal sexual abuse
R&amp;B star R. Kelly is scheduled to appear in court Saturday for a bond hearing after the singer-songwriter was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse Friday, said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.  Each count carries 3-7 years in prison. Some charges stem from a newly discovered video found by attorney Michael Avenatti that allegedly shows Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl, according to a copy of the indictment obtained by USA TODAY. Foxx said the indictment lists four victims, identified by initials, and multiple alleged criminal acts of sexual assault dating back to 1998.

Will Buffett weigh in on stocks in Berkshire letter?
Investing icon Warren Buffett releases his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday, and as always, the financial world will pore over the text for clues to the Oracle of Omaha's thinking. Berkshire spent just $5.6 billion in stock purchases in the fourth quarter the lowest total in several quarters. Does Buffett think stocks are headed for a fall? Is he holding on to cash in anticipation of a big acquisition? Also, Buffett is now 88, and investors will be looking for any further clarification on Berkshire's plans for its future leadership.
Blizzard, tornadoes and more wild weather coming
Winter and spring will battle across the United States in the last weekend of February. Blizzard conditions with freezing rain in the mix are possible in the Upper Midwest, as a potent winter storm hammers the region and unleashes ferocious winds across the central and eastern U.S. In addition to the snow, temperatures will drop to 20 degrees below zero overnight Sunday into Monday in the northern Plains. Farther south, the U.S. will also see its first significant tornado threat of the year. On Saturday, an outbreak of severe weather will unleash strong winds and few tornadoes to the Mid-South. Other parts of the South will endure ongoing rounds of heavy rain and the potential for more flooding.

Syracuse coach will make Duke game; Zion likely on sidelines
Saturday's men's college basketball battle bringing Duke to Syracuse stands out for the coach who's able to participate and an injured, shoe-challenged superstar who likely won't be. On Wednesday, Orange coach Jim Boeheim struck and killed a pedestrian, Jorge Jimenez, 51, while driving on a highway after his defeated Louisville. The incident was still under investigation but no charges are expected. Meanwhile, the Blue Devils will likely be without Zion Williamson. The prospective No. 1 NBA draft pick sprained his knee in Wednesday's loss to arch-rival North Carolina after the young superstar fell awkwardly to the floor while his shoe split open. The unfortunate injury led to ""what-just-happened?"" reactions from spectators, including former President Obama. Williamson is listed as ""day-to-day"" while he recovers from the Grade 1 knee sprain, Duke announced Thursday. 
SportsPulse: Zion Williamson's injury is considered day-to-day with no clear timetable for his return. Scott Gleeson dissects whether Duke is still a title contender and potential one seed.

,"At a Glance At least 12 tornadoes from Tuesday were confirmed in Pennsylvania. It was the state's most tornadic day in over 20 years. Long Island also had its first October tornado on record. Tuesday's warm of tornadoes in parts of the Northeast set an October record in Pennsylvania. It was the state's most tornadic day in over 20 years. As of Thursday evening, the National Weather Service had confirmed 17 tornadoes, 12 of which tore through Pennsylvania. This count could rise, pending results from additional NWS damage surveys and aerial photos from the Pennsylvania Civil Air Patrol. Preliminary tornado reports from Oct. 2, 2018. The number of dots on this map may not correspond to the exact actual number of tornadoes. NWS damage surveys may find additional tornadoes. (NWS/SPC) The 12 tornadoes smashed the state's previous October record from Oct. 5, 1979, of four tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service office in State College. Perhaps most stunning was in the 67-year record from 1950 through 2017: Only 13 October tornadoes had been documented in the Keystone State, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Pennsylvania's last October tornado was about six years ago, when an EF1 tornado injured 15 in Lancaster County on Oct. 19, 2012. Tuesday was the state's most tornadic day since June 22, 1998, more than 20 years ago, NWS-State College said. Thirty-two tornado warnings were issued in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, unlike anything the state had seen in previous Octobers, dating to 1986. ( MORE: Why Fall Color is Delayed in the East ) Three of the tornadoes were rated EF2, including one near Conneautville that damaged a nursing home and duplex, and another near the Tioga/Lycoming County border that downed hundreds of trees. In New York on Tuesday, three tornadoes including an EF0 in Ronkonkoma were confirmed. According to NOAA records dating to 1950, it was the first October tornado on Long Island. The previous 31 tornadoes in Long Island all occurred between June 1 and Sept. 27. In Connecticut, two other tornadoes were confirmed from Tuesday. One was an EF1 between New Canaan and Norwalk, which damaged trees and cars. The 17 confirmed tornadoes in Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut were the most tornadoes in those three states since June 2, 1998, according to ustornadoes.com. Nov. 16, 1989, with 18 tornadoes, was the only other fall day with more tornadoes in those states. Nationally, the number of preliminary tornado reports so far this year remain well below the average-to-date, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The National Weather Service reported Wednesday that 34 tornadoes were confirmed from Hurricane Florence.","The Weather Channel Pennsylvania Just Had Its Record October Tornado Outbreak, And It Was Its Most Tornadic Day in Over 20 Years The Weather Channel Tuesday's warm of tornadoes in parts of the Northeast set an October record in Pennsylvania.

"Matthew Cappucci, The Washington Post","Popular weather vendor AccuWeather took the meteorological community by storm Tuesday, releasing its highly specific outlook for the 2019 tornado season. ""AccuWeather predicts there will be 1,075 tornadoes in 2019,"" their piece begins, adding that Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and southern Nebraska have the highest risk of twisters this spring.
""The 525 tornadoes expected from March through May is almost exactly the normal average of 526 from March through May,"" AccuWeather wrote. In other words, they are expecting one less tornado than average in the spring. Many broadcast and private-sector meteorologists took issue with bold forecast.
""They are simply being very unscientific,"" wrote Scott Feldman, a meteorology graduate from Iowa State University. ""There is really no way to know . . . until a few days before a severe outbreak. It misleads the public into thinking we know more than we do so far in advance."" He said it undermines trust in meteorologists.
AccuWeather writes: ""We believe warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures over the Gulf of Mexico will lead to increased moisture transport from the Gulf over the region and ultimately a higher frequency of severe weather in these areas.""
Feldman noted warmth and moisture are among many ingredients needed to spin up a tornado and that there is little correlation between sea surface temperatures in April and May and tornado frequency in Oklahoma.
Among the leaders in the field of advanced tornado forecasts is John Allen, assistant professor of meteorology at Central Michigan University. He co-authored a paper in 2015 linking U.S. tornado counts to the El Nino/La Nina phase. While ""guidance . . . is feasible at leads up to 5 months,"" the article notes ""substantial variability . . . that may not be explainable.""
""I am extremely skeptical of Accuweather's decision to include a precise number of tornadoes in their forecast,"" Allen wrote to The Washington Post. ""There is no basis for such precision, as seasonal tornado counts are extremely difficult to predict.""
Allen names a number of factors that influence seasonal tornado tallies, including El Nino, Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures and seasonal wind shifts like the Madden-Julian Oscillation or the global wind oscillation.
""For the upcoming season, there is a weak El Nino event ongoing, which typically would imply the unstable conditions favorable to tornadoes being less likely over the Great Plains,"" Allen said. ""In contrast, the Gulf of Mexico is exceptionally warm, which would instead suggest more instability to be available over the U.S. Taken together, this suggests a forecast of mixed signals at best.""
Pinning things down to a single number or forecasting one less spring tornado than normal is indicative of a ""physical science basis that to me suggests little skill,"" Allen wrote.
A number of meteorologists urged AccuWeather to ""show their work"" in an effort to explain the science leading to their 1,075 tornado prediction. AccuWeather declined to discuss its methodology, stating it is a private company and that its methods were proprietary.
One Dallas television meteorologist called the post ""clickbait.""
The company issued a statement, saying ""AccuWeather is really proud of its 2019 tornado forecast. We have been in the prediction business for 57 years and have found that the powerful combination of utilizing all the tools and reliable indicators available, including the expertise of our over 100 expert meteorologists, results in predictions with the greatest accuracy.""
The Pennsylvania-based company stated ""we have the largest and most complete collection of weather data.""
Their article said ""four states have the highest risk this year,"" highlighting Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and southern Nebraska as a corridor for storms to brew. This is unsurprising, considering these four states average the most March - June tornadoes.
It is not the first time long-range forecasts have landed AccuWeather in the hot seat. It is known for its controversial 90-day forecasts, which calls for a high of 82 degrees and a 16 percent chance of rain on Memorial Day in Washington.
This far in advance, what can be said about the 2019 tornado season is limited. It is all the more reason to pay attention to forecasts when peak season rolls around.
""It only takes a single tornado impacting your house for your season to be above average,"" Allen said.","Popular weather vendor AccuWeather took the meteorological community by storm Tuesday, releasing its highly specific outlook for the 2019 tornado season.

Byline Manual,"This article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed &amp; Insights. In 2013, then congressman Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, stepped onto the floor of the House of Representatives and said these words : Mr. Speaker, global temperatures stopped rising 10 years ago. Global temperature changes when they exist correlate with Sun output and ocean cycles. During the Medieval Warm Period, from 800 to 1300 AD, long before cars, power plants, or the Industrial Revolution, temperatures were warmer than today. During the Little Ice Age, from 1300 to 1900 AD, temperatures were cooler. Neither of these periods were caused by any human activity. Even climate change alarmists admit that the number of hurricanes hitting the U.S. and the number of tornado touchdowns have been on a slow decline for over a hundred years. But here's what we absolutely know: We know that Oklahoma will have tornadoes when the cold jet stream meets the warm Gulf air. And we also know that this president spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning. This single, misleading statement, spoken in the wake of a deadly, devastating tornado outbreak in Oklahoma, was crafted with truths and mistruths. Perhaps it was uttered out of genuine misunderstanding of the scientific evidence on manmade climate change? Perhaps it was said out of ideological-driven political expediency? Regardless, it earned Bridenstine the brand of ""climate denier,"" an indelible mark that has been with him ever since, and made his recent confirmation as NASA administrator one of the most dramatic and controversial ever, for why should a science denier lead one of the world's leading scientific institutions? But now, just six weeks into his tenure as NASA administrator, Bridenstine stated that he has ""evolved"" on climate change. ""I don't deny the consensus,"" Bridenstine said at a NASA town hall meeting. ""I believe fully in climate change and that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way."" When asked why he changed his mind, Bridenstine told The Washington Post, ""I heard a lot of experts, and I read a lot. I came to the conclusion myself that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, that we've put a lot of it into the atmosphere, and therefore we have contributed to the global warming that we've seen."" Bridenstine has also backed up his rhetoric with vocal support for NASA's climate missions, which have been threatened under a Trump presidency. ""We spend over $100 million dollars annually … on carbon monitoring at NASA,"" Bridenstine told a small group of reporters at NASA's Washington D.C. headquarters. ""We're committed to that. And I'm committed to that."" Bridenstine's apparently genuine coming around to the facts of climate change is commendable and makes him a scientific hero of sorts. Too many scientific issues, most notably GMOs and climate change, are viewed through the lens of ideology. It's refreshing to see a politician publicly change his mind to move in line with scientific evidence. As Bridenstine has apparently shirked off his ideological blindfold, one wonders if his detractors will as well? A great many left-leaning scientists, science communicators, and politicians incessantly railed against Bridenstine during his protracted confirmation process, accusing him of climate change heresy and of lacking a background in science, despite the fact that one of NASA's greatest administrators, James Webb (who now has a telescope named after him), had even less relevant experience than Bridenstine. Bridenstine served as a pilot in the Navy and later was the executive director of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum. Some of Bridenstine's critics even turned on liberal favorite Bill Nye when he accompanied Bridenstine to Trump's State of the Union. One writer even lambasted Nye simply for congratulating Bridenstine when he was confirmed in April. Their bias and their message was clear: Don't engage with people with whom you disagree. Nye, who notably changed his mind on GMOs in 2016 (he's now proudly pro-GMO), wisely didn't listen. It's possible he even helped persuade Bridenstine to accept the scientific evidence on climate change. Jim Bridenstine's public acknowledgement of manmade climate change is a stirring example of how science transcends ideology. His actions should be celebrated and replicated.

The Associated Press,"Authorities say two small tornadoes touched down briefly in central Arkansas, downing power lines and destroying several buildings.
No injuries were reported.
National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Goudsward in Little Rock says an apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon near Carlisle, about 30 miles east of Little Rock and the second was near the unincorporated community of Slovak, about 13 miles southeast of Carlisle.
Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman says he had no immediate information of anyone hurt. But he says several power lines are down, at least one home was damaged and several buildings were destroyed. Goudsward said teams would be sent to assess the damage and determine the strength of the tornadoes.
Tornado watches are in effect for parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The weather service says those states face an ""enhanced risk"" for severe weather.
The storm comes just a week after a Southern tornado outbreak killed 23 people, all of them in a large Alabama twister.

But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a ""calculated political move"" by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

""If it's meaningful to them to have signatures in their Bible, I'm willing to do that,"" he said.
Trump visited Alabama on Friday to survey the devastation and pay respects to tornado victims. The tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family.

At the Providence Baptist Church in Smiths Station, Ala., the Rev. Rusty Sowell said, the president's visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.
Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grade volunteer and signed the child's Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. The president also signed her sister's Bible, Ingram said. In photos from the visit, Trump is shown signing the cover of a Bible.
Trump should have at least signed inside in a less ostentatious way, said the Rev. Dr. Kevin Cassiday-Maloney.

The Associated Press,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. —A tornado that splintered homes, killed 23 people and injured 90 more in Alabama was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when a twister near Oklahoma City killed 24 people.
The twister that struck Beauregard , Alabama, was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning at least 20 confirmed tornadoes in four states.
Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half. The tornado swept up and scattered the debris so widely that the metal frames of two of those homes could not even be located.
Church chaplain Ike Mathews checked on emergency workers who found some of the bodies .
""They're hurting. The community is torn up. They started crying talking about it,"" said Mathews, an associate pastor at Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church.

Search efforts are continuing but have been narrowed down to specific areas of concerns in the hardest hit areas, Jones said. Heavy equipment is being brought in to help move material during the search. Jones also confirmed that there hasnt been a single arrest made, to date, against suspected looters.
Assessment teams with the National Weather Service continue to update details on the twister, which is now considered an EF-4 with winds upwards of 175 mph. NWS Meteorologist in Charge Chris Darden had previously said the track indicated the tornado was nearly a mile wide.
Now, working with NWS offices in Georgia, theyve determined the tornado stayed on the ground for nearly 70 miles. Another tornado, classified as an EF-2, took a similar path from Macon County into Lee County and had a 29 mile path, Darden said.
And Darden revealed that another EF-2 tornado in neighboring Barbour County destroyed the NWSs equipment at the Eufaula Airport. That means much of the weather services radar capabilities during Sundays tornado outbreak depended heavily on equipment at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery. That radar system suffered a catastrophic failure just two weeks ago.
Had repairs not been expedited with crews working round the clock, its unclear how many more deaths could have resulted. Darden said without it, they may not have been able to see or track Sundays tornadoes.
Officials are working on putting together a long-term plan to continue recovery efforts and a smooth transition to more long-term support, according to Lee County EMA Director Kathryn Carson.
Many organizations have begun offering assistance to victims. The Lee County EMA has established a Volunteer Reception Center at Smith Station Baptist Church, (2460 Lee Road 430, Smiths Station) that will open Wednesday and will run from 10 a.m. though 5 p.m. Central, then from 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. daily starting Thursday. ALL VOLUNTEERS must report to this designated area for dispatch to areas in need. The minimum age for volunteers is 14 years old.The United Way will be operating the center and providing volunteers with arm bands that will grant them access through check points. The minimum age for volunteers is 14 years old.
Affiliate volunteers inside the state and outside the state should call the EMA office and then register their organization with 211. Volunteer organizations from outside the state should contact their local EMA office and they will correspond with Lee Countys EMA office.
Citizens should register their needs by calling 211. Volunteers and materials will be matched and will provide support to those who have registered.
Go to LeeCoEMA.com for a form to try and find a family or friend. Complete information: Address, phone number. Those without computer access can also call the EMAs office to try and locate someone.
There is a Red Cross Shelter at Providence Baptist Church and those in need are encouraged to take advantage. The Red Cross also has medicine available for people who have lost their homes.
Debris will be picked up if it is pushed along the county roadway. EMA officials ask that residents do not block ditches gutters and driveways. Debris should be separated by vegetated materials and larger items, such as appliances.
Each household can also collect two bags of ice per day in Opelika starting at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
MEDIA TOURS DAMAGED AREAS
Members of the media were escorted to the hardest hit area Tuesday morning, the Beauregard community.
Reporter Bethany Davis toured some of the damage and says its tough to imagine what happened in this area on Sunday. During Today in Alabama, she showed a home with only a foundation and kitchen counters left.
Pieces of the house, like the kitchen sink, doors, racks from the dishwasher, a bible, landed about 100 yards away, Bethany said.
Lee County deputies say the homeowner is currently recovering in a Birmingham Intensive Care Unit.
Donations have been pouring in for storm victims. Officials say they are currently overwhelmed with the response and are asking that donations be held onto until they can find a place to sort them.
The following are the current road closures from the Lee County Sheriffs Offices as of 9 a.m. Tuesday:
Lee Rd 38, Lee Rd 721, Hwy 51 between Lee Rd 11 and Hwy 80 will be southbound traffic only, no large trucks to include media will be allowed on Hwy 51 south of Lee Rd 11 unless they are utility workers, Lee Rd 294 between Lee Rd 430 and Lee Rd 293. During road closures only residents with ID, their immediate family members and utility crews will be allowed through, all others will be redirected. Travel on Lee Rd 11 and Lee Rd 166 is allowed both north and south bound. Please avoid Lee Rd 11 unless you are a resident or coming to Sanford Middle School to aid the first responders.","Names of 23 Lee County, AL tornado victims released WBRC Lee County, Alabama tornado: AERIALS raw video shows damage News 19 WLTX School prays for strength after fourth-grader dies in tornado Montgomery Advertiser Parents mourn daughter lost in Alabama tornad…",2019-03-05T16:52:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wbrc.com'}","Names of 23 Lee County, AL tornado victims released - WBRC",http://www.wbrc.com/2019/03/05/lee-county-officials-give-update-recovery-efforts/,http://www.wbrc.com/resizer/zO_Ig-12ZyNCpj5yIA12-2Ya94Y=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-raycom.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AHHGESW6EZBK5IUOZVFS3VDWSA.jpg,,Wbrc.com,tornado outbreak,1
Joe Peters,"WASHINGTON, March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he will visit Alabama on Friday, after weekend tornadoes in the southern state left 23 people dead.
Alabama search and rescue teams on Tuesday were going through the wreckage of houses flatted by tornadoes, looking for as many as eight people who remained unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. twister outbreak since 2013.
""It's been a tragic situation,"" Trump said at the White House before a ceremony on military veteran suicides. ""But a lot of good work is being done. I'm in constant touch with the governor and also the governor of Georgia.""

Mark Torregrossa | mtorregr@mlive.com,"Southern Lower Michigan is placed in an area where tornadoes could occur this evening and overnight. I've found three things that could help Michigan avoid tornadoes tonight. Of course, if these three things don't trend toward thwarting tornadic storms, we could have a few tornadoes tonight. The first weather feature that helps severe weather intensify is counterintuitive. Sunshine is a needed factor often for severe weather. Afternoon and evening sunshine heats the air, making air unstable and ready to rise into a severe thunderstorm. The satellite animation from late morning and early afternoon shows clouds are trying to thin across Lower Michigan. If you see a lot of sunshine this afternoon and evening, lean your expectations to more severe storms tonight, with a possible tornado. If the skies stay quite cloudy, temperatures will probably stay too cool to spark severe storms. In looking at the cloud trend above, sunshine is emerging. The second weather factor is an upper-air pattern that maybe out of sync with the on-the-ground severe weather factors. The upper-air winds have oval shaped segments that have stronger winds. These are called ""jet cores"" by us meteorologists. Here is the upper-air forecast at 8 p.m. tonight: The severe weather regions under the jetstream are not in a position to affect Lower Michigan at 8 p.m. tonight. At 2 a.m. tonight, a situation called a ""coupled jet"" is developing. That's where one part of a jetstream is situated to produce severe weather, and another part of a second jet core is also positioned to produce severe weather. But the coupled jet isn't quite put together just right at 2 a.m. At 8 a.m. Wednesday, the jetstream is put together just right for producing severe weather, but the unstable surface features will have already moved southeast of Michigan. This is why I'm calling it an out-of-sync situation. If the situation truly works out like this, we will probably avoid severe weather in Michigan this evening and tonight. The final item pointing against severe weather is a simple one- the timing of the storms. These thunderstorms are expected after sunset, and mostly in the middle of the night. Severe weather, including tornadoes, can happen in the middle of the night, but that's a rare situation. If you want to monitor the latest severe weather outlook for tonight, click here.

Nichole Manna,"A tornado watch is in effect until 10 p.m. for at least 34 counties in North and Central Texas and the First Responder Bowl in Dallas has been canceled.
The watch includes Clay, Jack, Parker, Hood, Palo Pinto, Erath, and Somervell counties. Tarrant County is not on the list. The full list can be found here.
In Tarrant County, a flood advisory has been issued for poor drainage areas. It will expire at 6:45 p.m. Fort Worth was in a severe thunderstorm warning for about 20 minutes. It expired at 4:45 p.m.
Scattered thunderstorms are likely Wednesday afternoon and evening mainly south of Interstate 20 and west of Interstate 35, according to the National Weather Service in Fort Worth.
Some storms may become severe with damaging winds as the main threat. Large hail and a few tornadoes are possible, along with flash flooding in some isolated areas. 
As of Wednesday afternoon, the biggest threat for severe storms exists south of Interstate 20.
The First Responder Bowl, which was scheduled in Dallas between Boise State and Boston College, was canceled as a result of the weather after a delay. It will be ruled a no contest.
Exactly three years ago, North and Central Texas experienced a tornado outbreak. Twelve confirmed twisters touched down in eight counties on this date. Thirteen people were killed. More than half were killed at the Interstate 30 and Highway 190 junction in eastern Dallas County.
The outbreak ranks third in the number of confirmed tornadoes in a 24-hour period in the month of December.
A 2015 Tornado Remembrance that was scheduled in Rowlett today was canceled because of the threat of severe weather.
Thunderstorms should clear up by midnight and Thursday will be sunny with a high near 50. Wind speeds will die down to 10 to 15 mph with some gusts as high as 25 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
Skies will remain clear until Saturday, when theres a 20 percent chance of rain. New Years Eve will bring more possibilities of rain with a high near 52.

Travis Fedschun,"As voters head to the polls on Tuesday to cast their votes in the midterm elections, some may need to pack more than an umbrella in parts of the country. While a large portion of the nation is expected to see fair weather on Election Day, the threat of severe weather, including tornadoes, is possible across the Southeast. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said that a system moving out of Arkansas will bring an ""enhanced risk"" of severe thunderstorms across northeastern Louisiana into Tennessee from Monday night into Tuesday. ""The best chance for large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes will be across southeastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, northwestern Alabama, through Tennessee and Kentucky,"" Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean said Monday. ""Heavy rain could cause flooding over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee River Valley."" Severe weather with the risk of large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes is possible across the Southeast from Monday into Election Day. (Fox News) Storms could target the cities of Memphis and Nashville in a state where Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is facing off against Democratic opponent businessman Phil Bredesen for a Senate seat. Further east, the National Weather Service's Atlanta office said that ""strong to severe thunderstorms"" could be possible in the early morning hours on Tuesday in northwest Georgia, and transitioning southeast as the day goes on. The forecast for Tuesday in states with key Senate races. (Fox News) ""Damaging wind gusts and brief tornadoes remain the primary expected severe threats,"" the NWS said. TOP 10 MOST SHOCKING MIDTERM ELECTION ADS: SIBLING BETRAYAL, RACIAL SLURS AND MORE The Peach State is where Georgia’s secretary of state and Republican gubernatorial hopeful Brian Kemp is locked in a close race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first black woman to serve as a U.S. governor. Fox News has rated the race as a “toss-up.” Besides the stormy South, a low-pressure system moving over the Great Lakes and an associated cold front will impact parts of the Midwest and Northeast. ""Rain and storms along the trailing cold front will keep the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast rainy and stormy for Election Day,"" Dean said. How could weather impact voters? Certain types of weather can be shown to have an impact on some voters in deciding whether or not to head to the polls, according to research compiled by AccuWeather. ""Weather was found to be, on average, nearly 20 percent of the change in voter turnout based on our analysis,"" AccuWeather Data Scientist and Meteorologist Tim Loftus said. ""Democrats are more weather sensitive, when compared to Republicans, and among the most weather-sensitive were African-Americans, those 65 and older and 18-24 year olds,"" he said. Studies have also shown that how far work or home is from a polling place could impact voter turnout if the weather isn't great, especially if people have to travel on roads that are affected by a storm. The type of weather can also be an issue, according to Dean. Besides roads that could be icy or snow-covered, people may be wary about waiting outside in lines to vote if there is severe weather in the forecast. In extreme cases, weather can cause a delay in an election. In Bay County, Fla., which was devastated by Hurricane Michael in early October, voters have been given one extra day to cast their ballots in the midterm election. Election officials have set up voting ""supercenters"" because traditional polling stations and the staff to run them, just don't exist after the storm tore through the area. ""Thankfully, our forecast Tuesday, for the most part, should not dissuade too many voters, especially across the Western half of the country,"" Dean said Monday. Fox News' Janice Dean and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.","Fox News Severe weather, rain may impact states with key races for Midterm Elections Fox News As voters head to the polls on Tuesday to cast their votes in the midterm elections, some may need to pack more than an umbrella in parts of the country.

Jennings Brown,"Martha Lillard spends half of every day with her body encapsulated in a half-century old machine that forces her to breathe. Only her head sticks out of the end of the antique iron lung. On the other end, a motorized lever pulls the leather bellows, creating negative pressure that induces her lungs to suck in air. In 2013, the Post-Polio Health International (PPHI) organizations estimated that there were six to eight iron lung users in the United States. Now, PPHI executive director Brian Tiburzi says he doesn’t know anyone alive still using the negative-pressure ventilators. This fall, I met three polio survivors who depend on iron lungs. They are among the last few, possibly the last three. Martha Lillard inside her iron lung, which has been modified by mechanics over the years. Photo: Jennings Brown for Gizmodo Their locations form a line that cuts directly through the heart of the country—one in Dallas, one outside Oklahoma City, and one in Kansas City, Missouri—what some call tornado alley. The human battery Storms have always been especially difficult for Lillard because if the iron lung loses power, she could die in her sleep. She lives alone, aside from three dogs and 20 geckos that she keeps in plastic terrariums filled with foliage and wool. “They like to sleep in the fleece, wrapped up like a burrito,” she said as she introduced me to a few of her favorites. Lillard sleeps in the iron lung, so it is in her bedroom. Even though the tank is a dull canary yellow it pops in the room, which is painted chartreuse—like the rest of the house, inside and out—and filled with toys and dolls that she has collected throughout her lifetime. On the walls hang a crucifix, a plush Pink Panther, and mirrors strategically placed so she can see around the room and into the hallway. Her iron lung has portholes and windows on the side; a pressure gauge at the top. The machine is actually cobbled together from two iron lungs. One, the March of Dimes gave her when she was a child. The other, she bought from someone in Utah, after she haggled him down from $25,000 to $8,000. The body has also been modified over the years. Her grandfather invented a motorized pulley system that closes the bed tray into the tank after she climbs in. He also replaced the brushed aluminum mirror above the neck slot with a real mirror so that she could have a clear view to the rest of the room when she’s locked in the canister. A local engineer used a motor from an old voter registration device to build a mechanism that tightens the collar around her neck after she slips her head through the portal. The fan belts and half-horsepower motor have been replaced about ten times. “It seemed like forever because you weren’t breathing. You just laid there and you could feel your heart beating.” When Lillard is outside of the tank, she can breathe using a positive-pressure ventilator, a smaller device that pushes air into her lungs. But that instrument doesn’t provide the same relief as when she puts her entire body into the 640-pound, 7-and-a-half-foot-long apparatus. Plus forcing air into the lungs can cause inflammation or damage the air sacs. When she’s sick, she can only heal if she spends full days in the iron lung. She calls herself “a human battery” because she has to recharge every day. Lillard is 69, 4-foot-9 and weighs 98 pounds. Her back is arched from scoliosis. She didn’t get surgery when she was a child because doctors didn’t expect her to make it to her teenage years and she never had an operation as an adult because polio survivors can stop breathing when they’re on anesthesia. She was infected with polio at her 5th birthday party at the Joyland Amusement Park in June 8th, 1953. Nine days later, her neck ached so bad she couldn’t raise her head off the pillow. Her parents said it was probably just a summer cold, but Lillard could tell they were afraid. They took her in for a spinal tap, which confirmed it was polio. Lillard asked me to take out a photo album so she could show me snapshots of her youth as she sat on a blanket on the floor of her living room, where it’s more comfortable for her to sit when she’s out of the machine. “I wanted to be a ballerina. That was my big wish. I started walking on my toes when I was one, and I just constantly was after ballerinas dolls. We didn’t have a dance school in town until I was five and my mom was going to enroll me that year, but I got sick,” she told me. “I think now of my life as a ballet. I have to balance so many things. It’s a phenomenal amount of energy I have to use to coordinate everything in my life.” Polio is a silver bullet “All the mothers were just terrified because people were just getting it right and left,” Lillard said. “They didn’t know if it was a virus or bacteria or how you caught it.” Poliomyelitis is a highly contagious disease that can cause paralysis of legs, arms, and respiratory muscles. “The polio virus is a silver bullet designed to kill specific parts of the brain,” Richard Bruno, a clinical psychophysiologist, and director of the International Centre for Polio Education said. “But parents today have no idea what polio was like, so it’s hard to convince somebody that lives are at risk if they don’t vaccinate.” When Lillard was a child, polio was every parent’s worst nightmare. The worst polio outbreak year in US history took place in 1952, a year before Lillard was infected. There were about 58,000 reported cases. Out of all the cases, 21,269 were paralyzed and 3,145 died. “They closed theaters, swimming pools, families would keep their kids away from other kids because of the fear of transmission,” Bruno said. Children under the age of five are especially susceptible. In the 1940s and 1950s, hospitals across the country were filled with rows of iron lungs that kept victims alive. Lillard recalls being in rooms packed with metal tubes—especially when there were storms and all the men, women, adults, and children would be moved to the same room so nurses could manually operate the iron lungs if the power went out. “The period of time that it took the nurse to get out of the chair, it seemed like forever because you weren’t breathing,” Lillard said. “You just laid there and you could feel your heart beating and it was just terrifying. The only noise that you can make when you can’t breathe is clicking your tongue. And that whole dark room just sounded like a big room full of chickens just cluck-cluck-clucking. All the nurses were saying, ‘Just a second, you’ll be breathing in just a second.’” In 1955, Americans finally had access to the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. “It was hailed as a medical miracle and the excitement about it was really unparalleled as far as health history in the United States,” Jay Wenger, director of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s polio-eradication effort told me. “No one who remember the 1950s, in terms of polio, wants to go back there and be in that situation again.” By 1961, there were only 161 reported cases in the US. But in 1988, there were still an estimated 350,000 cases worldwide. That year, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the Rotary Club began an aggressive campaign to end polio everywhere. Last year there were 37 cases reported in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. According to Bruno, if an infected person in either of those countries visited family in an area like Orange County, California, where many parents are opting out of vaccinating their children, “then we could be talking about the definition of a polio epidemic.” Wenger said that’s why the Gates Foundation recently joined the other organizations in the global effort to eradicate polio. “If there’s a virus anywhere in the world, it could just come back in,” Wenger said. “Some little kid could get on a plane and fly in and reinfect an area. And if the kids in that area are not vaccinated, you could start the virus circulating again.” But even though the last wild case of polio in the US was in 1979, it still haunts this country. “A lot of people think of polio as a disease of the past and don’t realize there are people here today that are still suffering the effects of polio.” said Brian Tiburzi, executive director of Post-Polio Health International (PPHI), an advocacy group for the estimated 350,000 to 500,000 polio survivors living in the US. “If there’s a virus anywhere in the world, it could just come back in.” Some polio survivors were only partially impaired or got better. For instance, Mia Farrow only had to spend eight months in an iron lung when she was nine, before going on to become a famous actress and polio advocate. And golfer Jack Nicklaus had symptoms for two weeks as a child, but as an adult only had sore joints. But many polio victims have breathing difficulties for the rest of their lives, or have issues later in life when overworked neurons burn out, a condition called post-polio syndrome. “I breathe 20 percent of what you breathe with every breath,” Lillard explained to me. “You still have the neurons that work the muscles that you breath with.” Let it breath for you Lillard offered to let me try out her iron lung about an hour after I met her. She showed me how to operate the ad hoc mechanisms that would lock me into the tank and tighten the collar around my neck like a camera shutter—tight enough that no air can escape, but loose enough that I don’t choke myself. I climbed into the bed tray, slipped my head through the hole, tightened the collar, then flipped the switch that controls the pulley that closes the tray into the main canister. As the system locked me in, I had a quick wave of claustrophobic panic and my instinct was to take deep breaths, but a motor was controlling that. I tried to describe the feeling to Lillard, but the machine was inhaling for me, so no sound came out. I had to wait a moment for the release. “Let the air out of your lungs and let it breath for you,” Lillard said. “Imagine if you were real tired of breathing, how good that would feel—if you were struggling to take a breath.” Being in an iron lung was the most relief and discomfort I have ever felt at the same time. I slowly got used to the mechanical rhythm and began feeling a little relaxed. I tried closing my mouth, and air still rushed in through my lips. I felt like a vacuum cleaner. As I climbed out, Lillard warned me to be careful and not break any of the switches or pulleys. If I damaged anything, and she wasn’t able to get someone to repair it within a few hours, she might not have made it through the night. A few weeks earlier, the collar-opener broke and she was trapped inside. Fortunately, her housekeeper was there to help her force it open, and a friend who does custom metal fabrication for motorcycles, planes, and other machines, Tony Baustert, came a few hours later to repair it. Recently, an ice storm knocked her power out for three days and the generator malfunctioned. The fire department came over but they wouldn’t run a power line from down the street or provide a temporary generator, Lillard said. Fortunately, one of the firefighters came by when he was off-duty and fixed the generator. During the panic, Lillard thought about Dianne Odell, a polio survivor who died in her iron lung in Memphis in 2008, after she lost power during a storm. Her father and brother-in-law took turns pumping the bellows by hand but couldn’t sustain the rhythm long enough to keep her alive. Understandably, Lillard lives in a constant state of anxiety over the functionality of her iron lung. But she said the company responsible for servicing the device, Philips Respironics, hasn’t been much help. She recalls one time when a repair person disassembled the machine to make a repair, then tried to leave before putting it back together. Another technician took it apart and couldn’t figure out how to fix it, so Lillard had to call another mechanically skilled friend, Jerry House, to help. These days her biggest concern is the canvas spiral collar that creates the seal around her neck. She used to have to replace them every few months after they wore out and stopped keeping a seal. Back then she could get them for a few dollars each, but she recently bought two from Respironics for a little more than $200 each. She said the company wouldn’t sell her any more because they only have ten left. For years she’s been trying to find someone to make a new collar. She uses Scotch guard on her current supply and tries not to move her neck around, hoping to make them last as long as possible. I asked her what happens if she runs out. “Well, I die,” she said, in a matter-of-fact tone. Iron lungs became the responsibility of Philips through mergers and acquisitions. The March of Dimes supplied and serviced iron lungs until the end of the ‘60s, around the same time the J.H. Emerson company stopped manufacturing the product. Once Salk’s vaccine diminished the need for polio support and advocacy, March of Dimes handed off iron lung responsibilities to Lifecare Services. Medical supply company Respironics acquired Lifecare in 1996, then merged with Philips in 2007. Over the years, Lifecare and Respironics have tried to get more polio survivors to use alternative breathing aids—devices that were newer, cheaper, easier to service, and didn’t require parts that were no longer manufactured. In 2004, Respironics gave iron lung users three options: transition to another ventilator device, keep using the iron lung but know that Respironics may not be able to repair the device, or accept full ownership and responsibility of the iron lung and find someone else to repair it. According to the Post-Polio Health International, responses “ranged from ‘it is understandable that repairing a device made that long ago would be difficult’ to ‘a multi-million dollar company should be able to just make parts.’” Philips Respironics denied multiple requests to comment for this story. But polio advocates believe the company can do more to help polio survivors who have struggled with the effects of polio their entire lives. “It would be helpful if the people who are contractually responsible and morally and ethically responsible for polio survivors did something to help these people,” said International Centre for Polio Education director Richard Bruno. “It would be like if you bought a used car, you drove it a block and the car stopped working. Then you go back to the car dealer and you say, ‘Hey, the car stopped working.’ And they say, ‘Well too bad, you bought it and that’s the way life goes.’ Except instead of a car it’s a machine that you need to live.” The iron lung’s a part of me Like Lillard, Paul Alexander, 70, also relies on a mechanic to keep his iron lung running. Alexander writes his memoir using a pen attached to a stick. Photo: Jennings Brown for Gizmodo I met Alexander a few times in his small house in Dallas. He spends nearly every moment in his iron lung in the center of his living room, which is decorated with degrees, awards, pictures of family, and a drawing of the Scottish folk singer Donovan, who had polio. When people enter the front door a few feet away from him, he usually greets them with a warm upside-down smile, reflected in the mirror above his head. One of the times I visited Alexander, I walked in on him editing a memoir that’s set to be published in a few months. He types and answers the phone with his mouth, using a capped pen attached to a plastic wand he clenches with his teeth. During another visit, his friend and mechanical savior Brady Richards stopped by the check in on Alexander. Alexander, who got polio in 1952 when he was 5, is almost entirely paralyzed below the neck but that hasn’t stopped him from going to law school and becoming a trial lawyer. “When I transferred to University of Texas, they were horrified to think that I was going to bring my iron lung down, but I did, and I put it in the dorm, and I lived in the dorm with my iron lung,” he told me. “I had a thousand friends before it was over with, who all wanted to find out what’s that guy downstairs with a head sticking out of a machine doing here?” Alexander hasn’t been to a trial in a few years now as it has become nearly impossible for him to get out of the iron lung for a few hours like he used to do when he went to court and represented clients in a wheel chair. In 2015, a friend of Alexander uploaded a YouTube video of Alexander explaining the issues he was having with his iron lung, hoping it would be seen by a machinist who knew how to repair the respirator. Finally someone connected Alexander with someone kind and skilled enough to help. “I looked for years to find someone who knew how to work on iron lungs,” Alexander said. “Brady Richards, it’s a miracle that I found him.” Richards runs the Environmental Testing Laboratory, which does rigorous testing to make sure equipment and products meet environmental standards (everything from checking if a TV mount is earthquake proof to checking how an ambulance will handle a T-bone collision). In one of Richard’s garages, he keeps his side projects—hot rods, desert race cars, and a small collection of iron lungs and parts. This is where Richards refurbished the current machine that Alexander uses and where he is fixing up another replacement. “When we first brought the tube into the shop, one of my younger employees asked me what I was doing with these smoker grills,” Richards said. “And I was like these are not smokers, these are iron lungs. And all my younger guys had no idea what that meant.” Alexander had been in the refurbished model for about a couple months when I first met with him in September. To him, it was like a new skin. “Once you live in an iron lung forever, it seems like, it becomes such a part of your mentality. Like if somebody touches the iron lung—touches it—I can feel that. I can feel the vibration go through the iron lung,” he said. “If there’s a slight bit of a vibration that occurs as the result of the mechanics—worn out the fan belt or it needs grease or anything like that—it tends to change the breath slightly. Yep, the iron lung’s a part of me, I’m afraid.” My worst thought My final visit was Mona Randolph, 81, who lives with her husband Mark, 63, in Kansas City, Missouri. When I first arrived, a helper was tucking Mona into the machine for the night. They lift Mona into the iron lung using a mechanical arm attached to their ceiling since Mark’s back problems prevent him from lifting her into the iron lung, like he used to do when they first met in the ‘80s. Mona got polio at the age of 20 in 1956. At the time, she was a skilled pianist planning her wedding. She needed an iron lung for the first year, until she went to rehab in Warm Spring, Georgia, where she was able to wean herself off. But 20 years later, in 1977, she had a series of bronchial infections—possibly due to post-polio syndrome—and her doctors told her she needed to start using an iron lung again. “The ‘yellow submarine’ is my necessary, trusted, mechanical friend,” she told me. “I approach it with relief in store at night and thankfully leave it with relief in the morning.” Mona is covered under Mark’s insurance and Medicare, but neither of those help with the iron lung or the caretakers that Mona needs. The Randolphs opted to take full ownership of the iron lung when Respironics was making its big push to offload them. Since then, Mark, a software engineer who has many other engineer skills, and Mona’s cousin, a former aircraft mechanic, have maintained and repaired Mona’s “yellow submarine.” Mark said the medical costs are about the same as a new car every year, “But what would I spend it on if not for Mona.” When I met with the Randolphs, Mark gave me photocopies of old service manuals and operating instructions. He filled me in on little-known history about the Emerson iron lung and its inventor, whom they met at a Post-Polio convention. I realized what each of these iron lung users have in common are the aid of generous, mechanically skilled friends and family. And that’s probably the main reason they’ve been able to live long and full lives, despite the hardships and anxieties of depending on aging machinery to survive. But another thing they all had in common is a desire for the next generations to know about them so we’ll realize how fortunate we are to have vaccines. “When Children inquire what happened to me, I tell them the nerve wires that tell my muscles what to do were damaged by a virus,” Mona said. “And ask them if they have had their vaccine to prevent this. No one has ever argued with me.” Alexander told me that if he had kids he would have made sure they were vaccinated. “Now, my worst thought is that polio’s come back,” he said. “If there’s so many people who’ve not been—children, especially—have not been vaccinated... I don’t even want to think about it.” Lillard is heartbroken when she meets anti-vaccine activists. “Of course, I’m concerned about any place where there’s no vaccine,” she said. “I think it’s criminal that they don’t have it for other people and I would just do anything to prevent somebody from having to go through what I have. I mean, my mother, if she had the vaccine available, I would have had it in a heartbeat.”","Martha Lillard spends half of every day with her body encapsulated in a half-century old machine that forces her to breathe.

bgriffiths@politico.com (Brent D. Griffiths),"President Donald Trump speaks during a visit to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters on Aug. 4, 2017 in Washington. | Michael Reynolds - Pool/Getty Images
President Donald Trump announced Friday night that he would nominate Jeffrey Byard to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency, after FEMA head Brock Long abruptly resigned earlier this week.
Currently FEMA's associate Administrator for Response and Recovery, Byard is the agency's ""senior-most executive over disaster response, recovery, logistics, and field operations,"" according to a White House statement. Before joining FEMA in September 2017, he served in multiple positions in the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, including as executive operations officer.
Story Continued Below
Byard led Alabama's large-scale state evacuation during Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and handled the state's response and recovery operations for the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill. In 2011, he dealt with one of the country's largest and costliest tornado outbreaks when the so-called Super Outbreak hit Alabama and also pummeled neighboring Tennessee, Georgia and Mississippi. 
Byard's tenure in Alabama overlapped former administrator Long, who served as head of Alabama's state agency from 2008 to 2011. 
Long led FEMA through the 2017 hurricane season that inundated Texas with a record amount of rain and later led to state emergencies in Florida and Puerto Rico. During his term, Long came under criticism for his personal use of federal vehicles. He later reimbursed the government after an investigation.

Trump also appointed a new ambassador to Turkey on Friday night. David Michael Satterfield is a career diplomat who has served as the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs since 2017. Before his most recent appointment, Satterfield has amassed a long diplomatic career with stops in Italy, Libya, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon. 
The appointment comes at a key moment in the region as the president wants to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and declare victory over the Islamic State.

Associated Press,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a deadly tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.
Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn't have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.
""Though we don't have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it's not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,"" he said. ""Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.""
But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a ""calculated political move"" by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.
Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.
It would have been different, Anderson said, if Trump had signed a Bible out of the limelight for someone with whom he had a close connection.
""For me, the Bible is a very important part of my faith, and I don't think it should be used as a political ploy,"" she said. ""I saw it being used just as something out there to symbolize his support for the evangelical community, and it shouldn't be used in that way. People should have more respect for Scripture.""
York said that he, personally, would not ask a politician to sign a Bible, but that he has been asked to sign Bibles after he preaches. It feels awkward, he said, but he doesn't refuse.
""If it's meaningful to them to have signatures in their Bible, I'm willing to do that,"" he said.
Trump visited Alabama on Friday to survey the devastation and pay respects to tornado victims. The tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family.
At the Providence Baptist Church in Smiths Station, Alabama, the Rev. Rusty Sowell said, the president's visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.
Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grade volunteer and signed the child's Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. The president also signed her sister's Bible, Ingram said. In photos from the visit, Trump is shown signing the cover of a Bible.
Trump should have at least signed inside in a less ostentatious way, said the Rev. Dr. Kevin Cassiday-Maloney.
""It just felt like hubris,"" said Cassiday-Maloney, pastor at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Fargo, North Dakota. ""It almost felt like a desecration of the holy book to put his signature on the front writ large, literally.""
He doesn't think politicians should sign Bibles, he said, because it could be seen as a blurring of church and state and an endorsement of Christianity over other religions.
It would have been out of line if Trump had brought Bibles and given them out, but that wasn't the case, said James Coffin, executive director of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida.
""Too much is being made out of something that doesn't deserve that kind of attention,"" he said.
Bill Leonard, the founding dean and professor of divinity emeritus at the Wake Forest University School of Divinity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, woke up to Facebook posts Saturday morning by former students who were upset about Trump signing the Bibles because they don't view him as an appropriate example of spiritual guidance.
But, Leonard said, it's important to remember that signing Bibles is an old tradition, particularly in southern churches.
Leonard said he would have viewed it as more problematic if the signings were done at a political rally. He doesn't see how Trump could have refused at the church.
""It would've been worse if he had said no because it would've seemed unkind, and this was at least one way he could show his concern along with his visit,"" he said. ""In this setting, where tragedy has occurred and where he comes for this brief visit, we need to have some grace about that for these folks.""

Chelsea Huang,"A severe thunderstorm outbreak is likely over the central Unites States next week with the risk of damaging storms on multiple days in parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley. The threat will begin a couple of days after a major warmup begins. The first thunderstorms may occur this weekend over the southern High Plains and Rockies. More storms are likely Monday and Tuesday from parts of the central and northern High Plains to the Upper Midwest. While these early-week storms may not be intense, they can bring locally strong wind gusts, hail and isolated flash flooding. A push of cooler, drier air may sweep in behind the early-week storms over part of the North Central states and southern High Plains. The cool push could protect these areas from more violent storms that may erupt later in the week farther to the south and east. At this time, the general area of concern for dangerous and damaging thunderstorms, including the possibility of tornadoes, is likely to extend from central Texas to perhaps as far to the north as Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois, according to AccuWeather Storm Warning Meteorologist Brian Knopick. ""Not everyone in this zone may experience severe weather,"" Knopick said. This event is not likely to rank high on the list of the worst severe weather outbreaks in U.S. history for the region. There have been some very violent outbreaks in the past. However, it has the potential to be the most significant of the year so far in areas that have had a minimal amount severe weather. All it takes is for one tornado out of a handful to hit a developed, populated area to threaten lives and property. People should take any advanced alert of severe weather seriously. Smack in the middle of the severe weather threat area for next week may be Kansas and Oklahoma, which have not yet had their first tornado of the season. On average, the peak months for tornadoes in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Central states are May and June. While there is the potential for tornadoes from the storms during the middle of the week, more common characteristics from the storms are likely to be damaging wind gusts, large hail and frequent lightning strikes, as well as the potential for isolated flash flooding. The end of the week may bring the greatest threat of severe thunderstorms, isolated tornadoes and flash flooding to portions of the middle and lower Mississippi Valley as well as the upper Gulf coast. Whether or not the main severe weather event commences on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday over the central and southern Plains will depend on the speed a storm in the upper atmosphere and its associated cool air emerges from the Desert Southwest. ""Timing when upper-level storms roll out from the Southwest can be tricky,"" according to AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Elliot Abrams. ""A great deal of the forecast during any time of the year ranging from severe weather to snowstorms for the Plains and Mississippi Valley is highly contingent on that timing."" People in the region should continue to monitor forecasts leading up to the event and have a plan of action in place ahead of the storms. AccuWeather meteorologists will continue to study the setup and adjust the timing and severity of the situation as necessary in the days ahead. Regardless of the timing of severe weather, warmth will last a few days in the Midwest and most of the week across the South Central and Eastern states as cooler air lunges across the Rockies.

Leada Gore | lgore@al.com,"A round of severe weather including the potential for tornadoes is expected to roll into the state tonight, possibly impacting Alabamas General Election. Secretary of State John Merrill said his office is closely monitoring the weather situation and will release contingency plans if conditions warrant. If severe weather does break out, it wont be the first time tornadoes have impacted an election day in the South. From Feb. 5-6, 2008, 87 tornadoes tore through the nine states in a 15-hour span from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday, killing 57 people and injuring 425 more. The tornadoes occurred on or just after Super Tuesday, when 24 states, including Alabama, were holding presidential primaries. The timing of the storms forced the Secretaries of State to close polls early in Arkansas and Tennessee. Despite watches and growing concerns about the weather, polls remained open in Alabama. Then-Sen. Barack Obama won the state for Democrats; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was the choice of state Republicans, with eventual GOP nominee John McCain finishing second. The storms didnt hit Alabama until the wee hours of Wednesday morning but the results were deadly. An EF-4 storm with peak winds of 170 mph touched down on Feb. 6 around 3 a.m. in Lawrence County before traveling to Morgan County near the town of Trinity. According to the National Weather Service in Huntsville, the tornado spanned about half a mile wide and stayed on the ground for almost 17 miles. Four people three from the same family - were killed and numerous homes and buildings were damaged. Another EF-4 hit Jackson County, roaring through the communities of Rosalie and Pisgah as it stayed on the ground for nearly 11 miles. One person was killed in the storm, which touched down shortly before 5:30 a.m. Two weaker tornadoes occurred in Marshall and Cullman counties. A later analysis by the National Weather Service showed intensive coverage of the election didnt prevent severe weather messages from being delivered. This event occurred during Super Tuesday for the Presidential primaries. Coverage of primary election results appeared to have little negative impact on the dissemination of warnings from the media. Television stations went to wall-to-wall continuous storm coverage as the event unfolded in their broadcast area and suspended any ongoing election coverage, NWS said. Deadliest day until 2011 Ten of the Super Tuesday tornadoes were deadly, with five classified as EF4s; One tornado made a 122-mile track through north-central Arkansas, the longest single track since record-keeping began in 1950. At the time, the Super Tuesday storm was the worst tornado outbreak since 1985, a record eclipsed by the 2011 Super Tornado outbreak that killed 348 people. The Weather Channel has ranked the Super Tuesday outbreak as the seventh worst overall in U.S. history.","AL.com Election day 2018 weather: In 2008, Super Tuesday tornadoes killed 57 people, 5 in Alabama AL.com Tornadoes cut a path across the Southeast on Feb. 5-6, killing 57 people, including 5 in Alabama.

Travis Fedschun,"The month of May got off to a destructive start across portions of the Great Plains on Tuesday, after multiple tornadoes were reported across portion of Kansas and Oklahoma. Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported across the region, but no major damage was reported, according to Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean. ""Thankfully no one is hurt and we don't have any deaths because it happened sort of out in farmland, which is where we like the tornadoes to stay, but unfortunately as we go throughout the afternoon and the evening hours we could see the potential again today for tornadoes,"" Dean said Wednesday on "" Fox &amp; Friends."" ""This could actually be a more destructive day."" The threat for large hail, damaging winds, and potentially violent tornadoes continues Wednesday across the Central Plains. (Fox News) The National Weather Service said a ""likely"" tornado in northwestern Oklahoma ended that state's record start to the year without a twister. Meteorologist John Pike told the Associated Press the funnel cloud captured on video by KOCO-TV Tuesday afternoon near Buffalo, about 150 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, has not yet been confirmed as a tornado. Harper County Emergency Management Director the only known damage is a tree that was blown down onto a road. The previous record for the latest, first tornado at the start of a year in Oklahoma was April 26, set in 1962. A THREE DAY SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK IS UNDERWAY ACROSS THE PLAINS Further north in Kansas, multiple tornadoes were reported across the central and northern parts of the state with only minor damage reported. The largest tornado was one with multiple vortexes and hit in a rural area south of Concordia in the north-central part of the state, according to the Wichita Eagle. Video showed the tornado taking shape and moving across the countryside. A home located near Tescott in Ottawa County sustained damage from the tornado, but no injuries were reported, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Tuesday’s tornadoes were the first of the year for Kansas, which hadn't reached May without a tornado since 1980. More severe weather, including tornadoes, is possible later Wednesday with strong storms developing in mid-afternoon in western Oklahoma and moving north and east, according to the weather service.

Seven members of one family were among the 23 victims identified after an outbreak of tornadoes devastated the US state of Alabama, officials have said.
Every victim, including four children, were found in close proximity to their homes, rescue crews say.
The victims range in age from six to 89, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference.
Up to eight people remain missing, officials say, and there are fears that the death toll could rise.
""We believe that every victim was in the residence when it hit. They all ended up, with the exception of two, outside the residence,"" Mr Harris told reporters, adding that their homes ""aren't there"".

He added that one survivor lost seven members of his family, and warned that he may be facing ""financial issues"" because of multiple funeral costs.
""They're going to have seven funerals that they have to finance somehow,"" he said, adding that donors have been reaching out to help the family with the expenses.
The tornadoes struck eastern Alabama on Sunday, levelling homes and carving a path of at least a half mile (0.8km) wide in some parts of the state. 
'Nature at its worst'

 About 50 structures have been reduced to rubble
Chris Buckler, BBC News, in Beauregard
On the edge of where the tornado struck, there is the constant buzzing of chainsaws as they try to clear up the hundreds of fallen trees.
But up in the Beauregard neighbourhood which was directly in its path, there is silence. Where once there were homes there is now what can only be described as an emptiness. All of the buildings have been levelled and from the road it's difficult to see that a community was once even here. 
There's no doubt that some of the most striking images are the cars, which have been smashed, overturned and in one case actually wrapped around a tree.
When you wander through what was a garden and look through the flattened remains, you discover the remnants of people's lives. Single shoes, an iron and what looks like an old schoolbag. 
There are a few figures wandering around amid all of the devastation looking numb and bewildered. At times they seem to be struggling to remember what was once here on this flattened landscape.
Frederick Franklin was standing by the debris of one house, trying to piece together where the rooms once stood from the foundations of the building.
""It was my brother's fiancé's place,"" he told me. ""She and one of her brothers were killed in it. You can't describe it. This is nature at its worst.""

Temperatures dropped below freezing on Tuesday as volunteer crews sorted through debris, looking for survivors and the bodies.
On Monday, weather officials upgraded the fatal twister that hit Lee County to EF-4 with wind speeds of 170 mph (275km/h).
Almost 50 people were injured and numerous homes and businesses were reduced to rubble as multiple tornadoes touched down in south-east Alabama and Georgia on Sunday.
During Tuesday's briefing, an official with the National Weather Service said the deadliest tornado had travelled for about 70 miles, and another nearby one travelled for 29 miles.
Bags of ice and medications are being made available to residents, who have been told they should start bringing debris out to the street for it to be removed by county rubbish crews.
Some residents who narrowly survived the onslaught have travelled to shelters to lend a hand and donate goods.
""I had a friend who lost his life, and just my heart spoke,"" Stephanie Griffith tearfully told WVTM-TV as she dropped off supplies at a shelter in Lee County. 
""So I went through my home this morning I got things that I'm not going to use and I know they'll be needed here.""
Members of the Auburn University football team, the Tigers, were on hand on Monday to help distribute food and water at emergency shelters.
Alabama State Trooper Robert Burroughs is in the intensive care unit of a local hospital in ""serious condition"", police said.
He and his wife Sandi lost their home in Sunday's storm.
""Troopers have a strong sense of camaraderie and will surround the Burroughs family at this time and offer support both short and long term,"" said Cpl Jess Thornton.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he planned to visit the region on Friday.
""It's been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done,"" he told reporters at the White House.
How did people survive?
Evony Wilson, 44, received a weather alert for the tornado that then tore through her mother's home at about 14:00 local time on Sunday. She told her mother and son to run to the bathroom, where all three generations piled on the bathroom floor to weigh each other down.""That's when everything started shaking. It was so strong,"" Mrs Wilson told BBC News. ""I held my son's hand as he was yelling 'I don't want to die!' My mom just kept reminding us to pray.""
She said that after the winds lifted, her home was ""no longer recognisable"" and was ""in shreds"".
Her elderly mother, who requires an oxygen tank, suffered a broken hip and fractured her ankle, but was grateful to have escaped.
Other residents hid in bathtubs in homes without basements, sometime with mattresses pulled over themselves.

""We knew we were flying because it picked the house up,"" Julie Morrison told the Associated Press (AP), adding that they thought they had survived because of the fibre-glass that their home is made from.
Greg Molinari told AL.com that he and his wife would have died if not for a text message from their daughter-in-law.
""She said get in the bathroom and put pots on your head. And we did put big cooking pots over our head. Saved our lives,"" said Mr Molinari. 
""The ceiling crashed in on us.""
Who were the victims?
Carol Dean told the AP that the body of her husband David Dean, 53, was found by their son on a nearby embankment after the storm had passed.
""He was done and gone before we got to him,"" she said on Monday. ""My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.""

Darby Bybee,"A Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch has been issued for our Eastern counties in our Arkansas Viewing area: Johnson, Logan, Scott and Polk Counties. This goes until 10:00 p.m. A PDS Tornado Watch is a rare advisory, issued by the Storm Prediction Center, only when there is an expectation of particularly strong tornadoes. This is the SPC telling us, ""the storms that form within this watch area could get dangerous, very quickly."" But, the bottom line is... we need to be on our toes all across the 40/29 viewing area, despite the fact that the greatest threat for strong tornadoes looks higher the farther east you go, especially in central Arkansas. Again, the PDS Tornado Watch only includes Johnson, Logan, Scott and Polk counties, and on into central AR. We'll continue to watch it closely. Chief Meteorologist Darby Bybee 1pm, Friday UPDATE: A Tornado Watch has been issued for Northwest Arkansas, parts of the River Valley (including Sebastian, Crawford and Franklin counties) and Eastern Oklahoma until 10:00 p.m. It still looks like we'll seespotty severe storms in parts of Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley thisafternoon... thru about 11pm. Primary threat still looks tobe large hail, but, a few damaging wind gusts and tornadoes will also bepossible. Stay tuned to 40/29 for all the latest. Chief Meteorologist DarbyBybee 10:26am, Friday UPDATE: The latest update from the Storm Prediction Center does clearly reflect what we are seeing in our latest models... the greatest threat for severe storms this afternoon and tonight will likely be in central and southern Arkansas. It's good news for the folks in our viewing area, and bad news for our friends and neighbors to the SE. But, it doesn't mean the threat no longer exists for us either. Far from it. We still expect spotty showers and storms to move in as we go into the afternoon. A few of which could quickly turn severe, especially along and east of a line from Springdale to Fort Smith. This activity will then spread into central AR, where the storms will further mature and expand in coverage. This is why areas to the south and east were placed under the Moderate risk. This is where a full line of intense storms could develop, effecting far more people. It's actually a very common occurrence with systems like this, as a natural boundary sets up along the path of these storms, at the edge of the Ouachita and Ozark mountains, from SW to NE. And it's a scenario we knew could play out, to our benefit. I say this, because as widespread thunderstorms develops to our east, it will often limit how much severe activity can develop behind it, to the west... in our area. But, remember, every situation is different. And we'll still need to be carefully watching the storms that do develop over Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. Especially those that form along the front, as it pushes in this evening and overnight. These frontal storms will be capable of all modes of severe weather, especially hail, in both Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. So, here are a few important take-aways: -Watch for a few strong to severe storms this afternoon, especially along and east of a line from Springdale to Fort Smith -We'll then have to watch the storms that could develop along the front this evening and tonight, which could effect any part of our area, but, are likely to be most intense in eastern OK and the western most counties of Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley (Benton, Washington, Crawford, Franklin, Sebastian and Scott) -All modes of severe still possible, with large hail being the most likely -Threat should be mostly over in our area by midnight Chief Meteorologist Darby Bybee -------------------------------------------------------------------- 7:00am, Friday UPDATE: The Storm Prediction Center has maintained the enhanced risk for much of Arkansas. We've seen a few spotty showers across the area this morning, but the majority of activity will occur later this evening after 1 p.m. Storm coverage is the big question as the lightning and thunder gets underway first in eastern Oklahoma. Those storms will push east throughout the afternoon with another burst of storms later in the evening. The strongest storms are likely to include large hail and damaging winds and we'll be keeping an eye out for a few tornadoes. Stay with 40/29 News for the latest updates throughout Friday. Our team of meteorologists is working around the clock to give you the latest information. Meteorologists Laura Huckabee &amp; Brendan Johnson --------------------------------------------------------------------- 4:26pm, Thursday UPDATE: Not a lot of changes to the forecast. It still looks like we'll see a few spotty showers and thunderstorms developing across Arkansas and Oklahoma Friday morning, but, most of this will remain below severe thresholds. The bulk of the severe threat still looks to be in the afternoon and evening, between 1pm and 11pm. It appears we'll see a round of scattered strong to severe storms in Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley between mid and late afternoon, with a second round possible during the evening hours. And keep in mind these storms will be fairly spotty in nature over our area. So, there will be those who get missed by most of this, while others could get hit pretty hard. The primary threat from the strongest storms still looks to be large hail (a few could be baseballs or bigger). But, damaging winds and a few tornadoes will certainly be possible. By 11pm, the threat should be completely out of our area. We'll keep watching it closely and have more updates in the newscasts. Chief Meteorologist Darby Bybee --------------------------------------------------------------------- 8:30 am, Thursday UPDATE: Although the Storm Prediction Center can, and often does, redraw the boundaries for the RISK Categories before a severe weather event... there hasn't been much of a change on the Convective Outlook for Friday. Most of our area is under an ENHANCED RISK of severe weather tomorrow. As Darby mentioned, our severe weather threats will be gusty (or damaging) winds, large hail, and possibly isolated tornadoes. Ahead of tomorrow's showers and storms, we are in store for one windy Thursday! Winds will be out of the south today at 10-20 mph -- but those wind gusts will easily be 25 to 30 mph initially... then 30 to 35 mph (plus) moving into the late afternoon and evening. Laura Huckabee / Meteorologist -------------------------------------------------------------------- 12:30pm, Wednesday UPDATE: Eastern Oklahoma and the entire western half of Arkansas is now highlighted in the ""Enhanced"" risk by the SPC, for the threat of severe storms on Friday. There is no question this system will have a great deal of potential to produce storms capable of very large hail, damaging winds and a few tornadoes. All the ingredients are there. Exactly how many nasty storms develop... and exactly where they occur... will hinge heavily on how active Friday morning is. Certainly a few morning storms could turn strong, but, any areas hit by a lot of rain early in the day may never reach peak instability in the afternoon/evening. Regardless, there is potential for an outbreak of severe storms in Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. So, be prepared now. Make sure you and your family have a plan... for when the kids are are at school, when you're at work and when everyone is at home. Try to think of every possible scenario. Remember, when severe weather strikes, you want to be in a sturdy structure, low to the ground, and as interior as possible. It's almost always best to shelter in place. So, look around your work and home for a good spot to go to, if a Tornado Warning is issued. As always, we'll be on top of it, and providing all the info you and your family will need over the air. Of course, we will be supplementing the on air coverage with fb lives on Friday, too. Chief Meteorologist Darby Bybee -------------------------------------------------------------------- 5:09pm, Tuesday UPDATE: We do have a good chance for showers and storms on Friday.

Kim Chandler,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Rescuers searched for victims Monday amid homes smashed to their foundations, shredded metal dangling from trees and dead animals lying in the open after a tornado ripped through a rural Alabama community and killed at least 23 people, including children.
Traveling straight down a county road, the twister carved a trail of destruction at least half a mile wide and about a mile long Sunday, overwhelming the Lee County coroners office, which was forced to call in help from the state.
It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground, Sheriff Jay Jones said.
With daybreak, volunteers used chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers, and at the R&amp;D Grocery, people were constantly asking each other if they were OK.
Im still thanking God Im among the living, said John Jones, who has lived most of his life in Beauregard, an unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people about 60 miles east of Montgomery near the Georgia state line.
The twister, with winds believed to be around 160 mph (257 kph) or higher, was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
All we could do is just hold on for life and pray, said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their Beauregard trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. Its a blessing from God that me and my youngns are alive.
He added: Everybody in Beauregard is a real close-knit family. Everybody knows everybody around here. Everybody is heartbroken.
The sheriff said children were among the dead, but he didnt know how many. And he said the death toll may rise as the search continues amid houses reduced to their concrete slabs.
Levi Baker took a chain saw to help clear a path for ambulances and other emergency vehicles. He said he saw dead people and animals and demolished houses, with one home swept off its foundation and left in the middle of a road.
Along the hard-hit country road, giant pieces of metal from a farm building dangled from pine branches 20 feet (6 meters) in the air, making loud creaking sounds as the wind blew. For an entire mile down the road, pines were snapped in half.
A mobile home crushed by two trees marked the end of the path of destruction.
The National Weather Service said the tornado was rated an F3, which means wind speeds of 158 mph to 206 mph (254 to 331 kph).

Ned Zeman,"Two apparent tornadoes touched down Saturday in central Arkansas, destroying shops as severe storms raking the South damaged some buildings and tore away roofs in northeast Mississippi.
There were no reports of any deaths or injuries from the widespread storms, which came nearly a week after a large tornado killed 23 people in Alabama amid an outbreak of Southern twisters.
An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon near Carlisle, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Little Rock and the second storm was near the unincorporated community of Slovak, southeast of Carlisle, said National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Goudsward.
Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman in Arkansas said several buildings were destroyed, power lines were brought down and at least one home was damaged.
""It was more than straight-line winds. One of the shops, it had debris strewn over two miles, (another) one of them was just twisted in a big twist with metal on top of automobiles that were in there,"" Hickman said.
Goudsward, based with the weather service in Little Rock, Arkansas, said teams would be sent to assess the damage and determine the strength of those storms.
In northeast Mississippi, strong winds tore away roofs and pulled down bricks from some buildings in the small community of Walnut, population about 3,000. Emergency Management Director Tom Lindsey, for the region's Tippah County, said the area that was hit was very rural.
Weather service meteorologist Marlene Mickelson in Memphis, Tennessee, said there were no reports of injuries from the storm in Walnut. But authorities said it was still too early to tell if the damage there was caused by a tornado or by straight-line winds.
A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area. The watches issued Saturday for Tennessee and Mississippi were in effect until 6 p.m. EST and for Arkansas and Louisiana until 4 p.m. EST.
The weather service's Storm Prediction Center also warned of the possibility of damaging winds and large hail and said via Twitter that cities at risk Saturday included Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky, among others. Forecasters said many of the affected areas were also at risk of flooding.

Associated Press,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.
Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didnt have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.
Though we dont have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so its not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles, he said. Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.
But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a calculated political move by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.
Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited the storm-ravaged town of Beauregard, Alabama Friday to survey the damage and comfort survivors after a powerful tornado roared through last Sunday, killing nearly two dozen people. (March 8)Tap to unmute
It would have been different, Anderson said, if Trump had signed a Bible out of the limelight for someone with whom he had a close connection.
For me, the Bible is a very important part of my faith, and I dont think it should be used as a political ploy, she said. I saw it being used just as something out there to symbolize his support for the evangelical community, and it shouldnt be used in that way. People should have more respect for Scripture.
York said that he, personally, would not ask a politician to sign a Bible, but that he has been asked to sign Bibles after he preaches. It feels awkward, he said, but he doesnt refuse.
If its meaningful to them to have signatures in their Bible, Im willing to do that, he said.
A request for comment was left with the White House on Saturday, a day after Trump visited Alabama to survey the devastation and pay respects to tornado victims. The tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family.
At the Providence Baptist Church in the Beauregard community in Alabama, the Rev. Rusty Sowell said, the presidents visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.
Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grade volunteer and signed the childs Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. The president also signed her sisters Bible, Ingram said. In photos from the visit, Trump is shown signing the cover of a Bible.
Trump should have at least signed inside in a less ostentatious way, said the Rev. Dr. Kevin Cassiday-Maloney.
It just felt like hubris, said Cassiday-Maloney, pastor at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Fargo, North Dakota. It almost felt like a desecration of the holy book to put his signature on the front writ large, literally.
He doesnt think politicians should sign Bibles, he said, because it could be seen as a blurring of church and state and an endorsement of Christianity over other religions.
It would have been out of line if Trump had brought Bibles and given them out, but that wasnt the case, said James Coffin, executive director of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida.
Too much is being made out of something that doesnt deserve that kind of attention, he said.
Bill Leonard, the founding dean and professor of divinity emeritus at the Wake Forest University School of Divinity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, woke up to Facebook posts Saturday morning by former students who were upset about Trump signing the Bibles because they dont view him as an appropriate example of spiritual guidance.
But, Leonard said, its important to remember that signing Bibles is an old tradition, particularly in Southern churches.
Leonard said he would have viewed it as more problematic if the signings were done at a political rally. He doesnt see how Trump could have refused at the church.
It wouldve been worse if he had said no because it wouldve seemed unkind, and this was at least one way he could show his concern along with his visit, he said. In this setting, where tragedy has occurred and where he comes for this brief visit, we need to have some grace about that for these folks.","President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.",2019-03-11T13:31:11Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Snopes.com'}",Trump Signed Bibles.

SMITHS STATION, Ala. As the sirens sounded on Sunday afternoon, alerting residents just before deadly tornadoes cut through eastern Alabama, 12-year-old Terryn Smith and 13-year-old Hannah Mounce, immediately sprung to action.
When the sirens went off, thats when we took cover, Terryn told NBC News.
The girls hid with Terryns mother and a friend in a Lee County home, getting down on the ground huddled with pillows and blankets in the kitchen, a room in the center of the house with no windows.
Krista Smith, Terryns mother, shielded the girls with her body as windows blew out and doors slammed in other parts of the home.
I was like scared that the house would take off and we werent going to make it, Hannah said.
Tornadoes roared through Lee County on Sunday afternoon, killing at least 23 people, including multiple children in what a local official called the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in the county.
A tornado watch for Lee County was issued at 11:40 am CST (12:40 p.m. ET) on Sunday, with the first tornado warning issued at 1:58 pm CST. That warning was issued just five minutes before the first damage report in the county.
It was one of the deadliest tornado events in the state since 2011, when more than 230 people across Alabama were killed that April.
Granadas Baker retrieves personal items from his home after a tornado caused extensive damage a day earlier in Beauregard, Alabama, on March 4.David Goldman / AP
The 2011 tornado outbreak left about 300 dead throughout the southeastern U.S. In response, the National Weather Service improved its operations for helping communities prepare for natural disasters, said Douglas Hilderbrand, a meteorologist who leads the NWS Weather-Ready National Ambassador program. The initiative began in response to the 2011 tornado season.
That April 2011 experience was really an eye opener for the National Weather Service, in the sense that it was a very well forecast event we were highlighting the magnitude of this event days in advance and yet still 300 people lost their lives, he said.
It really shined a light on how theres much more that needs to be done from a National Weather Service perspective but also a community perspective in terms of working together, he said.
The NWS invested in its technology and services to issue timely and more accurate tornado warnings but also on disseminating information to the community, he said.
The NWS recommends having multiple ways to receive warnings about extreme weather, such as receiving phone alerts, TV broadcasts and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Weather Radio.
During a news conference Monday, Lee County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was pretty sure the sirens sounded warnings ahead of the tornado but that both the weather service and the agency were increasingly reliant on sending targeted cell phone alerts to residents about tornadoes.
The 2011 outbreak in Alabama was declared a federal emergency and led to improvements in the states tornado shelters and warning systems, experts said.
Since then, through funds from FEMA there has been a lot of work to put in community safe rooms to be used during storms as well as money that has gone out through individual mitigation funds to put in tornado safe rooms in houses, said Lisa McCormick, an expert on emergency preparedness and associate dean for public health practice at University of Alabama at Birmingham.
McCormick said the state also worked to upgrade its outdoor warning systems so that they would be able to target county areas being impacted by incoming storms.
Experts recommend having a plan long before a tornado threat occurs, such as going to a basement, storm cellar or interior room away from windows and outside walls. People in mobile homes are encouraged to evacuate to community shelters.
Myles Tatum, a Lee County resident, said he and his two young sons, ages 7 and 10, ran and hid inside a closet in their barn after they saw a tornado heading towards them.
Tatum said what was going through his mind as he heard the tornado coming was, the ""same thing we're supposed to do, that's what they teach us go find cover in the best place you can find.""
Tatum said they could not get the door of the closet closed and just hoped the roof did not rip off. In the end, he and his boys survived.
""The only reason this part of the barn was here, I'm convinced, is the Lord saved us,"" he said.
""We just piled up on top of everything there's no time to worry about anything else right? It's what we're supposed to do,"" he said.

&amp;nbsp;
Local television news stations almost always preempt programming in favor of covering tornado warnings on an active severe weather day. This is a countrywide standard that's rarely violated in favor of whatever big program is airing that day. Its truly unsettling to see a barrage of vitriol every time a television show is bumped in favor of live coverage of people losing their homes and their lives.

While meteorologists warned people within the tornado emergency to seek shelter, they had to sift through vitriolic messages from viewers to put a golf tournament back on the air.
&amp;nbsp;
Rest assured: no matter how much pressure they receive from sour viewers to put Americas Next Top Whatever back on the air when a tornado is actively destroying communities, its extremely unlikely that news stations will ever choose to run with regular programming and talk about a significant tornado event after the fact. Thats just not going to happen, no matter how much selfish and angry hate mail people send.
&amp;nbsp;
News stations cover tornado warnings because it's an incredibly important service that saves lives. A ticker scrolling tornado warnings along the bottom of the screen isn't enough. People in harm's way need to see the radar and hear their towns and street names called out to drive home the urgent threat they're facing. We have the ability to track a tornado in real-time and even see detailed images of the debris swirling around in the air as it happens. It would be the height of irresponsibility to fail to utilize that technology to warn folks in the path of a bad storm.
&amp;nbsp;
This kind of coverage isn't only out of the goodness of your local news director's heart. One of the stipulations of a broadcast license from the FCC is that television stations exist to serve the public interest. This is widely understood to mean that broadcast news stations have to preempt programming to cover ongoing tornado warnings within their markets or they risk losing their broadcast license. It makes good humanitarian sense, good business sense, and good common sense.
&amp;nbsp;
People in harm's way deserve every chance they can get to hear a tornado warning and seek shelter. People who have family and friends in harm's way deserve the chance to hear what's coming toward their loved once.&amp;nbsp;That shouldnt even have to be said.
&amp;nbsp;
Contrary to popular belief, news stations with large markets cannot split their feeds off and isolate them only to areas affected by bad weather. That's not possible when you're broadcasting an over-the-air signal to antennas all across the area. Besides, dangerous thunderstorms move quickly and people upstream deserve to hear whats coming their way. People have family and friends in harm's way. People commute. The other option people angrily float during severe weathersplitting the severe weather feed off to digital subchannelsis tantamount to cutting off access to severe weather information for many viewers, especially those who subscribe to cable or satellite services that dont offer such channels.
&amp;nbsp;
Most television shows wind up on the networks website within a day or two of airing. A television show isn't worth someone losing their life because they didn't get advanced warning of a tornado. Theres just no fixing the amount of selfish callousness that goes into that kind of thinking.

Its difficult to encourage people to not be awful toward those who are trying to help save lives. Its a better use of energy to reassure people in harms way that theyll be able to rely on local television meteorologists to guide them through dangerous storms whenever they pop up regardless of what their angry neighbors think.

There were no reports of any deaths or injuries from the widespread storms, which came nearly a week after a large tornado killed 23 people in Alabama amid an outbreak of Southern twisters.
An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon near Carlisle, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Little Rock. The second storm was near the unincorporated community of Slovak, southeast of Carlisle, said National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Goudsward.
Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman in Arkansas said several buildings were destroyed, power lines were brought down and at least one home was damaged.
""It was more than straight-line winds. One of the shops, it had debris strewn over two miles, (another) one of them was just twisted in a big twist with metal on top of automobiles that were in there,"" Hickman said.
Goudsward, based with the weather service in Little Rock, Arkansas, said teams would be sent to assess the damage and determine the strength of those storms.
In northeast Mississippi, strong winds tore away roofs and pulled bricks from some buildings in the small community of Walnut, population about 3,000. Emergency Management Director Tom Lindsey, for the region's Tippah County, said the area that was hit was very rural.
Weather service meteorologist Marlene Mickelson in Memphis, Tennessee, said there were no reports of injuries from the storm in Walnut. But authorities said it was still too early to tell if the damage there was caused by a tornado or by straight-line winds.
A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area. The watches issued Saturday for Tennessee and Mississippi were in effect until 6 p.m. EST and for Arkansas and Louisiana until 4 p.m. EST.
The weather service's Storm Prediction Center also warned of the possibility of damaging winds and large hail and said via Twitter that cities at risk Saturday included Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky, among others. Forecasters said many of the affected areas were also at risk of flooding.","Southern storms, apparent tornadoes cause damages; none hurt WKRN News 2 Two apparent tornadoes touched down Saturday in central Arkansas, destroying shops as severe storms raking the South damaged some buildings and tore...

Kirk Hamilton,"Microsoft just showed off a ton of stuff at their E3 2018 Xbox press conference, including new Halo and Gears of War games, Fallout 76, The Division 2, Dying Light 2, a shiny Cyberpunk 2077 trailer, and a new samurai action game from the makers of Dark Souls. Personally speaking, I’m most excited about that last one, but there were a lot of good-looking games in general at Microsoft’s show. It was basically just a long run of trailers, but still a welcome jolt of excitement after yesterday’s sleepy Electronic Arts press conference. Many of the games shown were from third-party developers and will be available on other systems, so it’s a good idea to revisit my post from last year that broke down the various possible definitions of the word “exclusive” in this modern era. Ready to dive in? Let’s do this. They kicked off by announcing Halo Infinite. The teaser was light on information, but showed what looked like the original Halo, some marines driving a warthog, Master Chief holding his helmet and, apparently, Chief loading an AI (Cortana?) into his helmet. No release date on this one. Ori and the Will of the Wisps still looks beautiful. We got a good look at the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest, which debuted last year. Looks like the same mix of gorgeous visuals and surprisingly tough gameplay. Main question is how many times the sequel will get me to cry in the first 15 minutes. It’s coming in 2019. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a ninja game from the makers of Dark Souls, and I am excited enough for it to write a really long subhed for this entry!! You know how I described Team Ninja’s excellent Nioh as “basically Samurai Bloodborne ” ? Well, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is ninja Bloodborne, and it’s actually being made by FromSoftware, the developer of Bloodborne and Dark Souls. Hell yes. Hell yes! I will play the heck out of this, right after I finish playing all of Bloodborne for the second time. You play as a ninja with a prosthetic arm. He has a grappling hook, which means: traversal mechanics in a From game! (Not that “roll over a ledge and down to a weird platform” doesn’t count as traversal mechanics.) Also lots of sword fighting, huge bosses, monsters, and so on. Jason saw a separate demo of this game earlier today and will have more about it on Kotaku soon. He seems psyched, though. It’s coming in 2019. Bethesda gave us a first look at Fallout 76. It’s four times the size of Fallout 4, and set in the hills of West Virginia. As expected, it focuses on the years shortly after the bombs dropped. Not a lot of other details on how the game actually works, though of course my colleague Jason Schreier has already reported that it’ll be an online survival game with base-building, sort of like Rust or Ark. I’m sure we’ll learn more tonight at Bethesda’s press conference. The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a new game in the Life is Strange universe. It looks like a charming game about a young boy with an active imagination whose stories come to life. It’s out as a free download on June 26th. We got more Crackdown 3 Terry Crews antics. This game still looks pretty silly, as much later Saints Row games as early Crackdown. The trailer was trying pretty hard, but hey, the game lets you drive your car up a building, so whatever. As we reported late last week, the game has been delayed one final (hopefully?) time to February 2019. Metro: Exodus is still looking nice and bleak. Nothing major or new in the trailer, just a bunch more good Metro stuff, this time in an open (or at least more open) world. Love these games; will definitely play this one, too. It’s coming out on February 22, 2019. Looks like February of next year is gonna be a hell of a month! Kingdom Hearts 3 will have a Frozen world. The newest game in Square Enix’s extremely confusing but equally charming action series will feature a Frozen world featuring Elsa and Anna from Frozen along with Rapunzel from Tangled. Last night Square Enix announced that it’ll be out on January 29, 2019. Forza Horizon 4 takes the series to Britain, goes full shared-world. I love Forza Horizon 3 and will definitely play a new one of these games set in Britain. This one is being described as a seamless, shared-world online game, as opposed to previous games, which were more instanced and filled with AI “Drivatars.” There’ll be a 60fps mode on Xbox One X, which is nice; I love playing the third game at a high frame rate on PC. This is one of the few games at this conference that’s an actual exclusive, which means it’ll only ever be on Xbox and PC. It’ll be out on October 2, and will be included in Xbox Game Pass on the same day. Microsoft opened a new studio and bought a bunch of indies. They didn’t like, do any of that live onstage or anything, but they announced that they had. Xbox head Phil Spencer introduced the new Microsoft studio The Initiative, and also announced several studio acquisitions. Those acquisitions include State of Decay makers Undead Studios and Forza Horizon studio Playground Games, the second of which will be working on a new project in addition to Forza. Microsoft also bought Hellblade studio Ninja Theory as well as Compulsion Games, makers of We Happy Few. A couple of those studios had already been making games with Microsoft as their publisher. This all seems like Microsoft investing in having more in-house studios working on Xbox exclusives for the future. The Division 2 is moving to D.C. in the summertime. The very first thing we saw in Ubisoft’s Division 2 demo was a sweaty, verdant jungle, which is about as far as you can get from the first game’s wintry Manhattan streets without going to like, Mercury. After the intro teaser came a lengthy staged multiplayer demo that looked pretty much like more Division, but set in a much more colorful and vibrant environment. At one point, one player subtly shamed another player for being underleveled, which is probably the most realistic interaction I’ve ever seen in one of these canned E3 multiplayer demos. Anyway, I’m on board with this game. It’s coming out March 15, 2019. Shadow of the Tomb Raider heads to some nifty looking new places. Not a ton of new information about the game in the trailer they showed, but hey, it looks like another game in the style of Crystal Dynamics’ first two. At one point Lara got to cover herself in mud camouflage and do a Rambo-style takedown on a patrolling goon. I’ll play it. It’s out on September 14. There’s a new skating game in the works called Session. This sure looks like a skating game. I like skating games! Devil May Cry 5 is real, and looks like a good time. At one point in the trailer, a massive demonic boss stuffed a car into the mouth in his stomach, then belched fire. The game was described on stage as a “true sequel” to Devil May Cry 4, without no mention of Ninja Theory’s surprisingly great 2013 take on the series. DmC 5 is coming in Spring of 2019. Cool. Cuphead is getting an expansion. It’s called The Delicious Last Course, and will be out in 2019. I never got past the delicious first course of this delightful, hard-as-nails game, but I have a feeling those who did will welcome new characters and bosses. Bandai Namco announced Jump Force, a massive anime crossover fighting game. It’s got Naruto! It’s got Goku! It’s got lots of super intense fighting action! Kyaaaaaah! Dying Light 2 is more Dying Light, with a much more reactive open world. Cool dude and occasional Kotaku Splitscreen guest Chris Avellone is narrative designer on Techland’s sequel to Dying Light, which looks like it’s set in Paris after another zombie outbreak. It’ll keep all of the parkour and basic systems of the first game while adding a lot more narrative consequence to the choices you make in the world. They showed some branching dialogue options, shifting faction loyalties, and that kind of thing. The first Dying Light was great (don’t sleep on that game if you haven’t played it!) but its story was easily its weakest aspect. It’s promising to hear that Techland is focusing on on refining the narrative without changing what already works. There’s a new Battletoads coming out! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha it’s coming in 2019. They didn’t share may actual details. It’ll have couch co-op for three players. It will probably also be very difficult. Just Cause 4 is real, has tornadoes. This one already got leaked via accidental Steam ad, but now it’s confirmed. I was frustrated by Just Cause 3 despite the many things I liked about it, so I’m hopeful Avalanche has built on that good stuff and reworked the things (combat, basically) that I didn’t like. Also, this game will have a big tornado. Nice! I like inclement weather in video games. It’s coming on December 4, 2018. Gears of War 5 is coming, along with two spin-offs. First, they showed a Funko Pop mobile game, which looks cute. Gears Tactics is also in the works, and it looks like an XCOM -style turn-based strategy game. Last, they showed a cinematic trailer for Gears of War 5, starring Gearsverse character Kait Diaz. We saw a lot of snowy areas, some typically gory and gooey Gears gameplay, and some enemies that look like reanimated robots with some sort of red bio-element coursing through them. Microsoft is indeed working on the next Xbox. Not a huge shocker or anything, but at the end of the show, Phil Spencer mentioned that Microsoft’s hardware team is hard at work on a new Xbox. Hopefully they call it “Xbox Too.” They closed with a lovely new trailer for Cyberpunk 2077. There’s a lot of little details to unpack in that trailer, but I’ll leave that to the trailer-unpackers who will doubtless have already begun their work. It sure had a lot of graphics in it, and some high quality mohawks. I mean... it’s being made by the people who made The Witcher 3. I’m in, I’ll stay in, I’ve been in. Just lemme play it already. Few Other Things: Nier Automata was confirmed coming to Xbox in June; Sea of Thieves got a trailer for two expansions — Cursed Sails in July and Forsaken Shores in September; there was a Battlefield V story trailer; a new look at We Happy Few; a glimpse of a new PUBG mode; Tales of Vesperia is getting a definitive edition; Halo: The Master Chief Collection is coming to Xbox Game Pass later this year and The Division, The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited and Fallout 4 are hitting the Game Pass today; and we got another look at the promising Zelda -like indie game Tunic. And that’s that! If you ask me, they should’ve made that Sekiro trailer the last thing of the show, and probably also replayed it a couple times in between other trailers. But that’s just me. We’ll be back later this afternoon to cover Bethesda’s press conference, and all of the coming week with news, game announcements, hands-on impressions, and developer interviews.","Microsoft just showed off a ton of stuff at their E3 2018 Xbox press conference, including new Halo and Gears of War games, Fallout 76, The Division 2, Dying Light 2, a shiny Cyberpunk 2077 trailer, and a new samurai action game from the makers of Dark Souls.…",2018-06-10T22:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kotaku.com'}",Everything Microsoft Showed At E3 2018,https://kotaku.com/everything-microsoft-showed-at-e3-2018-1826712235,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1l-lCZ9v--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/u0jm97dwni8jlpxutuni.png",,Kotaku.com,tornado outbreak,1

ALLISON PETTY allison.petty@lee.net,"TAYLORVILLE At least 100 Taylorville buildings were damaged by a roaring storm system that lashed Central Illinois on Saturday, briefly trapping some in structures, before barreling northeast. The recovery effort will focus on a wide debris field that will become more clear in coming days. Three houses down, the front of the house is gone, said Lori Baker, 54, whose home had no damage, hours after the all-clear sign was given Saturday night. The rest of the houses on that block are fine. No fatalities were reported in the sweeping weather system, which raced across the state from near Litchfield to north of Decatur, toppling power lines and flag poles. Ed Shimon, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service at Lincoln, confirmed that a strong tornado struck Taylorville and caused significant damage. The weather service will send a team to the area today (Sunday) to document the damage and classify the strength of the storm. Shimon said Taylorville Memorial Hospital had reported 21 injured people and three were transferred to a Springfield hospital with critical injuries. It was one of those storms that just blew up, Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said during a news conference Saturday night. It just kind of came out of nowhere. The first indication of strong winds was at about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, following a period of unseasonably warm temperatures. Hazardous weather warnings were spattered across the region, but Taylorville Fire Chief Mike Crews said it was clear they were in for a direct hit. We took the unprecedented step of activating our sirens twice. We have a policy not to do that, but we felt because of the size of the storm we did do that, he said. Wil Pritchard, 23, was at work in Cerro Gordo when he heard about the conditions and headed to Taylorville. Pritchard is an amateur storm chaser, a hobby he picked up from his brother, a meteorologist. About five miles south of Taylorville, Pritchard captured several images of a funnel cloud. I saw a lot of power flashes as it was going through Taylorville. I could see lots of flashes of light. It was definitely destructive, he said. Said Pritchard: To see that sort of destruction was kind of unsettling. Baker rode out the storm in her basement on the west side of Taylorville along with four grandchildren between the ages of 3 and 14. The storm came on suddenly, she said. It was raining, but not a lot of hail, and the hail was pea-sized so it wasnt something that was just a downpour of hail, she said, and then, it came and all hell broke loose. Baker said there was hail and the sound of a freight train. We are all safe, thank God, she said. Across the city, trees had fallen into houses or across roadways, she said. Because so many roads were blocked, it was difficult to get across town. Lori Farley was visiting family and staying at her late mothers house on the southwest side of Taylorville when the storm struck. The house took minor damage, but others in the neighborhood were virtually destroyed. We walked outside and oh my god, it looked like a war zone out front, said Farley, 51, who lives in Normal. She said she had never seen anything like the damage around her. A tree had fallen on one house on the corner. A house across the street had lost its roof, and another house had its roof taken off and dropped in the middle of the living room, she said. A family friend who lives across the street was trapped in her home and had to be extricated by emergency crews, Farley said. A lot of people in our block afterward, they all came out, she said. People all really pitched in and helped to check on each and every one of the neighbors. Crews said they helped multiple people trapped in homes. The weather service said the storm at one point was moving northeast at 30 mph. In Macon County, the most serious damage was reported in Blue Mound and Harristown. Shimon said there was a report of a tornado four miles west of Boody, where a house was shifted off its foundation and there was roof damage. The storm passed near Warrensburg and just east of Maroa, he said. There had not been any damage reports as of 10 p.m. Saturday, but he said that could change when the sun comes up. ""This is a reminder that tornado season is not just in the spring. Its all year-round for Illinois,"" Shimon said. ""You get the right kind of warm temperatures and you can get some tornado development any month of the year. It's just a reminder to always be prepared for these kinds of things."" There also was a report of a Blue Mound house with severe damage, but no additional information was available Saturday. Decatur fire Battalion Chief Wade Watson said there no damage reports in the city Saturday night. Gov. Bruce Rauner also activated the State Emergency Operations Center to assist with recovery effort. The weather service said officials are investigating reports of 12 tornadoes in Christian, Cass, Fulton, McDonough and Schuyler counties. The Taylorville Food Pantry, 1429 E. Main Cross, also will be open for emergency help from 8 to 10 a.m. on Sunday. Christian County is receiving assistance from multiple agencies providing mutual aid, and Crews said it was likely that the city of Taylorville would reach out to the governors office for some type of state disaster declaration. He encouraged people to stay in their homes. He said a number of travelers on the roads have made it more difficult for first responders to reach fires and people in need of assistance. Illinois State Police also posted on Twitter that ""all non-resident traffic should avoid"" the community. Kettelkamp said Illinois 48 also was closed and a semi-truck was blown across a roadway. Scott Cox and Troy Petitt began boarding up broken windows at the Taylorville Family Video within a few hours after the tornado hit the business. The duo work for HPL Construction and provide repairs for many businesses around Taylorville. It looks like a bomb hit, Cox said about some of the areas of town. Shirley Niethe, manager of the Ace Hardware in Taylorville, was keeping the store open late into the night on Saturday to help a steady stream of customers who needed batteries, flashlights and other essentials. One man came in to buy tarps in an attempt to protect what was left of his home after a tree went through the middle of it. He said, Its going to be months before I can get back in my house, Niethe said. The store typically closes at 6 p.m., but as of 9:40 p.m., sales were still going strong. Niethe was planning to stay open until she went an hour without any customers. Its going to be awhile, she said. Donnette Beckett and Valerie Wells contributed to this report.

Kim LaCapria,"CLAIM A Facebook Live video shows careless food waste at a Celina, Ohio Walmart. MISCAPTIONED RATING ORIGIN On 6 November 2017, user Gary Joe Ahrns shared a Facebook Live video purportedly showing piles of wasted food outside a Walmart in Celina, Ohio (also published to YouTube and archived ): In the video, which has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, Ahrns laments heaps of discarded foods (such as meat, milk, and butter) and interrogates a manager about whether he can “have” the food. At around the two-minute mark, employees respond to his request to salvage some of the food by stating that it is “all bad,” presumably indicating that they believe it is unsafe to eat. Walmart’s Facebook response team issued a series of replies to agitated commenters, attributing the circumstances to the aftermath of a power loss in the area of the store on 5 November 2017: Unfortunately, due to a tornado that affected our store in Celina, Ohio on November 5, the food being disposed of was unsafe for consumption after the store lost power for 14 hours. Per internal and health department policies, we followed proper procedures by disposing of the food. -Red On 7 November 2017, limaohio.com reported widespread power outages following the storm: With areas of the city still without power [a day later], damage assessment was ongoing after the EF2 tornado whipped through Celina on Sunday. A second tornado, also an EF2, was confirmed in the vicinity of St. Anthony in western Mercer County. According to Midwest Electric, the storm caused just more than 1,000 of its customers to lose power Sunday, with almost all restored by midnight. A state of emergency was declared in an area affecting Celina, Ohio, and local news outlets listed Walmart among businesses heavily affected by power loss and storm damage. Walmart also sent us a statement: Unfortunately, due to a tornado that affected our store in Celina, Ohio on November 5, the food being disposed of was unsafe to eat after the store lost power for 14 hours. Per internal and health department policies, we followed proper procedures by disposing of the food. The video shows that Walmart did, indeed, throw away piles of food — but what it left out is that the store was responsibly disposing of spoiled or spoiling food after an hours-long power outage following an uncommonly destructive tornado. The circumstances under which the food came to be discarded were documented extensively in local news, and Walmart’s response was well supported by coverage of the early November 2017 weather event in Celina, Ohio.

A fire department representative estimated the number of injured could be as many as 40. The official added that four or five people were critically injured, KTRE reported.
The Cherokee County Sheriff's Office told KYTX there was at least one fatality in Houston County from the tornado, but no other details were provided.
Jackson said dozens of home were destroyed and people became trapped by the storms.
""I've seen brick homes flattened,"" said Jackson. ""I've seen homes moved across county roads. 
One of the two twisters caused a school gymnasium to collapse on one end. 
Damage to homes and a high school was also reported in Lufkin, Texas. 
More than 65,000 customers were without power as a result of the storms in Texas by 8 p.m. EDT, according to poweroutage.us. 
Louisiana
In Louisiana, an image taken Saturday morning in Stonewall shows what could be another tornado.
Damage, including downed large trees, was also reported near Blanchard, Louisiana.
Earlier in the morning, hail as large as 3 inches in diameter was reported north of San Antonio and in areas north of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
By 5:30 p.m. EDT Saturday, more that 37,000 customers were without power in Louisiana, poweroutage.us reported. 
Mississippi
A 'strong and dangerous' long-tracked tornado was reported in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Saturday afternoon.
Storm tracker Charles Peek told The Weather Channel the possible tornado busted windows and damaged a Kroger and other stores at a strip mall. He noted that the damage didn't appear to be too extensive.
The storms also caused significant travel delays. More than 500 flights were canceled Saturday at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport. Another 300 were delayed, according to Flight Aware. 
Officials with the Masters Golf Tournament said Saturday it was changing its schedule on Sunday as the storms move eastward. Players will be grouped in threes and will start play early, with half beginning on the first tee and the other half beginning their round on the 10th tee.
The safety of everyone on our grounds is paramount, Fred Ridley, chairman of Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, said in a statement released by the club. We also believe the earlier start will give us the best opportunity to complete the Masters on Sunday.""

David Epstein,"From tornadoes to hail, Tuesday stands out as the most active weather day in late October in New England I can remember — and I've been forecasting since college. The instability in the skies came about because of an active jet stream and rapid changes in both temperatures and wind direction. These factors brought a couple lines of showers and strong to severe thunderstorms through the region. There were two confirmed tornadoes in New England Tuesday: one in Lincoln, Rhode Island and the other in Norton, Mass. There were also waterspouts — tornadoes over the water — and funnel clouds, which are basically tornadoes that haven't reached the ground. It's likely the tornadoes were, at most, F1-strength tornadoes on the Fujita scale — meaning they are classified as relatively ""weak"" as far as tornadoes go. But the National Weather Service is continuing to evaluate the damage from Tuesday. Once it does later this afternoon or evening, we'll have the tornadoes' definitive wind speeds. Beyond tornadoes there were some very strong winds and hail. In some of these storms there was also something called graupel, which is basically soft hail or hard snow, depending on how you look at it. This is formed when supercooled water freezes directly on a snowflake as it's coming down from the clouds. Since so many of us have cameras at our fingertips, there were many, many incredible pictures of the waterspouts, funnel clouds and actual tornadoes. Keep snapping away, because these images actually help researchers to better understand the extent of this severe weather outbreak.","WBUR It's Not Just You: Even Our Weather Guy Thought Tuesday's Weather Was Unusual WBUR From tornadoes to hail, Tuesday stands out as the most active weather day in late October in New England I can remember — and I've been forecasting since college.

Power outages across the Lower Peninsula are a strong possibility tonight, courtesy of mu ltiple rounds of storms coming in off Lake Michigan, some expected to pack wind gusts of 60 mph. The biggest threat in these storms is damaging winds and more heavy rain for some areas, according to the National Weather Service. They will work their way across the state by around midnight. ""We are expecting more power outages across the region, unfortunately,"" Brandon Hoving, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Grand Rapids, said today during a webinar on the upcoming storms. ""Some of these people who have just recently had power restored... may lose it again."" Storms Sunday and Monday nights caused scattered power outages across the state. By this morning, most of those customers had their electricity restored. An area in west central Lower Michigan is the highest risk area for severe storms, according to the NWS forecast. That area stretches roughly from Holland and Grand Rapids north to the Traverse City area, then rounding east to Mt. Pleasant. Tree damage and even isolated tornadoes are possible between late tonight and 6 a.m. Wednesday. Rain could fall at the rate of an inch per hour on ground that is already saturated from recent downpours, leading to a flooding concern for later this week. Up to 4 more inches of rain could fall in some areas between tonight and early Wednesday.

The presidents proposed budget for 2020 makes more than $75,000,000 in cuts to the National Weather Service that, if passed, could adversely affect the agencys ability to keep the public safe during severe weather. The NWS is a force of nature that works tirelessly behind the scenes to warn every square inch of land in the United States when hazardous weather is on the way. Most Americans hardly realize how much they utilize the agencys products and services until theyre under threat.
The National Weather Service occasionally faces political pressure due to the mistaken belief that private weather companies could pick up the slack of a reduced NWS and provide the same services the federal agency does.&amp;nbsp;Contrary to those assertions,&amp;nbsp;private companies would find themselves lost without&amp;nbsp;the critical services and infrastructure provided by the NWS. Most of the observational data, weather radar imagery, and much of the weather modelling used by private weather companies is maintained by the federal government. Itd be prohibitively expensive for each company to foot the bill for these services on their own.
Upper-air observations would lose $2,271,000 of funding under the proposed budget. These observations, taken by instruments attached to weather balloons, collect information on temperature, moisture, wind, and air pressure as they ascend to the top of the atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;Weather balloons only ever come up in everyday conversation as the butt of a UFO joke, but these upper-air soundings are critically important to the accuracy of weather models. The use of upper-air&amp;nbsp;observations taken by airplanes flying over oceans would also be slashed under the proposed budget. Data collected by airplanes flying over remote areas help forecasters fill in the gaps where we don't have weather balloons.
The data collected by weather balloons is ingested into weather models to initialize them, or tell them what the atmosphere is doing right now. A weather model needs to know what the atmosphere looks like right now so that it can paint a more accurate picture of what it thinks could happen in the future. The NWS releases weather balloons more frequently ahead of a high-impact severe weather event like a tornado outbreak or a landfalling hurricane so that weather models have even more data to work with. Reducing the geographic extent and frequency of weather balloon launches would feed less data into weather models, potentially making it harder for models to produce accurate guidance for forecasters.
A $12,500,000 reduction in surface-based observation stations would also reduce the ability for forecasters to see what's happening on the ground as it happens. Most of the cuts would come from the National Mesonet Program, which supports dozens of mesonets across the country. A mesonet is a small-scale, densely-populated network of weather stations that gives us a good view of current conditions across a relatively small area. The most well-known mesonet is the Oklahoma Mesonet, which consists of at least one weather station in each county in Oklahoma. The type of ground truth provided by mesonets is importantwhen a station records a severe wind gust as a thunderstorm passes overhead, it lets forecasters issue advanced warning to communities in the path of the storm. Rainfall data collected by mesonets also helps meteorologists monitor and study flooding rain events.
More than 300 National Weather Service employees would stand to lose their jobs if the proposed cuts are adopted. Nearly 250 meteorologists and more than 70 IT professionals would be laid off as part of a workforce adjustment based on an analysis conducted several years ago. Understaffing at NWS offices across the country has been a pressing issue for years, made even more serious by hiring freezes and funding cuts.

Associated Press,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Cousins Cordarrly Jones and Demetria Jones have a hard time counting all the relatives they lost to a monster tornado that wiped out a rural community in Alabama.
Their grandparents, 89-year-old Jimmy Jones and 83-year-old Mary Louise Jones, were killed in their home on a two-lane road where most everyone shares family ties.
The couples son Emmanuel Jones, a 53-year-old uncle to the cousins, is gone too. Also dead, they said, were seven cousins by both blood and marriage: Eric Jamal Stenson, 38; Florel Tate Stenson; 63; Henry Lewis Stenson; 65; James Henry Tate, 86; Tresia Robinson, 62; Raymond Robinson Jr., 63; and Maggie Delight Robinson, 57.
Stunned by the loss of 10 relatives and worried about still more who are hospitalized with serious injuries, the cousins stood Tuesday amid the wreckage of a row of family homes in tiny Beauregard, near the Georgia state line.
It really hasnt fully hit me yet. Im still trying to process it, said Cordarrly Jones, 29.
Everybody in this area just about was related, said Demetria Jones, 28. Its devastating.
With winds of as much as 170 mph (275 kph), the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years rolled mobile homes across fields and caused even brick homes to collapse into unrecognizable heaps. At least 23 people were killed, some of them children. The full scale of the loss came into focus with the release of the names of the dead. The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 89.
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma. The enormous twister apparently churned for about 70 miles (110 kilometers), crossing the state line and ending in neighboring Georgia, the National Weather Service said. Government teams that surveyed Sundays damage confirmed there was an outbreak of at least 20 twisters in Florida, Alabama, Florida and South Carolina.
On Tuesday, the search for bodies, pets and belongings continued in and around Beauregard amid the din of beeping heavy machinery and whining chain saws. Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of the missing shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
Richard Tate, who is part of the same family and lost four close relatives, said he was lucky to be alive. It could have taken all of us the way it was moving, said Tate, who was inside his home with his wife when the structure was destroyed.
Bernard Reese, a distant relative of the Jones cousins, picked through the remains of his aunts house on Tuesday. He said he found more than a half-dozen bodies or fatally injured residents along Lee County 39, the road where so many of the family members died.
It bothers me, but it had to be done, said Reese, who lives about 2 miles away. He arrived in his truck after the twister passed and climbed over downed trees and power lines to get to the scene.
Reeses friend Dexter Norwood said he found three more bodies and the severed leg of a woman.
I keep seeing it. I aint slept worth a crap, said Norwood, 46. He suffered a fractured vertebra when the twister hit the mobile home he shared with his wife, but he said both are fine.
The bloated corpse of a gray horse lay on the ground beside the couples home. Norwood said he had to euthanize the animal after the storm because it suffered a serious leg injury.
The extent of the damage and death left him shaken.
I never thought Id see it, he said. Its rough.
The Jones cousins, who survived at least in part because dont live on the road where their relatives died, said they had to talk their way past police barricades to get to the scene. Officers, they said, kept asking for something to prove they were related to the victims.
I just had to tell them that everything that proves who I am is out on that road, Cordarrly Jones said.",It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013.,2019-03-06T15:41:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Snopes.com'}",Family Devastated After Losing 10 Relatives in Tornado,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/03/06/family-devastated-after-losing-10-relatives-in-tornado/,"https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/03/2000-14-e1551886808961.jpeg?fit=1200,800",,Snopes.com,tornado outbreak,1

Jeff Berardelli,"The deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. in six years touched down in Alabama Sunday with winds of 170 mph and a path of 27 miles. It killed 23 people and was part of an early severe weather outbreak with 50 preliminary reports of tornadoes.
But while some were quick to point to climate change as a cause of the tornado outbreak, current science isn't definitive about how much climate change influences tornadoes.  
On Monday, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a warning about climate change and tornadoes on Facebook. ""The science is clear, climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse,"" he wrote.
Sanders is correct to say climate change makes extreme weather worse, though how much that applies to tornadoes is unclear.
But climate change seems to be shifting the concentration and range of tornadoes, pushing them into more vulnerable areas. In addition, evidence suggests there will be a more favorable environment for severe weather -- and probably tornadoes -- in a warmer future.
Recent trends in tornadoes
Finding trends in tornado numbers or even intensity is complicated. That's because the U.S. tornado record is rather short (since the 1950s) and prone to many uncertainties since it is compiled through eyewitness reports.
It's logical to assume that with more people living in remote areas now, you would see an uptick in the number of tornadoes since more are being observed. However, a trend isn't discernable – the graph appears flat.
To the naked eye, it appears there is a trend toward less violent tornadoes. But past inconsistencies in determining the strength of tornadoes make the record hard to trust. For instance, there is evidence that tornadoes may have been rated as more powerful than they actually were before the adoption of the Fujita scale in the late 1970s.
The bottom line is that, so far, there is likely no significant trend in the overall number or intensity of tornadoes. But that doesn't  does not tell the whole story.
The science of tornadoes in a warming climate
Strong tornadoes are formed from a combination of warm, moist, rising air and strong ""wind shear."" Wind shear is a change in wind speed and/or direction with height – that helps provide spin to the supercell thunderstorms that aid in tornado formation.
Tornadoes form when certain ingredients are in place including high instability and vertical wind shear meaning winds are changing with height. This slide goes into some of the science of tornado formation and covers some safety tips as well. #SpringSafety#houwx#bcswxpic.twitter.com/MGRKquOIKm
— NWS Houston (@NWSHouston) March 8, 2018
In this warming world, global climate models clearly show warmth and moisture will increase. But climate models also suggest a general decrease in wind shear in the future. So which will win out: The increase in warm-moist air or the modest decrease in shear?
The devil is in the details
Armed with a global climate model ensemble, a team of researchers at Stanford and Purdue Universities in 2013 found there will be ""robust increases in the occurrence of severe thunderstorm environments over the eastern United States"" in response to global warming.
That result shouldn't be surprising given that more warm, moist, unstable air means more energy for thunderstorms. 
But the team also found something unexpected. The computer models showed that a warmer climate would produce an increase in low-level wind shear on days when the air is more unstable. The team said that suggested ""an increasing likelihood of atmospheric conditions that contribute to the most severe events, including tornadoes.""
It's worth noting that in their study, wind shear does decrease, but the drop is concentrated in more stable, less stormy days. So the general decrease in wind shear has no impact on tornadoes.
Extreme tornado outbreaks getting more extreme
A more recent study published in 2016 titled ""More tornadoes in the most extreme U.S. tornado outbreaks"" hints that some of the conclusions of the 2013 study may be happening now.
CBS News sat down with the lead author of the 2016 study, Columbia University Professor Michael K. Tippett. He explained that, ""Extreme meteorological environments associated with severe thunderstorms show consistent upward trends.""
Tippett analyzed the tornado record back to the 1950s and found that, ""The frequency of U.S. outbreaks with many tornadoes is increasing, and it is increasing faster for more extreme outbreaks.""
But Tippett said it is unclear if the increase in tornadoes per outbreak is being caused by climate change. Tippett said that although the trend is being driven by consistent changes in the environment, the changes aren't necessarily the kind that would be expected from climate change.
Specifically, the study found that, during big tornado outbreak days, unstable air isn't increasing as climate change would imply. Instead, it's wind shear that 's increasing. 
Tippett put it this way: ""Either we don't understand the all impacts of climate change or it's not climate change.""
But he cautioned that, in the future, ""It's clear there will be some impact from climate change such as more frequent conditions that are favorable for supercell thunderstorms and an expansion of favored areas northward.""
""Tornado Alley"" is shifting east
In what is likely the most impactful of all the tornado trends, a fall 2018 study concluded ""Tornado Alley"" is spreading eastward from the Plains States toward the more vulnerable, more densely populated Southeast. The study found that may lead to a threefold increase in disaster potential. The shift is happening as drier, more stable air from the desert Southwest shoves thunderstorm formation eastward.

Lead author Victor Gensini told CBS News, ""It's not a big jump to say that climate change is causing this shift east. The hypothesis and computer simulations support what we are observing and what we expect in the future.""",Is the science that links tornadoes to climate change really clear?,2019-03-06T05:44:02Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}",What we know about tornadoes and climate change,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alabama-tornadoes-and-climate-change-what-we-know/,https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/05/6c3d9d5a-c152-473b-9040-7d0072539014/thumbnail/1200x630/a0bf33d4aa9d42bc74604822a70e57ef/alabama-tornado-2019-03-05t000550z.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,tornado outbreak,1

,"At a Glance
In classic April fashion, a severe weather outbreak is ahead this weekend.
Saturday's threat includes the potential for some strong tornadoes in parts of the South.
A squall line with damaging winds, and some tornadoes may occur Saturday night into Sunday.
Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are also possible.
An outbreak of severe weather is likely this weekend in the South, including the threat of tornadoes, a few of which may be strong. 
As Wesley exits into Canada later Friday into early Saturday, a southward plunge of the jet stream will pivot out of northern Mexico and the Desert Southwest into the Plains states.
Ahead of that jet-stream disturbance, low pressure will form in the South Saturday and gain strength as it pushes northward into the Ohio Valley Sunday. This strengthening low will draw warm, humid air north from the Gulf of Mexico.
Setup for severe thunderstorms this weekend.
This potentially volatile combination of ingredients may give rise to an outbreak of severe thunderstorms across the South this weekend.
Here is what we know right now. Check back with us at weather.com for the latest on this potentially dangerous situation.
Friday's Forecast
Friday night into early Saturday, rain and thunderstorms should be widespread from the southern Plains to the Tennessee Valley. 
A few strong to severe thunderstorms may develop in parts of Texas, far southern Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana. The Dallas-Fort Worth area is included in this threat.
The primary concern will be large hail, but damaging wind gusts are also possible.

How Much Rain?
In the South, Ohio Valley and East, locally heavy rain may trigger flash flooding in areas that have been recently soaked by rain. However, the frontal system's steady eastward advance should put a cap on the magnitude of the flash flood threat.
Areas from northeastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma into the lower Mississippi and lowe Ohio Valleys have the best chance of flash flooding on Saturday.

Sarah Kaplan and Katie Mettler,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. — Seven members of a single family were among the 23 killed in one of the regions hit hardest by deadly tornadoes that tore through the Southeast, officials said Tuesday.
The names of the victims in Lee County, Alabama were released at a morning news conference two days after the tornadoes flattened homes and businesses.
The oldest was 89, and the youngest was a 6-year-old boy named Armondo ‘‘AJ’’ Hernandez, county coroner Bill Harris said.
The seven family members were connected by marriage.
‘‘Just keep those families in your prayers,’’ Harris said. ‘‘I can’t thank this community enough for jumping in there.’’
President Trump said he plans to visit Alabama on Friday.
‘‘Its been a tragic situation,’’ Trump said from the Roosevelt Room Tuesday afternoon. ‘‘But a lot of good work is being done.’’
Officials worked throughout the day Monday to identify the dead, determine cause of death and notify the victims’ families.
‘‘I learned early that afternoon my resources would be overwhelmed,’’ the coroner said.
He activated a statewide network of coroners who voluntarily came to Lee County to help expedite the process. By 10 p.m. Monday night, all the victims’ bodies had been released to their families so they could begin funeral preparations.
Three members of the Stenson family were killed. When the storm hit on Sunday, Eric Stenson, 38, had been visiting his parents, Henry and Florel Stenson, 65 and 63 respectively. All three were killed.
‘‘He was a good guy,’’ Dusty Bell, 38, said of Eric Stenson. The two were neighbors growing up and played baseball together. Stenson, Bell said, was a ‘‘really good’’ shortstop.
Another victim, 53-year-old David Dean, was known around town as ‘‘Roaddog.’’ How the man got this nickname remains a mystery to Wes Jones, 36, who said Dean had an infectious laugh and deep capacity for love. ‘‘He was so funny,’’ Jones said of Dean. ‘‘There was nothing bad when he was around.’’
As many as eight community members are still unaccounted for, officials said at the news conference. Search and rescue crews will continue combing through debris Tuesday looking for signs of life from people and animals.
Hardly anyone was left untouched by the storm. Even if they survived or their home was left standing, they knew someone else who wasn’t as lucky.
‘‘It’s just a weird feeling where you don’t have no control. Nothing,’’ said Bruce Britt, 52.
The tornado passed within a few miles of his home; he, his wife and daughter weathered the storm in their laundry room.
‘‘And then you know that some people lost their lives,’’ he said, shaking his head. ‘‘It’s terrible, but you really can’t put into words how bad it really is.’’",Seven members of one family are among the 23 dead in Sunday’s tornado outbreak.

Hemant Mehta,"I know we like pointing out the bizarre Christian reactions when a natural disaster destroys a community but spares a Bible… as if that’s a sign of God’s love. But this is a new one. 
The recent outbreak of tornadoes in Alabama decimated one family’s house. Everything, that is, except a closet where the grandmother used to pray. 
Jason Smith, a member of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team, shared the image on Facebook, where it quickly went viral.
Listen to me please. I just left a family who survived the tornado in this house and the only left standing is this closet. It’s the grandmother’s prayer closet, and the whole family survived. Are you kiddin me!!! My God is awesome!!! Shout somebody! –Jason–
If that’s the case, then that same “awesome” God has also killed 23 people and injured 97 others. God also destroyed their home. But the closet is still there… so yay?
Thankfully, no one in that family was hurt, but giving God credit for not taking down a few pieces of wood while ignoring the damage you also believe is part of God’s plan is a mark of religious delusion. It’s the same mindset that praises God after a plane crash because there’s a single survivor — you’re missing the point.
It makes me wonder what it would take for these people to stop giving God credit for this nothing-burger. If a family member perished in the disaster, would they still be praising God? If the closet fell but other parts of the house stayed up, would they be upset about it? 
Smith should just admit he’s grasping for any good news he can find instead of pretending God is sending a sign to the people of Alabama. No one deserves praise for destroying all-but-one thing.

The Associated Press,"Storms moving across the Gulf Coast region with howling wind and pounding rain were blamed for at least two deaths and left nearly 110,000 homes and businesses without electricity early Thursday. A Texas sheriff's deputy answering a call about a water rescue died after her patrol car ran into floodwaters covering a road and landed upside down, authorities said, and a Mississippi college student died in another weather-related wreck. At least two other people were sent to a hospital because of a possible tornado touchdown in Louisiana, and forecasters said the weather threat would last hours more. The Storm Prediction Center reported trees and utility lines down across a wide area from eastern Texas to northwest Alabama, and radar showed storms reaching from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. The storms were linked to a cold front that sent temperatures sharply lower once the line passed. Weather service sending team to look at north Alabama storm damage In Texas, the Waller County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook that Deputy Loren Vasquez, 23, had been on solo patrol for only three nights when her patrol car ran into water on a road and flipped late Wednesday while answering a rescue call. Other deputies tried to free her from the overturned vehicle but couldn't. ""Words will never express what our office is going thru and we can only ask for your prayers,"" said a statement by Sheriff R. Glenn Smith posted on the site. The system moved on to Mississippi, where the Department of Public Safety said Alcorn State University student Jayla A. Gray, 19, of Jackson died early Thursday when the car in which she was a passenger struck a tree that had fallen across a highway near the town of Port Gibson, which is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) southwest of the capital of Jackson. Severe storms continue in Alabama; tornado watch in effect The driver and another passenger escaped injury, the agency said in a statement. Public Safety spokesman Kervin Stewart said the three were returning to campus after a Halloween party and early-morning meal; Gray was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the wreck. Troopers said weather was a factor in the wreck, which happened just minutes after a storm toppled trees near Kevin Bryant's mobile home a few miles away in Port Gibson. Daybreak revealed a shattered community littered with broken trees and pieces of buildings, said Bryant. ""It tore up trees and old businesses that had been sitting awhile. Everybody is without power,"" he said. ""It definitely woke you up. That wind was howling."" Bryant wasn't hurt, but two people were taken to a hospital when a mobile home that flipped west of Bogalusa, Louisiana, said Bobbi Jo Breland, assistant director of the Washington Parish office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness said in an email. She did not know the extent of their injuries. A roof collapsed on a nearby home and one person had to be rescued there, Breland said. High winds downed power lines and flipped trampolines in east Texas before the storms entered the Southeast. Storms toppled tents being set up for an oyster cook-off planned for this weekend in Gulf Shores, Alabama, and powerful gusts stripped leaves from trees near Birmingham. Forecasters said the storms would bring a threat of tornados, winds blowing to 60 mph and drenching rains that could cause flash floods. The line was expected to move into Georgia later Thursday. At least 110,000 customers were without power as the storms moved eastward, but crews restored electricity to thousands as conditions improved. The biggest problems were in central and eastern Louisiana and western Mississippi. Schools were delayed in the New Orleans area and other parts of southeastern Louisiana.

Associated Press,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Fathers Day note to her husband reading, Daddy, I love you to pieces.
Her husband was done and gone, she said, one of 23 victims of what one National Weather Service meteorologist called a monster tornado.
She was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband, David Wayne Dean, was home in Beauregard. He had heard the forecasts warning that stormy weather was heading toward their rural community. He sent a text message cautioning a friend to pay attention to the news.
Then the storm hit. Dean, 53, didnt make it to safety. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbors yard.
Our son found him, Dean said between sobs Monday. He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.
The tornado packed winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and chewed a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama for nearly 27 miles (43 kilometers), the weather service said Tuesday after its crews surveyed the impact. The weather service said 90 people were injured.
Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half.
Surveyors found that the twisters intensity peaked in Beauregard, a rural Lee County community, where it demolished multiple manufactured homes, emptying their contents into the woods. The tornado swept up and scattered the debris so widely that the metal frames of two of those homes could not even be located.
By Tuesday morning, authorities reduced the count of unaccounted-for people from dozens to about 7 or 8, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Law enforcement teams have been searching amid splintered lumber and twisted metal from the air and by foot using cadaver-sniffing dogs, finding no more bodies since Monday.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academys Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.
An unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, Beauregard is in the same county as Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway.
Volunteers responded in force, using chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers, helping neighbors and friends search the wreckage, and gathering donations.
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the remnants of Morrisons home, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage the couples safe, her husbands motorcycle boots and her embossed Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub her husband jumping in at the last minute as the twister lifted their house off its foundation and swept it into the woods.
We knew we were flying because it picked the house up, Morrison said, figuring that the showers fiberglass enclosure helped them survive.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was pretty sure tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings.
The weather service found evidence that two tornadoes struck the area. Meteorologist Chris Darden said the one that did most of the destruction was a monster tornado classified as an EF4. He said it was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground, the sheriff said.
The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
Tornado outbreaks in early March arent unusual in the Alabama-Mississippi area, tornado experts said in fact, the weather services Storm Prediction Center had warned people three days before the disaster to be on the lookout for higher tornado activity in the region. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters were all over it.
An EF5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people. And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama.
For Beauregard, the mourning has only just begun. The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.
After the storm, Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to her husband, a man others called Roaddog for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriffs deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husbands body lay.

Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said that some patients were sent to hospitals elsewhere, including Columbus, Georgia, but details on those patients were not immediately known Tuesday.

The sound of chain saws and heavy equipment is in the air in Beauregard, Alabama, which got the worst of the tornadoes sweeping across the Southeast this weekend.
Church chaplain Ike Mathews is checking on emergency workers and members of his congregation as he walks a road lined with broken trees and pieces of homes. Mathews says the people who have found the bodies of some of the 23 victims are hurting, and the whole community is torn up.
He says many who living in the area are senior citizens who retired from textile mills or an factory nearby, and were hoping to leave their homes to their grandchildren. Now those properties are destroyed.

An Alabama coroner says all 23 people found dead after a tornado have been identified and their bodies have been released to funeral homes. He said their ages range from 6 to 93, and that one family alone lost seven people.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris says other coroners and funeral homes from around the state are pitching in to help prepare the victims for funerals.
Sheriff Jay Jones says ""a lot of heavy equipment is coming in to pick up big portions of debris"" in specific pockets of Beauregard where the search for more victims is now focused.
He says those areas are narrowed down from a broad spectrum to certain areas where there may be people or animals, and that they hope to transition from search-and-rescue to recovery later Tuesday. He said the number of missing people has narrowed from dozens to just ""seven or eight.""

Government teams surveying storm damage across the Southeast have confirmed that at least 18 tornadoes struck in a deadly weekend outbreak.
The National Weather Service says storm systems crossing the region Sunday spun off tornadoes in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina alone.
The most powerful twister was an EF4 tornado packing 170 mph (274 kph) winds that's been blamed for at least 23 deaths in Lee County, Alabama. The weather service says that tornado crossed into western Georgia and inflicted more damage.
The number of confirmed tornadoes could increase. Survey teams are still assessing storm damage in some areas.

9:20 a.m.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones says the search for tornado victims is still active, with the crews now looking at a smaller area and specific piles of wreckage.
The sheriff said Tuesday that the list of unaccounted people is down to seven or eight.
He says law enforcement teams are working the area by foot with the help of cadaver-sniffing dogs and also searching by air. In one hard-hit area, a small excavator turned over pieces of splintered homes and trees, which firefighters then searched for signs of potential victims.
Jones says authorities are contacting family and friends of the missing to confirm their status, since some of those unaccounted-for may have checked in but not with authorities.

7:50 a.m.
Forecasters say 90 people were injured in the tornado that also killed at least 23 people in the small community of Beauregard, Alabama.
The number of injured comes in a Tuesday report from the National Weather Service, forecasters say the tornado's damage path was nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide and kept gaining intensity before slamming into Beauregard, Alabama.
Survey crews from the weather service documented how the deadly twister shredded manufactured homes, emptying their contents into the woods.
Forecasters said in the report that the tornado was strong enough to bend the frame of a car around what remained of a large tree. Based on the damage, they've determined that it was EF-4 tornado with 170 mph (274 kph) winds.

12:40 a.m.
Residents of a small Alabama community hit by a powerful tornado are mourning the deaths of 23 people as they pick through shattered homes for salvageable belongings and crews search for more victims.
Carol Dean found her wedding dress Monday among the wreckage of her mobile home in Beauregard. But the storm took her husband. She said: ""My life is gone.""
Dean said her spouse, 53-year-old David Wayne Dean, was killed Sunday when the twister struck their home while she was at work. She said he had been texting a friend to beware of the approaching storm.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones says crews with dogs and drones have combed over the hardest-hit areas, but there's more searching to be done.

http://facebook.com/DavidNBC4,"COLUMBUS (WCMH) – Spring is here in Ohio, and that means it is the right time to take a wild weather ride again. We had snowfall early Monday morning across a good part of our area, with some seeing upwards of 4 inches of snow overnight. Now we turn the tables and await our next round of weather, severe weather! Late January temperatures to be replaced with late-April readings in next 18 hours Already we are watching on Live Vipir Radar, that rain and thunderstorms are forming well off to the west of us, in an area of relatively cool temperatures. These showers and thunderstorms are going to increase in coverage Monday night as they push towards our backyards with warmer air. I expect that as we start the day on Tuesday we will have waves of moisture with some rumbles of thunder as well moving into our are. Severe threat will be limited to brief periods of moderate rain and lightning early. But as a warm front lifts north through the state, we will begin to see the temperatures surge through the day on Tuesday, as well as see the available moisture increase too. Earlier in the day, some of the data we are seeing is hinting at the possibility of some stronger storms popping up in the late morning/early afternoon heating in the southwest part of the state, and these would be storms that could become large enough to produce hail, gusty winds, or even potentially spin up a tornado. That is why I have kept a low end chance in the forecast for hail and tornadoes. This is not to scare, but to alert you to be aware of this potential, small as it might be. As we head through the day on Tuesday we will see a bit of a lull in the activity and this should give us enough time to warm up into the upper 60s to near 70 across the area. A few positional questions linger as to how far north the warm front lingers, and this may give our northern counties a few more pop-up storms. Into the evening hours, expect the cold front to swing through the area, and this will bring up the chances of seeing severe storms. Cold front brings storms, some strong to severe As we discussed earlier, we should see the risk of severe storms ahead of this cold frontal boundary. It is not to say that during the day some of the pop-up storms may not kick up the winds enough, but the main straight line wind threat appears to occur late with the cold front. Behind the front, a return to winter-like temperatures and skies Clouds will stick behind this front with an irritating northwesterly wind that will be breezy to windy at times early Wednesday, and will remain gusty at times during the day Wednesday. We might have a few lingering light showers early on the backside of this system in the morning, but with highs only in the low to mid 40s, that strong northwesterly flow, will keep wind chills in the 30s at best during the day. Best advice Wednesday, keep the coat handy! As always with severe weather, I always mention to stay tuned, and this is no different. We will continue to tweak the forecast, and will have updates around the clock for you.

Youre probably one of the millions of people who follows at least one source for weather information on Facebook. Active weather is big news on social media, and the ability to find information for just about any town in the countryno matter how remoteis a significant step toward staying weather aware when hazardous conditions approach. However, Facebooks algorithms make relying on the site for immediate severe weather information a risky approach. Its best to rely on Twitter or other media outlets when the skies grow dark.
Facebook is not built for urgency. The sites shift away from chronological posts makes relying on your friendly neighborhood weatherperson to post a status update warning you about an impending tornado outbreak a gamble. You might not see the post for hours or even days after its posted. That doesnt help you much when severe weather is on the way and minutes are precious.
There are several kinds of reach on Facebook. The one were most familiar with is organic reach, or the ability for your friends and followers to see your posts just by virtue of following you. Seeing pictures of your aunts Disney vacation in your Facebook feed is organic reach. Facebook has limited organic reach in recent years for reasons of both volumethere are more posts now than before, and you cant see everythingand profit.

4:50 p.m.
Strong storm winds tore away roofs and pulled down bricks from some buildings in a northeast Mississippi town, but authorities say it's too early to tell if the damage was caused by a tornado or by straight-line winds.
Saturday's storm roughed up the small community of Walnut, pop. 3,000, not far from the state line with Tennessee. Tippah County Emergency Management Director Tom Lindsey says the area that was hit is very rural ""and nothing substantial"" occurred.
National Weather Service meteorologist Marlene Mickelson, based in Memphis, Tennessee, says there were no reports of deaths or injuries though the winds were strong enough to cause the building damage. There were also some reports of area power outages.
Tornado watches are in effect for parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The weather service says those states face an ""enhanced risk"" for severe weather. The volatile weather comes nearly a week after a Southern tornado outbreak killed 23 people, all of them in a large Alabama twister.

2:30 p.m.
Authorities say two small tornadoes touched down briefly in central Arkansas, downing power lines and destroying several buildings.
No injuries were reported.
National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Goudsward in Little Rock says an apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon near Carlisle, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Little Rock and the second was near the unincorporated community of Slovak, about 13 miles (21 kilometers) southeast of Carlisle.
Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman says he had no immediate information of anyone hurt. But he says several power lines are down, at least one home was damaged and several buildings were destroyed. Goudsward said teams would be sent to assess the damage and determine the strength of the tornadoes.

Reuters,"By Gabriella Borter
(Reuters) - A pair of tornadoes killed at least 23 people on Sunday in Alabama, causing infrastructure damage with at least 150 miles per hour (241 kph) winds in the deadliest twister to hit the United States in almost six years.
The following is a list of some of the deadliest single tornadoes and tornado outbreaks in the United States over the last quarter century:
- A so-called Super Outbreak of 362 tornadoes hit the southeastern United States over three days in April 2011, killing an estimated 321 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Three of the tornadoes were rated EF-5, the top of the five-step Enhanced Fujita scale that meteorologists use to measure tornado strength. The system struck Alabama the hardest, wrecking Tuscaloosa and Birmingham and causing about $11 billion in damages across 12 states.
- The deadliest tornado to hit the United States in the last several decades struck Joplin, Missouri on May 22, 2011 and killed at least 158 people, NOAA said. Damage from the storm exceeded $3 billion, the most of any single tornado in U.S. history.
- The so-called Super Tuesday Outbreak of 87 tornadoes in the southeastern United States on Feb. 5, 2008, killed 57 people, according to NOAA. It had the longest footprint of any tornado in U.S. history, according to private forecaster Accuweather, touching down continuously for 122 miles (196 km) through Arkansas.
- A tornado outbreak in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area on May 3, 1999, spawned 61 tornadoes and killed 55 people, with one single tornado responsible for 36 deaths, according to the Weather Channel.
- An outbreak of seven tornadoes in central Florida in February 1998 killed 42 people and injured 260 others in the state's deadliest tornado outbreak since 1962, the National Weather Service reported.
- In April 2014, an outbreak of dozens of tornadoes stirred up by a powerful storm system hit the Southeast and Midwest over a three-day period and killed 32 people in Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, according to NOAA.
- A tornado killed 24 people on May 20, 2013 in Moore, Oklahoma. The tornado had winds over 200 miles per hour (322 kph), giving it the most severe rating of EF-5. It lasted about 40 minutes, and caused billions of dollars worth of damage, according to NOAA.

CBS/AP,"Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Father's Day note to her husband reading, ""Daddy, I love you to pieces."" But the storm took the 53-year-old husband and father.
Dean was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband was home in Beauregard. As forecasters warned stormy weather was heading toward the Alabama-Georgia line, she said, David Wayne Dean sent a text message cautioning a friend to keep up with the weather on the news.
Then the storm hit and David Dean didn't make it out. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbor's yard.
""Our son found him,"" Dean said between sobs Monday. ""He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.""
Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to her husband, a man others called ""Roaddog"" for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriff's deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husband's body lay.
""They took me down to him,"" Dean said, ""and I got to spend a little time with him before they took him away.""

The tornado that struck the area where the Deans lived packed winds estimated at 170 mph and chewed a path of destruction nearly a mile wide. Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble.
Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half. On Monday, the storm's toll stood at 23 people dead in this rural community in Lee County.
According to the sheriff, dozens remained missing after the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years. Rescue crews using dogs and drones searched for victims amid splintered lumber and twisted metal.
""I'm not going to be surprised if we don't come up with some more deceased. Hopefully we won't,"" Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference.
Harris said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academy's Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.
Alabama tornado survivor: ""I was being sucked up into the attic""
Bobby Kidd described to CBS affiliate WIAT-TV the moments a tornado dragged his grandson, 6-year-old A.J. Hernandez, away from his father. ""The house exploded, and the force of the tornado snatched both the kids away from him,"" Kidd told the station.
Hernandez's brother, 10-year-old Jordan Griffin, was taken to the hospital along with his dad. Both are expected to be OK.
An unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, Beauregard is in the same county as Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway.
On the day after the disaster, volunteers used chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers. Neighbors and friends helped one another sift among the ruins.
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the remnants of Morrison's home, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage the couple's safe, her husband's motorcycle boots and her embossed Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub — her husband jumping in at the last minute — as the twister lifted their house off its foundation and swept it into the woods. ""We knew we were flying because it picked the house up,"" Morrison said, figuring that the shower's fiberglass enclosure helped them survive.
Alabama tornado flattens homes, leaves at least 23 dead
The National Weather Service said one and possibly two tornadoes struck the area. A powerful EF-4 twister was blamed for most of the destruction on a path about 24 miles long, meteorologist Chris Darden said.
Darden said the ""monster tornado"" was the deadliest twister to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF-5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma. ""It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground,"" Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Most of the fatalities occurred with a square-mile area, he said. County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was ""pretty sure"" tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings.
Authorities were busy with the search-and-rescue and had not yet looked into the question. The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
An early March tornado outbreak in the Alabama-Mississippi area is not unusual, tornado experts said. The weather service's Storm Prediction Center posted forecasts for higher tornado activity in the region Thursday, three days before the disaster.
Families survey devastation after deadly Alabama tornado
University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters ""were all over it."" An EF-5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people.
And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama. For Beauregard, days of mourning lies ahead.
The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.","Picking through twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Father's Day note to her husband",2019-03-05T13:38:17Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}","""My life is gone,"" woman says after husband dies in tornado",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alabama-tornado-woman-rushed-home-work-walmart-husband-beauregard-lee-county/,https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/05/768f2637-5d74-478f-b2d3-ae78433467a2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/4d3d4e433410995cb9a09a8647d6d76e/alabama-tornado-ap-19063819525375.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,tornado outbreak,1

JENNIFER McDERMOTT,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) President Donald Trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed Bibles at an Alabama church for survivors of a deadly tornado outbreak, many religious leaders say, though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently.
Hershael York, dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary School of Theology in Louisville, Kentucky, said he didn’t have a problem with Trump signing Bibles, like former presidents have, because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking.
“Though we don’t have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it’s not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,” he said. “Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.”
But the Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, said she was offended by the way Trump scrawled his signature Friday as he autographed Bibles and other things, including hats, and posed for photos. She viewed it, she said, as a “calculated political move” by the Republican president to court his evangelical voting base.

Presidents have a long history of signing Bibles, though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message. President Ronald Reagan signed a Bible that was sent secretly to Iranian officials in 1986. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the family Bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939.
It would have been different, Anderson said, if Trump had signed a Bible out of the limelight for someone with whom he had a close connection.
“For me, the Bible is a very important part of my faith, and I don’t think it should be used as a political ploy,” she said. “I saw it being used just as something out there to symbolize his support for the evangelical community, and it shouldn’t be used in that way. People should have more respect for Scripture.”
York said that he, personally, would not ask a politician to sign a Bible, but that he has been asked to sign Bibles after he preaches. It feels awkward, he said, but he doesn’t refuse.
“If it’s meaningful to them to have signatures in their Bible, I’m willing to do that,” he said.
Trump visited Alabama on Friday to survey the devastation and pay respects to tornado victims. The tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide, killing 23 people, including four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family.
At the Providence Baptist Church in Smiths Station, Alabama, the Rev. Rusty Sowell said, the president’s visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover.
Before leaving the church, Trump posed for a photograph with a fifth-grade volunteer and signed the child’s Bible, said Ada Ingram, a local volunteer. The president also signed her sister’s Bible, Ingram said. In photos from the visit, Trump is shown signing the cover of a Bible.
Trump should have at least signed inside in a less ostentatious way, said the Rev. Dr. Kevin Cassiday-Maloney.
“It just felt like hubris,” said Cassiday-Maloney, pastor at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Fargo, North Dakota. “It almost felt like a desecration of the holy book to put his signature on the front writ large, literally.”
He doesn’t think politicians should sign Bibles, he said, because it could be seen as a blurring of church and state and an endorsement of Christianity over other religions.
It would have been out of line if Trump had brought Bibles and given them out, but that wasn’t the case, said James Coffin, executive director of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida.
“Too much is being made out of something that doesn’t deserve that kind of attention,” he said.
Bill Leonard, the founding dean and professor of divinity emeritus at the Wake Forest University School of Divinity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, woke up to Facebook posts Saturday morning by former students who were upset about Trump signing the Bibles because they don’t view him as an appropriate example of spiritual guidance.
But, Leonard said, it’s important to remember that signing Bibles is an old tradition, particularly in southern churches.
Leonard said he would have viewed it as more problematic if the signings were done at a political rally. He doesn’t see how Trump could have refused at the church.
“It would’ve been worse if he had said no because it would’ve seemed unkind, and this was at least one way he could show his concern along with his visit,” he said. “In this setting, where tragedy has occurred and where he comes for this brief visit, we need to have some grace about that for these folks.”

JAY REEVES and KIM CHANDLER,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) With nearly two dozen people killed in a tornado outbreak that shattered a rural community in east Alabama, notifying the families of the dead was a huge, gut-wrenching task done in the privacy of a country church.
Pastor Rusty Sowell, with the county coroner behind him, would put his hand on the door to a Sunday school classroom at Providence Baptist Church, where dozens of family members were told to gather. Inside, people awaited word on whether loved ones were dead or alive.
First they told one family that a relative was dead, and then another. Then there was another and another in a string of heart-stopping gatherings where people heard the worst possible news about an afternoon of absolute horror.
Sowell recalls focusing on peoples’ faces once inside.
Most Read Nation &amp; World Stories
“It was surreal. It was sacred, if I can use that term,” he said.
There were 23 dead in all 17 meetings with relatives just one day after Sowell had preached about the mystery of death and the need for God. His eyes reddened Wednesday at the haunting memory of simply entering room after room after room.
“The toughest part was opening the door and looking in the eyes of that family member who was hoping against hope that it wasn’t their loved one that had died,” said Sowell, pastor of Providence Baptist. “I would say to myself, ‘Just breathe, just breathe.'”
Coroner Bill Harris’ radio had started crackling with a rising death count within minutes after an EF4 tornado ripped apart the Beauregard community in the deadliest U.S. tornado in almost six years. It was the largest of at least 11 twisters that struck the Southeast that day, weather officials said.
First came confirmation of three deaths, he said, then five, then seven. As the number arose into the double digits, he began setting up a temporary command post at a middle school and called for help.
Once the dead were gathered from fields and roads and splintered homes, each was given a post-mortem examination in a portable autopsy facility set up in the parking lot of the local middle school. The dead were identified either through ID cards, tattoos, scars or photos.
“We double-checked it and we doubled-checked it again,” Harris said.
Then came the process of notifying the next of kin at Providence Baptist, located a few miles away from hard-hit areas where pieces of homes litter gullies and ridges stripped bare of trees. Many families already knew the worst, Sowell said, but it was still tough for them to hear the words.
Harris said it was easiest to let Sowell, an old friend, enter each room first, followed by another pastor, himself and then a sheriff’s investigator. As coroner, Harris said, he’s learned to let a pastor or someone else lead the way.
“When you’re the first one in the room they know it’s bad,” he said.
Some cried, Sowell said, and many were in shock. Some leaned on each other; many leaned on God in a community dotted with churches both large and small.
“I saw a lot of love from the family to each other, and a lot of faith. Their faith was holding them up,” he said.
Seven funeral homes in all are handling services for the 23 victims, Harris said, and one mortuary is preparing 10 bodies on its own.
Sowell is now overseeing a disaster recovery operation that’s taking in donations and dispensing food, water, clothes, tarps, cleaning supplies and more from a church building across the road from where families learned their relatives had died.
Harris said he hasn’t had time to think about the emotional magnitude of the loss in a county of more than 160,000 people. Relatives say one extended family lost 10 people in all, and officials said as many as 116 homes were destroyed or severely damaged.
“I’m still in go mode,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to put your blinders on and get the job done.”

The National Weather Service says it has confirmed a tornado by radar that has toppled trees in a Florida Panhandle county, halting traffic on a stretch of Interstate 10 in one direction because of debris.
Meteorologist Don Harrigan with the Tallahassee office of the weather service tells The Associated Press that the tornado hit about 5:45 p.m. Sunday in Walton County in the DeFuniak Springs area. He says radar shows debris was lofted into the air and he was getting reports of trees down in Walton County and eastbound traffic disrupted at Mile Marker 83 on I-10 in the area.
He says the Tallahassee office confirmed other tornadoes on radar in Geneva County in southeast Alabama, just across the line from north Florida. And he says another radar-confirmed tornado was detected in Henry County, Alabama, moving into a neighboring county.
Harrigan says a squall line moving across the Southeast is entering an area of strong, low-level winds that is conducive to forming tornadoes. He says the threat of more tornadoes will continue for several hours as the storm system races toward the Atlantic seaboard.

Bernie Sanders pushes climate-change narrative despite last year’s ‘tornado drought’
In the wake of last weeks deadly twister outbreak, Sen. Bernie Sanders declared that climate change is making tornadoes worse, to which the experts say: Not so fast.
Purdue University professor Ernest Agee, who has studied tornadoes for 50 years, said his research and that of other scientists shows that the number of violent U.S. tornadoes has in fact tapered off slightly in recent decades.
…
Whats more, 2018 was the first year since record-keeping began in 1950 without an EF4 or EF5 tornado, the most devastating twisters, as rated on the Enhanced Fujita Scale from EF0 to EF5, according to the NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center.
Were definitely not seeing a trend of increase. If anything, were seeing a decrease in the number of strong and violent tornadoes, Mr. Agee said. And thats in papers that Ive published and my students and other colleagues that are prominent in the field.
…
Climate change is inevitably blamed for any natural disaster, and Mr. Sanders led the charge following the deadly tornado, saying in a Facebook post, The science is clear, climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse. We must prepare for the impacts of climate change that we know are coming.

He [Sanders] references our study, which says that climate change is shifting eastward.

Bands of lake effect snow show up on radar in western New York on Jan. 30, 2019.Gibson Ridge/NOAA
The National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of calling blizzard conditions and intense cold across the region a &amp;quot;particularly dangerous situation,&amp;quot; strong language reserved for only the most severe storms.

This cold air is key to the blinding lake effect snow pumping off of Lake Erie. Lake effect snow is produced through convection, which is the same process that produces thunderstorms. The warmer lake water warms up the air immediately above the surface of the water. When extremely cold air flows across the lake, the great temperature difference between air at the surface and air aloft can cause the warmer air to rise, producing bands of lake effect snow. This process can occur deep into the winter if&amp;nbsp;the surface of the lake remains uncovered by ice; a week ago,&amp;nbsp;satellite imagery revealed&amp;nbsp;that there was&amp;nbsp;relatively little ice on Lake Erie to save western New York from persistent lake effect snow.
The bands of lake effect snow roaring across western New York have been prolific. Communities under the most persistent bands will end up with several feet of snow by the time the storm is over on Thursday night. Heavy snow and dangerously cold temperatures are bad enough on their own, but the two conditions are combined with gusty winds sending wind chill values plummeting as low as -25&amp;deg;F.
Blizzard conditions can be disorienting for anyone caught outside, which is a life-threatening prospect when wind chills are so low that you can develop frostbite or hypothermia in a matter of minutes. If there was ever a time for meteorologists to&amp;nbsp;use the particularly dangerous situation wording outside of a tornado outbreak, weather conditions cold and snowy enough to disorient and kill you sure seems like its the top contender.

JAY REEVES,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Leaders in this rural Alabama area began working on a community storm shelter months ago, selecting a potential site and meeting to consider how many people might need protection. Plans were still coming along when a giant tornado descended, leaving nearly two dozen bodies inside splintered homes and scattered across Beauregard’s fields and country roads.
Now that the worst has happened, Fire Chief Mike Holden said, perhaps everyone will agree on a final plan and find the funding to remedy a situation that much of Alabama addressed about eight years ago after twisters killed more than 250 people statewide in one day.
“I’m hoping this will open up some FEMA money for it,” Holden said Thursday while helping guide recovery efforts.
Part of the trick, officials said, is finding the proper mix of public and private shelters to help an unincorporated area inhabited by roughly 11,000 people. Many residents aren’t clustered in orderly subdivisions but spread out along county highways and dirt roads.

The massive EF4 twister that demolished parts of Beauregard was the worst of 30 tornadoes that raked the Southeast on Sunday, snapping pine trees and pushing entire homes into gullies. Damage is particularly bad along two roads where friends and extended families lived in mobile homes and small houses.
As the sky darkened and storm warnings flashed, dozens of people fled to the safety of the area’s one community shelter, Providence Baptist Church. Cindy Sanford was cleaning out a closet when she felt the need to leave with her grandson; she returned to find her mobile home demolished, but they were safe.
Others didn’t have time to leave home, didn’t feel the need or didn’t know where to go.
Bobby Kidd lost his 6-year-old grandson, AJ Hernandez, when the twister exploded their home, hurling the family through the air. Kidd doesn’t know whether having additional shelters would have saved his grandson or anyone else, but he wishes more were available.
“I’m not going to say that if there were more locations for people to go to that lives wouldn’t have been lost, but we only have one location. We really do need more. More that are closer,” he said.
Federal grant money helped fund the construction of hundreds of shelters after the deadly tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011 nearly all in north Alabama, where most of the deaths occurred. Lee County, home to Beauregard in east Alabama, wasn’t hit by a tornado that day and didn’t share in much of the federal money that helped pay for in-home and community shelters elsewhere.
But a study published by the American Journal of Public Health after an analysis of the 2011 outbreak showed the need for community shelters, and leaders of the Beauregard Volunteer Fire Department want one.
Holden said the department has discussed plans to add one and possibly two 40-person shelters at a new fire station that will be near a planned athletic complex. Tornado and sports seasons overlap, he said, and having shelters so near athletic fields would provide cover for people in severe weather.
“This has been an ongoing plan for more than a year,” he said. Efforts to obtain grants and other funding have slowed progress, Holden said.
Others aren’t so sure about the value of shelters that aren’t at people’s homes.
Kathy Carson, director of the Lee County Emergency Management Agency, said a basic mass shelter that holds 90 people can cost $140,000, and the return may not be worth the investment.
“People are not going to sit in that thing for six hours during a (tornado) watch, and by the time a warning is out, it’s too late,” she said. “I think the answer is in-home shelters.”
Community shelters constructed after the 2011 outbreak were publicly credited with saving lives during a 2016 tornado in the northwest Alabama town of Aliceville, but Carson said there was no guarantee anything would have helped in Beauregard.
“This is the worst of the worst that struck here, and (residents) had no protection unless they were underground,” she said.
About an hour before the storm hit, Lee County emergency managers posted on social media that the tornado-producing storm would track over the county and urged people, particularly in mobile homes, to evacuate to a “safer location.” They noted that Providence Baptist and locations at Auburn University, about 9 miles (15 kilometers) away, were available as shelters.
Rita Smith, a spokesman for the county emergency management office, said 19 individual shelters were constructed in the county from grants after the 2011 outbreak, but the cost is too high for many people, even with federal assistance.
“It is heartbreaking for us. We would love to be able to have a shelter in every community, everywhere we could put one. It is just not financially feasible,” Smith said.
The agency has applied for funds for a community shelter in the county, Smith said, but she declined to provide details such as the possible location.
Sen. Doug Jones, who toured some of the damage, said the devastation may hold lessons for the future.
“You use tragedies like this to try to look forward and see what you could have done better, and I think we’ll do that here,” the Alabama Democrat said.

We typically think of severe weather outbreaks as a problem in the spring, but thunderstorms can hit you just as hard in the autumn. A multi-day severe thunderstorm event is likely across parts of the south on Wednesday and Thursday, including storms that could rumble through around the time that kids are out trick-or-treating. A sharp&amp;nbsp;upper-level trough moving out of the Rocky Mountains on Wednesday will lead to the development of a low-pressure system over the south-central United States. Severe thunderstorms are possible on Wednesday and Thursday in the warm, unstable air to the southeast of the center of low pressure. The severe threat will develop in central Texas during the day on Wednesday and progress east through the evening and overnight hours. The forecast from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) early Wednesday morning painted much of eastern Texas and Louisiana under an enhanced risk, which is a three out of five on the scale used to measure the threat for severe weather. A slight risk for severe weather, a two out of five, stretches from central Texas through Mississippi. &amp;nbsp;Wednesdays forecast map is shown at the top of this article.

Dennis Mersereau The active weather will shift east as the low-pressure system moves into the Mid-South on Thursday. The greatest threat on Thursday will likely be damaging straight-line winds in any lines of storms that can tap into strong wind shear. However, the SPC noted on Tuesday that a tornado or two is possible in storms that form along and near the northern Gulf Coast around New Orleans and Mobile. Its common to see severe thunderstorm events in the fall months as powerful cold fronts scour into the warm and humid air flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico. The latter half of fall is commonly referred to by meteorologists as the second severe weather season because of the uptick in damaging thunderstorms in parts of the southern United States as strong storm systems traverse the country.

Rachel Reeves,"Residents across several parts of the central United States will have to remain alert for potentially damaging thunderstorms through Monday. Late Sunday, severe storms triggered large hail and high winds across the central and southern Plains. Some of these same areas will be at risk for severe weather on Monday, as well as locations farther east. Any severe storm has the potential to endanger lives and property. Even in the absence of severe weather, anyone outdoors during a thunderstorm is at risk of being struck by lightning.

Shaddi Abusaid,"Brace yourselves, Atlanta. Severe weather is coming. 
Damaging winds, large hail and even tornadoes are possible starting as early as 7 a.m. Sunday, Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Eboni Deon said. 
Timing could change, but the storms are expected to move across Alabama and into Georgia overnight, sticking around for most of Sunday before settling down by late afternoon or evening.
Winds stronger than 60 mph are possible as well as tornadoes and an inch or more of hail, Deon said, calling for a 90 percent chance of rain the second half of the weekend.
Planning ahead for Sunday's storms, it will get active early. Our northwest and west counties could see storms as early as 7AM/8AM. Severe storms will be possible for ALL of north Georgia. I'll have an update at noon. #wsbpic.twitter.com/t40ccKCRHm

 “The rain stretches from Texas all the way into the Lower Mississippi Valley,” Deon said of the approaching storm system. “That energy will be moving in our direction overnight into early Sunday morning. ... We’ll have heavy rain and the possibility of hail as well as tornadoes and strong damaging winds early in the day.”
The storms could affect the Masters, which saw brief delays on Friday during short showers.

“I do think the Masters will experience a chance for showers and thunderstorms on Sunday, and (the chance) will be growing that afternoon,” meteorologist Glenn Burns said.
Scattered showers are expected to reach Augusta by the afternoon or evening.
The good news is that the wet weather should clear out some of this pollen.
Saturday’s pollen count reached 6,575 particles per cubic meter of air, which is considered “extremely high.”
“The pollen count has gone way up,” Deon said. “We need the rainfall to wash this out.” 
Pollen count...EXTREMELY HIGH! We do have rain on Sunday that could help some, but it's not going to last long. We're back to dry conditions early next week. pic.twitter.com/IejPYZHTXX

The strong cold front should clear North Georgia by late Sunday, leaving the air behind it cooler and drier. Monday morning lows are expected to be chilly in the 40s and highs will only reach the 60s.

Richard Payerchin,"A century ago, Lorainites were mourning the loss of their native sons and praying for a swift end to World War I. But a rapidly spreading illness at home claimed the lives of more Lorain residents than fighting overseas. In October 1918, Allied forces were claiming victory after victory in battles across Europe in the Great War. But at the same time, the flu pandemic of 1918 struck the world, including Lorain. Its an episode that was relatively brief compared to four years of trench warfare. As a result, the spread of the flu and its local effects may be less well known than other historical events of Lorain, Ohio or around the world. We have massive files on World War I, but not a lot on the flu, said Kaitlyn Goss Donaldson, collections supervisor at the Lorain Historical Society. But in Lorain, the flu outbreak would claim 200 lives, more than World War I and the Great Tornado of 1924 combined. That was just one city. The flu caused an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide, with 675,000 of those in the United States, said Cindy Modie, director of community health for Lorain County Public Health. The flu is one of the most overlooked tragedies of the 20th century, I believe, said Jim Smith, a local historian. Lorain history A few historical references to the flu outbreak cropped up over the years. The Lorain Historical Society has an American Red Cross nurses uniform worn by Mae Ginnane during the flu epidemic of 1918, Donaldson said. Ginnane was among those treating victims who were bed-ridden at Lorain High School, which became a makeshift hospital. A Century of Care, the 1992 memorial book published for the 100th anniversary of the former St. Joseph Hospital, had a brief reference to the hospital and other buildings filled to capacity with flu victims. Two nuns and a probationer nurse caught the flu and numbered among 200 Lorainites who died. Year 1918 As the weather turns colder, Ohioans get ready for winter and flu season through the winter. But conditions in 2018 are different from those of the flu outbreak of 1918, Modie said. There was no flu vaccine in 1918, she said. In fact, the flu virus wasnt even typed back then. The 1918 strain was a form of Influenza A that was new at the time, Modie said. Back then, no one had any protection to it, she said. It was a brand new strain, which is why it was a pandemic. No one had any immunity to it. Researchers and historians now believe the flu started at Fort Riley, Kan., among troops there. Yeah, they were sick, but they were in the military and there was a war, so they got shipped, Modie said. They carried the disease to Europe, where it spread, and it returned to the United States. Spain, a neutral country in World War I, began tracking deaths. Misinterpretation of the Spanish efforts ultimately led to a name, or misnomer, for the illness, which became known as Spanish flu, Modie said. In 2018, people may think of babies and older people as most susceptible to effects of the flu. A century ago, the 1918 flu affected young people in their 20s and 30s, Modie said. Im trying to paint the picture that this was sheer pandemonium, she said. Think about that - there was no effective treatment; they werent sure what it was. In Lorain The factors are identifiable in hindsight. A century ago, the flu led to drastic measures locally. On Oct. 7, 1918, the Lorain Times-Herald had headline: Flu Here But Is Not Epidemic. The next day: Heres How To Check The Flu. City health officer Dr. Valloyd Adair advised the sick to stay away from others. Victims would do well to remain in bed during the period of high temperature of fever, not only for his own good, but for the protection of others. The situation changed quickly. By Oct. 11, 1918, the newspaper read: Close Up City To Fight Flu. Mayor A.J. Horn issued a proclamation: All movies, theaters, churches and Sunday schools, all schools and dance halls were ordered closed. All loafing in billiard halls, soda parlors and saloons was prohibited, to be enforced by police. The move has been taken to check Spanish flu, the article said. Ten days later, there were 3,000 cases of flu in Lorain. The day after that, Lorain High School was taken over for use as a hospital, according to the Lorain Times-Herald. Calls went out for cots and volunteers: doctors, nurses, then anyone who could distribute water and medicine. The paper focused on Lorain, but there were occasional references to other communities. On Oct. 10, there were 250 flu cases in Wellington; on Oct. 23, there were 50 new flu cases in Elyria, along with 50 cases of smallpox, according to the newspapers. Stop the spread Doctors and people generally saw the disease would spread from the sick to the healthy in close contact. In an Oct. 8, 1918, article of the Lorain Times-Herald, Adair advised the sick to stay away from others. Victims would do well to remain in bed during the period of high temperature of fever, not only for his own good but for the protection of others. A Lorain Times-Herald article from Oct. 12, 1918, advised people to avoid needless crowding, smother your cough and sneezes, wash your hands frequently and dont use a napkin, towel, spoon, fork, glass or cup that has been used by another person. It was sound advice, that now is, backed up by science. But in 1918, doctors treating the flu had no anti-viral medications. Side effects included pneumonia and dehydration, which can be treated more easily now with medicine and intravenous fluids, Modie said. It was almost like the perfect storm of why it was so catastrophic, she said. By Oct. 29, 1918, the Lorain Times-Herald said the city could show optimism with only three flu deaths reported in 24 hours. But it also carried an influenza warning, noting the danger of the epidemic had not passed. For days, the paper would carry reports of more deaths of flu or complications. Another reference As months turned into years, in some ways, the flu faded from local memory. I think with all the jubilance of the end of the war, the pandemic was quickly forgotten, Smith said. People wanted to get on with their lives. After the Great Tornado of 1924, Lorain High School was used as a morgue for the dead, a grim necessity that has become lore of the city. That was a historic second, Smith said. The 1936 Lorain High School Scimitar was dedicated to Dalton J. Boone, who served as Lorain school superintendent from 1914 to 1935. A photo collage in the yearbook includes a picture of people lying in bed. It is not a hospital. It shows Lorain High School, the first time it became a medical ward in 1918, because of the flu, Smith said. Every day during the epidemic, 267 dreadfully sick people were living or dying within the deskless rooms and halls of Lorain High School, said the tribute to Dalton. His boys and girls and their parents.","Baltimore Sun Looking back at Lorain's devastating flu outbreak, 100 years later The Morning Journal A century ago, Lorainites were mourning the loss of their native sons and praying for a swift end to World War I.

James Spann,"From James Spann and the ABC 33/40 Weather Blog : DRY DAYS: Drier air is over Alabama this morning; we will forecast a partly sunny sky today with a high in the low to mid 70s. We expect a field of cumulus clouds this afternoon, but the low levels are just too dry for any rain. The weekend will be delightful. Sunshine in full supply both days; the high tomorrow will be in the 75-78 degree range, but Sunday will be a bit cooler with a high in the low 70s. RACE WEEKEND: Today at the Talladega Superspeedway the sky will be partly sunny day with a high in the low 70s. Then, the weather could not be any better for the weekend. Sunny tomorrow and Sunday; temperatures reach the mid 70s tomorrow followed by a high in the low 70s Sunday for the Geico 500. MULLET TOSS: The annual event at the Flora-Bama draws huge crowds, and the weekend on the Gulf Coast will be spectacular. Sunny days, fair nights through Sunday with highs in the 70s. Water temperatures in the Gulf are running in the mid 70s. NEXT WEEK: A building upper ridge will bring the warmest weather so far this year to Alabama as May begins. Monday’s high will be near 80, followed by low 80s Tuesday, and mid 80s Wednesday and Thursday. The ridge will also keep us dry most of the week. To the west of Alabama, a significant severe weather event is likely by mid-week across the Great Plains. SPC is already showing an enhanced risk potential on their Day 6 outlook for Wednesday… The upper trough responsible for this is expected to weaken and lift well to the north of Alabama; it will push a band of showers and storms into our state Friday of next week (May 4), but for now severe storms don’t look likely here. See the Weather Xtreme video for maps, graphics, and more details. ON THIS DATE SEVEN YEARS AGO: A generational tornado outbreak for Alabama. A total of 62 tornadoes, responsible for 252 deaths and over 2,000 injuries. A morning round of storms with damaging winds and tornadoes was responsible for knocking out power to almost a quarter of a million people in the state. But it got even more serious later in the day. There were three EF-5 tornadoes… one of them slammed into Hackleburg, destroying subdivisions, Hackleburg High School and the Wranger Plant. It continues on, with wind speeds reaching 210 m.p.h., leaving a trail of devastation in Phil Campbell and Tanner. The storm travels approximately 132 miles through six counties, killing 72 people and inflicting $1.2 billion in damage. The EF-4 that moved through Tuscaloosa, and communities around the Birmingham metro like Concord, Pleasant Grove, and Pratt City, killed 65 and injured over 1,500. Another EF-4 tore through Cullman; it was on the ground for 47 miles. One thing we learned that day… physical science is not enough. The loss of life was incredibly high despite excellent warnings for all 62 tornadoes. Social science knowledge must be blended in to make the warning process better.

Chris Enloe,"In what was slated to be a trip to Alabama to comfort those impacted by severe weather last week including a tornado outbreak that killed 23 people President Donald Trump ignited outrage after he was pictured signing several Bibles, which supporters had requested he sign.
Trump's actions generated two schools of thought: Some said signing the Bibles was deeply offensive, while others said Trump did not seek out the Bibles, and was only doing what he could to comfort storm victims when he obliged their requests. 
But what do Christian leaders say?
Several Christian leaders spoke with the Associated Press, explaining their thoughts on the outrage. Some said what Trump did was not wrong seeing that Trump's presidential predecessors were known to sign Bibles while others said Trump's actions were deeply offensive.
Hershael York, dean of theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told the AP that Trump likely signed the Bibles because their owners believed his signature was meaningful.
""Though we don't have a national faith, there is faith in our nation, and so it's not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their Bibles,"" he said. ""Those Bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are, too.""
Bill Leonard, founding dean and professor of divinity emeritus at Wake Forest's School of Divinity, highlighted the fact that Trump signed the Bibles in a church, not at a political rally.
""It would've been worse if he had said no because it would've seemed unkind, and this was at least one way he could show his concern along with his visit,"" he told the AP. ""In this setting, where tragedy has occurred and where he comes for this brief visit, we need to have some grace about that for these folks.""
Similarly, James Coffin, executive director of the Interfaith Council of Central Florida, told the AP the story does not deserve the outrage it generated.
""Too much is being made out of something that doesn't deserve that kind of attention,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Rev. Dr. Kevin Cassiday-Maloney, a pastor from Fargo, North Dakota, told the AP that Trump's signature does not belong anywhere near a Bible let alone on the front cover.
""It just felt like hubris,"" he said. ""It almost felt like a desecration of the holy book to put his signature on the front writ large, literally.""","In what was slated to be a trip to Alabama to comfort those impacted by severe weather last week — including a tornado outbreak that killed 23 people — President Donald Trump ignited outrage after he was pictured signing several Bibles, which supporters had r…",2019-03-10T11:30:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theblaze.com'}",Outrage erupted after Trump signed Bibles.

Sarah K. Burris,"Oklahoma voted overwhelmingly for President Donald Trump and now the Republican leader is hitting back against his most loyal supporters, KFOR news reported. In his budget, Trump has proposed gutting the National Weather Service in an area of the country that depends on forecasters and meteorologists to protect them from extreme weather events. Norman, Oklahoma is the location of one of “For some bizarre reason, the president is proposing to cut 248 forecasters,” National Weather Service Legislative Director Richard Hirn told KFOR. “Should the public be concerned about these potential staff cuts? I think the answer is yes because – even though you see things coming down the pipe for days, sometimes weeks in advance – even those last few minutes or hours can make a huge difference on the outcome as to what type of severe weather in this particular case that we may receive,” KFOR meteorologist Mike Morgan explained. The NWS could lose more than 350 staffers, the vast majority of which would be forecasters. “The Trump administration has proposed to effectively eliminate 20 percent of the forecasters or front-line operational employees at the 122 forecast offices around the country,” Hirn said. Hirn warned it could mean closing the NWS in Norman during nights and on weekends. Many of the state’s worst tornadoes have been late in the afternoon and a powerful storm doesn’t check the calendar to see whether it’s Monday through Friday. “That office would be closed in the evening and another office, maybe in Tulsa or in Texas, will be responsible for issuing the warnings,” Hirn said. Weather warnings aren’t the only concern, the National Weather Service data is used by airports to determine safety for takeoff and landing of planes. “It would be fair to say I think, if there was any delay of information regarding weather really when it’s inclement weather, that that could have an impact on our operations and our traveling public,” Will Rogers Airport Spokesperson Karen Carney said. Since the first EF5 tornado to hit Moore, Oklahoma May 3, 1999, Oklahoma has had six EF5 tornadoes. Since the 1999 outbreak, Oklahoma has had 1,193 tornadoes and 3,739 since 1950. The National Weather Service might be headquartered in Oklahoma, but it also helps other satellite locations with forecasting in neighboring red states. That includes Kansas, which suffered from a severe EF5 tornado that wiped Greensburg off the map in 2007. Missouri similarly had a major EF5 tornado that hit Joplin in 2011. In 2013, the NWS got a boost to their budget so that they could improve computing power needed to make quicker forecasts and save more lives.

"Aylin Woodward, Business Insider","Yesterday, over the course of a single afternoon, Lee County, Alabama, was ravaged by back-to-back tornadoes.
The one-two punch brought winds of 170 miles per hour (270 kilometres per hour), which ripped homes off their foundations, destroyed property, injured dozens, and killed at least 23 people.
But these twisters were only two of some three dozen tornado reports across the Southeastern US yesterday.
According to The Weather Channel, tornadoes were reported in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina as far west as Mobile, Alabama, and as far north as Columbia, South Carolina.
All the reports came within a span of a few hours, starting in the early afternoon and ending in the early evening.
When multiple tornadoes occur in a short amount of time across a large region as a result of a single weather system, it's called a ""tornado outbreak.""
While the exact number of tornadoes that swept this part of the country has yet to be determined, it was undoubtedly the ""deadliest tornado day"" since 2013, when an Oklahoma storm with winds gusting at 200 mph killed 24 people.
Yesterday's tornado outbreak caused double the number of tornado-related deaths that the US saw in the entirety of last year.
It also confirmed a trend that climatologists and scientists have been worriedly watching: Tornado outbreaks in the Southeastern US are getting worse.
North America sees dozens of tornado outbreaks annually, and the number of tornadoes that occur per outbreak seems to be increasing.
A 2016 study found that the average number of tornadoes in these outbreaks has increased since 1954, from 10 to 15. Between 1972 and 2010, outbreaks were associated with 79 percent of all tornado fatalities. The chance of these extreme outbreaks has also increased.
""When it comes to tornadoes, almost everything terrible that happens, happens in outbreaks,"" Michael Tippett, the lead author of that study, said in a press release.
""If outbreaks contain more tornadoes on average, then the likelihood they will cause damage somewhere increases.""
Tippett's research tracks where tornado outbreaks might become more intense. His data suggest that the part of the Southeast that was hit yesterday, particularly Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, is seeing trends of increasing activity.
Sunday's tornado outbreak was ""consistent with trends that we've been seeing for several years now,"" he said.
Lee County, Alabama which is 80 miles north of Montgomery, Alabama suffered the most in the recent outbreak. Two tornadoes touched down there within a span of 10 minutes, and all of yesterday's reported deaths were in that area.
According to the National Weather Service, one of the tornadoes that hit Lee County was an EF-4 storm, the second-most severe designation, with 170-mph winds.
The track of that ""monster tornado"" was at least 24 miles (39 kilometres) long, The New York Times reported.
The average distance tornadoes travel is about 3.5 miles (6 kilometres), according to the Storm Prediction Center, so this was far above average in that regard.
An even more deadly tornado outbreak occurred in 2011. It spawned 363 tornadoes across North America, caused US$11 billion in damages, and killed more than 350 people.
Climate change has been suggested as a contributing factor to the trend Tippett has observed, but he said the jury is still out on that.
""The consensus is we'd expect to have more thunderstorms and tornado activity in a warmer climate, but it's not completely clear that these trends we're seeing now are a result of climate change,"" he said.

"Clark Mindock, Clark Mindock","A tornado warning has been put into place across much of Pennsylvania, where at least one destructive twister has already struck a nursing home. The confirmed tornado is a part of an outbreak of severe weather in the state which was observed on Tuesday afternoon, as well as in parts of Ohio, New York, and New Jersey. The National Weather Service said that a tornado warning will remain in effect for almost the entire state of Pennsylvania until Tuesday evening at around 11pm EDT. A tornado warning does not necessarily mean that more tornadoes will be seen in the area, but is indicative of hospitable conditions for one to form. Watch more Major cities in the state that are currently under the warning include Pittsburgh, State College, Allentown, and Scranton. The main area identified for tornado conditions stops short of Philadelphia, in the far east of the state.

Reuters,"By Gabriella Borter
(Reuters) - Alabama search and rescue teams on Tuesday were combing through the wreckage of houses flatted by weekend tornadoes, looking for seven or eight people who remained unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. twister outbreak since 2013.
The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, was beginning to mourn the 23 people confirmed killed by the storms, which included four children and seven people from one family, officials said on Tuesday.
The victims ranged in age from 6 to 93 years old, Bill Harris, coroner for storm-ravaged Lee County, told a morning news conference.
""Just keep these families in your prayers,"" Harris said.
Most of the deceased were found in close proximity to their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, officials said.
County Sheriff Jay Jones said on Tuesday that search crews had narrowed their scope down to ""the most affected areas"" after scouring much of the county on Monday. He said he hoped the search and rescue effort would become a recovery effort by the end of the day.
The tornadoes, stirred up by a late-winter ""supercell"" thunderstorm, toppled mobile homes and uprooted massive trees on Sunday with 170 mile-per-hour (274 km-per hour) winds. Forecasters ranked the worst of the outbreak at step four of the six-step Enhanced Fujita scale of tornado strength.
The Beauregard community in the twister's path might have had as few as eight or nine minutes to seek shelter from the time the warning was issued, National Weather Service chief meteorologist Chris Darden said.
In addition to 23 confirmed deaths, more than 50 people were reported injured, authorities said, making this the deadliest tornado outbreak since a massive tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, killing 24 people and injuring 375 others.

The Associated Press,"Alabama: Rescue crews using dogs and drones searched for victims amid splintered lumber and twisted metal Monday after the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years ripped through a rural Alabama community. At least 23 people were killed, some of them children.
Dozens were missing in Lee County nearly a day after the twister struck, according to the sheriff, who said that crews had combed the hardest-hit areas but that other places had yet to be searched.

The winds Sunday afternoon obliterated numerous homes, leaving huge, jumbled piles of wood and household belongings. Some homes were reduced to concrete slabs. Debris was scattered across the countryside, with shredded metal hanging from the pine trees.
""I'm not going to be surprised if we don't come up with some more deceased. Hopefully we won't,"" Coroner Bill Harris said. He said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10.
On the day after the disaster, volunteers used chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers. Neighbors and friends helped one another find some of their belongings in the ruins. At the R&amp;D Grocery, rattled residents asked each other if they were OK. And a big banner that read ""#BEAUREGARDSTRONG"" was hung on a fence at Beauregard High School.
""I'm still thanking God I'm among the living,"" said John Jones, who has lived most of his life in Beauregard, an unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people about 60 miles east of Montgomery near the Georgia state line.
The National Weather Service said one and possibly two tornadoes struck the area, with a powerful EF-4 twister with winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) blamed for most of the destruction. It carved a path nearly a mile (1.6 kilometers) wide and 24 miles (39 kilometers) long, said meteorologist Chris Darden.
Darden said the ""monster tornado"" was the deadliest twister to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF-5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
""It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground,"" Sheriff Jay Jones said.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was ""pretty sure"" that tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings but that authorities were busy with the search-and-rescue and had not yet looked into the question.
Crews searching door-to-door used dogs as well as drones that can detect heat from a body. ""We're basically using everything we can get our hands on,"" the sheriff said.
President Donald Trump tweeted that he told the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give Alabama ""the A Plus treatment.""
The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
Don Willis, who lives near the Lee County community of Smiths Station with his wife, four daughters and four dogs, said the twister came within about a mile of their home as the children and pets took cover in the closet and bathroom.
He said he had been through numerous tornadoes over the years and had never heard one as loud.
""You could feel the energy that it was sucking into that system. It was the most crazy sound,"" Willis said. ""It sounded like a living, breathing beast.""
""All we could do is just hold on for life and pray,"" said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their Beauregard trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. ""It's a blessing from God that me and my young'ns are alive.""
Beauregard, named for a Confederate general, is in a corner of the same county that is home to Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway that runs through it.
""Everybody in Beauregard is a real close-knit family,"" Clardy said. ""Everybody knows everybody around here. Everybody is heartbroken.""
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the ruins of Morrison's home in Beauregard, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage her husband's motorcycle boots and a Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub as the twister lifted their house off the ground and swept it into the woods.""We knew we were flying because it picked the house up,"" Morrison said, figuring that the shower's fiberglass enclosure helped them survive. She said her son-in-law later dug them out.
Along one hard-hit country road, giant pieces of metal from a farm building dangled from pine branches 20 feet (6 meters) in the air, making loud creaking sounds as the wind blew. For an entire mile down the road, pines were snapped in half. A mobile home crushed by two trees marked the end of the path of destruction.An early March tornado outbreak in the Alabama-Mississippi area is not unusual, tornado experts said.
The weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, posted forecasts for higher tornado activity in the region on Thursday, three days before the disaster. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters ""were all over it.""An EF-5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people. And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama.

JEFF MARTIN and KIM CHANDLER,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Father’s Day note to her husband reading, “Daddy, I love you to pieces.” But the storm took the 53-year-old husband and father.
Dean was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband was home in Beauregard. As forecasters warned stormy weather was heading toward the Alabama-Georgia line, she said, David Wayne Dean sent a text message cautioning a friend to keep up with the weather on the news.
Then the storm hit and David Dean didn’t make it out. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbor’s yard.
“Our son found him,” Dean said between sobs Monday. “He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.”

The tornado that struck the area where the Deans lived packed winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and chewed a path of destruction nearly a mile (1.6 kilometer) wide. Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half.
On Monday, the storm’s toll stood at 23 people dead in this rural community in Lee County. According to the sheriff, dozens remained missing after the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years. Rescue crews using dogs and drones searched for victims amid splintered lumber and twisted metal.
“I’m not going to be surprised if we don’t come up with some more deceased. Hopefully we won’t,” Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference. He said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academy’s Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.

“It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground,” Sheriff Jay Jones said. Most of the fatalities occurred with a square-mile (2.6 square kilometer) area, he said.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was “pretty sure” tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings. But authorities were busy with the search-and-rescue and had not yet looked into the question.

For Beauregard, days of mourning lies ahead. The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.
After the storm, Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to the husband others called Roaddog, for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriff’s deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husband’s body lay.
“They took me down to him,” Dean said, “and I got to spend a little time with him before they took him away.”

Abbie Bennett,"Election Day in the Carolinas could be a soggy one, and theres a chance of severe storms as voters head to the polls. A strong cold front is pushing a line of showers and thunderstorms ahead of it east and is expected to move into North and South Carolina Tuesday, reaching the central part of both states by Tuesday afternoon and evening, according to the National Weather Service. Some of those storms could strengthen and become severe producing damaging winds, heavy rainfall and possibly an isolated tornado, the weather services Raleigh office said. Storms could begin to move into western North Carolina and much of western and central South Carolina beginning Tuesday morning, and will reach the Triad area of North Carolina around noon, NWS Raleigh meteorologist Kathleen Carroll told The News &amp; Observer Monday. The Triangle area and eastern South Carolina could see the storms move in closer to 3 or 4 p.m., Carroll said. North Carolinas coast likely wont see storms until Tuesday evening. The intensity of Tuesdays storms will depend on how warm in gets, and how clear skies are ahead of the cold front, Carroll said. Parts of western North Carolina and the Triad could see less severe storms, while the Triangle and areas east of Interstate 95 could see stronger storms, she said. But the main threat to voters in the Carolinas will be periods of heavy rain and the possible thunderstorms that could make waiting at the polls miserable, or potentially dangerous. People should probably bring a rain jacket or poncho with them when they go vote, Carroll said. And maybe an umbrella, though heavy winds could make that a hazard. Just be prepared to get wet. Since wind gusts could reach 25 mph or higher in North Carolina as storms strengthen, Carroll said people should monitor the weather when they head to the polls and have a plan to get inside if things worsen. Straight-line wind gusts from severe storms could reach 60-70 mph, NWS Columbia meteorologist Doug Anderson told The State, which could damage trees or power lines. The strongest weather will be in (South Carolinas) Upstate, but its southern edge will be in Columbia and the Midlands and move in a northeast direction up through Charlotte and Raleigh, Anderson said. A dense fog also was possible for Monday night in the Columbia, S.C. area, the weather service reported. A fog advisory may be issued. The same cold front heading into the Carolinas Tuesday was moving over other parts of the South Monday, bringing strong winds, large hail and tornadoes according to the weather service. A significant severe weather outbreak is forecast to intensify Monday night with potential for very large tornadoes EF-2 or greater possible, the weather service said. Election Day will be the warmest day of the week across the Carolinas, with temperatures rising into the 70s, ABC11 meteorologists reported Monday. While the advancing cold front will bring storms and the potential for a heavy downpour, ABC11 meteorologists said people shouldnt expect more than one or two hours of rainfall.","News & Observer Strong storms with damaging winds, tornadoes possible on Election Day in the Carolinas News & Observer Election Day in the Carolinas could be a soggy one, and there's a chance of severe storms as voters head to the polls.

The Associated Press,"Two apparent tornadoes touched down Saturday in central Arkansas, destroying shops as severe storms raking the South damaged some buildings and tore away roofs in northeast Mississippi.
There were no reports of any deaths or injuries from the widespread storms, which came nearly a week after a large tornado killed 23 people in Alabama amid an outbreak of Southern twisters.
An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon near Carlisle, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Little Rock and the second storm was near the unincorporated community of Slovak, southeast of Carlisle, said National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Goudsward.
Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman in Arkansas said several buildings were destroyed, power lines were brought down and at least one home was damaged.

“It was more than straight-line winds. One of the shops, it had debris strewn over two miles, (another) one of them was just twisted in a big twist with metal on top of automobiles that were in there,” Hickman said.
Goudsward, based with the weather service in Little Rock, Arkansas, said teams would be sent to assess the damage and determine the strength of those storms.
In northeast Mississippi, strong winds tore away roofs and pulled down bricks from some buildings in the small community of Walnut, population about 3,000. Emergency Management Director Tom Lindsey, for the region’s Tippah County, said the area that was hit was very rural.
Weather service meteorologist Marlene Mickelson in Memphis, Tennessee, said there were no reports of injuries from the storm in Walnut. But authorities said it was still too early to tell if the damage there was caused by a tornado or by straight-line winds.
A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area. The watches issued Saturday for Tennessee and Mississippi were in effect until 6 p.m. EST and for Arkansas and Louisiana until 4 p.m. EST.
The weather service’s Storm Prediction Center also warned of the possibility of damaging winds and large hail and said via Twitter that cities at risk Saturday included Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky, among others. Forecasters said many of the affected areas were also at risk of flooding.","Two apparent tornadoes touched down Saturday in central Arkansas, destroying shops as severe storms raking the South damaged some buildings and tore away roofs in northeast Mississippi.

Ken Jorgustin,"Have you ever wondered when exactly is ‘tornado season’?
Tornado season doesn’t span an “exact” time frame. It occurs at different times for different regions of the United States. The season typically shifts northward from early spring into the mid summer months.
The important thing to remember is that a tornado can happen any time of the year if the conditions are right.
That said, the following regions of the United States will experience ‘tornado season’ during these months:
Gulf CoastApril
Southern PlainsMay – early June
Northern Plains, Upper MidwestJune – July
Mid-AtlanticJuly

David Magee,"If Mother Nature were a person, she could be judged as having a breakdown. The weather and climate these past weeks has been crazy. We’ve experienced the world’s hottest rain, a weird jet stream, unusually warm ocean water, raging wildfires and more. It’s as if Mother Nature has lost her mind. Let’s start with the jet stream, considering how it did something so unusual, taking the type of deep knee bend toward the Gulf of Mexico that almost never happens this time of year. In January, perhaps. August? Almost never. But it happened in late July, driving up humidity across the southeast region with a strong pull of moisture from the gulf at the same time temperatures soared. Typically, the jet stream spends the hot summer resting in Canada, before dipping into the states beginning in the fall. Its deepest dives don’t often arrive until winter – the type that brings a rare snowflake to, say, Hattiesburg, Mississippi when cold air combines with moisture. But that’s not what happened in late July. “The jet stream has stretched all the way from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico over the eastern U.S., helping to trigger the intense tornado outbreak in Iowa, and the persistent, torrential rains in the Mid-Atlantic,” Jeff Halverson, Capital Weather Gang’s severe weather expert, told The Washington Post. “Even veteran meteorologists with decades of experience are astounded by the extreme nature of this jet stream pattern.” Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now The result still lingers, since moisture that spilled upward into the states from this phenomenon is what’s agitating high temperatures from Chicago to Birmingham, Alabama, making for excessive heat. Officials say more people take to the streets in the heat, and the mix can be lethal. This past weekend in Chicago, 66 people were shot and 12 died. New Orleans has also experienced an outbreak of shootings in the searing summer. Crazy from the heat is what southerners say. But that’s only the beginning. More unusual weather and climate aspects have popped up recently. Let’s take the world’s hottest rain as one example. It was 119 degrees (Fahrenheit) on July 24 in Imperial, California, when it rained, according to weather expert Jeff Masters, prompting the hottest ever rainfall in the world. The rain was so hot that one local resident reported it felt hard on the heart and “made it difficult to breathe.” If that’s not enough, consider that the ocean water just off San Diego in California recorded its highest-ever recorded temperature last week. Scientists have been recording temperatures at the Scripps Pier in La Jolla, California, every day since World War I, but the sea temperature registered at 78.6 degrees F on Wednesday. Researchers said the record warmth in the ocean surface water is consistent with a “torrent of extreme weather in 2018” and an example of how “global warming will play out.” “Like other climate change trends, background warming enhances the probability and magnitude of extreme events,” said Scripps oceanographer and Shore Stations principal investigator Reinhard Flick in a release. The thing about extremes is, of course, that they can sway far to one end or the other. So, while the Pacific gets warm, the jet stream dips and the hottest raindrops fall, hurricanes in the Atlantic haven’t been a factor at all—and it's likely to remain that way this year. It’s the opposite effect of the other extremes, with a benefit being a light Atlantic hurricane season. “The tropical Atlantic remains cooler than normal, and there is a relatively high potential that a weak El Nino develops in the next several months,” according to a recent report from Colorado State University. “The probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the U.S. coastline and in the Caribbean is below normal due to the forecast for a below-normal season.” In the Pacific, though, warm waters currently have three named storms and a potential fourth on the way. And there’s this: “Chances are high that we witness a rare event in tropical meteorology: the merging of two tropical cyclones. #Ileana and #John may both become hurricanes prior to forming a binary system…” tweeted Levi Cowan, a graduate student studying tropical cyclones. It’s not just the oceans behaving strangely, either. The Gulf of Mexico had riptides so strong late last week in the Destin, Florida, area that more than 100 people had to be rescued, and beachgoers trying to get a last weekend in before school starts resorted to a human chain while trying to save struggling swimmers. The same thing happened days later in Michigan when waters got rough on Lake Michigan. Meanwhile, “ catastrophic wildfires continue to ravage California ” and one California community—Keswick—was burned to ashes in an unusual tornado of flames that rendered firefighters helpless. They call it a “ fire tornado.” It’s all part of a new normal, explained one environmental expert : Mother Nature like we have never seen her before. David Magee is a contributing editor, a former newspaper publisher and columnist, and the author of a dozen book,s including How Toyota Became #1 (Penguin).",The world's hottest rain to a tornado fire.

"Marshall Shepherd, Contributor, Marshall Shepherd, Contributor https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/","Weather is a part of our day. We are aware of it. We plan for it. We are affected by it. Many people take weather information for granted. Its on our phones, television screens, Internet pages, or radios. The &amp;quot;weather fairy&amp;quot; does not produce those forecast numbers, emojis, and warnings. Meteorologists, using various tools, do. I often say we are living in a golden age of&amp;nbsp;weather forecasts. The public often gets stuck in the &amp;quot;inertia of perception.&amp;quot; I find that there is a lack of understanding of the accuracy of weather forecasting and personal misconceptions about how good forecasts are supposed to be. A previous piece that I wrote in Forbes explores why people think weather forecasts are bad when they are actually pretty good. Meteorologists work under very stressful and high-pressure conditions, especially when dealing with situations like Hurricane Michael or potential tornado outbreak. It is why a weather forecast discussion issued by a forecaster at the National Weather Service Office in Juneau, Alaska this week was so refreshing. Shakespeare statue at the U.S. Library of Congress Library of Congress website To understand what I am talking about, I present to you the long-term analysis in the Southeast Alaska Forecast Discussion by the National Weather Service, Alaska.&amp;nbsp;This Forecast Discussion was issued at 5:43 am AKDT on October 30th and brilliantly captures, in an accessible way, the challenges of making snow forecasts. &amp;quot;I have done the deed,&amp;quot; as Macbeth once nervously&amp;nbsp;proclaimed. As is customarily the case when one first reads &amp;quot;snow&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;in the forecast, one can imagine the trepidation felt by a&amp;nbsp;forecaster at the first instance where said forecaster is&amp;nbsp;presented with this high profile conundrum. It is truly the stuff&amp;nbsp;of Shakespearean tragedy. Someone has to do it; it is Alaska and&amp;nbsp;the calendar doth say, &amp;quot;Consider it not so deeply.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;But even after it is done, there is always thoughts of doubt, as&amp;nbsp;Lady Macbeth states, &amp;quot;I am afraid they have awaked and tis not&amp;nbsp;done.&amp;quot; It may not be done, because the low on Thursday night comes&amp;nbsp;hither on a path more southerly than we originally thought, so slaying each outlier model run as one bidst &amp;quot;God bless us,&amp;quot; and&amp;nbsp;the other &amp;quot;Amen,&amp;quot; has become a challenge indeed in such a&amp;nbsp;difficult pattern to get right. While earlier we speculated the&amp;nbsp;low to follow a northerly course across the north central&amp;nbsp;Panhandle, suggesting a warmer system, we are looking at possibly&amp;nbsp;a much more southerly track with areas north of Petersburg under&amp;nbsp;the influence of a cooler air mass.

We are aware of it. We plan for it. We are affected by it. Many people take weather information for granted. Its on our phones, television screens, Internet pages, or radios. The ""weather fairy"" does not produce those forecast numbers, emojis, and warnings. Meteorologists, using various tools, do. I often say we are living in a golden age of weather forecasts. The public often gets stuck in the ""inertia of perception."" I find that there is a lack of understanding of the accuracy of weather forecasting and personal misconceptions about how good forecasts are supposed to be. A previous piece that I wrote in Forbes explores why people think weather forecasts are bad when they are actually pretty good. Meteorologists work under very stressful and high-pressure conditions, especially when dealing with situations like Hurricane Michael or potential tornado outbreak. It is why a weather forecast discussion issued by a forecaster at the National Weather Service Office in Juneau, Alaska this week was so refreshing. Shakespeare statue at the U.S. Library of Congress Library of Congress website To understand what I am talking about, I present to you the long-term analysis in the Southeast Alaska Forecast Discussion by the National Weather Service, Alaska. This Forecast Discussion was issued at 5:43 am AKDT on October 30th and brilliantly captures, in an accessible way, the challenges of making snow forecasts. ""I have done the deed,"" as Macbeth once nervously proclaimed. As is customarily the case when one first reads ""snow"" in the forecast, one can imagine the trepidation felt by a forecaster at the first instance where said forecaster is presented with this high profile conundrum. It is truly the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy. Someone has to do it; it is Alaska and the calendar doth say, ""Consider it not so deeply."" But even after it is done, there is always thoughts of doubt, as Lady Macbeth states, ""I am afraid they have awaked and tis not done."" It may not be done, because the low on Thursday night comes hither on a path more southerly than we originally thought, so slaying each outlier model run as one bidst ""God bless us,"" and the other ""Amen,"" has become a challenge indeed in such a difficult pattern to get right. While earlier we speculated the low to follow a northerly course across the north central Panhandle, suggesting a warmer system, we are looking at possibly a much more southerly track with areas north of Petersburg under the influence of a cooler air mass. So while we have decreased pop (probability of precipitation), yet not erased it, and lowered expected precipitation amounts across the north, we have also cooled temperatures a bit more boldly, therefore adding a chance of rain and, yes obligatorily, snow for much of the northern Panhandle Thursday night through the weekend. ""This is a sorry sight,"" rings the wisdom of Lady Macbeth. So while we feel as if we needed to get the deed done, we also acknowledge that much of this forecast averages solutions that will likely span two bookended likelihoods of either a drier and colder atmosphere whereby nothing falls from the sky, or else, a more northerly track with a wetter and warmer atmosphere whereby the only thing that does fall is in liquid form. And thus we risk our messaging going haywire with our forecasts marked with magical four-letter words beginning in `s.` Only we should stress the preceding words--""chance of.""

Anthony Watts,"We’ve been told time and again by climate alarmists that global warming would make more severe weather. In fact, the opposite is true according to recently released tornado data from NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center. By Paul Homewood https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/2017/torngraph-big.png 2017 was a relatively busy year for tornadoes in the US, ranking third since 2005 on preliminary data. This was mainly due to a spurt in numbers in January to March, most of which were weak EF-0 and EF-1 tornadoes. There were though three EF-3s in an outbreak in January, which sadly led to 20 fatalities. https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/2017/ptorngraph-big.png As for longer term trends, regular readers will recall that we need to discount weaker tornadoes, as NOAA explain: One of the main difficulties with tornado records is that a tornado, or evidence of a tornado must have been observed. Unlike rainfall or temperature, which may be measured by a fixed instrument, tornadoes are short-lived and very unpredictable. If a tornado occurs in a place with few or no people, it is not likely to be documented. Many significant tornadoes may not make it into the historical record since Tornado Alley was very sparsely populated during the 20th century. Much early work on tornado climatology in the United States was done by John Park Finley in his book Tornadoes, published in 1887. While some of Finley’s safety guidelines have since been refuted as dangerous practices, the book remains a seminal work in tornado research. The University of Oklahoma created a PDF copy of the book and made it accessible at John Finley’s Tornadoes (link is external). Today, nearly all of the United States is reasonably well populated, or at least covered by NOAA’s Doppler weather radars. Even if a tornado is not actually observed, modern damage assessments by National Weather Service personnel can discern if a tornado caused the damage, and if so, how strong the tornado may have been. This disparity between tornado records of the past and current records contributes a great deal of uncertainty regarding questions about the long-term behavior or patterns of tornado occurrence. Improved tornado observation practices have led to an increase in the number of reported weaker tornadoes, and in recent years EF-0 tornadoes have become more prevelant in the total number of reported tornadoes. In addition, even today many smaller tornadoes still may go undocumented in places with low populations or inconsistent communication facilities. With increased National Doppler radar coverage, increasing population, and greater attention to tornado reporting, there has been an increase in the number of tornado reports over the past several decades. This can create a misleading appearance of an increasing trend in tornado frequency. To better understand the variability and trend in tornado frequency in the United States, the total number of EF-1 and stronger, as well as strong to violent tornadoes (EF-3 to EF-5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed. These tornadoes would have likely been reported even during the decades before Doppler radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports. The bar charts below indicate there has been little trend in the frequency of the stronger tornadoes over the past 55 years. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/trends Not that this stops NOAA continuing to publish grossly misleading graphs, such as the one below: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tornadoes/201713 Since NOAA also appear reluctant to update their graph for strong tornadoes beyond 2014, I will help them out: https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data Despite those three EF-3s in January, the year ended with a record low 15 EF-3s and stronger, equalling the records set in 1987 and 2016. There were also only two EF-4s, well below the mean of 7.4, and no EF-5s at all, the strongest tornadoes of all. Indeed, we have now gone five years without an EF-5. It is evident that strong tornadoes have been in a steady decline since 1970. As for this year, we are now through the season when we can expect to see most tornadoes, and the strongest ones. So far the year is running at the lowest number since 2005. Provisionally there have only been four EF-3s, and nothing stronger, which is extremely low. We keep being told that weather is becoming more extreme, but as far as tornadoes go it is the opposite which is true. Even better, overall deaths from tornadoes are decreasing as well, due to better warning systems. The exception is one recent event in 2013, the year of the F5 Moore, OK tornado.","We’ve been told time and again by climate alarmists that global warming would make more severe weather.
