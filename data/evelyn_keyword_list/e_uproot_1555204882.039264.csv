https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption A traditional Mayan ceremony was held to launch the four-year project Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has launched the Maya Train - an ambitious project to build a railway through five south-eastern states. At an indigenous ceremony near the ancient Mayan ruins of Palenque, he said this would help create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The 1,525km (950-mile) railway will link Palenque and the tourist resort of Cancún on the Caribbean coast. But opponents warn it could damage the region's important biosphere. A third of the planned route passes through pristine jungle, and the owners of the land, the Maya people, say they have not been consulted. But President López Obrador dismissed environmentalists' concerns, promising that ""we won't uproot a single tree"". The four-year project is expected to cost up to $7.4bn (£5.9bn).",The ambitious project will link Mayan archaeological sites to cities and beach resorts.,2018-12-17T02:22:13Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Mexico launches $7.4bn Tren Maya railway project,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46588042,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7A48/production/_104840313_6e8624b5-cc34-406b-b3a3-7347a0212598.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,uproot,1
THE NEW YORK TIMES,"In many ways, climate change has made hurricanes worse: A rise in sea level is causing higher storm surges, and warmer air is leading to rainier storms. With Hurricane Michael, local geography also has a role to play in the storms impact. If the predictions of its path hold, the hurricane will be the first to hit this area since Hurricane Hermine in 2016, said Jamie Rhome, a storm surge specialist at the National Hurricane Center. That storm was a Category 1. Hurricane Michael is expected to strike land as a Category 3, a major storm with wind speeds of 111 to 129 m.p.h. Thats enough to uproot trees and tear off roof decking. Wind, while a source of destruction in storms, is not the only threat. Surge can devastate coastal communities, and the rain dumped by storms can cause flooding far inland. Mr. Rhome noted that while this hurricanes path was still not certain, its probable impact at the bend of Florida on the way into the Panhandle could be very destructive. Its an incredibly vulnerable spot, he said. Regardless of whether the track moves a little to the left or the right, or wobbles, he said, its going to be a bad storm surge event for somebody. Rick Luettich, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina, said that the area was especially susceptible to a large storm surge because of its funnel-shaped geometry and broad, shallow continental shelf. If there is good news, he said its that the area of possible impact is not as densely populated as other parts of the Gulf Coast, and therefore the human consequences of such a large surge should be less severe than if it hit further west on the Florida Panhandle or further east, in say, Tampa.",Tropical Storm Michael was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on Monday as it barreled toward the Gulf Coast.

Kate Clark,"Women in tech are not only significantly under-funded by venture capitalists, but they also often lack access to the early-stage support granted to their male counterparts. To enroll in a startup accelerator like Y Combinator, for example, its expected founders relocate to the Bay Area for three months. Women, who are more often caregivers, might not be able to do that, and even if they can, the program may not cater to their specific needs. Female Founders Alliance (FFA), a relatively new network of female startup founders, has built a free, non-dilutive 5-week accelerator for women by women. Called ‘Ready, Set, Raise,’ its goal is to help more female-founded startups raise VC through workshops, 1-on-1 coaching, legal clinics, communications and speech coaching and more. The accelerator, sponsored by Trilogy Equity Partners, kicked off at the end of August and will culminate with a private demo day with VCs in Seattle on September 27th. “I don’t know many women who can uproot their families for three months to go live in another city,” FFA founder Leslie Feinzaig told TechCrunch. “When I was working on my company, I wanted to apply to Y Combinator but I was a new mom, it was 100% a non-starter.” Feinzaig knows the trials and tribulations of raising VC as a female entrepreneur all too well. As the founder of an edtech startup called Venture Kits, she tried, unsuccessfully, to procure venture backing. That struggle is why she started FFA, which began as a Facebook group to connect female founders in the Seattle area but has expanded across North America. The accelerator is designed to allow founders to tune into the programming remotely. Participants are only required to be on-site in Seattle, where FFA is based, for one week, during which the organization is providing free housing and childcare. FFA’s accelerator is among a new class of efforts created for women in tech. All Raise’s Founders For Change initiative, for example, and new female-focused funds, like Sarah Kunst’s Cleo Capital, are all working to close the gender funding gap. “I know it seems to people like there’s a lot happening around female founders and diverse founders, but in the context of the size and scale of that gender gap, we are barely getting started,” Feinzaig said. “We need all the accelerators. We need hundreds of funds. We are nowhere close to making a real dent in equal leadership.” Today, FFA is announcing their inaugural class of startups, eight in total. Here’s a closer look at the group: Chanlogic : Based in Seattle, the SaaS startup provides a product for e-commerce channel managers. Esq.Me Inc. : A Portland-based document marketplace for lawyers created by lawyers. Future Sight AR : A Houston-based AR product for engineering, procurement and construction companies. geeRemit : Based in Raleigh, the startup leverages the blockchain to power remittances to Africa. Magic AI : A Seattle-based AI startup for livestock care. MoxieReader : Based in New York, an edtech startup focused on improving child literacy through tech. Pandere Shoes : Based in Anchorage, the startup is creating expandable shoes.

For some positions that Siemens AG needs to fill, there may be a universe of fewer than 2,000 qualified people in the U.S., said Michael Brown, vice president of talent acquisition in the Americas for the German industrial conglomerate that makes everything from gas turbines to mammography machines. ""The question is how many of those are looking for a job?"" Mr. Brown said. Finding the right potential candidates on sites like LinkedIn isn't easy because ""they're tired of being found.""

Scroll Staff,"Punjab minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu criticised the Centre, asking if the Indian strikes on a terror camp in Pakistan was just an election gimmick.
Sidhu is the latest to demand details from the Centre on the cross-border air strike. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress leader Digvijay Singh have sought evidence and clarity on the number of casualties in the strikes.
300 terrorist dead, Yes or No? tweeted Sidhu. What was the purpose then? Were you uprooting terrorist or trees? Was it an election gimmick? Deceit possesses our land in guise of fighting a foreign enemy. Stop politicising the army, it is as sacred as the state. he said. 
Sidhu cited media reports quoting BJP leaders like BS Yeddyurappa, who claimed the air strike will help the party win more seats in Karnataka, and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who alleged that Pakistan could attack the Indian Parliament and Assam Assembly if Narendra Modi is not elected the prime minister again.
Sidhu also tweeted a video that cited international media reports quoting Pakistani officials or villagers as saying that Indian jets had dropped bombs in a wooded area, causing no damage or casualties. Two Reuters reporters who had visited the site of the bombings reported seeing four large craters and up to 15 damaged pine trees.
Skimmed milk masquerades as cream, things are seldom as they seem, Sidhu said along with the video.

On February 26, the Indian Air Force carried out air strikes at a camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. India called the operation a non-military, counter-terror preemptive action, and said it had eliminated a large number of terror operatives.
Multiple media reports, quoting unidentified officials, had pegged the number of casualties at over 300, and some estimated it at even 600. Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa on Tuesday refused to state the number of casualties from the cross-border air strike.

Sidhus comment comes days after Pakistan accused India of eco-terrorism and said pine trees were damaged in the strikes. Islamabad has so far denied the presence of any terror camps in the area. Several opposition parties have also raised questions on the credibility of the February 26 IAF air strikes. Two days after the 12 Mirage 2000 aircraft dropped 1,000kg bombs on a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Pakistan, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee demanded that the Centre share the exact details of the operation.We want to know what happened actually. National TV channels were showing that 300 to 350 people were killed. International media saying one. We want to know how many actually died. We want to know whether anyone was killed or not, she had said.
On Sunday, a day after the return of IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, a war of words ensued between the Congress and Prime Minister Modi after INC general secretary Digvijaya Singh asked the Centre to provide proof of the air strikes. 
In a rally in Bihar on Sunday, Modi slammed opposition party leaders for raising doubts and asking for proof of the Balakot strike. While we are out to counter terrorism what are some people inside the country doing? he said. 
The Indian Air Force on the intervening night of February 25-26 conducted air strikes deep inside the Pakistani territory. Though preliminary unconfirmed reports claimed around 300-350 terrorists were killed in the attack, the Indian government is yet to come clear on the figure.","Were You Uprooting Terrorists or Trees?

Eillie Anzilotti,"The small waterfront town of Scituate, Massachusetts has been through a lot this year. One of the parts of the country hardest-hit by the four nor’easters that blew through the east coast in March, Scituate saw homes destroyed and huge piles of sand lifted up by the wind and waves and deposited on Inner Harbor Road, where the street sign stuck was half-buried. On the coasts, storms like these were expected–sometimes. A blizzard in 1978 swept through Scituate and tore houses off their foundations; 400 homes were damaged so badly that residents could not return to them. And yet, people continue to live in Scituate. “Scituate residents, hardened by years of storms past, know what they’ve signed up for. They know what comes with living on the coast and they take pride in doing so,” writes Andrew MacFarlane in a feature on The Weather Channel. But after this winter, even the most stubborn longtime residents of the town are considering leaving. 46 and 48 Town Extension Way, the last remaining homes on the front line of Peggotty Beach that once featured 30 homes, flirt with each crashing wave. [Photo: Andrew MacFarlane/courtesy weather.com] Forced migration due to the extreme weather events caused by climate change is happening in communities across the U.S. and the world, and the phenomenon is the subject of a new series on The Weather Channel, of which MacFarlane’s piece is among the first published. Called Exodus, the series will run through the end of this year, and document circumstances of climate migration across the world. Shot of Main St. Ellicott City down the hill. [Photo: Liz Roll/courtesy weather.com] “We have climate change as a pretty core part of our editorial menu for a long time,” says Kevin Hayes, executive editor of Weather.com. Last year, the site launched a project called The United States of Climate Change, which told a story on the impact of extreme weather from every state. Throughout the course of publishing the stories, forced migration stood out as a consistent theme. One story followed people forced off the Marshall Islands due to rising sea levels as they tried to make a home in Springdale, Arkansas; another tracked the threat of constant flooding to the naval base and community of Norfolk, Virginia. “Migration wasn’t the core notion of the series, but it seemed very present,” Hayes says. So the next project, Exodus, focused explicitly on the subject. The first three features, which went live on August 1, delve into flooding in both Scituate and Ellicott City, Maryland, as well as drought and water scarcity in the country of Jordan. Hayes, along with Greg Gilderman, global head of news for The Weather Channel, and Patty Cox, the site’s executive editor, have put a call out among reporters and photographers across the world in an attempt to capture the global phenomenon of climate migration. While Hayes anticipates that the series will ultimately contain around 40 features, he’s fielding pitches every day for more stories. Jordan [Photo: Sharon Avraham/courtesy weather.com] While each feature, Hayes says, takes forced migration as its core, the stories they tell vary widely by place. “Scituate, Massachusetts is a very different story than Lagos, Nigeria,” he says. While both may be grappling with flooding, “what the infrastructure can bear, and how the local and national governments respond, create very different conditions and ripple effects.” What’s troubling to Hayes is that for all of these stories of displacement and forced relocation, he’s yet to see a good example cross his desk of how a place is productively and proactively dealing with these realities, or designing solutions to equitably relocate people or attempt to keep them in place. Jordan [Photo: Sharon Avraham/courtesy weather.com] Just as the New York Times Magazine this week devoted around 30,000 words to the topic of climate change, it’s encouraging to see media outlets broadcasting the reality that climate change is happening now, and its effects are being felt across the globe. But it’s especially significant to see this coming from The Weather Channel because too often, climate change skeptics dismiss the phenomenon as nothing more than fluctuations in the weather, rather than a sustained and systemic transformation. While the site, as Hayes says, has long been dedicated to covering extreme weather in the context of climate change, with this series, it’s redoubling its efforts. “The core of The Weather Channel is meteorology and science,” Hayes says, “so the editorial concerns that flow from that are very straightforward. It’s our job to communicate them.”","A new series on The Weather Channel delves into the places around the world where droughts and floods are forcing people to uproot.

Brett and Kate McKay,"We have a small lot of woodsy land behind our house, and a few years ago I decided to make a trail through it, leading to a “secret” fire pit. Blazing the trail was a lot of work — there were weeds to pull, thorny bushes to trim, and small trees to uproot. Then there was the task of hauling bags of mulch up and down the small hill the trail traversed, and covering the path with their contents. I kind of enjoyed the process though. It was fun to watch the trail take shape, and when it was done, boy, was I proud. It felt great to step back and see this thing I had made. Yes, blazing the trail was pretty fun. Maintaining it, though, well, that’s been another story. Turns out with trails you can’t just “fix it and forget it.” Each spring, prickly, dense vegetation explodes, entangling itself over the path to the extent that you practically can’t see it anymore. Every year it has to be cleared away once again. And I find it’s a lot harder to get motivated to do that job, than it was to make the trail in the first place. Upkeep is just a lot less sexy than creation. Still, I’ve got to keep at it if I want our family to be able to access the fire pit. As it goes with literal trails, so it goes with the metaphorical pathway to adulthood. The Art of Manliness has always aimed to be a magazine about helping men grow up well, and we have consequently spent a lot of time researching, writing, and thinking about not only what it means to be mature, but how to make adulthood a fulfilling endeavor. I used to think that the key shift to be made when growing up was moving from consuming to creating: a mature adult aimed to create more and consume less. I still think there’s a lot to that idea. But as I’ve gotten a little longer in the tooth, I’ve come to feel that the real crux of becoming an adult can even more accurately be captured this way: moving from choosing and pursuing to maintaining and building. Choosing &amp; Pursuing When you’re young, you’re staring down a hallway of unopened doors, unsure of what lies behind each. Where will you go to college? What will you major in? What will you do for work? Who will you marry? Where will you live? What will you believe? Will you have kids? How many? What will they be like? You’ve got a lot of choices to make, and the uncertainty surrounding them can be a source of anxiety and worry. But, also, a whole lot of excitement. Uncertainty has a paradoxical effect on the brain in which it causes both stress and the release of feel-good, motivation-heightening dopamine. Think about how much more often you check your phone when you’re waiting for a text from your crush, versus waiting for a text from someone you’ve been together with for a long time. Uncertainty is what drives you to keep pulling the arm of life’s metaphorical slot machine to see what comes up. Even as you start opening the various doors before you, and move from the realm of sheer possibility to experimenting with certain choices, the level of excitement and motivation you experience stays high because these initial forays are full of novelty — another dopamine primer. How wonderful is it when things are shiny and new? We speak about the “honeymoon period” in regards to romantic relationships, but every endeavor begins with that same giddiness-inducing phase. New friendships, new place to live, new job — everything’s a bit thrilling at the start. It’s the thrill of pursuit. In the gap between initiation and consummation, there is a compelling tension, an enlivening drama that’s downright intoxicating. Perhaps no scenario better encapsulates this feeling then the tension right before a first kiss — the electricity generated in the will-we-or-won’t-we dance. That tension dissipates a bit once the kissing commences (though when it’s a first kiss the novelty of it keeps the excitement level high). But even though the spark is discharged, the fun isn’t over; that little moment of pursuit and consummation is embedded within a broader, longer courtship cycle that itself is structured by the same dynamic. Still to come will be more phases of pursuit-tension-consummation as the couple takes their first steps into love, marriage, sex, and so on. This dynamic of following a trail of exciting new moments through the woods of some exciting new endeavor play out the same way whether it’s a new romantic relationship, a new friendship, a move to a new place, or a new job. In every case, though, all the “firsts” are eventually consummated. The overarching goal is achieved. The new becomes routine. And as you get older, this happens not only in one area, but along all the major avenues of life. You reach a point where you’ve opened all the doors and seen the contents of each once mysterious room: You know where you went to college and what you majored in. You know what you’re doing for work. You know where you’ll be living, at least for the foreseeable future. You mostly know what you believe. You know who your wife is (she’s sitting right across from you right now). You know what your kids are like (they’re asleep upstairs). While life can always shift and change, new possibilities can always emerge, and unknowns always remain, the biggest uncertainties are now pretty certain. You reach a point where you look around and realize: “This is my life.” Maintaining and Building Once you consummate your goals, dopamine, and instinctual motivation, plummet. Think about the build-up to much-desired sex — the frantic drive and lead-up to orgasm... and then the flatness that follows. Then juxtapose that dynamic on the longer-term pursuits in life, and there you essentially have the transition from youth to adulthood. That sounds kind of depressing perhaps. And indeed, some people just can’t get over the excitement and novelty that marked their younger years. They want that pre-first-kiss tension back, writ large. Once a relationship, job, or other endeavor loses its shiny newness, they start over again with another relationship, another job, another aim (which they’re sure, this time, will be their enduring passion). These folks get the benefit of ever replenishing the spark of electricity that marks the beginning of something new, but not the satisfactions attendant to seeing it through. They start projects, but don’t finish them; they dabble in things, but don’t stick with them. As a result, all the areas of their life remain in a shallow and superficial state. They have lovers but not partners. They have acquaintances but not best friends. They’ve got a new faith or spirituality every year. They know a little about a lot of places, but have never put down roots in any. They remain on the lower rungs of their career path, as workers, but not professionals. Fortunately, this isn’t the only way to deal with the fall off in excitement that follows the making of life’s major choices. Instead of constantly starting over again, you can shift to maintaining and building what you’ve already begun. You can decide it matters less how many choices you have, and more what you do with the ones you’ve already made. The shift from choosing and pursuing to maintaining and building takes more work, but it doesn’t mean giving up on experiencing zest and satisfaction; rather, it’s a matter of changing the fuel your pleasure system runs on. While the pleasure of pursuit is in getting something, period, the pleasure of building comes in getting better at something. So you know who’s going to be your wife. How can you be a better husband to her? You know where you’re going to live. How can you learn to really love that place? You know who your kids are. How can you be a better father to them? You’re pretty solid in your faith. How can you be a better disciple of it? You know what you’re going to do for work. How can you get better in your job? You’ve “won” a new buddy. How can you become a better friend to him? The process of building on what you’ve begun isn’t as sexy and doesn’t come with the automatic, visceral, neurotransmitter-driven motivation and rewards that accompany the pursuit of something new. Instead, the drive to maintain and improve life’s existing structures and the feeling of satisfaction in one’s efforts must be intentionally chosen and actively contemplated. The gratifications which accompany the work of building are not inferior — you simply have to learn to notice them and enjoy them. They don’t come mindlessly. You have to observe how you feel as you get better in your tasks. You have to take time to reflect on the meaning you get from them. Having known the pleasures of expanding, you have to learn to appreciate the satisfactions of deepening. Having known the pleasures of initiation, you have to learn to appreciate the joy of mastery. Once you’ve kindled life’s fledgling flames, the challenge becomes keeping them burning. And carrying them forward. What’s great about adulthood is that in finally getting centered with a lot of things in life, you can reach for more and more mastery with them. This isn’t just advantageous to you, but also allows you to become a mentor to others — to move into a generative phase in life where you’re able to make a real contribution to the world around you. Keep Pursuing Even though I think the major crux of moving from youth and immaturity (regardless of age) to a fulfilling, mature adulthood is shifting from running on the pleasures of pursuit to running on the satisfactions of construction, I don’t think you should ever entirely cease from engaging with the former. Being centered shouldn’t mean becoming lazily settled. Complacency kills. The endeavor of maintenance and improvement isn’t completely devoid of tension and drama. Even when you commit to certain people and certain things, your relationship with them, your ardency for the commitment, waxes and wanes; you go through smoother and rougher seasons, times when you’re closer to someone and more distant. Commitment is rarely a one-time deal, but something you choose over and over again. This ebb and flow is natural, and maybe even desirable; a fulfilling life needs a little tension and drama — an endlessly placid flow would grow boring. But if a rough patch persists, it’s time for a reevaluation. That doesn’t mean automatically following the temptation to chuck it, and start all over again. Sometimes you just need to tweak the way you’re doing things. If you really give something everything you’ve got, but it still doesn’t work, it might then be time to try something new — a new job, a new location, a new belief system. Adulthood is largely about maintaining and building what is, but that doesn’t mean entirely giving up on new possibilities for what could be. That goes not only for changing course on one’s existing commitments, but being open to new ones altogether — new friends, new hobbies, new travels, new adventures of all kinds. In improving on what you have, while reaching for fresh frontiers, you ever maintain the zeal of youth, no matter your age. As Bruce Barton once put it: “The minute a man ceases to grow—no matter what his years—that minute he begins to be old. As long as he can look back on every year and say, ‘I grew,’ he is still young. The minute he ceases to grow, the day he says to himself, ‘I know all that I need to know’—that day youth stops. He may be twenty-five or seventy-five, it makes no difference. On that day he begins to be old.” On the path of adulthood, blessed are not only the trail blazers, but the trail tenders.","We have a small lot of woodsy land behind our house, and a few years ago I decided to make a trail through it, leading to a “secret” fire pit. Blazing the trail was a lot of work — there were weeds to pull, thorny bushes to trim, and small trees to uproot.

Noam Cohen,"Jo Freeman is one of those people whom Kipling would praise for keeping her head while those all around are losing theirs. The womens liberation movement of the late 1960s was rebuilding the world in a consciously different way: no designated leaders and no rules on what you could say and when you could say it. Yet Freeman wondered if getting rid of rules and leaders was actually making feminism more open and fair. I am very analytical, which, frankly, inside the movement was not appreciated, she recalled over breakfast at a coffee shop near her home in the residential Brooklyn neighborhood of Kensington. After a hard think, she concluded that, if anything, the lack of structure made the situation worse: Elite women who went to the right schools and knew the right people held power and outsiders had no viable way of challenging them. She decided to write an essay summing up her thoughts. As long as the structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the rules, she wrote in the piece, published in Ms. magazine in 1973. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which they are not quite aware. Noam Cohen is an Ideas contributor at WIRED, a writer living in Brooklyn, and the author of *The Know-It-Alls : The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball*. More than 40 years later, Freemans essay, The Tyranny of Structurelessness, continues to reverberate, especially in Silicon Valley, where it is deployed by a wide range of critics to disprove widely held beliefs about the internet as a force of personal empowerment, whether in work, leisure, or politics. That a decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin gives ordinary folk control over high finance. That driving an Uber means you are an entrepreneur. That Facebooks largely unsupervised advertising system is designed for small businesses because it allows them to reach a sea of customers inexpensively. Or that Silicon Valley companies with their informal college-campus vibe, including study nooks, snack bars, and a free-thinking debate culture, are immune to the need for corporate protection.. The reality, of course, is a bit different. Bitcoin is dominated by a small cadre of investors, and mining new coins is so expensive and electricity-draining that only large institutions can participate; Facebooks advertising system is exploited by foreign governments and other malevolent political actors who have had free rein to spread disinformation and discord; and Googles informal structure allows leaders to believe they can act in secret to dispense with credible accusations of harassment. In Freemans unstinting language, this rhetoric of openness becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. Because Tyranny explains how things work, as opposed to how people say things work, it has become a touchstone for social critics of all stripes. During the Occupy movement, Freemans essay was on the organizers minds when they sought to eliminate hierarchy without introducing a hidden hierarchy. The essay is cited in hundreds of academic papers and books to explain the history of the Vatican, or the womens movement in Iceland, or the Walmart workforce. But digital culture is where Freemans work has the most currency these days. Arvind Narayanan, an expert on bitcoin at Princeton, recalled analyzing a crisis in how the currency should be governed when he suddenly thought, Hmm, why does this feel familiar? He had what he calls an Oh my God, its the Tyranny of Structurelessness moment. Benjamin Mako Hill, a fellow at Stanfords Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, where he is studying how free software projects operate, said Freemans essay was really an inspirational thing. In many of the communities he researches, Hill said, participants reject any hint of formal structures or authority only to discover that 10 years later, there really are a lot of leaders and structures. Because the leaders and structures arrived informally, he said, they are much harder to uproot. For the left-wing author and documentarian Astra Taylor, Tyranny was a healthy reminder that Silicon Valleys rhetoric of openness and meritocracy doesnt match the reality. Ive felt that paranoid delusion myself, Taylor wrote in her book about the internet, The Peoples Platform. How do you explain inequalities in a system where explicit discrimination doesnt exist? How do you make sense of homogeneity when theres no sign on the door excluding different types of people? Freeman is an unlikely internet guru. She is 73 and has never given a Ted talk; she doesnt host a podcast. She speaks in specifics, not generalities, and her fashionblue corduroy jacket, turtleneck sweater, and jeansis more throwback academic than forward-thinking disruptor. A self-described guerrilla scholar, Freeman has published 11 books of political history without the benefit of any academic affiliation or support. But she does have something in common with many of the biggest proponents of todays tech-led free-for-all: When Freeman was a student at UC Berkeley, she too wanted to save the world. This was a long-ago time, before apps and internet platforms, so she had to content herself with the civil rights, antiwar, and womens rights movements. As political organizations became more radical during the 1960s, Freeman told me, she would think back to the first organization she joined while on campusthe Young Democrats. They may have lacked the passion of Berkeleys Free Speech Movement, which Freeman also joined, but they were able to get things done by having clear leaders and clear rules of governance. At the Young Democrats, I watched menthere werent any women chairschair meetings using Roberts Rules of Order and get through an agenda in three hours that would have taken the Free Speech Movement three days. Freeman takes the long view about her argument, seeing it as part of a permanent push-pull between structure and structurelessness. There may be particular reasons why Silicon Valley leaders have an aversion to outside authority and rules, but mainly she thinks they embody the excessive enthusiasm of any group who gains a foothold in a new fieldwhether in oil exploration or railroads or the internetand decides they are uniquely fit to hold that powerful position. In the early days of the internet, she says, it was highly inventive, it was highly spontaneous, but were past that. As long as you reject the idea that any organization is bad you are never going to have the discussion about the best organization for whatever it is you are trying to do. And while this rhetoric of personal empowerment has been great for Silicon Valley, for the rest of the world it has produced a deeply painful reality: greater disparity in wealth and power, fewer tools for reversing these conditions, and a false sense that we are personally to blame for our own difficult circumstances. The question today is whether Silicon Valley companies will voluntarily impose some structure on their magical platforms and devicesor whether that structure will need to be imposed upon them by the public. Your guess.

Deb Hipp,"This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. It is part of the Transforming Life As We Age Special Report. Sara Tapscott won’t ever forget the day an employee at her aging parents’ assisted living center knocked on their apartment door and told them they’d have to move. Their needs had become too great for the staff to accommodate. Tapscott’s mom, who was 79 and down to 90 pounds from advanced Parkinson’s disease, was crying and shaking so badly that she nearly fell from her chair. Tapscott’s dad, who was 83 and a retired attorney with Alzheimer’s, attempted to make his case, holding a finger up for each point. “We’ve always paid our rent on time. You’ve never had a problem from us. We’ve been ideal tenants,” he argued. None of that mattered. They still needed to move. “It was horrible to see them like that,” says Tapscott, who had been driving 400 miles roundtrip from Kansas City to Des Moines every few weeks to attend to her parents while working full time as a nurse. Now she felt obligated to move near them. “They’d been so good to me and put me through college,” Tapscott says. “How could I leave them there?” More care than one person could give It is a question faced by many boomers and Gen Xers with aging parents who live far away: whether to uproot their own life to care for a parent or try to manage things from a distance. Neither choice is easy. Tapscott’s parents, Mary and Leo, had received their diagnoses 10 years earlier. At first, “it didn’t seem like that big of a deal,” says Tapscott. “They weren’t sick.” Over the years, though, their symptoms worsened. Ultimately, Leo, who weighed over 200 pounds, needed to be lifted out of bed, chairs and the car. Mary, a former journalist who held a master’s degree, had become incontinent and blurted out inappropriate thoughts unfiltered. Tapscott’s back already ached from lifting her dad during visits. And her mom had fallen multiple times, breaking both wrists. There was no way that Tapscott and her sister, who also visited, could take care of their parents. “Every time I visited, I could see how much worse they were becoming,” says Tapscott, who was in her early 50s at the time. She considered moving to Des Moines. “Don’t you dare,” Mary told her in a rare lucid moment when Tapscott mentioned relocation. Other times, though, Mary and Leo pleaded with her to move and take care of them. “Being a nurse, it was almost expected that I would take care of their needs,” says Tapscott. “But they needed more care than one person could give them, whether that person was a nurse or not.” Sara and her sister wound up moving their parents from assisted living to a skilled nursing facility. Aging parents and unrealistic expectations Caregivers who provide unpaid care for at least 21 hours a week report the highest stress of all caregiving groups, according to a 2015 report by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP. The typical high-hour caregiver provides care “for an average of five years and expects to continue care for another five years,” the report found. Most people underestimate the time it takes to be a caregiver, says Amanda Lambert, owner of Lambert Care Management. Even if your parent is in assisted living, your caregiving duties can include: Scheduling appointments and coordinating with health care professionals Monitoring your parent’s care at the facility or home Handling emergency medical calls Navigating stacks of insurance and medical bills You could also be tasked with home maintenance, lawn care and household expenses. Meanwhile, you might still need to hold down a full-time job. Moving won’t heal old wounds Moving may be acceptable if you have a good relationship with your parents and time and resources to spend with your mom and dad — as long as they’re in favor of the move, says Lambert. However, don’t expect to heal a lifetime of conflict by swooping in to save the day. “Ongoing conflict or issues will only be complicated by the role reversal of the adult child taking care of a parent,” says Lambert. In conflicted relationships, she recommends staying put and hiring a geriatric care manager with good contacts and a neutral view of the situation. That way, you can monitor from afar rather than uproot yourself. Better able to handle a change When Amy Goyer was 48, she left her life in Washington, D.C., in 2009 to live in her parent’s Phoenix home and monitor their care in assisted living. She based her decision on her belief that she could handle a big change better than they could. Goyer’s mother had suffered a stroke and her father was declining from Alzheimer’s. “I kept my home, and I get to travel back to D.C. regularly,” says Goyer, AARP’s family and caregiving expert. “I refer to that as ‘filling my tank.’” Goyer’s move was by no means easy, though. Her parents eventually moved back into their house, and after her mom died a few years later, Goyer stayed on as the primary caregiver for her dad. After moving, Goyer soon realized she could not possibly do everything that needed doing. “I woke up six months after I came out there and I was so overwhelmed, I didn’t want to get out of bed,” she says. That day, Goyer made lists of all the tasks she’d assigned herself and saw that it was impossible to complete them all. So she hired someone to assist with running errands. “I needed someone to help me, not necessarily my parents,” says Goyer, who misses “that ability to do whatever I want to do when I want to do it.” Still, she’s glad she made the move. “There are things that are not the way I wish,” says Goyer. “But if I hadn’t moved here, I would have always regretted it.” Goyer still cares for her father, who is now 93. ‘You give up your whole self’ Even though Tapscott knows that she didn’t have the resources and physical ability to move and take on full-time caregiving for her parents, she’ll always struggle with her decision. “If I had a dollar for every tear I shed in guilt, I could have hired 15 caregivers,” says Tapscott. She and her sister alternated visits to Des Moines until Mary died in 2004. Tapscott even bought a handicapped-accessible van to transport her dad when she visited. In 2006, she moved Leo into a nursing home in Kansas City near her home. “He only lasted three weeks,” says Tapscott. “There’s so much guilt if you don’t do it. But you also realize you give up your whole self to move, and in the long run, I didn’t think my parents would have wanted that.” “I went back and forth about it until they died,” says Tapscott. “I still do.” Deb Hipp is a Kansas City, Mo.-based freelance writer who covers elder and caregiving issues, personal finance and popular culture.

Harrison Weber,"I like to think Im a friendly guy. I frequently wave at people and tend to like a lot of tweets on Twitter. Today, that friendliness was transformed into something dark and unfamiliar. Today, I accidentally re-liked hundreds of years-old tweets, alarming some, delighting others, and leaving me very, very sorry.
Please, let me explain. This morning, I decided to Marie Kondo my Twitter account and did a quick search for a way to reset my list of Liked Tweets without paying for a service or authorizing a questionable third-party app that might embarrass me in some way. If I was already going to nuke some old tweets and give my following list a spring cleaning, I figured, I might as well do something about the more than 17,000 (yeah, 17,000!) tweets Ive faved over the years.
So I found a simple script on Quora and gleefully shared it with my coworkers. Oh nice, they said, wow. But do not use this scriptnot without great caution. For I now know that its easy to automatically re-like hundreds upon hundreds of tweets with such a script, which is exactly what I did. Jesus Christ.
All I had to do was open Operas developer tools, paste in the code, and tap the enter key. The script seemed to work like a charm for a bit, but after 15 minutes or so I noticed some errors in the console. The tab had gone blank. Undeterred, I refreshed the window, re-ran the script, and got ready to head into work. After taking a nice, hot shower and putting on a fancy sweater, I strolled in the direction of the subway, enjoying the unseasonably nice weather this fine February afternoon.
Picture me, truly at peace in this moment. Coatless, preparing to uproot my life in mere days and explore the world beyond the net. Entirely unaware what I had done until I got a message from my former coworker and friend, Jordan Novet.
I popped open Twitter on my phone, and it quickly became clear that my personal Relikeocalypse had begun.
I called my partner, Amanda, to ask her to shut my laptop at home as fast as she could as I caught the train. No answer. You may be wondering why I boarded that train at all, dear reader. The truth is, I found this all hilarious for a few seconds before panic set in. I strained to respond to the tweets from dozens of different colleagues, friends, and acquaintances who wanted know what was up, and the many more strangers who reached out to me, quote-tweeted me, and so on. Great. SO GREAT.
Soon, Amanda answered and quit the open browser window. It was too late, of course. The script may have stopped, but the notifications were already sent. I may never truly know how many tweets I re-liked, but a conservative estimate puts it at more than 400. So to everyone I accidentally like-spammed today, all I can say is: Whoops!!!! Sorry!
On my way to the office, the L wasnt running due to what MTA workers called a gas leak. Friends, I wish the leak was to blame for my folly. It was not, but I think I know what happened.
I believe my mistake involved re-running the script before Twitter had updated my list of likes, leading it to re-like a certain subset of the tweets Id just recently unliked, thus firing off many, many unintended notifications, and again, sorry! It was an accident!
Imagine how I felt walking into work, as my coworkers swarmed Slack gleefully celebrating my very big goof. My impulse, at this stage of the blog, is to talk about the embarrassment I felt. Instead, I will be honest. Ive quickly cooled off and now this is funny again.
Ive spent the majority of my time in New York (around eight years) somewhere else. Ive spent it online, with you, working, streaming, tweeting, blogging, and yes, liking lots and lots of tweets. And now that Im moving away, at least for a little while, Im energized by the idea of putting some distance between me and the news, even more between myself and social media, and as much as possible between Harrison Weber and all the joy and utter exhaustion the internet brings him. Thats something Ill happily like a thousand times.","I like to think I’m a friendly guy. I frequently wave at people and tend to like a lot of tweets on Twitter.

Alexis Sobel Fitts,"When he uploaded his first YouTube video, there was no way Kumar could have expected that he’d become a public face of H-1B visas: an advocate—and a whistleblower—for a way of life he can barely tolerate. On his channel, Kumar Exclusive, Kumar serves as an everyman narrator of the experience of recipients of the coveted H-1B skilled worker visa, which allows foreign workers to fill technical jobs in America. His dispatches offer both user-friendly how-tos (how to find a job, how to avoid scams, how to win at an American-style interview) and warnings (tales of abusive bosses, short-term contracts, employees faking resumes to win visas, and companies that use lies to tempt foreign workers to the West). On YouTube, he’s amassed a small group following, whose members regularly watch his dispatches to gain practical advice for securing their spots as technical workers abroad. Kumar’s first video was an afterthought—something he made on his lunch break. He’d left the low-slung office building where he worked processing data, sat in his car, and filmed with his cell phone on the dashboard. Quickly, he learned two things: There was an audience for his videos; he loved making them. It was also a distraction from his life on said visa, where he spends his time circling the country in search of short-term jobs that pay crap wages. His wife doesn’t like his hobby; she worries it’ll hurt his visa renewal. His friends have pointed out the people that threaten him, regularly, in the comments section. None of this has stopped Kumar from filming thousands of videos. After all, he tells me, what else is he supposed to do? “I don’t sleep, Alexis,” he says. In a way, Kumar’s life is one big, messy juxtaposition. Our interview is yet another example of this. He’s eager to talk to me about the crappiest parts of the H-1B visa. Then again, our calls are frequently interrupted, because Kumar is looking for his next gig and needs to pick up call waiting in case it’s a recruiter. By the time he got his H-1B visa, Kumar had been trying to enter the program for almost a decade. H-1B visas—which are granted each year to just 85,000 recipients, who hail predominantly from India and China—are tough to get; demand far outweighs supply. Though his bachelor’s degree was in literature, Kumar went back to school to earn a technical degree that would make him eligible for the program. Back in India, he’d been laid off from his government job when he received the news: His visa application had been approved. The visa was tied to a job in New Jersey. The company would sponsor him and pay him a starting salary of $55,000 a year. In the summer of 2008, Kumar’s employer sent a plane ticket and he boarded a flight to Newark, leaving his wife and young son with his mother-in-law. It felt like a fresh beginning. But quickly, he realized, he’d been unaware of the fine print. That job in New Jersey wasn’t quite a job—it was a project that would last for an uncertain amount of time. On paper, H-1Bs are tied to a specific company, making changing jobs or advancement difficult. (That’s one of the reasons the more flexible Optional Practical Training visa, or OPT, has become more popular.) But in practice, H-1B recipients are responsible for ensuring their continued employment, with jobs that could end at any moment. Reading Kumar’s resume from his time in the United States, it would seem like he was working as a spy, or running from the law. In the 10 years he’s lived in America, he’s held jobs in over a dozen different cities. In 2010 alone he worked in North Carolina, Montana, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. (The project in Massachusetts lasted just 36 hours.) Eventually, he developed a system: He’d roll into town and stay in a motel while he looked for a more permanent place to live. Kumar’s first job lasted just a few months. He picked up another project, this time in Maryland. He stayed in a motel for a week while he looked for housing, eventually decamping to the home of an Indian acquaintance, where he paid $700 a month for a room in the basement. When that job ended, he found another in Pennsylvania. He found himself criss-crossing through a strange country, whose small towns were proving trying. The next year, he returned to India for surgery. But his visa required that he return to America within a few weeks, before he’d fully recovered. He was on bed rest, staying with a friend in Michigan, when he picked up his next contract—this time in North Carolina. He packed up his van and drove. Kumar was lonely; he was in pain. He cried for most of the trip. By 2011, he’d saved up enough money for his wife and sons to join him. (That’s right: He now had two sons; his second son was born during the years he was working abroad.) Eventually, Kumar settled on the environs of Rochester, which is when he started commuting. He was hesitant to uproot his family for his erratic schedule, so he found himself driving wherever he got a project. On Sunday evenings he’d drive 375-miles to a small Rhode Island city from Rochester. During the week he’d stay in a motel, and then dart off on Friday evenings for the trip back home. Another commute, this time to Ohio, was grueling enough that he thought about uprooting his family. But his manager was elusive on how long the job would last. His family stayed put. Kumar says that the videos were a natural progression from his daily life. Despite his problems, Indian acquaintances often asked him for dispatches on his life in America. Once he started filming the videos, Kumar found that he had lots to say. His earliest videos are filled with practical advice. In one, titled “[sic] How to Get First Job,” he gives basic advice. (“Your resume is not your autobiography, if you put everything in the resume then what do you speak of in the interview?”) In another, called “Work Culture in America,” Kumar advises on how to get along with colleagues who might be annoyed by being around a foreigner. Over the years, his videos have become more controversial. He warns prospective visa recipients on what to avoid: fake job postings, lawyers who run away with H-1B money, and vendors who try to convince immigrants that fees should come out of their own pocket. He considers himself, in many ways, a truth teller. Over the course of more than a thousand videos, Kumar’s production quality has improved a bit. Instead of speaking from memory, he now types up his points and reviews them off of a sheet of paper. He still films in his car or office, while pointing the camera at himself, selfie-style. Sometimes he films videos solely intended to delight. Last month, a Kumar video titled “[sic] The Beauty of America in fall season, NY,” showed a lake surrounded by trees with brilliant orange and red leaves. In his YouTube bio, Kumar writes that the “highest ambition for any Indian” is coming to America, learning from the West, and returning back to India to change the system. And, as Kumar is the first to point out, without the H-1B program, he never would’ve gotten the chance to come. But that experience has been grueling. His kids, however, are thriving in American school. He’s not like other Indian parents, he tells me. He doesn’t force his kids to study; he doesn’t care if they become doctors. His oldest son, who is in seventh grade, likes basketball and dreams of going pro. He thinks adjusting to life back in India would be hard for them. At one point, when his wife’s visa expired, Kumar suggested that she fake her resume and apply for an H-1B. Unlike her husband, she decided it wasn’t worth the hassle.",Kumar has spent the past decade chasing jobs across America to keep his visa. And he's amassed a cult following of people anxious for his tips and tricks.,2017-11-22T11:45:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The YouTube Celebrity Taking the H-1B Visa Fight Public,https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-celebrity-h1b-visa/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a14475b92ed6c62f0f94995/191:100/pass/profile3_Kumar_flat.jpg,wired,Wired,uproot,1
Craig Kellmann,"Name: Marcella, Justin, and their dogs Buddy Holly and Pete Location: Fonthill — Ontario, Canada Size: 1,700 square feet Years lived in: 2 years, owned Just two years ago Marce of Hey Modest Marce decided to leave her hectic job in the Toronto financial district and uproot her life to live a slower pace. She and boyfriend Justin found a 1920s traditional craftsman home in Fonthill, a small town in the heart of Ontario's wine country. Just minutes away from the town's center, Marce is able to walk to the market and pick up the ingredients for the day's recipe. While the home they live in is traditional in many ways, the couple have brought their modern ""city"" touch to the space. They've been careful to maintain the nearly 100-year-old home's integrity, but you will also find modern streamlined decor, giving the home ""best of both worlds"" as Marce puts it. Filled with premium furniture and fixtures, the monochromatic home perfectly mixes old and new. Combinations of rich tones, subtle patterns, and layered textures give the home a luxurious but still homey feel, no doubt where Marce finds inspiration for many of her recipes. Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Cozy! Monochromatic and minimal (most of the time). I like a mix of vintage and modern, or the best of both worlds; modern vintage (think Rejuvenation and Schoolhouse Electric). Inspiration: Instagram has become a huge inspiration source for me. I love following Apartment Therapy, Design Sponge, and Remodelista to name a few. Favorite Element: The wallpaper! I don't think I will ever get sick of it. The blue stove is a very close second. Okay, it might be a tie. Biggest Challenge: Living in an old house, I am constantly trying to do the house justice. I go out of my way to bring in pieces that could have been here in the 1920s. What Friends Say: ""When I win the lottery, can you design my house?"" or ""Do you seriously fold the toilet paper into a triangle every single time?"" The answer to the latter question is yes, yes I do. I have been called Monica Geller one too many times. Biggest Embarrassment: When I decided to paint the porch floor bright white. Like Farrow &amp; Ball's All White. My design ideas usually pan out, that one did not. The white was so bright you needed sunglasses every time you stepped outside. Some things just aren't meant to be painted white! Proudest DIY: We don't do many DIYs, but I would say sanding and refinishing every original door in the house the first month we moved in. Those old doors are heavy and took so much TLC to restore them to almost new. I think there was 12 in total! Biggest Indulgence: The Lacanche range! No regrets, it is perfect. The custom front white oak door, too. Best Advice: Design with what works best for your home. I let each house or apartment we have lived in really influence my final designs and style decisions. From living in an old Toronto Victorian, to a bright modern condo, to our current 1920s Craftsman home, I always work with the features each space has to offer.

Adrienne Breaux,"Name: Kelly Jackson Location: Atlanta, Georgia Size: 300 square feet ""We bought this Eastlake-style Victorian home almost a year ago, right after we had a newborn baby (our second child, daughter Lucy),"" writes Kelly Jackson. ""The whole house needed major renovations, but my husband, who is a realtor, convinced me that despite this being the WORST time ever to take on a major reno and uproot our whole family, that this was an amazing investment. I listened (begrudgingly) as he convinced me that we could convert the back of the home into two rental units/Airbnbs that could also function as MIL's when our family was in town."" ""This would pay our mortgage, provide savings for our kids and could always be reclaimed as part of the house when we didn't need it anymore. I wasn't sold until I walked into the home and saw the Victorian staircase that I had always dreamed about having. And here we are. This tiny, tiny unit was previously the dirt basement underneath what was previously the servants' quarters of this 120-year-old home. I wanted to keep it as light and bright as possible, dig out a full bathroom to make a little luxurious space that is cozy, but comfortable to stay in. I added white shiplap, herringbone tile and loads of tiny details to hopefully make this space unique. There is also the original fireplace stack (an exposed brick wall) in the bathroom."" What's the last thing you bought (or found!) for your home? We love the abstract painting we found at Highland Row Antiques here in Atlanta. This is the BEST little antique store. Many people write it off because they look at the front and it appears very small. What they don't know is it has a gigantic basement where all the real goods are. We have gotten almost every beautiful piece of furniture (from sideboards to vintage curio cabinets) at this store. The dresser you see in the bathroom was actually found in the dirt basement/crawl space and converted into a vanity. A little homage to the house. The house itself was built in 1890, for Thomas Buchanan who was Warden of the Fourth Ward of Atlanta at the time; Claude Buchanan, his son was interim mayor of Atlanta for awhile. We have a friend who specializes in researching home histories and we have SO many wonderful articles about the house, which include everything from weddings to funerals."" ""This home is surrounded by other Victorian homes in a beautiful part of Grant Park, which is quickly becoming one of the most vibrant places in Atlanta thanks to the carefully curated developments happening on Memorial Drive. Grant Park has the feeling of a historic little neighborhood, while being right in the heart of the city of Atlanta. It's also just a few steps away from historic Oakland Cemetery, the most famous cemetery for Victorian architecture. A small note on that cemetery is that the entire family who built this home is all buried there! One of the most beautiful places to stroll with a coffee from Octane (also just two blocks away). Dine at famous Six Feet Under. Our little family includes myself, a marketer who moonlights in interior design.

PTI,"Mumbai: A day after sealing a seat-sharing pact with the BJP, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday asked the NDA government not to behave in a way that would fuel allegations that it was trying to wage a war to influence poll results.Riots and terror attacks should not be used for ""political gains"", the Sena said in an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana'. 
Targeting students from Kashmir over such incidents could spell more trouble for the government, it warned. 
 The remarks came a day after the BJP and the Shiv Sena announced a seat-sharing arrangement for the upcoming Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly elections, overcoming their strained ties and earlier declarations of going solo. 
Without taking names, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said, ""Sometime back there were political allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could wage a small-scale war to win elections... The rulers should not behave in a way that these allegations gather strength."" Referring to the February 14 Pulwama bombing in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, the Marathi daily said, ""The country is still boiling over the terror attack, hence some may face criticism. (But) riots and terror attacks should not be used for political gains.""
Cautioning the government that the recent attacks on students from Kashmir in other parts of the country could spell more trouble, it recalled the 1984 anti-Sikh riots after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi and said the Congress was still ""paying a heavy price"" for it. 
It also took a dig at certain lawmakers for their controversial comments made on India-Pakistan relations and in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror strike.
Noting that Punjab Congress minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was ousted from a television show after he called for dialogue with Pakistan even after the Pulwama attack, the Sena said pressure was mounted on him and a campaign launched against him over the remarks.
On the other hand, the comments of BJP legislator Nepal Singh, who recently stirred a controversy with his statement that Army jawans ""ought to die"", were selectively ignored and he did not face any action, it pointed out.
Further targeting the government over the Pulwama incident, it said, ""Our intelligence officials can trace an e-mail purportedly referring to a threat to the prime minister's life but they fail to stop terror attack on a convoy.""
Before 2014, Modi and RSS held the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government responsible for every terror attack in the country. ""Then it should be understood if someone expects the current prime minister to uproot terrorism from the country,"" it said.","Day After Seat-Sharing Agreement, Sena Targets BJP Over Pulwama Terror Attack News18 The Secret Role Of Prashant Kishor As BJP, Sena Sink Differences NDTV News How Modi and Shah Tamed the Tiger, Proved Uddhav’s Sena Was All Roar and No Bite News18 Opinion | T…",2019-02-19T14:42:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'News18.com'}","Day After Seat-Sharing Agreement, Sena Targets BJP Over Pulwama Terror Attack - News18",https://www.news18.com/news/politics/day-after-seat-sharing-agreement-sena-targets-bjp-over-pulwama-terror-attack-2042035.html,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2019/02/Amit-Shah-greets-Shiv-Sena-President-Uddhav-Thackeray.jpg,,News18.com,uproot,1
"VIVIAN YEE, LIZ ROBBINS and CAITLIN DICKERSON","More than 45,000 Haitians will have to leave by July 2019; about 57,000 Hondurans are hoping, against all indications to the contrary, that they will be spared the next time the Trump administration must decide whether to extend their protections. Another report, by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, estimates that stripping the protections from Salvadorans, Hondurans and Haitians would deprive Social Security and Medicare of about $6.9 billion in contributions over a decade, and would shrink the gross domestic product by $45.2 billion. Officials under multiple presidents have renewed the protections year after year, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to enlarge their foothold on American life. But the Trump administration has emphasized that the permissions were originally granted because of wars and natural disasters in the immigrants’ home countries and intended to last only until conditions there improved. The administration and its supporters do cite one economic argument for tighter controls on immigration: Those jobs, they say, could be done by Americans. “T.P.S. does not exist for the convenience of industries that rely on low-wage foreign labor,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The companies create “self-fulfilling prophecies” by offering little pay and grueling conditions, he said: “When Americans reject the wages and working conditions they offer, they then argue that Americans are unwilling to take the jobs.” Business leaders often insist they cannot find enough workers at all, let alone Americans. Construction companies already confronting a nationwide labor shortage will have to replace workers from what industry executives said was a minuscule pool, or turn down projects. “There are no Americans out there to take the jobs,” said Mark Drury, a vice president at Shapiro &amp; Duncan, a Washington-area plumbing, heating and cooling firm. The company and its competitors have resorted to poaching each other’s project managers, engineers, welders and plumbers. The company even retrained and hired a former coal miner who decided to switch careers, Mr. Drury said, but had not found other miners willing to move to the area. Not only will the company have to lay off its 14 Salvadoran workers, Mr. Drury said, but it was also worrying about the roughly 30 employees who are protected from deportation by virtue of a government program for immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. The Trump administration has announced the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, will expire in March. Congress is considering creating a new program for those immigrants, perhaps in exchange for new border security spending, but no deal has been reached. Mr. Drury said he had about 40 openings. The company — which is helping to build a cancer center, the new headquarters of the mortgage giant Fannie Mae and a project at the National Security Agency’s headquarters — was already turning away work because it could not hire fast enough, he said. Photo “If you get rid of 26 percent of my employees, I guess I’m going to have to terminate some of the contracts,” said Victor Moran, the chief executive of Total Quality, a janitorial services company. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times “Losing people just puts us further behind,” he said. For Stan Marek, the chief executive of Marek, a Houston-based construction company, the decisions to end temporary protections have come at the worst possible time. Houston is waiting to be rebuilt after its run-in with Hurricane Harvey, yet, he said, there will be fewer people than ever to overhaul the city’s office buildings, schools, hotels and hospitals. About 30 employees from Honduras, Haiti and El Salvador with temporary protected status have worked for him for over a decade. Some are skilled craftsmen; some are supervisors. Mr. Marek has pushed on his workers’ behalf, even paying for a public relations campaign to call for immigration reform. “If they lose their status — boom, we’ll have to terminate them, and that’s not much fun, telling a guy who’s got three kids in high school, all American-born, that he’s going to be terminated,” Mr. Marek said. “They’re good people, damn good people.” Though they will be subject to deportation, many immigrants who lose their temporary protections are likely to stay in the United States. Asked what he planned to do when his status expired next year, Noe Duarte said he and his wife and two adult children, who are already living here illegally, would simply “hide.” Mr. Duarte came to the United States from El Salvador in 2000, fleeing violence and poverty in his hometown, and was granted temporary status the following year. His family operates two small companies, cleaning and painting houses, in Gaithersburg, Md. When business is slow, Mr. Duarte works as a safety supervisor for a major construction company. Even knowing that their finances would crater without his work permit, he felt that the family would be safer here than in El Salvador. “The country is infested with gangs,” he said. “The moment we arrived, they would come to our door asking for money. And if we didn’t give it to them, we’d be killed.” Mr. Moran, the janitorial services executive, had been worried about the impending cancellation of the program. His staff cleans buildings throughout the Washington area, including the headquarters of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that would be responsible for deporting his workers, and the offices of the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III. A Trump voter who said he supported the president’s overall approach to immigration, Mr. Moran refuses to hire unauthorized immigrants, saying he believes such hiring practices leave those workers more vulnerable to wage abuse and poor treatment. (And, if caught, his firm could also face prosecution and large fines.) Mr. Moran, himself an immigrant from Spain, hopes that immigration reform will eventually happen under President Trump. In the meantime, he said, “it could be painful” for thousands of people to uproot their lives. It will not be easy on employers, either. Assisted living facilities that rely on skilled nurses to care for the elderly and the sick already struggle to attract applicants to jobs that are both physically and emotionally taxing, said Christopher Donnellan, the director of government relations for the American Healthcare Association, an assisted living facility trade group. His affiliates were already shaken once, in November, when the Trump administration announced it would rescind protected status for Haitians, who make up a majority of the staff in some facilities in the Boston area. Salvadorans with protected status make up an even larger proportion of the members’ work force, he said. Before the November decision, the Walt Disney Company announced that it, too, supported an extension: It said Disney World employed more than 500 protected Haitians. Seventeen years ago, Hugo Rodriguez, 43, started as a dishwasher at the Great Neck, N.Y., outpost of the fabled Peter Luger Steak House. Now he is a cook. Several of his co-workers also have temporary protections, he said. Receiving his permit “was the beginning of the American dream,” he recalled. Now, he fears losing it will be the end. “I can’t stay illegally, I can’t do it,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “But that means to go back and start at the bottom.” Continue reading the main story",The Trump administration’s ending of temporary legal status for Salvadorans and Haitians means that employers who depend on them will have to look harder for help.,2018-01-09T10:00:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","From Offices to Disney World, Employers Brace for the Loss of an Immigrant Work Force",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/immigrant-work-force-salvadorans-haitians.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/08/us/00employers-01/00employers-01-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,uproot,1
Ellen Francis,"DEIR AL-ZOR PROVINCE, Syria (Reuters) - Hareth Najem fled Islamic State’s last enclave in eastern Syria wounded and alone. The Iraqi orphan’s family had died two years earlier in air strikes across the border in al-Qaim region. 
“I had two brothers and a sister. They all died, and then I was by myself,” Hareth told Reuters, tears filling his eyes. “My little sister, I loved her a lot. I used to take her with me to the market.” 
Lying in a cattle truck beside another injured boy at a desert transit point for U.S.-backed forces, he huddled under a blanket. His face was covered in dirt and the side of his head wrapped with bandages covering wounds incurred days earlier. 
Hareth was 11 years old when Islamic State (IS) carved out its “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of civilians and attracting an array of enemies that have fought from the air and on the ground to uproot the jihadists. 
Now 16, he was among the children swept up this week in the civilian evacuation of Baghouz, the last shred of land under the jihadists’ control where they are on the brink of defeat at the hands of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 
Some of the children are foreigners whose parents brought them to be raised under IS rule, or child fighters conscripted into what the group dubbed “cubs of the caliphate”. Others, including members of the Yazidi minority, were enslaved by the jihadists. 
Many have seen their parents die in the fighting or be detained by rival forces. As IS faces territorial defeat, their fate remains uncertain. The SDF investigates all men and teenage boys arriving from Baghouz to determine possible IS links. 
‘THESE KIDS HAVE NOBODY’ 
Around 20 children crossed the frontline on their own this week, including Iraqis, Syrians, Turks and Indonesians, said SDF commander Adnan Afrin. The fathers of some were identified as IS fighters and arrested immediately. 
“These kids have nobody. They need somebody to take care of them, to provide mental health support,” said Afrin, adding that some had gone hungry for a long time. The SDF plans to hand over the children to aid groups, he said. 
Hareth said his family had been running a market stall when IS overran their town and they had no links to the group. 
After his family was killed in an aerial bombardment, he crossed into Syria with other Iraqis who feared Shi’ite Muslim militias advancing against IS would take revenge on Sunnis - a fear that other Iraqis have cited as their reason for entering IS-held Syria. 
Hareth said he tried to avoid the jihadists and denies attending their schools or receiving military training. Their morality police would sometimes arrest and whip him. 
“They gave speeches at the mosques, jihad and whatnot,” he said. “I was scared of them. My whole family died because of them.” 
When he reached Baghouz, he worked in a field in return for a room to sleep in. He tried saving enough money to go home, but said the militants stopped him. 
Hareth was wounded last week when a shell fell near where he was standing along the Euphrates River, injuring his ear, hand and stomach. He wants to get medical care and return to relatives still in Iraq. 
“I want to go look for them ... When I get better and my body recovers, when I can walk,” he said. “I want to go back, to become a young man again, to build a future again.”

Cale Guthrie Weissman,"Financial institutions sure want to make us think they know what’s in store for the future. Yet even they disagree on some of the fundamentals. You see this firsthand in Davos, Switzerland, this week, where world and business leaders have descended on the small mountain town to discuss what lies ahead for the world. Indeed, Thursday morning, during a panel discussing the future of banking, we saw precisely these types of diverging visions.At the event early Thursday morning, Fast Company editor-in-chief Stephanie Mehta sat beside Mastercard vice chairman Ann Cairns, Western Union CEO and president Hikmet Ersek, and PayU CEO Laurent Le Moal. During the hour-long conversation, she brought up the gnarly subject of security and trust. “You need to earn the trust of the consumer,” Le Moal said as a matter of fact.
To do that, he went on, financial companies need to do a variety of tasks. “It’s about promises getting delivered to the consumer,” Le Moal explained. “Money needs to arrive now—it needs to [have] almost zero fees,” he said. “If you deliver these promises everyday, you win the trust of the consumer.” His prognostication was clear: The only way to stay relevant in the financial space was to continually deliver cheap and reliable services to customers.
Not everyone was on board with this sentiment. Ersek, for example, visibly grimaced at Le Moal’s reference to no fees. When asked about whether it was sustainable for financial institutions to remove fees, his answer was blunt: “It’s not.”
“We’re all here to make money,” he went on. “There’s nothing wrong with making money off of consumers.” To the Western Union CEO, most consumers aren’t necessarily looking for zero fees, but simply the peace of mind that they can successfully do a transaction. “The customer in Uganda trusts us to go pick up the money,” he said.
Said Ersek, the issue is about the business model. Right now, companies rely on fees as a way to stay afloat. It’s possible that these organizations can completely uproot their models to make way for reduced fees.
“These things are changing over time,” Ersek admitted. “But at the end of the day, somebody has to pay for the service.”

Victor Luckerson,"It’s always the perfect temperature inside the Amazon Spheres. More than 40,000 plants sourced from tropical forests in 30 countries populate the four-story glass edifice, which doubles as a workspace and lounge for company employees. During the day, the lush vegetation is kept healthy at a temperate 72 degrees and 60 percent humidity, mimicking Costa Rica’s Central Valley, a haven for expats who have left their home countries for paradise. The cavernous structure also includes waterfalls, winding canopy walkways, and fish from the actual Amazon River. Heat is piped in using recycled energy from a nearby data center, ensuring that downtown Seattle’s warmest respite isn’t a drag on the power grid. Outside the spheres, the city is a colder place. In the nearby neighborhood of Wallingford, a newly erected outpost of small wooden shacks offer shelter for 22 of Seattle’s homeless residents. This is a “tiny house village,” sanctioned by the city as a kind of middle ground between living at a street address and on the street. The buildings sit in the corner of a parking lot across from a seafood restaurant, shielded from view by a metal fence. Each shack, painted with one of the bold colors of a Crayola starter pack, offers electricity and a roof sturdier than the tents in Seattle’s increasingly common homeless encampments. Every resident is issued a window fan for the occasional hot day, and the people here hope to receive heaters before winter. But the small collections of potted petunias and pothos that sit in front of their temporary homes are unlikely to survive the city’s harshest months. Seattle, like a lot of American cities, has become a boomtown split between haves and have-nots. Here, though, many of the haves can be ID’d from afar by the blue lanyards hanging from their necks as they swarm fast-casual restaurants during lunch hour. Amazon is Seattle’s largest employer, its greatest occupier of office space, and its most prized economic engine. The company is also one of the reasons the city has endured skyrocketing housing prices, ever-expanding waves of gentrification, and a huge spike in homelessness over the past several years. By reaching a level of success that outpaced even its own ambitious projections, Amazon has detonated what some critics call a “ prosperity bomb ” in Seattle, leaving the less affluent to deal with the fallout. Kshama Sawant, a City Council member who has cast herself as the local foil to CEO Jeff Bezos, wants to lob a bomb right back. “It is class warfare,” she tells me, as the chants from an anti-ICE protest at Seattle’s immigrant detention center ring out behind us. Here, among Seattle’s activist left, she’s in her element—passersby greet her warmly every few minutes, and a woman wearing a Seattle Fire Department sweatshirt swoops in to take a selfie. “We cannot base our needs for affordable housing on whether or not the billionaires are going to agree with us. … This is a consequence of capitalism. So we cannot expect those that are benefiting from the system to fight against the system.” Sawant’s main topics of conversation regularly veer from talking local policy to the scourge of the global capitalist system, two seemingly distinct topics that she sees as deeply interconnected. She is one of the only socialists elected to public office in the United States, and she doesn’t shy away from the fact her ideology puts her squarely at odds with America’s most successful companies. In her four years on Seattle’s City Council, her platform has included a $15-per-hour minimum wage and rent control for tenants. This year, the cause that thrust her into national headlines was a campaign to enact a per-employee tax, commonly known as a head tax, on Amazon and other large businesses in Seattle. The money raised would have been used to fund efforts to increase affordable housing and curb homelessness. The “Amazon tax,” as she calls it, “would have been a shot in the arm for people in other cities saying we want a tax on Big Tech, too.” “We cannot base our needs for affordable housing on whether or not the billionaires are going to agree with us. … We cannot expect those that are benefiting from the system to fight against the system.” —Kshama Sawant, Seattle City Council member The head tax battle dominated local politics this spring, leading to regular street protests, City Council meetings that doubled as screaming matches, and a gong rung 6,320 times in front of City Hall to represent each of the homeless people sleeping outside in Seattle’s King County. The conflict was partially the doing of Amazon, which stopped construction on one of its buildings to oppose the proposal and poured money into an antitax political campaign. But it also belied a split between Seattle’s traditional liberals and the so-called “far left,” an ascendant faction nationally in the era of Donald Trump. Riding a wave of disillusionment with both tech giants and the business-friendly policies of mainstream Democrats, Sawant has carved out a prominent space for leftist politics in local government. The backlash against the head tax, though, indicates that her platform may face resistance from corporate giants and everyday liberals alike. Her critics say her hardline rhetoric is a distraction that undermines efforts to achieve compromise between the government and the business community. But the head tax fight seems to have only calcified Sawant’s us-vs.-them mentality. “If a politician is not willing to do the right thing because they face some opposition from big business, they are of no use to us,” she says. Whether it wants to be or not, Seattle has become an incubator for the ideological conflicts among liberals that are poised to erupt on the national stage during the midterm elections and beyond. As the city struggles to decide just how far left it wants to drift, housing prices, Amazon’s head count, and the homeless population all continue to rise. “We’re fighting for a tax on big business to build affordable housing,” Sawant says. “But underlying that demand is really a deeper question: Who has the right to live in our cities?” Even at a young age, Sawant was acutely aware of the economic chasm between the extremely wealthy and the “vast ocean of poverty and misery” in Mumbai, India, where she grew up. Her activist streak was inflamed when she came to the United States in the mid-’90s to work as an engineer in North Carolina and saw that income inequality was a problem here as well. “To come to America, the richest country in the world, and see homelessness, poverty, just absolutely rampant racism … that’s what ultimately was the next step in me getting radicalized.” Sawant speaks with a low hum of intensity that spikes when she’s describing the vagaries of capitalism. She rarely breaks eye contact. Many politicians, especially local ones, communicate in facts and figures, but Sawant speaks in ideas. She’s less a legislator arguing for a specific agenda than a polemicist mapping out a new world order—“We need international solidarity among working people”—and actively seeking recruits. In 2009, working as an economics professor, she moved to Seattle and found a group that articulated her sense of disillusionment with the way the world functioned: the Socialist Alternative party. The political organization, which currently includes roughly 1,000 members across about 40 cities, advocates for public ownership of the world’s 500 biggest corporations to upend the global capitalist system. This puts Sawant and her party far to the left of Bernie Sanders, who identified as a socialist but ran for president as a Democrat and supported private ownership of companies. “I recognized that this is what I’ve been looking for: an explanation of the global ills and a confirmation of my own understanding that these are systemic problems and will need systemic solutions,” Sawant says. “That is what I got from being part of Socialist Alternative, a Marxist critique of capitalism. But not just that—a strategy to get organized as a working-class person.” Socialist Alternative was active in the Occupy Wall Street movement, with Sawant serving as an organizer in Occupy Seattle. The group wanted to channel the anticorporate furor of the moment into longer-lasting political action, so it backed Sawant as a candidate for state representative in 2012. She says she was “somewhat horrified” at the prospect of being a politician. She ran, though, to support the will of the party. She lost to the incumbent speaker of the house, but her nearly 30 percent share of the vote made Socialist Alternative think she was politically viable. “We don’t want to run just to bring up issues,” says Josh Koritz, a party member who worked on Sawant’s 2012 campaign. “We want to run to win.” The next year she ran for Seattle City Council, making the burgeoning $15-per-hour minimum wage movement the centerpiece of her platform. She beat a 16-year council incumbent by about 3,000 votes, and Seattle became the first major city to institute such a high minimum wage in 2014. “She was a very effective candidate in 2012, and she’s only gotten better since then,” Koritz says. “She’s very good at connecting with the anger that people have and bringing it to the surface.” Eventually, her ire turned toward Amazon. The online retail giant spent its first decade in Seattle in a few office buildings spread throughout the city, but in the mid-2000s committed to building a centralized urban campus. The company secured nearly 2 million square feet of office space in the largely undeveloped South Lake Union, a massive land grab that was supposed to accommodate Amazon’s growth through 2016. But by 2012, the company had committed to another 3.3 million-square-foot complex closer to the core of downtown, which would include several high rises and the tropical workspace housed in glass spheres. Today Amazon controls more than 8 million square feet in the city, nearly 20 percent of Seattle’s prime office space. It’s gone from 5,000 local employees to 45,000 in eight years. “They grew at a pace that even they didn’t expect, and nobody really expected,” says Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association, a lobbying group for Seattle businesses. “You have people who are earning a lot of money at a company like Amazon right next to people that are either serving them coffee or working at a restaurant.” —Joe Parilla, Metropolitan Policy Program fellow at the Brookings Institution The strain on the city during this period has been obvious. Housing stock has not kept pace with the torrid job growth spurred by Amazon and expanded footprints for rivals Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Apartment rents increased 64 percent between 2010 and 2017, and home prices seem to reach record highs every month. The median household income rose nearly $10,000 in a single year, a signal less of a rising tide than a tsunami of well-paid transplants. In an assessment of the 100 largest metro areas in the United States, the Brookings Institution found that Seattle ranked third in prosperity, measuring the increase in wealth in a community. But the city ranked 86th in inclusion, measuring how that wealth is distributed among individuals. “Seattle has gotten much more expensive. Even if my wage is going up, [if] it’s not going up as fast as the cost of living is rising, then my real standard of living is actually declining,” says Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. “You have people who are earning a lot of money at a company like Amazon right next to people that are either serving them coffee or working at a restaurant.” Still, Parilla says it’s unfair to lay the problems associated with Seattle’s growth solely at Amazon’s feet. The company notes that its presence has led to the creation of 53,000 other jobs in Seattle and helped drive the unemployment rate down from 9 percent in 2010 to 3.7 percent today. Amazon estimates that it brought an additional $38 billion to the local economy between 2010 and 2016, outside its own multibillion-dollar outlay. And it says it has paid tens of millions of dollars to the city for affordable housing. Through a partnership with Mary’s Place, a local nonprofit serving homeless women and families, the company has provided shelter for more than 350 families since 2016. Amid its current building spree, Amazon is planning a Mary’s Place shelter in one of its downtown office buildings, which will house at least 300 people per night. “It’s our first permanent home,” says Mary’s Place executive director Marty Hartman. Typically the nonprofit converts vacated buildings slated for demolition into temporary shelters. “Knowing that we don’t have to leave is something every family wants, right? To be stable, to set roots. And for Mary’s Place, [Amazon has] made that possible.” Despite Amazon’s charitable efforts, Seattle infrastructure is increasingly littered with graffiti tags like “Amazon Get Out” and “ Fuck Bezos.” The tensions between Amazon and its home city came into stark relief when the company announced in September it was going to choose a second headquarters through a thirst-inducing public bidding process. The HQ2 search was an acknowledgement that Amazon was getting too big for Seattle. It also hinted that Seattle might be getting too unpleasant for Amazon. Five City Council members signed a letter to Bezos apologizing if the company felt “unwelcome” in the Puget Sound, an olive branch meant to keep HQ2 in Washington. Sawant dismissed the letter as “craven” and called for Amazon to be taken under democratic public ownership. With no chance of an Amazon takeover, a tax would have to do. Sawant had been pushing for a head tax in Seattle since her first year on the City Council, to no avail—a previous head tax, adopted in 2006, was repealed after it was deemed a drag on the economy during the recession. But the optics of such a tax were changing fast. Seattle’s homelessness problem was declared a state of emergency in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing, exceeding 12,000 people countywide this year. President Trump’s corporate tax cut enriched big business, landing Amazon a windfall estimated at nearly $800 million. Thanks to the company’s high-flying stock, Bezos became the richest man in the world in October. In November, after another head tax measure failed, the City Council formed a task force to gather insight from the community on how best to raise money to fight homelessness. Amazon and other businesses were invited to participate. Most chose not to. The Seattle Chamber of Commerce said an onerous head tax was a “ predetermined outcome ” of the task force, so taking part didn’t make sense. As the task force’s deliberations took place in City Hall, Sawant drummed up anti-Amazon sentiment on city streets. She hosted a Tax Amazon town hall in Seattle’s historically black Central District, which she represents, and organized regular protests outside the company’s tourist-friendly spheres. Socialist Alternative members crowded the City Council chambers, with one meeting growing so raucous that the council emptied the room. Not everyone agreed with Sawant’s tactics, even among those who believed Amazon should be taxed. “She said the enemy is Bezos,” says Teresa Mosqueda, a fellow City Council member. “I say the enemy is income inequality.” But Amazon itself helped turn the head tax debate into a sparring match on May 2. As the City Council was settling on a $500-per-employee tax proposal, Amazon paused construction on a new tower and floated the idea of subleasing its office space in another, pending the head tax vote. The tactic put the fate of 7,000 potential Seattle jobs in question. Mosqueda, who cosponsored the head tax and was among the City Council members in negotiations with Amazon, recalls officials from the company visiting her office that day. “They walked in and I held up that press release, or the news coverage of it, and I was like, ‘What are you guys doing?’” she says. “It felt like a threat, and that’s the reality of what it was.” “[Sawant] said the enemy is Bezos. I say the enemy is income inequality.” —Teresa Mosqueda, Seattle City Council member As Amazon executives were starting to play hardball, some if its workers were mobilizing as well. Aubrey Pullman, a lighting artist in the company’s video game division, was among about 60 employees who signed a letter to Amazon’s leadership urging the company to support the head tax. Though he describes his work environment as mostly apolitical, he also spoke at City Council meetings in support of the tax, believing it was important for the community to know that not everyone at Amazon was against the initiative. He was surprised how vehemently his company opposed the tax, given its immense wealth. “When I first joined Amazon, I didn’t really see the businesses as a problem,” he says. “As I see how we’ve behaved in these situations where we’re opposing a progressive business tax to support city services and the well-being of the city, I’ve become less positive about being an Amazon employee.” On May 14, when City Council members filed into their chambers to vote on the tax, they were greeted by hundreds of passionate citizens. Some, waving red signs saying, “Tax Amazon, Housing for All,” and identifying as socialists, urged the council to pass as large a tax as possible. Others, waving green signs asking, “Results First: Where Has Our Money Gone?,” argued that the escalating homelessness crisis showed that the City Council wasn’t using taxpayer dollars responsibly. In reality, the decision of how much to tax businesses had already been made. Over the weekend, Mayor Jenny Durkan had urged the City Council to lower the tax to $250 per employee. The figure represented the most Amazon had told the mayor it’d be willing to pay, according to the Seattle Times (Durkan’s mayoral campaign was backed by a pro-business group funded heavily by Amazon ). Ultimately, the mayor and the council settled on $275 per employee for companies earning $20 million or more in annual revenue. The tax would raise about $47 million per year for five years to fund 591 affordable housing units and a variety of services for the homeless. Amazon would have to pay about $11 million per year. Though it was a big reduction from $500, Sawant still claimed the new law as a victory. “The message that we are sending is that working people, not just in Seattle but in every other city, can have the courage to take on one of the most powerful corporations in the world and the richest man in the world,” she said before the vote. “And you can build a movement that can win.” “She’s the Donald Trump in our midst.” Saul Spady is devouring a deluxe cheeseburger and a strawberry milkshake at Dick’s Drive-In, a burger joint in the style of the original McDonald’s, where you have to walk up to the orange-and-white outdoor stand to order a meal. This is not millennial kitsch (though the gentrified Capitol Hill neighborhood is also full of that)—Spady’s grandfather opened Dick’s in 1954, and the company now has six restaurants across the metro area. It’s now unlikely to open another one in town, Spady says, in part because of the policies advocated by Kshama Sawant. Spady, and many others, see Sawant as a provocateur heavy on divisive rhetoric but light on practical policies. Her socialist credentials and protest photo-ops garner her national attention, but they’ve also earned her plenty of ire in the city she represents. A lot of people in Seattle care less about a globalist vision than what’s happening on their own streets with their own tax dollars. What happened after the head tax was passed may prove Spady’s point. Mayor Durkan signed the City Council ordinance on a Wednesday evening. By Thursday morning, a range of business community leaders, including Spady and executives from Amazon, were gathered at the offices of the Downtown Seattle Association to strategize a way to defeat the new law. Overall about 600 businesses were to be subject to the tax, including low-margin operators such as restaurants and grocery stores. “[The City Council] talked about Amazon so much that they forgot Seattle is an incredibly diverse economy that has both blue- and white-collar [jobs], tech and businesses like Dick’s Drive-In, who would have been included in the tax as well,” Spady says. The group decided to push for a referendum on the November ballot, which would require signatures from thousands of Seattle residents. Such political efforts typically involve paying signature gatherers to stand on street corners with clipboards and rope in would-be voters. With enough money, an organization can strong-arm nearly any cause onto the ballot, and the antitax alliance was flush with cash. Amazon donated $25,000, and regional trade groups for grocers and food suppliers poured in even more. The business community, under the banner No Tax on Jobs, built up a war chest of over $450,000. The group also amassed an army of 2,000 volunteers, who it says collected about 17,000 of the 48,000 total signatures the campaign gathered. Polling showed that the head tax wasn’t popular among Seattle voters, many of whom expressed frustration with the City Council’s inability to curb homelessness despite a ballooning city budget. “I’m not evil for being a fiscally responsible progressive,” says Spady. “What we’re really missing is a place for a fiscally responsible, moderate progressive Democrat. … There’s a lot of those people here, and they’re people who totally understand how to run a small business or a union or their own budget at home. They’re asking the council to do the same thing.” “[The City Council] talked about Amazon so much that they forgot Seattle is an incredibly diverse economy that has both blue- and white-collar [jobs], tech and businesses like Dick’s Drive-In.” —Saul Spady, No Tax on Jobs organizer Supporters of the head tax launched a countereffort called Bring Seattle Home. The campaign raised almost all of its $145,000 in funding from Service Employee International Union, which lobbies heavily to influence labor battles across the country. Members of Socialist Alternative and other activist groups staffed public tables in an effort to persuade people to cancel their referendum signatures. Both sides were digging in for a long summer fight. Sawant was planning a meeting on June 30 to start organizing a grassroots movement to win in November. But the meeting never happened. On June 12, the City Council voted 7-2 to repeal the head tax, stunning advocates on both sides (Sawant and Mosqueda voted against the repeal). In a meeting punctuated by jeers from the largely tax-supporting crowd, City Council members reiterated that they supported the tax in theory but felt that unfavorable polling and the deep pockets of the opposition made the referendum unwinnable in November. Nationally, headlines declared that the city had meekly “ bowed to Amazon.” Locals have plenty of other theories for what happened: The SEIU refused to fund a losing, monthslong campaign; the mayor didn’t want the unpopular head tax sucking political oxygen from her other November initiatives; or council members feared losing their seats in the next election over the vote (City Council members Mike O’Brien and Lisa Herbold, who cosponsored the head tax proposal, did not respond to requests for comment). Whatever the case, the head tax was widely perceived as a political loser. Moments before the council killed the tax, though, Sawant was characteristically defiant. “It’s magical thinking to believe that somehow you will be able to win a tax like this without making enemies out of Jeff Bezos,” she said. “No, Jeff Bezos is our enemy.” The months of speeches, negotiations, anti-Amazon signs, and protests ultimately produced nothing for Seattle. Sawant had become the name most closely associated with the tax, but she did not cosponsor the initial ordinance or chair the task force that hammered out its details. Her coalition of working-class people did not encompass all of Seattle—at one of her protests she was shouted down by construction workers who’d been employed on Amazon projects and opposed the head tax. She was not even aware the tax was being killed off until it was already dead. Opponents of the head tax see this as proof that Sawant’s lone-wolf, no-surrender strategy doesn’t work. “The simplistic, politically convenient rhetoric, I don’t think is meaningful and moves a lot of voters in Seattle,” says Scholes, the Downtown Seattle Association president. “I think she was really unhelpful to [her] cause and helped galvanize the rest of the city.” Sawant insists that by knocking on doors and reaching out to everyday people, her side could have reversed public opinion on the head tax the same way they were able to build momentum for a $15-per-hour minimum wage. She seems to blame Democrats as much as she blames Amazon for the head tax’s collapse. “All the council members in Seattle are Democrats except for me,” she says. “And seven of them engaged in this cowardly capitulation at the first sign of attack from big business. That is why it is really important for our movement to build our own strength independent of the Democratic Party.” Greg Casar watched the head tax saga unfold with great interest from Austin, Texas, where he serves as a City Council member for one of the city’s lowest-income districts. Austin is one of the finalist cities for Amazon’s HQ2, along with 19 others that have been placed in a kind of municipal deathmatch by the tech giant. The way Amazon influenced the head tax debate made Casar more wary of bringing Amazon’s new headquarters to his home. “Having seen Amazon lead the fight to repeal such a reasonable tax in Seattle, that would help significantly address issues of homelessness in that city, it really cast a doubt in my mind about whether or not we want to see Amazon expand in Austin,” he says. “We already in Texas have had so many laws repealed and options taken away from us, that having Amazon be a part of that I think could make things even worse.” Casar was one of five City Council members in HQ2 cities to sign a joint statement urging finalists not to offer Amazon cushy tax incentives. If Amazon does come to Austin, he wants the company to be proactive in helping address the inevitable challenges regarding affordable housing and income inequality. “If they want to participate as a part of our community, then their labor practices, their antiunion stance, their antiredistribution stance need to change,” he says. “Based on their behavior in Seattle, it seems unlikely that they’re going to step up and offer more.” Casar is a Democrat, but he’s also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA has more than quadrupled its membership since the election of Trump, to about 37,000 as of May. The organization, and socialist ideals more generally, got another huge boost last month, when 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pulled off a surprise victory over a 19-year congressional veteran in New York’s Democratic primary. Casar paraphrased the DSA’s newly world-famous member when we spoke: “In the richest country in the world, people shouldn’t be too poor to live.” “If [Amazon wants] to participate as a part of our community, then their labor practices, their antiunion stance, their antiredistribution stance need to change.” —Greg Casar, Austin City Council member Ocasio-Cortez is not the only leftist to rise to prominence in the Trump era. Four women backed by DSA won Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania’s state Legislature in May. Black Lives Matter organizer and DSA member khalid kamau recently won a City Council seat in South Fulton, Georgia. Socialist Alternative member Ginger Jentzen raised the most money ever in a Minneapolis City Council campaign, though she lost her race. All told, the DSA now has at least 35 members serving in public office across the United States. That’s a far cry from the thousand-plus socialists elected in the early 20th century, but it’s an improvement for the movement over 2013, when Sawant’s election was a complete outlier. This is the lens through which Sawant tries to frame the head tax defeat. She sees her work in Seattle as part of a broader national and international cause, the beginnings of a long struggle against “capitalist-oriented politics.” “It’s a confirmation of what we’ve been saying in Socialist Alternative, that there’s a huge openness to socialist ideas,” she says of the recent leftist victories. “I think that for millions of young people in the United States—the millennial generation, people in their teens, 20s, 30s, even in their 40s—socialism is not a dirty word. What’s crystallizing in the minds of millions of these young people is the capitalist system, as it’s on offer, is not working.” Despite the advances of her movement nationally, Seattle’s housing crisis is no closer to being solved than when the head tax debate started. Sawant is vague on next steps, saying that the confirmation of the annual city budget in the fall will provide a new opportunity to raise the housing issue. Spady envisions leasing government-owned lands to developers at a discounted rate in exchange for mixed-income, dorm-style housing near public transit stations. He also sees Amazon’s partnership with Mary’s Place as a promising development model. But rezoning residential areas is an entirely separate political battle just as controversial as raising taxes. What’s more concrete is the typical political wrangling for council seats—Socialist Alternative wants to assemble a team of leftist candidates to run with Sawant in 2019, while Spady is hoping to oust all the councilmembers up for reelection and install a fresh, more business-friendly regime. As for Amazon, the company is set to announce its HQ2 city (and likely a huge tax incentive package) later this year. On Monday, its stock hit an all-time high. Sawant, its most vocal local critic, is defeated for now, left only to seethe about “the ferocity of big business and the capitalist class.” Life inside the great glass bubble couldn’t be much better.","A socialist City Council member wants to uproot Jeff Bezos’s tech giant and shrink the wealth gap with radical politics.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption A young boy snacks on a handful of stir-fried termites in Johannesburg, South Africa Edible insects are often portrayed as something of a sustainable superfood - an environmentally friendly alternative to livestock. But who is already eating them and do they actually taste any good? Two men cloaked in tarpaulin and tied to one another by a thick rope are engulfed in a swarm of hornets. They've been looking forward to this moment all day. One lifts the lid from a large jar of clear liquor and deftly swats the attacking hornets into its opening, while the other takes a pickaxe and hacks at a near-vertical hillside to expose the many layers of their nest. This moment, after two hours of trapping, baiting and chasing hornets through steep cedar forests in central Japan, brings the men a rush of satisfaction. Returning home later that day, the men have hundreds of hornets swimming in liquor - and a 7kg (1st 1lb) nest. Image copyright Charlotte Payne Image caption Hornet harvesters pick larvae from nests Over bottles of beer, they pick the remaining hornets from the nest with tweezers, while their wives simmer the larvae - which taste like a gamey clotted cream when eaten raw, but like sweet mussels when cooked - with ginger, soy sauce, and mirin. They fry any semi-adult hornets until their carapaces are crispy coverings for the soft meat within. Neighbours drop by and toast their bounty with a glass of aged liquor made on a similar adventure, the hornet's venom having turned the ordinary white alcohol into a dark, smoky brew. As they enjoy the feast, they joke about how none of them will sleep much that night - hornets are considered a powerful aphrodisiac. The world is filled with scenes such as these, of families and friends collecting and cooking edible insects, not out of desperation but because they are there and they taste good. Image copyright Charlotte Payne Image caption Hornets emerge from a nest Take the famed tequila worm: more than a tourist gimmick, the range of species lurking in the golden bottles are a cherished food in parts of Mexico. But if you want to find one, you must uproot and overturn a large, spike-riddled agave plant. Different agave species contain different worms. The red worms are especially prized: even raw they have a distinct smoky taste reminiscent of a very good mezcal. They are in such demand that harvesting is strictly regulated, though visit a provincial Oaxacan market out of the official season and you may be approached with an offer of some illicit wriggling red worms. The vast majority of edible insects, however, are easy to harvest, with many of them quite literally falling from the sky. Take termites, which are eaten across sub-Saharan Africa. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A street vendor extends a plate of fried termites, in Laos After the first rains, a flurry of the winged creatures rises like smoke from their mounds. The next day, they cover the ground in their thousands. Children are particularly keen collectors, since the process involves scrabbling around on all fours in the dirt before pulling the wings off each termite in turn They are then boiled and sauteed with a little salt. They are mostly eaten mostly in rural areas, but can occasionally be found in urban markets, where they sell out quickly - and no wonder, for they taste like tiny pieces of crispy bacon. Entomophagy is the name for eating insects Most insects are 100% edible, compared with about 40% of a cow Mealworms produce 10-100 times less greenhouse gas per kilogram than pigs Many insects are high in calcium, zinc, iron and protein Beetles make up 40% of all recorded edible insect species Image copyright Charlotte Payne Image caption A baby looks into a bucket of caterpillars in Burkina Faso Other edible insects grow on trees, in vast quantities. Visit southern Burkina Faso in the rainy season, and you'll find the trees stripped of their leaves and the ground covered in shea caterpillars. Villagers wake as early as 02:00 to collect the juiciest specimens, which they cook into a stew for a hearty meal or fry as a snack. They've been described as tasting like meaty vegetables. Media caption Kahitouo Hien and Charlotte Payne have kick-started an initiative to commercialise caterpillar production Others grow inside trees, such as palm weevil larvae. These plump white grubs are popular in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where forest-dwellers take an axe to rotting palm trees to find the insects living inside. The larvae are wrapped in leaves and cooked in an open fire. They taste like small parcels of buttery pate. Many of the most widely eaten insects worldwide are grasshoppers, crickets and locusts. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man holds lunch in the tips of his fingers Why? Because we grow the plants that provide their preferred food in large concentrations. In Asia, farmers trail nets through fields of rice to catch grasshoppers. In Mexico, they sweep through fields of maize and alfalfa with large buckets for the very popular chapulines - the colloquial name for a pleasingly lemony species of grasshopper. Locusts are mentioned in the Old Testament because they were and still are a common edible crop pest in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East. Lighter than meat and heavier than seafood, they're delicious. Each one of these plant-loving insects absorbs the taste of your chosen seasoning and adds a satisfyingly crunchy texture. Like other crops, most edible insects are highly seasonal, with many celebrations of the coming harvest held around the world - including wasp festivals in Japan and caterpillar festivals in Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of Congo. So, while there's been a lot of recent interest in farming insects for food, we've been doing it non-intensively for millennia. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vendors in Cambodia sort crickets at the market The movement towards bringing edible insects to more dinner tables worldwide has been driven by the belief that eating insects could help boost nutrition and reduce pollution. There has been interest in the possibility that bugs - already eaten by two billion people - may have a lighter environmental footprint than livestock. Enthusiastic ""ento-preneurs"" - or bug businesses - are looking for new ways to appeal to the discerning consumer, with powdered insects now appearing in bread, pasta, and protein shakes. It could be that such powder-pushing is what introduces more consumers to the pleasures of bug eating. However, there remains a lot to be said for the joy and adventure that unapologetically insect-shaped delicacies can bring to the table.

David Slotnick,"The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. What are you saving for? 
 When you open a new investment account, this is typically the first question you'll be asked. Your answer determines how your account is set up, and what kind of funds your money will go into — in particular, it guides how your savings will be proportioned between high-earning but higher-risk funds, and to slower-earning but safer ones. 
 Typical reasons for saving include things like general investment, retirement, to buy a house, or to build an emergency fund. Wealthfront, a popular robo-advisor service that we've reviewed before, figured out that there's another big reason that people might want to save for, or plan their long-term savings around — to take an extended leave and travel the world. 
 Robo-advisors use algorithmic tools to help provide financial advice or portfolio management for you. This helps keep costs down compared to working with a traditional financial advisor, which is potentially a better option for some people. It also means that just about anyone can use the tools, even with smaller amounts or looking for more casual investing. 
 This summer, Wealthfront launched a new program called Time Off for Travel. Like the name suggests, the financial-planning service is designed to help people realize their goal of taking an extended leave from work to travel. 
 ""The millennial generation is completely blowing up our parents' definition of 'The American Dream,'"" said Dan Carroll, Wealthfront co-founder, in a press release. ""Life is no longer linear and work is no longer 9-to-5. We prefer collecting experiences to collecting assets and retirement is no longer the ultimate goal."" 
 The decision to quit your job and uproot your life to travel is not a light one. If it's a serious goal of yours, there are a few things to square away, all of which Wealthfront takes into account. 
 The key is figuring out how you can make it happen without hurting your future self. You wouldn't want to stop saving for retirement while you travel, for example. When you have a current and funded Wealthfront account, you can connect your accounts at other institutions. The Time Off for Travel tool then looks at your entire financial position and analyzes everything, figures out whether it's practical to take the time off, shows you how long you could afford to take off, and provides an idea of what effects your leave will have on your long-term financial health. 
 Once everything is set, the tool calculates the affordability of your goals. If the trip you had in mind is unrealistic, you can use the tool to figure out something that's more feasible, or figure out what you can change to make the trip work. You can also adjust your savings rate and contributions once you have your long- and short-term goals defined. 
 With retirement coming later in life — if at all — there are good reasons to take a sabbatical earlier in life to travel and relax, something that's typically associated more with retirees.

Clancy Morgan and Benji Jones,"What if you could use your nose to snorkel, or uproot a small tree, or smell water from several miles away? Well, elephants wouldn't be that impressed. They do it on the daily, thanks to what's inside their trunk. 
 If you were to dissect an elephant trunk, it would actually look more like the inside of your tongue than your nose. Trunks, tongues, and even octopus arms are unique organs called muscular hydrostats. That means they're made almost entirely of muscle, and an elephant's trunk has a lot of them, about 40,000, compared to around 650 muscles in the entire human body. Normally, muscles depend on bones and joints to move and exert force. 
 When we pick up a dumbbell, for example, our bicep pulls on our forearm bones and that causes them to swing up around our elbow joint. But in an elephant trunk, there are no bones to pull and no joints to hinge on. The muscles take on that role instead. This makes trunks incredibly flexible so they can move in all directions. And all those muscles mean they're powerful enough to lift hundreds of pounds, yet delicate enough to pick up a tortilla chip without even cracking it. 
 But while trunks may be structured like a tongue and function like an arm, they are, in fact, a nose, and an exceptional one. An animal's sense of smell is linked to the number of olfactory receptor genes it has. And elephants, well, they have a lot of them, nearly 2,000 — more than any other animal we know of. Bloodhounds, for example, only have about 800 while humans have even fewer. In fact, an elephant's nose is so good it can actually sniff out bombs. People have reported that African elephants avoid land mines in Angola and in 2015, researchers put it to the test. Elephants were presented with a lineup of buckets filled with different smells, including TNT, the main ingredient in land mines. Out of 97 TNT samples, elephants detected all but one. 
 Of course, their trunks didn't evolve as bomb detectors. They use their nose like we use our eyes, to find food and water, to avoid predators, and to map out other elephants nearby. That's like walking into a family reunion with your eyes closed and knowing exactly where everyone is. But if you can believe it, there are even more tricks up their, trunks. When elephants traverse deep rivers, for example, they curve their trunk into a snorkel, and when bathing, they can use it as a hose, or more like a fire hose. With one suck, a trunk can pull in as much as 10 liters of water. 
 And the trunk's impressive abilities haven't gone unnoticed. In fact, if you stick a mirror in front of an elephant, one of their favorite activities is to open their mouth and check out their trunks. Let's admit it, if you had a nose like that, you would do the exact same thing.","Elephant trunks are some of the most impressive noses in the animal kingdom.

Mike Householder and Tom Krisher,"ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- Less than a week after a series of critical tweets from the president over an Ohio plant closure, General Motors is announcing plans to add 400 jobs and build a new electric vehicle at a factory north of Detroit.
The company says it will spend $300 million at its plant in Orion Township, Michigan, to manufacture a Chevrolet vehicle based on the battery-powered Bolt.
GM wouldn't say when the new workers will start or when the new vehicle will go on sale, nor would it say if the workers will be new hires or come from a pool of laid-off workers from the planned closings of four U.S. factories by January.
The company also announced plans Friday to spend about another $1.4 billion at U.S. factories with 300 more jobs but did not release a time frame or details.
The moves come after last weekend's string of venomous tweets by President Donald Trump condemning GM for shutting its small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. During the weekend, Trump demanded that GM reopen the plant or sell it, criticized the local union leader and expressed frustration with CEO Mary Barra.
GM spokesman Dan Flores would not answer questions about Trump but said the investment has been in the works for weeks. Indeed, GM has said it planned to build more vehicles off the underpinnings of the Bolt, which can go an estimated 238 miles on a single electric charge. The company has promised to introduce 20 new all-electric vehicles globally by 2023.
In November, GM announced plans to shut the four U.S. factories and one in Canada. About 3,300 workers in the U.S. would lose their jobs, as well as 2,600 in Canada. Another 8,000 white-collar workers were targeted for layoff. The company said the moves are necessary to stay financially healthy as GM faces large capital expenditures to shift to electric and autonomous vehicles.
Plants slated for closure include Lordstown; Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan; Warren, Michigan; White Marsh, Maryland, near Baltimore and Oshawa, Ontario near Toronto. The factories largely make cars or components for them, and cars aren't selling well these days with a dramatic consumer shift to trucks and SUVs. With the closures, GM is cancelling multiple car models due to slumping sales, including the Chevrolet Volt plug-in gas-electric hybrid.
GM has said it can place about 2,700 of the laid-off U.S. workers at other factories, but it's unclear how many will uproot and take those positions. More than 1,100 have already transferred, and others are retiring.
The United Auto Workers has sued GM over the closings, which still must be negotiated with the union.
Trump's latest GM tweet on Monday said GM should: ""Close a plant in China or Mexico, where you invested so heavily pre-Trump,"" and ""Bring jobs home!""
Ohio and the area around the Lordstown plant are important to Trump's 2020 re-election bid. The state helped push him to victory in 2016, and Trump has focused on Lordstown, seldom mentioning the other U.S. factories that GM is slated to close.
Barra has said that she sees no further layoffs or plant closures through the end of 2020.","GM announces jobs, electric vehicle after Trump criticism CTV News Less than a week after a series of critical tweets from the president over an Ohio plant closure, General Motors is announcing plans to add 400 jobs and build a...

Adam Rosenberg,"When all is said and done, The Division 2's story can be summed up in simple terms: This is Bad Dudes, but with a script.
I'm talking about the old arcade game that famously opened with the lines: ""President Ronnie has been kidnapped by ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the President?"" From there, you get to punch and kick your way through seven stages of ninja baddies before chomping on some burgers with the president.
SEE ALSO: 'Devil May Cry 5' review: This game f*cks
When you look at the bigger picture of The Division 2, the premise is nearly as ridiculous and far-fetched. Washington, D.C. is lawless and locked down after a deadly viral outbreak, and it's up to you an agent a secret federal task force charged with, well, fixing America to restore order and rebuild that symbol of U.S. freedom, the White House. 
Yes, that includes rescuing the president.
There's just a small problem with that premise. In the U.S. of 2019, when Donald Trump is historically unpopular (and is perhaps best described as the country's first bona fide despot), it's hard for a lot of people to get fired up by The Division 2's efforts to make America great again. The White House isn't much of a symbol for American freedom when it's occupied by a tyrant.
Here's why Ubisoft, The Division's publisher, thought that approach would work: The Division 2 isn't making any political statements. That's what Terry Spier, one of the game's creative leads, told Polygon in a June 2018 interview.
Im just going to say that you are a veteran agent who was activated before the time of The Division 2 and you got the SOS call. OK, youre war torn. Youre tired. Youve been doing Division stuff elsewhere and you arrive in DC to find what it is that youre going to find. And youre going to rebuild and make sure that DC does not collapse, SHaDe [Strategic Homeland Division] does not collapse and that the nation does not collapse. And so should it be clear, were definitely not making any political statements. Right? This is still a work of fiction, right?
The audacity of making a statement like that in 2018, and about a game set in the crumbling ruins of Washington, D.C., was obviously not lost on an ever-watchful internet. Ubisoft faced sharp criticism almost immediately after Polygon's story published, and the whole ""it's not political!"" thing has become a running joke.
That was all before the game came out. Now that I've played through the whole thing and loved it unabashedly, I should say I feel like I understand where Spier was coming from when he said that. The story The Division 2 has to tell isn't a statement in and of itself. That's because it's so absurdly over the top and open to interpretation.
This is a game where you spray bullets across the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as you take it back from militarized fascists. Where your efforts to rescue the president turn sideways when that president turns the gun on his captor and proceeds to back you up in combat. Where, after the rescue, you join the president in the Oval Office and this happens.
The Division 2's story is so addled and all over the place, it couldn't form a coherent political statement if it tried. That's not why it was written and not what it exists to do. It's the modern-day version of that Bad Dudes vibe: ""Washington, D.C. is wrecked! Are you a bad enough dude to kill all the gang leaders and rebuild the White House?""
The Division 2's story is so addled and all over the place, it couldn't form a coherent political statement if it tried. 
That doesn't mean it's completely free of politics, however.
The game is still very much a product of the current socio-political climate it was born into. Its inherent over-the-top-ness is tempered by a grim and frequently off-putting outlook on the depths humanity can plunge to when seismic shifts uproot our civilized society. Bad Dudes works because it's light-hearted and stupid; The Division 2 often goes off the rails because it's grim and stupid.
You can see it in the desperation coded into the art design of the game's lawless Washington. Some American citizens, bereft of hope, have organized into brutal gangs that splash their beliefs all over the walls with graffiti and crude signs. Unlockable ""found footage"" clips dig deeper into the story's human misery, showing graphic scenes of unconscionable violence and murder.
In one clip, we see a suicide bomber saying goodbye to his friend before we watch him run off and commit his final act. In another, an emotionless gang leader listens to a government researcher plead for his life he helped plan the Washington quarantine under orders, which makes him the enemy of this gang before cutting him off with the blunt end of a hammer. 
Even The Division 2's opening cinematic goes in on the social politics of the moment. It talks about how we as a society took our luxuries and our comforts for granted. When all of that started to disappear, we survived. But when basic infrastructure went with it, there was only one question that mattered anymore: Did you own a gun?
The story is clumsy at times, with big moments that feel borderline (if not fully!) incoherent. Most of the dialogue washes over you as NPCs chatter in your ear while a blockbuster gunfight unfolds. An entire settlement of peaceful survivors gets wiped out at one point, but the moment is so drowned out by action and background noise that I didn't even realize what had happened and thought the game was broken! when I wandered into the dead community after that mission ended.
There isn't a political statement in The Division 2 because the game itself doesn't have anything specific to say. The story is just a vehicle, a set of circumstances that create reasons for you chase loot, earn XP, and do the Destiny-style RPG thing in more of a real-world setting. That was the purpose of the original game and this sequel isn't any different.
But none of that means it's completely devoid of political touchstones. As has been pointed out countless time before, all art is inherently political and The Division 2 isn't any kind of outlier. Between the ""war-torn D.C."" setting and the overall vision of what a total collapse of U.S. society might look like, the story and setting are brimming with threads to tug on and analyze.
But! Don't forget. Most artists will back away if you ask them to interpret their own work. I think that's what is going on here. The politics of the moment are inescapable in The Division 2, but when Ubisoft says ""it's not a statement,"" that's really just code for ""we don't want to go there ourselves.""","When all is said and done, The Division 2 's story can be summed up in simple terms: This is Bad Dudes, but with a script.

This is exactly what Tami and Gleb, a young couple from Moscow, Russia, did just four years ago when they decided to uproot themselves to the sunny city of Barcelona. What brought them to the Catalan capital? It was right after a vacation trip that they both fell in love with the climate, the people, and the close proximity to the mountains and the Mediterranean sea. They didn't waste much time getting started on their search for what would soon become their new home sweet home. ""We looked at about 10 flats before we found this one, which is in a family friendly neighborhood called Sarria,"" says Tami. ""The flat looked very ugly, with '60s style décor, but it had lots of natural light and very good potential for changing everything according to our tastes. We also loved the white Catalan ceiling."" In just five months and with the help of their good friend and interior designer Abel Perez, they created a space they are now proud of. The apartment consists of two bedrooms, two bathrooms, one office/study, and an open concept living room, dining room, and kitchen. ""The biggest challenge was creating different spaces within the limited square footage and making it still feel light and open,"" says Tami, ""but Abel came up with some creative solutions that we would have never thought of ourselves and are very happy with."" Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Nordic but with warm accents. Inspiration: We were totally inspired by the ideas of our interior designer Abel Perez. Favorite Element: The white Catalan ceiling in the living room. Biggest Challenge: Creating different spaces in the flat, which is not big, without obstructing the natural light. Abel came up with a great solution for the office by putting in translucent glass walls instead of regular walls, which would have obstructed additional light flow from the master bedroom. What Friends Say: ""I would love to spend several days in your flat."" Biggest Embarrassment: The sound isolation in the guest bathroom, which is right near the dining room table. But now it's fixed! Biggest Indulgence: Our white piano. I just wish I had more free time to play it! Says Tami.

The Austin City Council is scheduled to decide Wednesday, Aug. 15, 2018 whether to move ahead with a stadium plan that could prompt Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew to leave its home city after 22 years. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Another day, another scheduled vote on the future of pro soccer in Texas and Ohio. The Austin City Council is scheduled to decide Wednesday whether to move ahead with a stadium plan that could prompt Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew to leave its home city after 22 years. Austin delayed the vote a week, but is expected to make a decision whether to enter formal and final negotiations with Crew owner Anthony Precourt. Precourt bought the Crew in 2013 and has been pushing for a move to Austin since 2017. If successful, the move would uproot a bedrock MLS franchise and give the league its third Texas team. The Houston Dynamo and FC Dallas are the others. The Austin metropolitan area has just over 2 million people and remains the largest city in the country without a major sports franchise The vote is expected to be close among the 11 council members. The stadium plan is strongly supported by Austin Mayor Steven Adler, but some council members have resisted giving Precourt 24 acres to build a privately funded, 20,000-seat stadium. Critics call it a giveaway by Texas' capital city and argue Austin could better use the space for parkland or affordable housing. Precourt initially wanted downtown space for a picturesque venue on the river. Austin refused to make such a deal and instead has considered a tract of land near new retail and condominium developments north of downtown. Some Columbus fans are fighting to keep their team at home. The fan group Save the Crew has gathered thousands of future ticket pledges and produced its own design for a potential new stadium in downtown Columbus, while hoping new investors will offer to buy the Crew. Precourt also faces a lawsuit from the state and city seeking to block the move. It cites an Ohio law that owners of teams that use tax-supported facilities and accept state financial assistance must give at least six months' notice and allow local investors the chance to buy the team. The law was enacted after the NFL's Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in 1996. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rachel Becker,"After attempting to bury a climate change report during a long holiday weekend, the White House has pivoted to calling it “not based in facts.” Unfortunately for the White House, the report is filled with years’ worth of facts gathered by scientists, which paint a clear and alarming picture: climate change is already affecting Americans, and it’s going to get worse. The report came after the Camp Fire, the worst wildfire in California’s history, which was preceded by what was previously the worst wildfire in California’s history. The Camp Fire killed at least 85 people and displaced roughly 50,000, the Los Angeles Times reports. The fires forced evacuees out of their homes, away from their jobs, and into hotels, shelters, and tents in a Walmart parking lot. Now, rains are threatening to pour onto the scorched ground which could easily turn into mudslides like the ones that killed at least 15 people in Santa Barbara last year. “You harm the health, the welfare, the economy, and the future of hundreds of millions of people.” Worsening wildfires, more intense droughts, downpours, and floods are all described in the latest National Climate Assessment. The congressionally mandated report is the work of 13 federal agencies and more than 300 scientists, and it spells out how climate change is hurting people already. President Donald Trump’s reaction to the findings? “One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we’re not necessarily such believers,” Trump told The Washington Post. It’s a reaction that climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech and an author on the National Climate Assessment, hears a lot. “I have people telling me every day almost that they don’t believe in climate change,” she tells The Verge. The White House’s response frames the heavily researched, meticulously referenced National Climate Assessment as something one could choose to disbelieve, rather than the experts’ best understanding of reality. “And of course the reality is you can certainly choose your own reaction to it. But your perspective, your reaction, your belief or lack thereof does not affect its reality,” Hayhoe says. If you’re the president and you’re making decisions that aren’t based on reality, she says, “you harm the health, the welfare, the economy, and the future of hundreds of millions of people.” Just ask the newly minted Californian climate refugees. “She is breathing molecules of the people who died because the smoke has reached Washington.” Even as 50,000 people were displaced by wildfires that neatly matched climate scientists’ predictions from decades ago, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders doubled down on Trump’s disbelief during a press conference on Tuesday. Her false evaluation — that the National Climate Assessment is “not based on facts” and “not data driven” — is bad news for Americans who are already facing the effects of climate change. The timing of these claims is particularly appalling after the recent devastation in California. “She is breathing molecules of the people who died because the smoke has reached Washington,” says Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who reviewed the National Climate Assessment before it was published. In fact, data and facts inform the models that Sanders dismissed at the briefing as “the most extreme model scenario which contradicts long established trends.” That’s just not true, Hayhoe points out on Twitter. Sarah Saunders says, “this report is based on the most extreme model scenario, which contradicts long-established trends.” That’s two false statements because: 1, we considered many scenarios including vv low ones; and 2, the chapter I wrote concludes this, based on actual data: pic.twitter.com/X0vYG4Bzb1 — Katharine Hayhoe (@KHayhoe) November 27, 2018 The report assesses multiple paths to possible futures: paths where we burn a lot of fossil fuels or a little. That’s the point, Yohe says. “To show that the mitigation path that you choose matters,” he says. “But the high path isn’t an extreme, and the low path isn’t extreme either.” Don Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois, agrees that looking at a range of futures is a key element of the report. It gives us an idea of what we can prevent by reducing emissions, and what we’ll have to adapt to. “It tells you a lot about the advantages and disadvantages of following one pathway or another,” he says. So, for the White House, he says, “It’s very important that they represent the science properly in their discussions of it, rather than these simplistic statements that are not based on fact at all.” Sanders does say something that’s almost true, according to Robert Kopp, director of the Institute of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Rutgers University and an author on the first volume of the latest National Climate Assessment. “She’s correct in that modeling the climate is an extremely complicated science, and it’s not exact,” he says. But it’s the details that are complex, he says, not the big picture. “The fact that when you put greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, you’re going to warm the planet, that’s not complex,” he says. “It’s been known since the 19th century.” “It’s very important that they represent the science properly.” Those details are getting clearer, too, Hayhoe says. “We’re starting to be able to put numbers on the extent to which human-induced changes exacerbated natural disasters, like hurricanes and wildfires, instead of the standard mantra,” she says. (The standard mantra is some permutation of “We cannot attribute any single event to the effects of climate change.”) The report cites findings that Hurricane Harvey, for example, which dropped more than five feet of rain in Houston and killed at least 68 people, was three times more likely because of human-driven climate change. But the myth that climate science is up for debate isn’t the biggest or most dangerous falsehood that people buy into, Hayhoe says. “It’s the myth that it doesn’t matter to me.” That’s the myth that Sanders perpetuates when she separates climate change from impacts, as she did in Tuesday’s briefing. “Our focus is on making sure we have the safest, cleanest air and water, and the president is going to do exactly that,” Sanders said. (The Trump administration, in fact, has moved to scrap Obama-era clean water and air regulations. ) Fossil fuel emissions and climate change are already affecting our water and air. The report puts it bluntly : “Water security in the United States is increasingly in jeopardy.” There are large-scale impacts, like more severe droughts and bigger downpours. But there are also local impacts on water quality, like the growing scourge of harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, which thrive in warmer waters tainted by nutrient-rich runoff. Due to a harmful algal bloom in 2014, 500,000 people in Toledo, Ohio, were told to not drink from their taps, the report says. “This is a legacy that we’re leaving to them that we ought to be very concerned about.” As for the air we breathe, climate change is lengthening the fire seasons and making massive fires more frequent, the report says. And in addition to the people they kill, homes they destroy, and lives they uproot, wildfires in the West are also a major source of the microscopic droplets and tiny solid particles known as particulate matter. Particulate matter is bad for air quality and bad for health. “So ignoring climate change doesn’t really contribute to other aspects of clean air and clean water,” Kopp says. The point of the report is to help inform decision-makers about how to prevent emissions from worsening the climate changes of the future and how to prepare for what we can no longer avoid. That’s why more than 300 scientists devoted their time and effort to write it. And when representatives of the White House sow doubt about it, experts say they’re doing a disservice to the American people. “Just making up falsehoods about the National Climate Assessments has the potential to really deprive the states and communities that are least resourced of a trustworthy source of information,” Kopp says. That’s a problem for our present and our future. “I don’t know how anyone could look at this and not be concerned about what it means not only to themselves — perhaps they want to ignore that,” Wuebbles says, “but they shouldn’t be ignoring what it means for our children and our grandchildren. This is a legacy that we’re leaving to them that we ought to be very concerned about.”","After attempting to bury a climate change report during a long holiday weekend when most reporters weren’t working, the White House has pivoted to calling it “not based in facts.” Unfortunately for the White House, the report is filled with years’ worth of fa…",2018-11-28T14:37:42Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Experts aren’t buying the White House’s spin on an authoritative climate report,https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115771/climate-change-national-assessment-government-report-white-house-trump,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrKzlrRnVRaJy_r61-IDhWhiUHM=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13585610/1059759300.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,uproot,1

Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham got his championship ring. Now, it's time to get paid (again). A windfall is unlikely to happen in the City of Brotherly Love. 
The defender, who turns 31 years old in April, is finishing the last season of a four-year, $26 million deal he signed prior to the 2015 campaign. At Graham's age, this will likely be the last time he can maximize his worth by testing free agency. 
The Eagles really don't have an option to re-sign him, since they're already over the projected 2019 salary cap. 
Graham, meanwhile, remains a prolific pass-rusher despite his understated sacks totals. He often collapses the pocket and forces quarterbacks to move off their spots or into other defenders. He's a disruptive presence and a good run defender. 
Complete edge defenders are always in demand. Graham has been a staple on defense for nine seasons. He's given everything to the organization. It doesn't have anything to give back at this point, and his next move should be to the highest bidder.
""I'm on my way out in probably five years, so I think that it's just a different situation for me,"" he said in November, per NJ.com's Zack Rosenblatt.

Due,"This story originally appeared on Due What does it mean to be ""rich?” Does it mean an ability to afford basic needs like a home, clothing and food? Is it an arbitrary earning rate, like $100,000 per year or $1 million per year? Is richness measured by how much money you have in the bank? While there may not be a clear answer to what makes someone rich, many people do try to categorize us by earnings, assets and other measures. One common way to look at your wealth is to compare yourself to others. That often comes in the form of “ keeping up with the Joneses,” or feeling bad if you can’t. Some recent studies showed the average income in some of America’s biggest cities, and where the top and bottom incomes are found in the United States. Let’s dive in to see how you compare and the answer to the pressing question: are you rich? Top 50 percent income rates Depending on where you live, the mid-level income varies widely. The highest average income in the country is Silicon Valley, with a top 50 percent threshold of $110,000 per year. That’s right! You need to make six figures just to reach the median income in The Valley. Nearby San Francisco has the next highest average income at $96,700 per year, according to Census Bureau data. But if you can live anywhere on your income and want to feel rich, consider a move to America’s Southeast. In New Orleans, you only need to make $48,800 per year to join the top half of incomes. Nearby Memphis is another city where you can be in the top 50 percent below $50,000 year, with a $49,800 income putting you square in the middle. Those are the extremes of metro areas in the United States for 2016. The infographic compiled by how much shows that the vast majority of cities require an income in the $60,000 to $80,000 range to reach the top half of incomes. This income breakdown also helps to show why some cities are more attractive than others. Why would someone move to Washington D.C. where you have to earn over $95,000 per year to join the top half when you could move to Atlanta, not far away and a lot more affordable? In Atlanta, $62,600 per year puts you in the upper 50 percent of incomes. Compare your total income to the chart above to see if you land in the top half of income earners in your city, or if you need to hustle to earn a little more to join the top half. Can moving make you rich? Here’s an interesting question to ask yourself. If you are not self-employed, could you move to a new city in search of wealth? If you make the average income in a low paying city, would moving to a higher average income city lead to a raise? The answer is maybe. In my own experience, I was able to move to a new city and get a 40 percent raise in the process. Much of that, however, was due to a new MBA, working with a high-quality recruiter, and changing from a low paying industry to a highly profitable one. But in some cases, if you have the right skills you can absolutely do the same. Just keep in mind that you may be able to get a raise in your current hometown before you uproot and move to a high-income city that may also cost a lot more in comparison to where you live today. Are you rich already? Nearly a decade ago, I had a lively debate with another personal finance blogger about what makes someone rich, or at least upper class. He argued that a $100,000 income in San Francisco does not mean it is easy to get by. That may be true, but it could just be a matter of how you are trying to get by. Perhaps you have let lifestyle inflation take you into a more expensive living situation than you can really afford, but that does not make you poor. Maybe you are rich. Compare your standard of living to that in other parts of your city, other parts of the country, and other parts of the world. If you have a high income and still struggle with the bills, stop looking at your neighbors and start looking at your budget. If you manage your money right, you may be able to live a rich lifestyle on what you make today. If you can find happiness living within your means, you are on the right track for a lifetime of happiness and success.

Mikkel Svane,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. In 2009, when my co-founders and I moved our company to San Francisco from Copenhagen, Denmark, it was challenging to uproot our lives and leave home. But despite uncertainty, we were happy to find we quickly felt at home in San Francisco's innovative and forward-thinking culture. Related: 10 Tech Companies That Are Making the World a Better Place Part of what makes San Francisco and Silicon Valley an innovation hub and a technology powerhouse is the array of inspired people from all walks of life. It has been an incredible home for our company, and we have been successful beyond what we could have imagined because of this. For the last several years, it's become a tradition that my three daughters and I attend the annual San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus holiday concert at the Castro Theatre. We love these concerts; they're festive, fun and absolutely fabulous. They also give unique insight into the history of San Francisco. The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus recently did something pretty remarkable in response to the current political climate and perceived deepening divides in our country: They decided to go on a tour of the South. They performed in cities like Jackson, Miss., and Birmingham, Ala., to promote acceptance and love through song and music, allowing typically marginalized people to share their stories. I joined them and learned a thing or two along the way. Related: Corporate Social Responsibility Can Actually Be a Competitive Advantage, So Where's Your CSR Program? The example starts with you. When I heard of this Lavender Pen Tour, named after the pen that Harvey Milk gave to George Moscone when he signed a landmark gay civil rights bill into action 40 years ago, I wanted to get my company involved and get myself involved -- beyond writing a check. Beyond cash, finding unique and impactful ways to give back to the communities that you care about makes a more meaningful impact. That's Zendesk's philosophy. In every city we land, my employees and I commit to being good neighbors and embracing the community with empathy and compassion. We commit to connection. We commit to becoming a part of the fabric of the places we are a part of. Paying lip service to diversity and inclusion initiatives perpetuates a cycle of discrimination. To develop a truly inclusive and compassionate company culture, change has to happen from the top down, with the C-suite leading the charge. When executive leaders champion initiatives like these, being more thoughtful about inclusion morphs from a nice-to-have passion project into a strategic priority that the entire company feels tied to. Just showing up and lending visibility to a cause you believe in may not feel like much, but it sets a precedent for my employees and reaffirms the company values that may have attracted them to work here in the first place. Related: Giving Back Is How Your Startup Changes the World Let your values guide you. The Lavender Pen Tour was such a beautiful mission to support. And it's a mission that reflects my own journey with Zendesk and what we try to do with our products. Creating understanding between people. Building better relationships. Promoting empathy and understanding between businesses and their customers. Practicing that empathy muscle is important in all aspects of life. Especially in our industry, where it gets increasingly hard to empathize with your customers, as they're mostly just a number in your app or a user behind the screen. I've learned it's important to clearly define your values and let them be at the heart of everything you do. It's what has allowed me to be successful, and I believe it's why the brave men in the chorus, who basically fund the tour out of their own pocket and stand up for themselves in some of the least inclusive neighborhoods in the country, have seen such an outpouring of support. As the CEO and a founder of a company with more than 2,000 employees, it's important for me to show what I believe in and what kind of company I know we must build. Related: 4 Ways to Engage Your Customers in Social Good -- And Why It Matters Be open to what you can learn outside your bubble. Living in Silicon Valley as a white heterosexual man, it can be easy to diminish how much intolerance and hate exists outside my bubble. It's hard to acknowledge that the Bay Area is far from free of hateful discord. I can name many times when my employees have had terrible experiences with discrimination right here in progressive San Francisco, and it breaks my heart. But hearing their stories helps me realize how much power there is in my discomfort -- and in experiencing the world through an unfamiliar lens. So I, my three girls and some of our employees who are instrumental in our diversity and inclusion initiatives joined the Chorus on this tour. We did not sing. We joined in solidarity as allies and as spectators to the show. And it was a pretty humbling experience joining the Chorus in a walk across the Selma bridge where, 52 years earlier, hundreds of people marched for civil rights in the U.S. During my short time on the road with the Chorus, I got an intensive, real-world crash course in acceptance, empathy, pride and bravery. Showing up for people who stand up for such fine values has been incredibly rewarding, and a good reminder that I need to continue to show up. For my employees, for my customers, for my daughters.

PTI,"Several houses suffered damage, coconut trees got uprooted and communication lines were disrupted as rains accompanied by strong winds lashed the Lakshadweep islands under the influence of Cyclone Ockhi. Five fishing boats were damaged early on Saturday morning at Kalpeni island as water level rose due to heavy rains, sources said. The ‘very severe’ cyclonic storm Ockhi — which in Bengali means ‘eye’ — over Lakshadweep is likely to intensify further in the next 24 hours. It is likely to continue to move west-northwestwards across Lakshadweep islands during the next 24 hours and then recurve north eastwards during the subsequent 48 hours, according to the latest Met department bulletin. Minicoy island received 14cm of rains in the last 24 hours ending at 0830 this morning, Met department sources said. Coconut trees have been uprooted in various places and houses damaged in eastern Kalpeni and Minicoy, official sources said, adding the extent of the damage was being assessed. The breakwater jetty, the embarkation and disembarkation point to Kalpeni island have also suffered severe damage. Efforts were on to rescue fishermen who had ventured into the sea in 12 fishing boats from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Gale winds with speed reaching 120-130kmph gusting to 145kmph is very likely over Lakshadweep in the next 24 hours and gradually decrease thereafter, the met bulletin said. Giant waves were expected along the Kerala coast, official sources said. Yesterday, 218 fishermen, stranded in mid-sea off the coast, were brought safely to the shore through active coordination of various agencies including the Navy, the Air Force and the Coast Guard. The rescued fishermen included 60 who were saved by a Japanese cargo vessel.","Minicoy island received 14cm of rains in the last 24 hours ending at 0830 this morning, Met department sources said.",2017-12-02T07:40:59Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}","Cyclone Ockhi: rains hit Lakshadweep islands, damage houses, uproot trees",http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cyclone-ockhi-rains-hit-lakshadweep-islands-damage-houses-uproot-trees/article21247841.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/article21247839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ockhi,the-hindu,The Hindu,uproot,1
Rachel Feintzeig,"Fewer Americans are moving around the country to pursue new work opportunities, as a tighter labor market and changing family ties make people less willing to uproot their lives for a job. About 3.5 million Americans relocated for a new job last year, according to census data, a 10% drop from 3.8 million in 2015. The numbers have fluctuated between 2.8 million and 4.5 million since the government started tracking job-related relocations in 1999—but have been trending lower overall, even as the U.S. population grew by nearly 20% over that stretch. The share of job seekers relocating for new employment has fallen dramatically since the late 1980s, when more than a third moved to take new opportunities elsewhere, according to surveys from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc. In the 1990s, job-related moves ebbed and flowed between 20% and 35%, then fell below 20% after 2000. Roughly 10% of job seekers relocated for new opportunities in the first half of this year, Challenger said. Economists and demographers point to a number of factors that can keep people in one place, including a rise in licensing requirements for occupations like barber and florist that makes it tougher to transfer skills from one state to another. The current tight labor market has also meant that many people who don’t want to move can find work in their local area. Heather Murray recently got a call from a former colleague who tried to tempt her to his tech company. The senior vice president role he had in mind came with more pay and more responsibility—the next logical next step in her career. But it also came with a deal breaker: She would have to move to a city in the Mid-Atlantic region. Ms. Murray opted to keep her vice president position at technology distributor Tech Data Corp. in Clearwater, Fla. “Kids need their parents,” said Ms. Murray, who shares custody of her two children with her nearby ex-husband. People with children are less likely to move after a divorce than they were in prior decades, as more parents opt for shared-custody arrangements that include time living with their children, according to Thomas Cooke, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut who studies Americans’ mobility patterns. “Any way you measure it, families are more complex than they used to be,” he said. Mr. Cooke said adults were increasingly making decisions that revolve around not disrupting their children’s routines. Both men and women are spending more time on child care, with a majority of fathers saying that parenting is extremely important to their identity, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew data also show women are contributing more to their family’s incomes, making it difficult to replicate a family’s standard of living if only one spouse has a new job waiting. And as the country grows older, the number of adults caring for aging parents has grown. Such trends are chipping away at the once-common pattern of families following careers—typically the husband’s—and changing how workers think about distant job opportunities. Aimee Cohen, a career coach based in Denver, said relocation packages have gotten skimpier and even executives wonder how long a gig will last. “You’re not made any promises,” Ms. Cohen said, adding that many workers’ mentality is, “Am I going to uproot my family? For what? And for how long?” Doug Ringer and his wife have made seven moves during their 22 years of marriage, all of them driven by his job changes. The most recent was in 2014, when the Ringers moved with their two children from Louisville, Ky. to Fort Collins, Colo., so he could take a product-management job with Schneider Electric SE. Mr. Ringer explained the new opportunity to his daughter and son, then 17 and 15. “We asked for their opinions.” The children wanted to see Fort Collins, so Mr. Ringer arranged for Schneider to fly the family to Colorado for a few days. Though his children agreed to the move, he now feels it was too tough on his daughter, who had to start a new high school in the middle of her junior year. When Mr. Ringer lost his job in a round of layoffs in January, looking for a new job far afield was off the table, he said. His son was still in high school, and his daughter is enrolled in college nearby. His wife is happy at her job at Colorado State University, where she is a veterinary technician. For now, Mr. Ringer is consulting with small and midsize businesses while continuing to look for work locally. John Touey, a principal with executive search firm Salveson Stetson Group Inc., said he used to assume moving wasn’t a problem unless a job candidate specifically mentioned that it was. “Now we go into the situation thinking it probably is an issue, so we need to bring it up,” he said. Dan Gallagher, 46, has been job hunting since the end of 2017, after he left his senior vice president role at Comcast Corp. in the Philadelphia area following 17 years with the company. His four young sons’ lives are a top consideration as he sizes up potential positions. In previous generations, “you had this binding loyalty to the organization and if a promotion meant you had to move, you’d do that,” Mr. Gallagher said. “Today, there’s so many moving pieces.” Write to Rachel Feintzeig at rachel.feintzeig@wsj.com and Lauren Weber at lauren.weber@wsj.com","Fewer Americans are moving around the country to pursue new work opportunities, as a tighter labor market and changing family ties make people less willing to uproot their lives for a job.",2018-08-19T15:29:53Z,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",Fewer Americans Uproot Themselves for New Jobs,https://www.wsj.com/articles/fewer-americans-uproot-themselves-for-new-jobs-1534690800,https://images.wsj.net/im-22666/social,the-wall-street-journal,The Wall Street Journal,uproot,1
Hilary Brueck,"Depression is one of the most treatable mental disorders, experts say. Shutterstock Mental health experts are worried: Depression is on the rise in the US, especially in teenagers. From 2005 to 2015, depression rates in kids between the ages of 12 to 17 spiked, and the suicide rate for teenage girls is now the highest it's been in four decades. Experts aren't sure what's causing the disturbing trend, but they're concerned about the mental health of the country. In New York City, coaches are working to recruit and train a kind of civilian mental-health army of 250,000 volunteers. The hope is that people trained in ""mental health first aid"" will be better able to start conversations, lend a helping hand, and share compassion for friends, colleagues, neighbors, and other fellow New Yorkers who are dealing with mental health issues. New York residents who volunteer get a free, day-long training — I recently participated in one. My fellow volunteers and I were taught some simple ways to spot the difference between someone experiencing a bad mood or a few bad days and a person with more serious, long-term depression. The coaches suggested a four-word approach to checking in on friends and loved ones. If you're worried that you or someone you care about may be suffering from depression, but you're not quite sure how serious it is, ask yourself how the person is doing when it comes to four key happiness measurements. Is you/your loved one's mental state having an impact on the person's ability to: Live Laugh Learn and Love? If these four pillars of life are feeling compromised by a persistent cloud of sorrow or indifference, it may be a sign that depression is at hand. It's pretty likely that you know someone dealing with depression. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 5.9% of the US population is dealing with a diagnosable depressive disorder. That means more than 1 in every 20 Americans are suffering from depression at any given time. Depression is the single largest contributor to ""non-fatal health loss"" worldwide, according to the WHO. It affects around 4.4% of the globe, though those rates vary from place to place. Some of the highest depression rates in the world are among women in Africa, while some of the lowest are in men in the Western Pacific islands, the WHO says. When health care professionals in the US diagnose depression, they use a manual called the DSM-5, or ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders."" It lists several common signs of depression, and defines depression as a condition that lasts for more than two weeks and impacts a person's ability to go about their life, enjoying the activities that typically make them happy. Depression might change how a person thinks and feels about the world, and can uproot how they would otherwise go about an average day. In some cases, it can make it impossible for a person to get out of bed in the morning. And it can have an impact on other daily routines, like how a person sleeps, eats, and works. Only a trained mental health professional can officially diagnose depression, but when it comes to on-the-fly ""first aid"" for depression, these tell-tale signs can be a first warning that it might be good to ask for help or see a counselor. If you're worried about depression, here are some additional resources: In New York, you can contact health care professionals at this link. They're available by text message or online chat there as well. If you're having suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. There are also new apps coming online that aim to provide some of the benefits of therapy on the go. These include Woebot, a texting-based system, but they're untested and by no means a substitute for a mental health professional.

Ari Zoldan,"We may all try to say our prayers and take our vitamins, but at the end of the day, most of us may find ourselves caught in the clutches of some unhealthy habits. It can be as damaging as a smoking or drinking habit, or something seemingly innocuous such as a TV show binge tendency. Now we all know that these addictions are not good for us. There are literally millions of articles out there on the internet doing enough to spell out the vices of the issues. What will be more beneficial for our conversation here today is to find a way on how to stop the urges for these addictions, in order to uproot the very cause of the problem. Based on this, Tony Robbins has invented a way for us to train our brain to feel repulsed by these vices; yes, this mean that we can not only stop our desire for them but actually feel repulsed and disgusted by the very thought of it! The Pizza Trick In a demonstration of this mindset tool in one of his world famous seminars, Robbins invited an audience member on stage and asked him what his number one vice was. The audience member replied that he is a big-time pizza fan. When asked how would he rate his love for pizza from -ten to ten, he rated his love as a 12. Then Robbins brought up a pizza in front of him and asked him to imagine something bad about it to bring the level of his love for it to level eight. This made the audience member think of something bad, such as: the pizza was not hot enough, was missing a topping, etc. Robbins then asked him to make it come down to a three, which made him imagine the pizza having a topping he didn't like. Doubling down on it, Tony urged him to go even further as the rating kept coming down from three to zero to -three. He now started imagining the pizza as stale and sitting out for while. As the exercise kept going, the pizza became more and more an object of repulsion and despise in the mind of the member. By active use of the mind triggering the senses to feel something bad about the pizza, he kept adding more and more pieces of negativity towards it. Near the end, he started smelling the rottenness of the pizza, saying the cheese on the pizza was rancid and that he could not stand the sight out of it. Literally begging to not hold the pizza a minute longer, he called off the exercise. At the very end of the exercise, in a demonstration of its effect, Tony brought up the pizza in front of him and asked him to smell it. The very pizza he loved so much was now an object of disgust for him, and he refused to take a single bite. The Power of the Mind Thus, this exercise shows the power of the mind to tune and train our senses to respond the way we want. This power can be used to control any urges or bad addictions by triggering the senses to build a distaste for it. This is done by actively imagining pieces of disgusting things and picturing it on the addiction. This will trigger the senses to think more and more negatively of this addiction, ultimately feeling a lifelong disgust for the same. Here's some actionable advice for you: pick any of the addictions you are currently having, and perform this mindset exercise. Keep the addictive item in front of you, along with a paper on which you can rate your current level of addiction from -ten to + ten. Then actively imagine something bad about the addiction, voluntarily bringing the level more and more down. **Abhik Shome contributed to this article",Tony Robbins uses this powerful mental tool to rid any addiction or bad habit.,2017-11-16T20:41:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Get Rid of Your Bad Habits With This 1 Powerful Mental Tool,https://www.inc.com/ari-zoldan/get-rid-of-your-bad-habits-with-this-1-powerful-mental-tool.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_153784617_330630.jpg,,Inc.com,uproot,1
Mark Hanrahan,"Donald Trump Jr. has weighed into the political battle over the United Kingdom's looming departure from the European Union, writing that Prime Minister Theresa May ""should have followed my father's advice.""
In an op-ed piece published Wednesday in the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph newspaper, the president's eldest son warned that ""democracy in the U.K. is all but dead,"" and criticized ""elites"" whom he argued were trying to frustrate the will of British voters.
""In a way, you could say that Brexit and my father's election are one and the same -- the people of both the U.K. and the U.S. voted to uproot the establishment for the sake of individual freedom and independence, only to see the establishment try to silence their voices and overturn their mandates,"" Trump Jr. wrote.
Trump Jr. also rebuked May, saying her failure to heed his father's counsel resulted in ""a process that should have taken only a few short months [becoming] a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo.""
Donald Trump Jr. speaks at a campaign rally for U.S. Senate candidate Martha McSally, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, in Sun City, Ariz.
President Donald Trump has made comments supporting Brexit since before the 2016 referendum and has since criticized May's negotiating tactics.
""I'm surprised at how badly it's all gone from the standpoint of a negotiation,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on March 14. ""But I gave the prime minister my ideas on how to negotiate it. And I think you would've been successful. She didn't listen to that.""

ABC News,"Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) today released their forecast for this year's hurricane season, predicting five to nine hurricanes including at least one that could be a Category 3 or higher. Interested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. They also predict a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year. Overall, this hurricane season will be near normal or above normal levels. This satellite image obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows Hurricane Maria, Sept. 19, 2017. When is hurricane season? Hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30. Peak hurricane season is from mid-August through mid-October and the peak date for hurricane season on average is Sept. 10. Hurricanes, however, can occur year-round. A car gets towed while men walk in the flooded waters of Telephone Rd. in Houston, Texas on Aug. 30, 2017. What are the hurricane categories? Category 1: Winds from 74 to 95 mph, which can damage homes, trees and power lines. SLIDESHOW: Slideshow: Worst hurricanes in US history Category 2: Winds reaching 96 to 110 mph. These extremely dangerous winds can uproot big trees, cause serious damage to homes and lead to power outages that last several days to weeks. Category 3: With winds from 111 to 129 mph, Category 3 is considered a major hurricane. Devastating damage can occur, and electricity and water might unavailable for several weeks. Category 4: With winds from 130 to 156, Category 4 hurricanes bring catastrophic damage to homes, trees and power lines and can make areas unlivable. This photo shows damaged homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Sunshine Key, Fla., Sept. 13, 2017. Category 5: Five is the highest category for hurricanes with winds reaching 157 mph or higher. These hurricanes cause catastrophic damage by completely destroying buildings and houses and can make areas completely unlivable. What happened last year? The outlook for this year follows a brutal year of hurricanes for the United States -- 2017 was the worst hurricane season for the nation in at least xxxx years. Hurricanes Harvey pummeled Houston in August, followed by Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean and Florida in September, both of which left behind severe flooding that destroyed and damaged homes and businesses.

(Photo: Grace Beahm Alford, The Post And Courier, via AP) Already ferocious Hurricane Florence grew stronger Tuesday as it continued its unrelenting march toward the U.S. East Coast, a massive storm expected to claim elite Category 5 status as more than 1 million people flee the anticipated devastation. An ominous update from the National Hurricane Center reported that Florence was driving maximum sustained winds of almost 140 mph, a Category 4 storm out of a possible five on the Saffir-Simpson scale. ""Some strengthening is expected during the next day or so, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday night,"" the hurricane center's update said. A ""major"" hurricane is one with sustained winds of more than 110 mph, and any Category 3, 4 or 5 hurricane is classified as a major hurricane. The storm is forecast to blast ashore along the North Carolina or South Carolina coast late Thursday or early Friday. Florence is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20 inches in some areas and possibly with 30 inches in isolated locations along the storm's track over portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

The hurricane roared from a Category 1 (90 mph) to a Category 4 (130 mph) in just 13 hours, an extremely quick intensification, Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach said. That's the most rapid hurricane intensification since Hurricane Humberto in 2007, he said. In North Carolina, officials in coastal Dare County ordered everyone to leave Hatteras Island on Monday. Residents and visitors in popular tourist spots such as Duck and Corolla faced a Tuesday deadline.

PTI,"By: PTI | Patna | Published: October 21, 2018 9:47:23 pm Tejashwi Yadav in New Delhi. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Leaders of the Grand Alliance in Bihar chose the state’s first chief minister Sri Krishna Singh’s birth anniversary function in Patna on Sunday to band together against the NDA, where RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav slammed the BJP-JD(U) government by likening it to “Rakshas Raj” (reign of the devil). The Grand Alliance leaders from the Congress, the RJD and the HAM(S) vowed to uproot the NDA governments at the Centre and in the state. They came down heavily on the two governments, alleging that both the dispensations failed on all fronts, especially in taming price rise, corruption and crime. The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee organised the function at S K Memorial hall. RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav slammed JD(U) chief and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, likening the state government to “Rakshas Raj” (reign of the devil). “These people (NDA leaders) used to talk about ‘Jungle Raj’ (during the 15 years of Lalu-Rabri rule in Bihar). But there is ‘Rakshas Raj’ in Bihar today. State-sponsored crime is on the rise. This is the double-engine government of crime and corruption,” Yadav said. Taking a swipe at Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who had termed Lalu Prasad’s younger son as “rumour-monger”, Tejashwi asked what has Bihar got from the Modi government in its four and a half years. “When will the special category status be accorded to Bihar? BJP has cheated the people of the state as it has no concern for them,” Tejashwi said, adding sarcastically that the BJP has more concern for Lalu Prasad’s family. People should be wary of “back-stabbers”, he said without naming anyone. Former Bihar CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi demanded the Bharat Ratna for Sri Krishna Singh, the first chief minister of Bihar and powerful leader from the Bhumihar caste who occupied the post till his death in 1961. Manjhi also sought 15 per cent reservation for upper castes by amending the Constitution. The party’s national general secretary and Bihar in-charge Shakti Sinh Gohil said, “We will fight together to uproot the NDA government and install Congress government at the Centre… We will come out with a blueprint for Bihar’s overall development and will fulfil our commitment”. Former Union minister and Bihar Congress Campaign Committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh announced that the party would soon hold a mega rally at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna to “send out a message”. Singh, a Rajya Sabha member, said it would be a “Parivartan rally” (rally for change), the date for which would be announced soon. Singh, who has been organising birth anniversaries of Sri Krishna Singh for the past 15 years, said the Nitish Kumar government, which would complete 15 years of rule in Bihar, has ditched the upper castes as it did nothing for them, and even forgot to implement the recommendations of ‘Sawarn Aayog’ (commission for upper castes). The Nitish Kumar government just used upper castes as its “vote bank”, he said. Celebration of Shri Krishna Singh’s birth anniversary is seen as an attempt by the Congress to win back a section of the upper castes who have traditionally been its voters in the state but have gravitated towards the BJP recently. Bihar Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha, former governor Nikhil Kumar, former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad, senior party leaders Vijay Shankar Dubey and other senior leaders spoke at the function.

Suvojit Bagchi,"What was the strategy?
When Sheikh Hasina returned to power in 2008, the Bangladesh Prime Minister promised to uproot every anti-India terror module in Bangladesh and help reduce insurgency in Indias northeastern region. Top ranking intelligence officials agree that without the Hasina-led Awami League in Dhaka, it would have been impossible to check flare-ups in the east. She dismantled all known Pakistani assets in Bangladesh, an intelligence official said. A decade later, agencies in both sides are engaged in real-time intelligence sharing with more efficiency to combat terror, hugely benefiting India.
Will elections change things?
With the general election slated for December 30, India wants a fair exercise in the neighbouring country. It is more necessary, however, for Ms. Hasina to return to power, the official admitted, for the Awami League steadfastly remains Indias best friend in the subcontinent.
What did the Awami League do?
The return of the Awami League in 2008 dramatically changed the nature of India-Bangladesh engagement on every front. A plethora of connectivity projects, unthinkable earlier, are either in place or in advanced stages of negotiation. While trans-shipment of goods using river ports and roads is on, many bus and train routes have been operationalised. A bus service from Kolkata to the northeastern region through Bangladesh has started, thus shortening time and distance to the region. The land boundary issue in north Bengal has been sorted out alongside amicable settlement of a long-standing maritime boundary dispute and neither of the sides is too keen to hype their differences from Teesta water-sharing to illegal border trade. Power and energy sector cooperation is another of many bilateral achievements. The flow of tourists has increased to such an extent that Bangladesh has proposed to set up a diplomatic mission in Chennai.
How has India reciprocated?
India has contributed towards security cooperation from training to interception of exchanges between groups hostile to the regions stability, averting attacks on the countrys top establishments. Maintaining stability is Indias first contribution to Bangladesh. There are about a dozen agreements amounting to $10 billion of Indian private investment in Bangladesh. A $7.5 billion Line of Credit has been approved for infrastructure and other projects in Bangladesh.
What are the concerns?
But India is in a fix. Delhi is keen to see a fair election in Bangladesh, unlike last time, when the Awami League returned to power without a contest. India was relieved when Kamal Hossain, a former Awami Leaguer, with secular credentials formed a multi-party coalition, Jatiya Oikya Front, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) as the biggest constituent. An election process was set in place as Ms. Hasina met Mr. Hossain.
But closer to the election, the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (JeI-B), with its cadre depth in the countryside, catapulted to centre stage as a partner of the Jatiya Oikya Front. The JeI-B is not contesting the election as the party was de-registered in 2013 but it has fielded candidates who are contesting on the BNP symbol in 25 of the 300 seats. The JeI-Bs participation is a cause for worry for both the Awami League and India as it has put down roots in Pakistan, an allegation that the JeI-B has repeatedly denied. But the JeI-B candidates, who are contesting in constituencies bordering Bengal, are keeping the political and security establishments on tenterhooks in India. Indias ruling elite had tried to deal with the other main party, the BNP, when it last came to power in 2001 but burnt its fingers. 
What happens next?
Experts are watching this election to see how the India-Bangladesh relationship will unfold if a BNP-Jamaat coalition comes to power, a possibility the international press is ruling out. Will it jeopardise connectivity projects, unsettle Indias northeastern region or meddle with billions of dollars of investments made over the last years in Bangladesh? Answers will be public in a little over a week.","What was the strategy?When Sheikh Hasina returned to power in 2008, the Bangladesh Prime Minister promised to uproot every anti-India terror module in Bangladesh and help reduce insurgency in India’s",2018-12-22T15:05:16Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Why are Bangladesh elections important?,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-are-bangladesh-elections-important/article25808434.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oh6v9m/article25808433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23DHAKA,the-hindu,The Hindu,uproot,1
AP,"JERUSALEM (AP) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base in the final stretch of the tight race.
Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion in his four terms as prime minister, but until now refrained from presenting a detailed vision for the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as the heartland of a future state.
An Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank is bound to snuff out any last flicker of hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967.
A so-called two-state solution has long been the preferred option of most of the international community. However, intermittent U.S. mediation between Israelis and Palestinians ran aground after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israels capital early in his term. The Palestinians, who seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their capital, suspended contact with the U.S.
More recently, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The move was viewed in Israel as a political gift by Trump to Netanyahu who is being challenged by former military chief Benny Gantz.
The U.S. State Department declined to comment on Netanyahus statement.
Polls have indicated a close race, though Netanyahus Likud Party is expected to have a better chance than Gantzs Blue and White slate to form a ruling coalition. Polls forecast more than 60 out of 120 parliament seats for the Likud and smaller right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties
On Saturday, Netanyahu gave an interview to Israels Channel 12 TV at the top of the prime-time newscast. Netanyahu portrayed the U.S. policy shifts on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as his achievements, saying he had managed to persuade Trump to take these steps.
Netanyahu pledged that he would not dismantle a single Jewish settlement and that Israel would retain control of the territory west of the Jordan River the West Bank. More than 600,000 Israelis now live on war-won lands, two-thirds in the West Bank.
The interviewer asked why he hadnt annexed some of the larger settlements during his current term. The question you are asking is an interesting question, whether we will move to the next stage and the answer is yes, he said, adding that the next term in office would be fateful. We will move to the next stage, the imposing of Israeli sovereignty.
I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements, he said. From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.
In any partition deal, the more isolated Jewish settlements would likely have to be uprooted to create a viable Palestinian state.
Saeb Erekat, a veteran former Palestinian negotiator, said he held the international community, especially the Trump administration, responsible for Israels policies.
Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administrations support and endorsement of Israels violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine, he said in a statement.

The Motley Fool,"In the course of our careers, we’ve bound to make mistakes we come to bemoan after the fact. Maybe you didn’t fight hard enough for that promotion, or let your coworkers walk all over you for months on end. Here are a few of the things my colleagues and I regret the most in our careers. With any luck, you’ll learn from our mistakes and avoid falling into a similar trap. 1. Not being willing to move for work As a Motley Fool contributing writer, I’ve been lucky enough to appear on our Industry Focus podcasts fairly often. That scratches an itch that my own fears kept me from pursuing in my younger days. I wanted to be on the radio and even went to one of those short-term broadcast schools to learn what to do. Realistically, I could have been hired to do news updates and maybe host weekend talk shows, except I would’ve had to move to get one of those jobs. Related: 5 ways to make tough decisions faster (and not regret them later) At the time, I lived in the New York City area, and that market doesn’t have many openings for inexperienced personalities. I had some interest in my tape from, to put it kindly, smaller markets. In most cases, the jobs being bandied about included sales or promotions work in addition to hosting or news duties. That didn’t scare me, but leaving my comfort zone did, so I never took my shot. Maybe I never would have progressed, and maybe I would have been one of those hosts who lasted a year or two before moving on to the next market. It’s also possible I would not have enjoyed the work as much as expected. But I know it was fear that kept me from ever finding out. At this point, I’m happy with my career, but I also have a family, which means I have less flexibility to uproot my life if an opportunity does arise. Daniel B. Kline 2. Not speaking up about an abusive boss This is a sensitive topic, and not easy for many people to discuss. Yet it’s easily the biggest regret I have in my quarter-century in the working world, and something that, particularly in light of the “me too” movement, I know I should have done something about. When I was in my early 20s, I picked up a summer job delivering phone books (remember those?) for extra cash. The supervisor I worked for was a predator. The last week of the job, he made several passes at me, which I rebuffed. But that didn’t stop him. Without going into detail, his methods became physical, and I had to use force to restrain him on two separate occasions. I ended up walking out of the job after the second incident. Related: These are the mistakes that even experience job seekers keep making Here are my two regrets: First, I didn’t deal with what happened to me. It caused problems in my relationships, it affected my self-confidence, and it took much longer for me to address the psychological impact than it should have. Second, by not reporting this predator to the phone company and the contractor he worked for, I didn’t do anything to stop him from victimizing someone else. And since his job was to spend a few weeks in each area, supervising temporary workers, he almost certainly had many other victims. By remaining silent, I not only caused additional harm to myself by not getting the help I needed, but I also didn’t do anything to stop a predator. I regret the latter far more. Jason Hall 3. Not quitting a bad job sooner My first job out of college was a stressful one at a hedge fund, and while I learned a lot from it and built some pretty solid skills, I was utterly miserable pretty much from the start. I forced myself to stick it out, however, because the pay was pretty good and I was worried I wouldn’t find another job that offered the same salary and bonus structure. But I stayed on board way too long. Rather than leave after two years, or three years, I forced myself to stay with the firm for nearly five years. By the time I submitted my resignation letter, I was completely burned out and in a pretty bad place because of it. Not only did staying at a bad job too long cause me undue anguish and stress, but it also caused me to hold off even longer on doing what I really wanted to do. If you’re stuck in a job that makes you unhappy, by all means, have an exit strategy before you quit. But figure out a game plan to put an end to your misery as quickly as possible. Otherwise, you might come to regret it down the line. Maurie Backman This article originally appeared on The Motley Fool and is reprinted with permission.

Express News Service,"Paswan said, “The issue is not about eating food at anybody’s house. There is nothing wrong in it. But patronising and pitying Dalits is wrong.” As BJP lawmakers visit Dalit homes to share meals with them, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan Saturday said the political class should not patronise the community, and that “pitying Dalits is wrong”. Speaking to reporters after attending a meeting in Mumbai, Paswan said, “The issue is not about eating food at anybody’s house. There is nothing wrong in it. But patronising and pitying Dalits is wrong.” The minister said that eating at Dalit homes will not help eradicate untouchability. “The deep caste prejudices and social evils like untouchability cannot be wiped off by dining at Dalit homes,” he said. Referring to Lord Ram who had food at Shabari’s home, Paswan said such tokenism cannot eradicate caste biases. Paswan went on to say that attacks on the Dalit community were undermining all policy changes being brought in by the government. “All the affirmative policies of prime minister Narendra Modi were being overshadowed because of such mindless incidents against Dalits,” he said. Stressing on holistic development of Dalits, Paswan said, “The larger concern for Dalits relates to their holistic development. Focus should be to uproot the atrocities against Dalits. They should be provided better education and jobs.” Asked about the growing resentment among Dalits and tribals over attacks and its impact on elections, Paswan said, “The BJP government has brought in pro-farmer reforms, complete with minimum support price mechanism.” For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","Stressing on holistic development of Dalits, Paswan said, “The larger concern for Dalits relates to their holistic development.

Marni Epstein-Mervis,"There's a powerful and palpable movement happening right now. Women are shattering their silence and taking a loud and proud stand on a plethora of incredibly important issues, smashing the patriarchy along the way in nearly every arena. Take Frances McDormand's rousing Oscar speech earlier this week and Ava DeVurnay's decree against Hollywood's sexism and racism, not to mention a robust showing at the one year anniversary of the Women's March this past January. The feminist movement is undoubtedly reignited and burning red hot. But it's not only changing the political and corporate landscapes but also how women themselves are living, designing and buying for their homes, according to expert design forecaster Nancy Fire of Design Works International and HGTV Home. ""This is an amazing time in history when women are coming together to dismantle stereotypes and show that we are just as strong as men in every way,"" Nancy told Apartment Therapy this week. She notes the femme design movement is everywhere, from art and magazine covers to fashion, product design and kids' rooms design.

""Women [and men!] are teaching their daughters and sons about equality, purpose, women's rights. Children's nurseries have been huge in supporting the feminist design movement, employing art and decals that, for instance, encourage a little girl to be a scientist, astronaut, or CEO rather than the go-to-for-too-long princess."" She also notes that publications like Teen Vogue are focusing more on culture and Women Power over beauty products and sex appeal; their Volume II issue from 2017 featured Solange Knowles on the cover with one headline — ""The Sound of Protest"". So what does all of this have to do exactly with home decor and things like sofas and wallpaper? Well, plenty actually. Nancy elaborated to the fact this shift in mindset and its influence directly affects the retail market, and hence, decorating trends. ""We're seeing this empowerment movement through color, textiles, posters. We're seeing products become more feminine — rounder and more voluptuous. We're seeing this incorporation of positive feelings about the female body,"" she explains. A few specifics to note are badass female art popping up everywhere, more comfortable, textural fabrics that just feel good on the body, curvier furniture — ""This is in distinct contrast to the clean, hard lines of the ubiquitous mid-century modern trend of the last decade,"" explains Nancy. The unavoidable Millennial Pink has been so prevalent throughout interior design over the last number of years and doesn't seem to be going anywhere, either. You can't lift a shampoo bottle without running into the blushy shade. ""Millennial pink, whether pale or desaturated or salmon-y, is a kind of non-pink pink, an aesthetic distillation of the ideals of contemporary feminism: unabashedly female, but removed from the constraining associations of the past,"" wrote Senior Writer Nancy Mitchell in an article about the zeitgeisty color last year. ""It is, in a lot of ways, defined more by what it isn't than what it is: not Barbie. Not bubble gum. Not princessy."" While home decor has always been in the realm of the female, it appears that, like we're doing in so many other areas, women have decided to uproot the status quo and play by a new set of rules.","There's a powerful and palpable movement happening right now.

Gulrez Shah Azhar,"Alexendre Jorge evacuates Ethan Colman, 4, from a neighborhood inundated by floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey on Monday, Aug. 28, 2017, in Houston, Texas. Charlie Riedel/AP Between 150 to 300 million climate refugees might be displaced by climate change by 2050. Desertification, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events are already forcing people out of their homes at an alarming rate. The key to solving the problems is recognizing the threat, including climate change migrants within the definition of refugees, and preparing for the wave now. Wildfires tearing across Southern California have forced thousands of residents to evacuate from their homes. Even more people fled ahead of the hurricanes that slammed into Texas and Florida earlier this year, jamming highways and filling hotels. A viral social media post showed a flight-radar picture of people trying to escape Florida and posed a provocative question: What if the adjoining states were countries and didn’t grant escaping migrants refuge? By the middle of this century, experts estimate that climate change is likely to displace between 150 and 300 million people. If this group formed a country, it would be the fourth-largest in the world, with a population nearly as large as that of the United States. Yet neither individual countries nor the global community are completely prepared to support a whole new class of “climate migrants.” As a physician and public health researcher in India, I learned the value of surveillance and early warning systems for managing infectious disease outbreaks. Based on my current research on health impacts of heat waves in developing countries, I believe much needs to be done at the national, regional and global level to deal with climate migrants. Climate change is already impacting people and societies worldwide Climate migration is already happening. Every year desertification in Mexico’s drylands forces 700,000 people to relocate. Cyclones have displaced thousands from Tuvalu in the South Pacific and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean. Experts agree that a prolonged drought may have catalyzed Syria’s civil war and resulting migration. Between 2008 and 2015, an average of 26.4 million people per year were displaced by climate- or weather-related disasters, according to the United Nations. And the science of climate change indicates that these trends are likely to get worse. With each one-degree increase in temperature, the air’s moisture-carrying capacity increases by 7 percent, fueling increasingly severe storms. Sea levels may rise by as much as three feet by the year 2100, submerging coastal areas and inhabited islands. Boys cool off under a water fountain on a hot summer evening in New Delhi. Reuters/Anindito Mukherjee The Pacific islands are extremely vulnerable, as are more than 410 U.S. cities and others around the globe, including Amsterdam, Hamburg, Lisbon and Mumbai. Rising temperatures could make parts of west Asia inhospitable to human life. On the same day that Hurricane Irma roared over Florida in September, heavy rains on the other side of the world submerged one-third of Bangladesh and eastern parts of India, killing thousands. Climate change will affect most everyone on the planet to some degree, but poor people in developing nations will be affected most severely. Extreme weather events and tropical diseases wreak the heaviest damage in these regions. Undernourished people who have few resources and inadequate housing are especially at risk and likely to be displaced. Recognition and contingency plans Today the global community has not universally acknowledged the existence of climate migrants, much less agreed on how to define them. According to international refugee law, climate migrants are not legally considered refugees. Therefore, they have none of the protections officially accorded to refugees, who are technically defined as people fleeing persecution. No global agreements exist to help millions of people who are displaced by natural disasters every year. Refugees’ rights, and nations’ legal obligation to defend them, were first defined under the 1951 Refugee Convention, which was expanded in 1967. This work took place well before it was apparent that climate change would become a major force driving migrations and creating refugee crises. Under the convention, a refugee is defined as someone “unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.” The convention legally binds nations to provide access to courts, identity papers and travel documents, and to offer possible naturalization. It also bars discriminating against refugees, penalizing them, expelling them or forcibly returning them to their countries of origin. Refugees are entitled to practice their religions, attain education and access public assistance. In my view, governments and organizations such as the United Nations should consider modifying international law to provide legal status to environmental refugees and establish protections and rights for them. Reforms could factor in the concept of “ climate justice,” the notion that climate change is an ethical and social concern. After all, richer countries have contributed the most to cause warming, while poor countries will bear the most disastrous consequences. Some observers have suggested that countries that bear major responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions should take in more refugees. Alternatively, the world’s largest carbon polluters could contribute to a fund that would pay for refugee care and resettlement for those temporarily and permanently displaced. The Paris climate agreement does not mention climate refugees. However, there have been some consultations and initiatives by various organizations and governments. They include efforts to create a climate change displacement coordination facility and a U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change.

REUTERS/Mal Langsdon It is tough to define a climate refugee or migrant. This could be one of the biggest challenges in developing policies. As history has shown, destination countries respond to waves of migration in various ways, ranging from welcoming immigrants to placing them in detention camps or denying them assistance. Some countries may be selective in whom they allow in, favoring only the young and productive while leaving children, the elderly and infirm behind. A guiding global policy could help prevent confusion and outline some minimum standards. Preparing for refugees must begin now Negotiating international agreements on these issues could take many years. For now, major G20 powers such as the United States, the European Union, China, Russia, India, Canada, Australia and Brazil should consider intermediate steps. The United States could offer temporary protected status to climate migrants who are already on its soil. Government aid programs and nongovernment organizations should ramp up support to refugee relief organizations and ensure that aid reaches refugees from climate disasters. In addition, all countries that have not signed the United Nations refugee conventions could consider joining them. This includes many developing countries in South Asia and the Middle East that are highly vulnerable to climate change and that already have large refugee populations. Since most of the affected people in these countries will likely move to neighboring nations, it is crucial that all countries in these regions abide by a common set of policies for handling and assisting refugees. The scale of this challenge is unlike anything humanity has ever faced. By midcentury, climate change is likely to uproot far more people than World War II, which displaced some 60 million across Europe, or the Partition of India, which affected approximately 15 million. The migration crisis that has gripped Europe since 2015 has involved something over one million refugees and migrants. It is daunting to envision much larger flows of people, but that is why the global community should start doing so now.","Charlie Riedel/AP Between 150 to 300 million climate refugees might be displaced by climate change by 2050.

Nicole Pomarico,"During the second episode of season 16 of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" the family tried to organize their trip to Bali and Kim Kardashian found out that Kanye West told fans he was moving back to Chicago without discussing it with her first. 
 Here's what you might have missed on ""KUWTK"": 
Scott wanted to join the family trip to Bali
 Some of the family was getting ready to take a big trip to Bali, and there was a debate about whether or not Scott should be invited. Kourtney had her hesitations; on the last family trip, he snuck a woman along with him, much to everyone else's surprise, and this time, she was hoping for a ""drama-free vacation."" 
Scott wanted to go on the family vacation.
 E! 
But Kim and Kris thought that Scott should definitely be invited, and Kim decided to try to help convince Kourtney it was a good idea. She planned to invite Scott to join her and Kourtney on a trip to New York to see Kanye perform on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and if that trip went well, maybe Kourtney would want to bring him to Bali, too. 
 The trip to New York did end up going well, but Kourtney was worried that Scott might not be able to maintain co-parenting boundaries if he came to Bali. But when the two of them had a chance to talk one-on-one about the situation, she felt a little better about it. 
 ""My past with Scott has always been complicated, and I just feel like this New York trip has really made me feel excited,"" she said. ""It's really nice to see how much Scott has grown and how much he's invested in really being a great dad to the kids."" 
Kourtney ultimately decided it was OK if Scott came.
 E! 
Ultimately, Kourtney decided that it was okay with her if Scott came to Bali, and he was happy that he wouldn't miss out on that time with his kids. 
MJ had a health scare
 Kris' mom, MJ, said she hadn't been feeling well, and although she'd been suffering from pneumonia, doctors found a mass they hadn't been able to identify, which had Kris worried. She said until the results of her biopsy were in, she couldn't imagine going on vacation. 
 Ultimately, Kris decided to skip out on the trip so she could be around in case MJ needed her, even though she said she was having FOMO about not going to Bali with the rest of her family. 
 ""The results of MJ's biopsy are saying it's a terrible intense infection, which is still very serious,"" Kris said. ""I could never leave her now."" 
Kim found out Kanye wanted to move to Chicago via social media like everyone else
 While Kim was working on a photo shoot, she started getting text messages from friends, asking her if she was moving to Chicago. That's when she found out about Kanye saying he was moving back to Chicago while talking to a crowd at an event — and yes, she was hearing about this for the first time as the rest of the world, and she was not on board. 
Kim said she was in the dark about Kanye's desire to move to Chicago.
 E! 
""I know Kanye really loves being in Chicago but I had no idea that he wants to move there until I hear about it on social media,"" Kim said. ""I'm a little bit annoyed. We have to talk about this. I have to get there in person and see face to face what's really going on."" 
 When Kim made it to Chicago, she found out that when Kanye said they could move into his mom's house, he meant it seriously, not that they could just stay for a few weeks, and for the time being, Kim decided to ""ride it out"" and see where the idea went. But the rest of her family seemed against it, including Khloe, who was living in Cleveland part time at the time and knew what it was like to uproot her life and be away from her family. 
 But then, at Kanye's SNL performance, he ranted about President Donald Trump, which had Kim even more stressed out. 
 ""I don't know if they'll invite us back ever,"" Kim said. ""I can't control it."" 
Kanye and Kim had a talk about moving.
 E! 
Kris told her that she should try to pay more attention to Kanye to keep him calm, but Kim said that she has ""a million kids and a million jobs"" and doesn't have much more to give. 
 When Kim talked to Kanye later, she told him that since the kids are in school, she didn't want to make them leave their routine and their cousins and asked him if having a second house in Chicago would be an option rather than permanently moving to Chicago. 
 ""When I went to Chicago I felt like I was home. There were a lot of things that I missed, just not being there for a long, long time,"" Kanye said. 
 Kim said she was willing to split her time, but during the school year, she wanted to remain in California with her kids. And in the end, they agreed that they wouldn't move full time, but they would spend more time in Chicago so Kanye could feel at home more often.","On Sunday night’s new episode of ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians,"" the family debated whether or not Scott Disick should join their trip to Bali.

"Anne van Riel, Contributor","For so many years, IKEA has seemed unrelenting in its domination among home furnishing retailers. However, even the Swedish giant, known for such items as the Billy bookcase and Malm bed, is not immune to disruption from changing customer behaviors and demands. For IKEA, the answer may well lie in disrupting its own business. 
 Following a difficult 2018 which included a fall in profits and job losses, IKEA has decided to reevaluate its business. As a result, the company has announced that it is set to start leasing furniture, signaling one of the most significant shifts from its traditional model for decades. This product-as-a-service (PaaS) trial — or Sofa-as-a-Service as some are calling it — is a prime example of a company addressing disruption but also one of the most high-profile cases of the circular economy. 
 IKEA and the retail sector are not alone. A combination of shifting consumer behaviors and rapidly-evolving digital technologies is disrupting long-established business models across many industries and putting increasing pressure on traditional growth models. 
Disruption is underway
 What do cars, printers and clothing all have in common? Or perhaps the question ought to be framed as ""what will they have in common?"", because it's easy to envisage a future where consumers no longer 'own' any of these things but opt purely for an 'access' model. 
 If we look at the automotive industry, as one example, new vehicle sales have traditionally accounted for the lion's share of revenues. Yet the future could look quite different. 
 Increased connectivity through smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with urbanization could lead to a surge in demand for car- and ride-sharing or e-hailing services like Zipcar or Uber. As consumers place more value in the digitally-driven services in their vehicles, product-as-a-service models may be preferred because it makes it easier for them to keep their technology current. What it means to be a car owner and manufacturer could be very different. 
 Similar forces are at work in other industries too. It is becoming increasingly common for businesses to access rather than own electronic devices such as printers because of the flexibility it provides them with — and to avoid falling behind as technology upgrades come along. It may not be long before personal computers follow this trend and consumers migrate to a subscription model there too. 
 Meanwhile, in healthcare, some providers are now placing their bets on offering managed equipment services for medical technology, to respond to demand from healthcare institutions to future-proof their assets and reduce maintenance costs.

The circular advantage
 As these product models become more dominant within certain industries, those businesses that have adopted a circular mindset should be able to make a more natural transition to deliver them. 
 One trait that is central to the implementation of circular practices is a high propensity to innovate. Companies that adopt a circular economy philosophy become masters of redesigning products to enable remanufacturing and repair. 
 They learn to embrace organizational agility too, rethinking existing processes, adapting supply chains and collaborating with a broader ecosystem of partners. 
 These qualities will deliver a strategic advantage as companies seize the initiative to uproot old product models and bring new ones to market. 
 When implementing circular frameworks, one of the first areas that companies often address is to increase their recycling levels, working toward the ultimate goal of creating a closed materials loop. Achieving this requires developing closer connections and more frequent engagement with customers, as they must play their part in enabling companies to recover materials in their products. 
 In turn, this may help companies to bring their customers along with them on their circular transition. It may smooth the path to service-based models and subscription models too, as customers become engrained in the process of purchase, use and return. 
 A more open dialogue and more frequent interactions with customers — whether business or retail — could also help in moving to new pricing models that will accompany subscription-based and sharing models. It may be necessary to work with customers during the development of new pricing and payment approaches. 
 The businesses that adopt a circular philosophy are likely to be more future-oriented in their strategic vision too. They will naturally recognize the potential sustainability and revenue win-win of some emerging product models. 
 For example, PaaS models will be high on their radar given the potential to increase product longevity, reusability and the sharing of materials. And product sharing too, which facilitates the sharing of overcapacity or underutilization, so improving the efficiency of resource use.

 In fact, the businesses at the forefront of introducing these new product models — whether by intention or not — are already driving increased circularity. In many cases, these businesses are also some of the most mature within their industries on sustainable thinking. 
 In today's fast-changing environment, the pace of business model disruption is only set to accelerate. And while there are many factors that will enable businesses to ensure they are on the right side of change, there are good reasons to believe that those which embrace a circular economy philosophy, such as IKEA, will have something of a head start. 
Last week marked the first Circular City Week New York, an open festival for events in support of the circular economy with the aim of inspiring industry professional across sectors to go circular.

IANS,"Kolkata, BJP President Amit Shah said on Saturday only the Bharatiya Janata Party can bring progress in Bengal as he urged the people to uproot the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government from the state. Addressing a massive rally in central Kolkata's Mayo Road, Shah came down heavily upon the West Bengal's ruling party, accusing it of being involved in a series of corruption cases, besides destroying the law and order situation in the state. Shah said BJP is the only alternative. ""Since the time the Trinamool Congress government came to power in Bengal -- seven years ago, there has been series of corruption (cases) starting from the Narada scandal, Saradha and Rose valley ponzi scams... syndicates and the unlawful activities of cattle mafias and coal mafias.

Emma Latham Phillips,"Essex as a county has been historically judged by misguided stereotypes, summed up in the Spitting Image’s anthem, Essex is Crap. Radical Essex is an ongoing project dating back to 2016 that aims to uproot these malignant categorisations; it “re-examines the history of the county concerning radicalism in thought, lifestyle, politics and architecture, and sheds light on the region’s vibrant, pioneering thinking throughout the twentieth century”. At the end of June, Radical Essex was released in stunning printed form by Focal Point Gallery in Southend-on-Sea. The publication seeks to tell “an alternate story”, to what we’d classically hear in The Only Way Is Essex. At times images are tiled upon beautiful pages of marbled ink, which see branches of pink, blue and green spread out like landforms. The custom typeface, designed by Fraser Muggeridge Studio, has been morphed subtly and simply; with the ""o""s often replaced by diamonds, suggesting mystic and alternative roots. The book explores and “celebrates the extremes of this innovative and experimental county”, Joe Hill, co-editor explains. “From early modernist architectural experiments to worker colonies and pacifist communities”. Trapped between the city and sea, Essex became a “form of escape, a testing ground for experimental ways of living”. Examples include Tolstoyan communes, the anarchist-pacifist open house Dial House and the religious retreat of Othona Community. The publication is accompanied by gorgeous photography from the award-winning photographer Catherine Hyland. As well as images documenting the at times brutalist, modernist architecture, the book also features a new series of work, People of Othona. With her signature soft, light colour palette, the portraits are intimate and striking. As the subject stares at the viewer, we share a personal moment. Founded by RAF chaplain, Norman Motley, the Othona community works within a religious framework, set off-grid by the sea. With slight blue and green tones, Catherine’s images are reminiscent of the ocean, carefully capturing this tone. The county “also lays claim to being the birthplace of British modernism, with the country’s earliest building in this style built on the outskirts of Braintree”. Throughout its pages Radical Essex is laced with striking examples of the county’s architecture. The innovative buildings are captured by Catherine, striking a calm and melodic tone.","Essex as a county has been historically judged by misguided stereotypes, summed up in the Spitting Image’s anthem, _Essex is Crap._ _Radical Essex_ is an ongoing project dating back to 2016 that aims to uproot these malignant categorisations; it “re-examines …",2018-07-17T09:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Itsnicethat.com'}",Radical Essex is a publication that aims to uproot the county’s misguided stereotypes,https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/radical-essex-publication-170718,https://www.itsnicethat.com/system/files/072018/5b4db6267fa44cb9b50000ea/index_default/catherinehyland-radicalessex-publication-list.jpg?1531820831,,Itsnicethat.com,uproot,1
New York Times,"A photo provided by the City of Healdsburg of the hammer sculpture weighing 800 pounds that disappeared from the community centre lawn in Healdsburg in early October. (Source: The New York Times) As residents of Kansas City, Missouri, revel in the recovery of a sorely missed stolen colon, locals in Healdsburg, California, are still holding out hope for their own oversize oddity. For more than three weeks, authorities have scoured the city of 11,000 tucked in California wine country, hoping to find an 800-pound hammer. Like the giant, inflatable intestine in Kansas City, the hammer is hard to miss. It is 21 feet long; its head is about 5 feet tall; and it had been securely displayed on the lawn of the citys community centre since spring. For months, residents drove by and got out of their cars to take pictures with the art installation, which officials said quickly captured the small citys imagination. But sometime on the weekend of October 6 and 7, it vanished. Since then, the city has had a mystery on its hands. There are no leads at this time, Officer Darryl Erkel of the Healdsburg Police Department said Tuesday. Were taking it seriously, he continued, adding that the hammer heist was potentially a felony offence. Who knows what the motivation is? At first, the authorities wondered if it was a prank. The high schools homecoming festivities took place the weekend the hammer disappeared, and some believed it would soon reappear. But reached by The New York Times days later, Erkel bemoaned that it had not shown up. The crime left residents wondering not only who had stolen the hammer but also how. Erkel said police believe the thieves had to uproot the hammer from the ground and then dragged it about 100 feet. Several people would have been required to lift the hammer onto the back of a truck, he added. Either that, or a crane was involved. (Indeed, video on Facebook shows a crane straining to lift the hammer onto city property earlier this year.) All of which leads to more questions: Why would someone want a giant hammer this badly and where would someone even put it? I highly doubt its in someones personal art exhibit, Erkel previously quipped. Then, a twist. Sometime on Oct. 20 or 21 another weekend someone pounded a 3-foot metal nail into the site where the sculpture had been. Etched on the head of the nail? BAIT. A photo provided by the City of Healdsburg of a three-foot metal nail that was recently pounded into the ground on the sculpture site in Healdsburg. (Source: The New York Times) The initial reaction was huh?’ Rhea Borja, a Healdsburg city spokeswoman, said Tuesday. Were we being goaded by the people who took the hammer? They were not. Last week, a local metalworker confessed that he had planted the nail, telling The Healdsburg Tribune that it had been an unsuccessful attempt to lure the hammer back to its proper place. It was supposed to attract the hammer, Erkel said of the nail, adding that it had since been removed. In the meantime, the artist who created the hammer, Doug Unkrey, is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to its recovery, officials said. Many are hopeful; others are upset; and a few feel as if they have been unwitting participants in a multi-act performance. With a new roundabout scheduled to be unveiled in town which officials noted was a very big deal and years in the making some residents are half expecting the hammer to materialize at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Its a fun thing for the community to talk about, Borja said. There are so many derisive things going on in the world. This is light enough for people to be able to commiserate. Indeed, in a gesture of support, Healdsburgs city manager was recently given a signed hammer (of normal size) by other city managers to replace the one the city has lost. Told Tuesday of the stolen colons triumphant return in Kansas City, Mark Themig, Healdsburgs community services director, perked up. If and, hopefully, when the hammer returns, were going to do something big, Themig said. Weve got some ideas. Thats all I can say.

Reuters Editorial,"GENEVA (Reuters) - An anticipated Syrian government offensive against rebels in Idlib province could displace more than 700,000 people, far more than were uprooted in a recent battle in the southwest of Syria, a U.N.-led group of health agencies said in a monthly report. Many of Syria’s battles have ended with agreements for fighters and their families to depart for Idlib governorate, where an influx of displaced people has roughly doubled the population to around 2.5 million. The United Nations has said the province has become a “dumping ground” for evacuees. The monthly Health Cluster Bulletin, published by a group of health-focused aid agencies led by the World Health Organization, said aid workers were bracing for the Idlib battle. “Increased hostilities are expected in the North West in the coming period, to result in displacements of 250,000 to over 700,000 people in Idlib and surrounding areas,” the report said. “This will cause an increased need for humanitarian assistance to the new vulnerable and host communities, especially emergency health services.” Between mid-June and the end of July, 184,000 people were displaced by a battle in the south and subsequent agreements to end the fighting there. Among the displaced, more than 10,000 went to Idlib and northern Aleppo governorate, the report said. The U.N. has repeatedly warned about the dangers of an attack on Idlib. Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad said in a Russian media interview last month that Idlib governorate would be a priority for his forces. U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in June that the governorate’s entire population of 2.5 million could be displaced and move towards the Turkish border if there was a major battle. Such a battle would be much more complicated and brutal than anything seen so far in the seven-year war, he said. The health cluster report included a map showing the breakdown of the population in southern and eastern parts of the governorate, suggesting that the displacement scenario was based on an attack by government forces from the south and east. The map showed population estimates in four zones from the frontline up to the Latakia-Aleppo highway and the Hama-Aleppo highway, with a total of 993,000 people in those zones.

Hina Rohtaki,"A newly designed roundabout in Panchkula. (Express)
FOR UPROOTING the existing tree cover at roundabouts, the Panchkula Municipal Corporation paid money to the firm executing the work of beautification of roundabouts, even when on quotation basis, another contractor had already carried out the work for Rs 69,000 per roundabout, documents accessed by Chandigarh Newsline have found.
Executive engineer, incharge of the beautification work, L C Chauhan said, Yes, this discrepancy came to my notice and that is why I have held back the payment of this contractor P C Yadav after I got to know that M/s Sakumbari Engineering Works was also being paid for the same nature of work.
He added, On an urgent basis, some works are done on verbal approvals as well and later post facto approval is taken. In fact, one sub- divisional officer of horticulture wing got this work of uprooting existing tree cover done on a quotation basis from Yadav at all the roundabouts. Later, I saw that even Sakumbari was being paid for the same work, so I have held back Yadavs payment.
The payment for tree felling at roundabouts also varied for Sakumbari. At the roundabout of sector 11/12/12A/14, as per the work order, the firm was given for Rs 2,500 per tree for uprooting them while on roundabout of Shaheed Major Sandeep Sagar chowk and Major Shankla chowk, for the same tree, they paid Rs 1,000 per tree.
Talking to Newsline, contractor Yadav whose payment has been held back said, I was the one who actually carried out the uprooting of the plants and trees, clearing the wild cover at all eight roundabouts before the main work was to begin. I have pictures with me. Now I have been running from pillar to post for my payment but they arent releasing it saying that other firm has been paid for it.
He added, I was told that post facto approval would be given for my work. But the fact is that my labour and money has been spent and now they arent paying for it.
Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of news articles, has highlighted the glaring discrepancies in the roundabout beautification project currently underway in Panchkula. Haryana Urban Local Bodies Minister Kavita Jain on Friday had ordered a probe into the alleged discrepancies in the ongoing roundabout beautification work. Eight roundabouts in Panchkula are being beautified at a cost of Rs 2.84 crore.
The Youth Congress has decided to hold a protest against the alleged discrepancies on Monday outside the office of Municipal Corporation building in Sector 14, Panchkula. The agitation will be held at 10 am.
Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta said, An inquiry has already been ordered and anyone who is found guilty will be punished. But I just want to convey that those who are trying to stop the development works of the city, the development will not stop. I am not protecting anyone but politicising an issue is not justified.","Another contractor had already carried out the uprooting work, now his payment has been withheld",2019-01-06T23:23:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}",Panchkula: Firm doing beautification work was also paid for trees it did not uproot,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/panchkula-firm-doing-beautification-work-was-also-paid-for-trees-it-did-not-uproot-5526049/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/01/roundabout-759.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,uproot,1
Brian D. Evans,"As the digital world becomes more and more intertwined with reality, we will continue to see the clever adoption of internet connected services into our daily lives. At the core of this evolution is the concept of "" The Internet of Things "" (IoT), pegged by many as the ""next big shift"" in consumer and enterprise technology that will drive our society forwards. By 2020, it is estimated that there will be over 20 billion connected devices online. The question many are asking is what does this really mean for schools? Offices? Public utilities? How will fusing more technology with our lives empower us to be better humans and get more done? With billions of internet enabled machines integrated in our homes and workplaces, we will be able to automate monotonous functions, observe cultural data patterns, and make systems far more efficient. The phrase is far more than just a buzzword. If we execute correctly, we can fundamentally disrupt entire industries (agriculture, construction). We can build safer streets, make more efficient farms, and entirely rewrite the experience of life. There is a massive opportunity for entrepreneurs and incumbent technologists to develop IoT devices, thereby enhancing some of life's most boring and monotonous functions for the masses. And this enticing opportunity has drawn in a wide and talented pool of makers (engineers, designers, marketers, etc.) who are excited and eager to build the future faster. One of the big bets for the IoT community, however, is that we can securely and safely store the huge quantities of data being sent to and from these appliances. The threat of cyber hackers, notorious for placing malware inside of internet connected devices like security cameras and computer monitors, is alive and top of mind, especially within major corporations who carry big, important data. If we cannot even guarantee security and safety of our data today, how will we be able to create an infrastructure/standard for a digitally connected world when there are billions, if not trillions, of connected nodes in the network? The answer, luckily, lies in the advanced development of blockchain technology that is breathing new life into the IoT movement, making a ""faraway future"" feel more and more like an inevitable component of reality. At a high level, what you have to understand about blockchain is that it is a distributed network that maintains a verifiable, secure ""ledger"" to log, store, and access information. Unlike centralized systems, blockchain ledgers are immutable, meaning no single individual can uproot the system and make any changes without majority approval. Effectively, they create a shared governance structure, ""an optimal environment for IoT networks where there can be trust, anonymity, and effective contracts between parties without any single vendor being in charge,"" says Paul Fremantle from the University of Portsmouth. Above that, implementations of blockchain could also enable players in the IoT space to begin monetizing and collaborating with their data. Streamr, a startup built on Ethereum Smart Contracts, allows companies to tokenize their streaming data, enabling a whole new way for machines (internet connected devices) and people to trade and exchange data. Their model hinges on the idea that, with all of this new data from IoT devices, like self driving cars, being compiled and collected, surely companies and individuals should have the ability to monetize it. On the other side, Streamr provides a complete system for developing real-time data apps, all without a single line of code. Finding unique and interesting ways to make use of the new abundance of data will prove to be the challenge for entrepreneurs of the next 5, 10, 20 years. While the learnings are far from predictable, one certainty is that technology will be at the core of mankind's evolution for years to come. Currently, we are faced with the challenge of making processing chips less expensive, and spreading the internet (and IoT devices) as far and wide as possible. The next step is to access the synergies from having a string of devices online together, such that we can begin automating entire systems and making mundane processes far more efficient.",The Internet of Things and blockchain technology are creating a powerful combination.,2017-11-17T14:22:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Blockchain Is Giving The IoT Space Another Boost,https://www.inc.com/brian-d-evans/blockchain-is-giving-internet-of-things-space-another-boost.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_612622938_331323.jpg,,Inc.com,uproot,1
Kevin Wong,"The core innovation of Super Mario Odyssey is Mario’s companion, Cappy. Cappy is a hat that can magically possess everything from non-living objects to living characters. Toss Cappy at an enemy, and the enemy will sprout a Mario moustache and a signature red hat. Mario gains full control over the creature’s movements and abilities. There are 52 different transformations that Mario can make throughout the game. Here they are, ranked from worst to best. 52. Letter Possess the letters, move them to spell “M-A-R-I-O,” and get a Power Moon. At its best, Odyssey rewards the player for clever insight, experimentation, or completion of a difficult play sequence. This Letter challenge requires none of that. 48. Tie: Cactus, Tree, Boulder, Bowser Statue There are 880 unique Power Moons that Mario can collect. That number feels like it was inflated by filler challenges such as these. Possess and move the Cactus? Get a Power Moon. Possess and move the Rock? Get a Power Moon. Power Moons ought to mean a little more than simply tripping over them. 47. Taxi It’s a car with a moustache! 46. Meat Mario can possess a salt-encrusted slab of meat. First, you shake loose of the salt by “twitching.” Then, you quiver and flop about until the bird boss carries you to the final Luncheon Kingdom battle. Honestly, it’s kind of gross. 45. Mini Rocket The rocket feels really good to use. You hold down the B button, and there’s a unique controller vibration that coincides with the rocket’s blast-off. 44. Ty-foo Ty-foo is fun in theory but less so in practice. His special ability is that he can blow stuff away. Given his size, you’d think he could kick up snow drifts and tidal waves. Instead, he blows what could be generously described as a light breeze. 43. Lakitu As Lakitu, Mario should be able to fly into the heavens and rain down Spiny Eggs on his hapless opponents. Instead, you fish. If you ever wanted to replay the fishing mini-game from Wii Play, here’s your chance. 42. Binoculars You get goggles that let you see into the distance and zoom in and out. Enjoy looking at exciting things that you would rather be doing. 40. Tie: Zipper, Manhole These are visual sight gags that grant you passage to hidden areas. They’re fun, but unfortunately, they only occur in two levels. The zippers are in the Lake Kingdom, and the manholes are in the Metro Kingdom. The game holds your hand a great deal (a little too much), so there’s never a question of when to use them. 38. Tie: Picture Match Part Mario, Picture Match Part Goomba These challenges taught me that my visual memory is poor (I initially failed the tracewalking sequences as well). To cheat, take a snapshot of the Goomba before his features are scattered. 37. Moe-Eye Moe-Eye, Moai. Get it? Possess these monolithic Easter Island-esque heads, and Mario can see platforms that would otherwise be invisible. It’s a cool idea that, after several themed challenges, you never want to see again. 35. Tie: Puzzle Part Metro Kingdom, Puzzle Part Lake Kingdom These puzzles tax your spatial reasoning instead of your memory. You roll puzzle pieces around on a grid, and you lay them into place on their correct side at the correct orientation. They’re extremely satisfying to solve; unlike the other challenges that grade you on a point scale, you either solve these puzzles or you don’t. 34. Poison Piranha Plant The Piranha Plants are difficult to possess. If you throw Cappy, the Piranha Plant will eat it. Instead, throw a boulder, and while the Piranha has its mouth full trying to eat it, throw Cappy and capture the Piranha. The biggest problem with the Poison Piranha Plant is that the purple goo you excrete doesn’t disappear on its own. Every time you spit you might kill a baddie, but you’re also creating a puddle that could kill you. 33. Jizo The Jizo statues look exactly like the Tanooki Mario statues in Super Mario Bros. 3. You can’t do much with them except hop around. They’re also heavy, which lets you break through wooden floors if you hop in the right area. Still, they’re one of the better callbacks to Mario’s 8-bit era. 32. Fire Piranha Plant This is the better of the two Piranha Plants, because the fireballs travel far away—you won’t risk burning yourself after you exit the transformation. The circumstances to use either Piranha, however, are pretty rare. Since the Piranhas are rooted to the ground, their applicability is limited. 31. RC Car There’s something unsettling about the humans in the Metro Kingdom. They all have the same drab look, like the drawings in an airline safety manual. Possessing one allows you to drive a remote-controlled car and post your best lap times on a global leaderboard. Here’s nice bit of nostalgia: the race music is the Mario Circuit theme from Super Mario Kart. 29. Tie: Pole, Volbanon Here’s another transformation that feels really good. You can bend the poles or the Volbanons (spoons) all the way back and launch yourself across the screen. They’re springy, fun, and excellent for reaching high places and futzing around. 26. Tie: Chain Chomp, Big Chain Chomp, Broode’s Chain Chomp When the Chain Chomps first debuted in Super Mario Bros. 3, they were terrifying: hard to kill, randomized, and aggressive as hell. In Odyssey, they’re far more manageable. They give you a clear, barking warning before they launch themselves at you. Capturing a Chain Chomp allows you to use it like a slingshot to strain against your chain and then launch yourself at a target. Again, its applicability is limited; any puzzle that requires a Chain Chomp is confined to its radius. 25. Spark Pylon The spark pylon allows you to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time. Mario leaves a jagged trail of sparks in his wake, and the wire gets so hot that it smokes. You can get even more sparks and smoke by tapping the buttons on your Switch. It’s one of the best visual effects in the game. 24. Shiverian Racer As a Shiverian racer, Mario takes part in the Bound Bowl Races; you compete with other Shiverians by bouncing down a wooden gauntlet. It feels free wheeling and random—which is the point—but there’s definitely a strategy to selectively bounding on declines and corners in order to maximize your speed. I never mastered it, but I got lucky enough times to earn my Power Moon. 23. Yoshi Yoshi is on top of Peach’s Castle in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is exactly where he was in Super Mario 64. As Yoshi, you eat apples to earn Power Moons, and you can even flutter jump. The only thing Yoshi can’t do is gobble up enemies, because the Mushroom Kingdom doesn’t have any. We’ll all have to wait until 2019 to get our real Yoshi fix. 22. Frog Mario’s first transformation in Odyssey is also one of his best. When he transforms into a Frog, Mario can leap extremely high, and if you shake the Joy-Cons, Mario flips and leaps even higher. The best transformations in Odyssey go beyond the cosmetic; they fundamentally change the way Mario interacts with his world. As a Frog, what was once inaccessible is now in reach. Equipped with this new knowledge, you find yourself looking up in addition to looking directly around you. 21. Knucklotec’s Fist I love end bosses with massive hands. I loved Master Hand in Super Smash Bros. I loved Andross in Star Fox. I love Naga Sotuva in Ninja Gaiden II. So of course, I love Knucklotec, whom you defeat by punching him in the face with his own fist. Knucklotec bobs and covers up when you’re on the offensive, which makes it extra satisfying to cut in at a sharp angle and jack up his jaw. 20. Hammer Brother The most common Hammer Brother in Odyssey is not armed with hammers, but with frying pans, which he can throw with blurring efficiency. In the original Super Mario Bros., the Hammer Brothers were the trickiest enemies in the game, save for Bowser himself. In Super Mario Bros. 3, the Hammer Bros. suit was the most prized power-up in the game. But in Odyssey, you never feel strong as a Hammer Brother. It’s probably because whenever you get to play as one, you’re always facing off against multiple other Hammer Bros or an even more powerful enemy. Yes, you have some good firepower on your side, but you need every bit of it to survive. 19. Coin Coffer There’s only three of these in the game, and they’re almost impossible to find. They’re camouflaged, and you’ll probably come across them by accident unless you know what you’re looking for. Capturing a Coin Coffer earns you 30 coins. You can also use coins to attack; you can spit them out one-by-one, or you can shake the controller and spit them in a circle. It’s a decent attack, but quite literally, the cost is too high. 18. Glydon This little dinosaur’s job is to glide, which makes sense, because you always find him on top of the highest tower or hill, where you can survey the land and pick out a target in the distance. Glydon takes some practice to use to his full potential, because he descends fairly quickly. To get the most air time, start shaking the controller as soon as you jump off the ledge. It’s always better to overcompensate than undercompensate; you can always dive bomb out of the sky if you overshoot the landing. 16. Tie: Paragoomba, Parabones The Paragoomba and Parabones both outrank the Glydon, because their flight is easily controllable, and they can hover indefinitely. Like all the best transformations in Odyssey, the Paragoomba and Parabones alter how you engage with the environment. Lava and pits are no longer a problem; you can fly right over them to access remote areas of the map. 15. Fire Brother The better, more powerful version of his cousin the Hammer Brother, the Fire Brother has one of the best weapons in the game. Unlike the hammers or frying pans, which disintegrate upon contact, the fireballs ricochet off barriers, guaranteeing that they’ll hit something before they fizzle out. The only problem is mobility; both he and the Hammer Brother hop-walk at a slow pace. But they can also perform a mid-air jump, similar to the one by Rattly the Rattlesnake in Donkey Kong Country 2. 14. Sherm It’s a mini-tank, and once you capture it, you’ll want to hold onto it for as long as possible. Its turret has a full range of motion and can take out enemies both above and below it. It can break down walls and barriers. And Mario needs it to defeat bosses in both the Wooded Kingdom and the Metro Kingdom. Sherm is also, against all odds, a family-friendly tank. When its explosive shell hits a target, it bursts into rainbow confetti streamers. 13. Tropical Wiggler There are all sorts of Wigglers in the Mario franchise. The original Wiggler of Super Mario World lived in the Forest of Illusion, and it became enraged when you stomped on his head. The most imposing Wiggler is in Odyssey; it’s a massive Mecha on the peak of the Metro Kingdom’s Empire State Building. The Lost Kingdom is where you meet the Tropical Wiggler. It can stretch from one platform to another, and it can snake around obstacles instead of operating in a straight line. It also has a great sound effect. Whenever it snaps back into place, it sounds like beads colliding against one another. 12. Uproot Uproot comes at exactly the right time. You’re in the Wooded Kingdom, surrounded by massive trees, with no way to climb and reach the high ground. Just as you start wondering what to do, along come these stretchy plant creatures. The Wooded Kingdom is vertically dense, a unique attribute in the Mario franchise. One of the cool things about the Uproot is that when you hit something with its head, it registers multiple times, like the business end of a jackhammer. You can clearly see this mechanic when you take on the Torkdrift boss at the end of the Wooded Kingdom. 11. Bullet Bill The Bullet Bill is a staple of the Mario franchise, and the Odyssey developers gave it its due. It feels right—it curves and banks at just the right angles, and it never feels beyond your control. And that’s a good thing, because right away in the Sand Kingdom, the game puts your Bullet Bill skills to the test by winding you through tight corners and roundabouts. 10. T-Rex Odyssey does a great job of mixing its art styles. Mario is a human, but he’s a different sort of human than the ones who populate the Metro Kingdom. Bowser is a dragon, but not like the Game of Thrones -esque dragon of the Ruined Kingdom. And Yoshi is a dinosaur, but not like the monstrous, reptilian death machine you meet in the Cascade Kingdom. The T-Rex in Odyssey is the rough equivalent of the New Super Mario Bros. Mega Mushroom. It plows through barriers and enemies alike. Unfortunately, the T-Rex has a timer. It’s the only captured creature who will kick Mario out of its body if he lingers too long. 9. Lava Bubble The Luncheon Kingdom is a series of narrow spaces and cramped platforms. It’s the least fun of all the game’s worlds, because there is more lava in the level than land. That’s exactly why the Lava Bubble transformation feels so liberating. You can swim and dive in the lava instead of delicately tiptoeing around it. Later, you defeat the Luncheon Kingdom’s Cookatiel bird by transforming into a Lava Bubble and launching yourself at your opponent’s head. 8. Chargin’ Chuck The toughest baddie in Super Mario World was the Chargin’ Chuck—a football gear-clad Koopa that required multiple head stomps to defeat. In Odyssey, he makes the most of his limited screen time by charging through a barrage of boulders. The developers use a low angle shot to emphasize your size and strength as every obstacle turns to dust around you. You know that seat-of your-pants feeling in Uncharted 2, when you’re barely staying ahead of the road as it collapses behind you? This sequence conjures the same epic sweep. 7. Banzai Bill The Banzai Bill is used in Mario games for its shock factor; the point is to appear huge and imposing. Its first appearance was in Super Mario World, where it appeared in the very first level. Since then, Banzai Bills appear almost exclusively in the final levels of Mario games. In Odyssey, the Banzai Bills surprise you by breaking through massive brick walls. Once you possess one, you’re able to bust through walls too. After so many years of running and cowering from these things, it’s a thrill to finally control one. 6. Goomba The humble, disarmingly cute Goomba’s defining quality in Odyssey is its stackability. You can create a massive, improbably tall Goomba towers to reach high places. Late in the game, one particular puzzle requires you to stack ten Goombas to earn a Power Moon. The other defining Goomba characteristic is that it’s surefooted; it can walk over ice-covered floors without slipping into a nearby pit. Most of the baddie transformations have a single function, but the Goombas have multiple functions depending on their environment. They’re understated but essential, which is in keeping with their character. 4. Tie: Cheep Cheep, Cheep Cheep Snow Kingdom Water levels are, by and large, the weakest parts of any Mario game. The franchise’s strength is its on-land platforming; Mario is at his slowest and clumsiest in the water. This is why the Frog Suit in Super Mario Bros 3 was such a prized commodity. It evened the playing field between Mario and the more nimble sea life that attacked him. When you possess a Cheep Cheep for the first time in the Lake Kingdom, you get a bit of that Frog Suit feeling. You can finally swim with fluidity, attack instead of avoid, and not worry about your oxygen supply. When you go to the Snow Kingdom, you don’t have to worry about freezing to death either. Odyssey, unlike many other Mario games, is exploratory and meant to be played at a leisurely pace. In the numerous water-based kingdoms, the Cheep Cheep allows that to happen. 3. Gushen The Cheep Cheep moves at a decent clip, but the quickest water transport is the Gushen, which shoots water to propel itself across the water’s surface like a jet ski. The Gushen can also shoot water straight down, which launches it skywards. Once in midair, you can shoot horizontally and fly for a brief period. Once you run out of water, you’ll drop back down to Earth. As the Gushen, you have to keep track of how much water you have left, which you replenish by touching the water again. The Gushen is exclusive to the Seaside Kingdom, and it’s useful no matter where on the map you go. It’s essential to beating the level’s final boss, a massive lava octopus called a Mollusque-Lanceur. 2. Bowser Possessing Bowser just makes sense. The Mario developers have a habit of repurposing a game’s core mechanic into the final boss showdown. In Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins, Mario faced a rabbit-eared Wario. In Super Mario 64, Mario attacked Bowser by running around him, grabbing him by his tail, and swinging him, which highlighted the game’s innovative 3D perspective. More recently in Super Mario 3D World, Bowser donned a Super Bell and became Meowser for the final chase sequence. The entire transformation sequence in Odyssey is an amalgamation of old and new. As Mario and Bowser’s minds become one, you see a rapid flash of previous Bowser battles through the years. And when you finally get to control Bowser, it’s everything you wanted. You can claw. You can breathe fire. And when you briefly enter 2D mode, you even get to play as 8-bit Bowser, with 8-bit Peach perched on your shoulder. 1. Pokio Bowser is incredible to use, but he serves a single, brief purpose: to break everything in front of him and get the hell out of Dodge. Small and slow Pokio, on the other hand, has weaknesses in addition to strengths. The needle-nosed bird is balanced, which gives it a depth of play that the other transformations lack. Pokio’s attack is a straightforward sword lance. It can kill enemies and repel obstacles, but since it hugs close to the ground, the target also must be rolling or walking towards Pokio. It has to jump or time its stabs to account for jumping enemies or bouncing obstacles, such as the bombs during the Mecha Broodal battle. Pokio can also poke into a wall, bend its lance, launch itself, and then poke into the wall again—sort of like a self-climbing ice axe. It requires a little practice to use well, but it’s a fair challenge. Most of the transformations make Odyssey ’s gameplay significantly easier; they serve as hard counters to whatever challenges await. But the Pokio manages something more impressive: it gives you the tools to succeed, but not to dominate. It immerses you deeper into the world, rather than providing a “win button” that removes you from it. Agree? Disagree?

Associated Press,"DETROIT — General Motors' plans to lay off 14,000 salaried and blue-collar workers might not be quite as bad as originally projected. The company said Friday that 2,700 out of the 3,300 U.S. factory jobs slated for elimination will now be saved. Blue-collar workers will still lose jobs at four U.S. plants slated for closure next year, but most will be able to find employment at eight other GM factories where jobs are being added. Some would have to relocate. GM still plans to lay off about 8,000 white-collar workers and another 2,600 factory workers in Canada. In November, the company announced plans to end production at the U.S. factories and one in Ontario as part of a major restructuring designed to cut costs and divert resources to development and manufacturing of trucks, SUVs and electric and autonomous vehicles. Legislators and President Donald Trump have hammered GM over the moves. While some of the roughly 3,300 U.S. factory workers will retire, most of the rest will be offered one of 2,700 jobs the company plans to add at factories where production will increase, GM announced on Friday. Some would have to uproot and move to other cities for jobs. ""Our focus remains on providing interested employees options to transition including job opportunities at other GM plants,"" CEO Mary Barra said in a statement of the factory workers. That still leaves the majority of the 14,000 cuts hitting white-collar workers. A small number of them will be able to transfer to other openings, and those who can't will get help in finding work elsewhere, the company said. Since the announcement, GM has faced withering criticism from Trump, legislators from the affected states and the United Auto Workers union, largely over the plant closure plans. Trump has focused on a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that's slated to stop making compact cars on March 1. He has promised to return factory jobs to the U.S. and Ohio, a key state in his 2020 re-election campaign. GM is cutting six car models as buyers have dramatically shifted their preferences to SUVs and trucks, which will account for about 70 percent of new-vehicle sales this year. Just six years ago, that number was 51 percent, and now GM is left with too many factories making cars. The automaker's attempt to close the factories still has to be negotiated with the United Auto Workers union, which has promised to fight back. The other factories that could go are assembly plants in Detroit and Oshawa, Ontario, and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and near Baltimore. Trump continued to blast GM and Barra in an interview with Fox News on Thursday. ""I don't like what she did,"" Trump said. ""It was nasty. Ohio is going to replace those jobs in two minutes."" The announcement that nearly all the blue-collar workers may get other GM jobs could counter some of the attacks, but it's unlikely to stop them completely since GM still intends to halt production at the factories. Tommy Wolikow, 36, who was laid off from the Lordstown, Ohio, factory in January of 2017, said he would be interested in openings at a Toledo, Ohio, transmission factory and a plant in Tennessee. But he's not happy about the prospect of moving. ""I want to go back to Lordstown,"" he said. ""The last thing I want to do is uproot my family and leave my parents."" Under GM's contract with the union, the more senior active workers at the four factories targeted for closure get first crack at transferring to another plant, and there may not be enough jobs for workers with less seniority who were previously laid off. Of the 3,300 factory workers slated to lose their jobs, 2,800 are active and 500 are on leave. In addition, there are about 830 who were laid off previously at the Lordstown and Detroit plants. Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM, said Friday's job announcement had nothing to do with the criticism the company has been facing. The automaker, he said, knew some of the laid-off workers would be placed at other plants, but it didn't know the number of jobs available until this week. ""We have opportunities for just about everybody who wants them,"" Morrissey said. Morrissey said the number of workers placed in new posts depends a lot on how many of the senior workers decide to retire. About 1,200 are eligible. Some workers also could decide they don't want to relocate. Wolikow is sure if he has enough time in with GM to get a transfer to another plant. He has found work as a diesel engine technician, but it pays $10 per hour less than the $28 per hour plus profit sharing that he'd be making if he was still working for GM. ""It's hard not to follow the money,"" he said. ""You know that you can make a great living, have a great career."" GM said jobs will be added mainly at truck and SUV plants including about 1,000 positions at a Flint, Michigan, factory that makes heavy-duty pickup trucks. GM wouldn't release exact numbers but said several hundred will be added at each of five assembly plants in Arlington, Texas; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Lansing, Michigan. In addition, jobs will be added at a transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio. Another 50 will be added at a casting plant in Bedford, Indiana. Dave Green, president of the auto workers local at the Lordstown plant, says he's still hoping the factory can stay open by getting a new vehicle to build. The future of the plants will be part of the UAW's national contract negotiations next year. The job transfers will help laid-off workers but will do nothing for the area of Northeast Ohio which has been devastated by job losses over the years, Green said. ""Some people do have the opportunity to move, but it's extremely disruptive, and it does nothing to help or support the communities that are left behind,"" he said.

Health insurers are reporting unprecedented growth in the number of seniors flocking to private Medicare Advantage plans amid talk of a single payer government-run approach that could uproot such coverage.
The same week U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) made news with her support for Medicare for All, insurers Anthem&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Cigna reported strong growth from Medicare Advantage, private coverage sold via contracts with the federal government.
Anthems Medicare Advantage enrollment jumped by 35% to more than 1 million at the end of 2018 compared to 746,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, the operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans reported last week. Our individual Medicare Advantage business is on track to achieve our mid-double digit growth target, Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux told analysts during the companys fourth quarter earnings call last week. In total, we estimate our Medicare Advantage growth will exceed 20% by the end of 2019.
Meanwhile, Cigna reported Friday that its Medicare Advantage enrollment was up one percent to 436,000 from 432,000 and UnitedHealth Group ended 2018 with 4.9 million Medicare Advantage enrollees, which was up nearly 12% from 4.4 million at the end of 2017. Other insurers including&amp;nbsp;Aetna, which is now part of CVS Health, are expected to report higher Medicare Advantage enrollment later this month after these plans expanded into new markets.
The industry is tapping into&amp;nbsp;a market of more than 10,000 baby boomers aging into the Medicare population every day . The insurers that have reported 2018 earnings thus far are reporting overall industry growth thats slightly ahead of the projected record growth the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) predicted for Medicare Advantage last fall. We completed a strong Medicare Advantage enrollment season . . . and are on track to achieve 2019 growth within the 400,000 to 450,000 range of expectations, Steve Nelson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealths insurance business told analysts two weeks ago.
Medicare Advantage plans contract with the federal government to provide extra benefits and services to seniors, such as disease management and nurse help hotlines,&amp;nbsp;with some even providing vision and dental care and wellness programs. CMS is changing regulations to allow Medicare Advantage plans to provide broader coverage in the future, which is also expected to boost enrollment. L.E.K. has projected Medicare Advantage enrollment will rise to 38 million, or 50% market penetration by the end of 2025.
As seniors flock to Medicare Advantage, analysts say its going to make it difficult for Democrats on the presidential campaign trail to support a Medicare for All approach that would bring an end to the private insurers role.
The insurance industry worries most about so-called single payer forms of health insurance that would conceivably replace the private insurers role with a government-administered form of coverage. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has espoused the single payer approach for years but the Medicare for All Act of 2017 that he, Harris and others supported does mention the ability to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan.
Americas Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby that includes Anthem, Cigna and other insurers that sell Medicare Advantage, said Americans dont want a a one-size-fits-all health care system.
Today, health insurance providers deliver coverage that is working for hundreds of millions of Americans including 180 million Americans who are covered through an employer, 20 million covered through Medicare Advantage, 55 million covered through Medicaid managed care, and 20 million who buy their own coverage, AHIP spokeswoman Kristine Grow said.
The vast majority of these 300 million Americans are satisfied with their existing coverage,&amp;quot; Grow added. &amp;quot;One of the reasons they like their coverage is it provides them with choice and control. Health care is personal all Americans are unique individuals with different health care needs depending on their stage of life, where they live, their income and resources, and physical and mental health. People should be able to get the care they need, when they need it, at a cost they can afford.

Martha Ross,"January 2018 has not been a kind month to Melania Trump, what with a number of high-profile humiliations capped by a report that her husband Donald Trump paid off a porn star to keep silent about an alleged affair. Reportedly “blindsided” and “furious” by the report about porn star Stormy Daniels, Melania Trump last week opted to not accompany the president on his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the New York Times reported. At the time, her East Wing spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham cited “scheduling and logistical issues” for the First Lady skipping the Davos trip. But it turns out that those “scheduling and logistical issues” included an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum last Thursday, followed by a whirlwind trip to her husband’s Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach, Florida resort, where she visited the spa, the New York Times said. We recognize International #HolocaustRemembranceDay so that #WeRemember all the innocent men, women, and children lost. May we continue to educate our children on one of history’s most devastating events and always #AskWhy. pic.twitter.com/dzTQqLmlGA — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) January 27, 2018 By the way, that quick trip — leaving Thursday and returning Friday — possibly cost American taxpayers at least $64,000, the Times said. The two-hour trip, aboard a C-32A plane, from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to Palm Beach International Airport, cost $16,168 per hour, the Times said, citing Department of Defense figures. That brings the total roundtrip travel costs to around $64,600, according to those figures. Perhaps by skipping Davos and heading down to Mar-a-Lago for some spa therapy, Melania Trump thought she was sending her husband, or the rest of the world, a message that she wasn’t pleased with the Daniels news — or that she’s her own person, or something. Grisham on Friday fiercely denied much of the speculation about the First Lady’s reaction to the Daniels news, or about the state of the first couple’s marriage, writing on Twitter, “The laundry list of salacious &amp; flat-out false reporting about Mrs. Trump by tabloid publications &amp; TV shows has seeped into ‘main stream media’ reporting. She is focused on her family &amp; role as FLOTUS — not the unrealistic scenarios being peddled daily by the fake news.” BREAKING:The laundry list of salacious &amp; flat-out false reporting about Mrs. Trump by tabloid publications &amp; TV shows has seeped into “main stream media” reporting. She is focused on her family &amp; role as FLOTUS – not the unrealistic scenarios being peddled daily by the fake news. — Stephanie Grisham (@StephGrisham45) January 26, 2018 But the reported costs of Melania Trump’s air travel — for a possible spa day — could bring another round of bad publicity and more humiliations to the Slovenian-born former model, who has sometimes appeared to struggle in her role as First Lady. In any case, since her return to Washington D.C., she has presumably been preparing to appear at the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Melania Trump would be at the address, signaling some kind of show of support for her husband. The Times describes the State of the Union as “the most high-profile appearance of the year for First Ladies.” In a statement at the White House Monday, Sanders said Melania Trump would sit in her own box in the Capitol with 15 guests. The guests include the parents of girls murdered by the MS-13 gang in New York and a special agent for a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security unit that investigates the MS-13 gang. The guests of first ladies at the State of the Union speech typically represent a president’s achievements and the agenda he hopes to focus on in his speech, CNN said. Meet some of the special guests that will be seated with @FLOTUS at the President’s first #SOTU address: https://t.co/6LnqMwh29X pic.twitter.com/YlfDl7LROS — The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 29, 2018 All the president’s children, except for 11-year-old Barron Trump, also will attend the address. But among the president’s family, the attention will likely be on Melania Trump, whose bad month started with the release of Michael Wolff’s controversial book about the inner workings of Trump’s White House. The book described Mrs. Trump as not being thrilled by her husband’s election. It also portrayed her as a “non-presence” in the White House during Trump’s first few months in office. It’s true that Melania Trump stayed in New York until the summer, saying she didn’t want to uproot Barron in the middle of the school year. But since she moved to Washington D.C., Wolff’s book and other reports have described her appearances at public events as “sporadic.” Melania Trump also hasn’t been seen much in public since Jan. 12. That’s when the Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen had arranged the $130,000 payout to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Trump’s alleged affair, which he and Daniels denied through Trump’s attorney, reportedly started at a Lake Tahoe celebrity golf tournament in July 2006. When Trump and Clifford met, Trump and Melania had been married for about 18 months and were parents to their new baby boy, Barron. The Journal story opened the proverbial floodgates of reports from other outlets that had interviewed Clifford prior to the alleged payout, which occurred in the month before the 2016 election. In those accounts, Clifford said that there had been a consensual sexual relationship with Trump. Of course, the Daniels revelations wouldn’t be the first time Melania Trump has had to endure reports that her husband pursued other women during the time they have been a couple, including before their January 2005 marriage. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, multiple women came forward to allege that Trump harassed or assaulted them over the years. The president was also caught on a leaked “Access Hollywood” tape boasting about grabbing women’s genitals. As much as Melania Trump puts on a brave face at the State of the Union, more humiliation could follow with Daniels getting more of the spotlight later Tuesday when she appears as a guest on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” On the one-year anniversary of Trump’s inauguration, Daniels also kicked off her “Make America Horny Again” tour at a South Carolina strip club. Could Daniels use her interview with Kimmel as an opportunity to reveal more about her association with the president? Various reports describe the normally reclusive Melania Trump as being particularly elusive the past few weeks, including over whether she would be at the State of the Union address. She did attempt a unifying message on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with a tweet that spoke of her pride in being first lady “of a nation that continually strives for equality &amp; justice for all.” But that tweet massively backfired, coming a few days after the president reportedly disparaged Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations as “s–thole” countries in an immigration meeting with lawmakers. There was some speculation that Melania was signaling distance between her and her husband in the way she marked the one-year anniversary of his 2017 inauguration. She tweeted an image and message to mark the occasion. But as reports noted, the image did not include a photo of the president. It just showed herself with a military escort. This has been a year filled with many wonderful moments.

Reuters,"TOKYO — Carlos Ghosn said Nissan executives opposed to his plans for closer ties with automaking partner Renault SA resorted to ""plot and treason"" to disrupt them and were behind the financial misconduct allegations against him.
Speaking to the Nikkei newspaper in his first media interview since his arrest on Nov. 19, Ghosn said he had discussed plans to integrate the companies with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa in September.
But Nissan executives employed ""plot and treason"" to uproot those plans, Ghosn said.
Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese corporation.
He remains in detention following his arrest and indictment on charges related to breach of trust and understating his salary.
His arrest has clouded the outlook for closer ties between Nissan and Renault, along with Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the third member of the automaking alliance
Since his arrest, Saikawa has said it was not the time to discuss revising the partners' complex capital ties. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors have dismissed Ghosn as chairman, while he has resigned from the helm at Renault.
Ghosn denied accusations of improper payments to a company run by a Saudi businessman, saying the payment had been approved by a Nissan executive.
Ghosn also called accusations by both Nissan and Mitsubishi that he received nearly 8 million euros in improper payment through a Dutch-based joint venture of the two automakers ""a distortion of reality,"" and argued his luxury residences in Rio de Janeiro and Beirut were approved by Nissan's legal department.
Nissan has said it was not aware that it had paid for many of Ghosn's properties. On Wednesday, a spokesman said that the company was unable to comment on Ghosn's legal defense.
Ghosn, in the 20-minute interview, denied that his tenure at Nissan had been a ""dictatorship.""
""People translated strong leadership to dictator, to distort reality"" for the ""purpose of getting rid of me,"" he said.
Ghosn added that his health was fine, and that he wouldn't flee if freed on bail.
Meanwhile, NHK reported that Saikawa plans to hold his first face-to-face discussion with new Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard on the sidelines of an alliance meeting in the Netherlands on Thursday.

Naomi Zeveloff,"Israel is in the midst of an ambitious mass-transit project, a new light-rail network serving the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, where 44 percent of Israelis live. The system is expected to provide half a million trips a day and save hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon emissions annually. But the project has drawn the ire of environmentalists, who say it threatens a precious resource: Tel Aviv’s towering, glossy-leafed ficus trees. Planted decades ago along the city’s wide boulevards, these trees are an iconic part of the streetscape, central to the city’s early identity as a European-style settlement in the Middle East. In a 1974 photo, men relax in the shade of a ficus tree in Jaffa. (Moshe Milner/Israeli Government Press Office) For three years, environmental groups, residents, and Tel Aviv University students rallied to save the ficus trees lining Jerusalem Boulevard in Jaffa, the mixed Jewish-Arab neighborhood of Tel Aviv. A Facebook group called “Save The Trees on Jerusalem Boulevard,” with more than 700 members, served as a hub for strategizing and communication. An online petition to “cancel the death sentence” of the trees garnered 2,172 signatures. The movement received frequent coverage in the Israeli press. In one act of protest, activists pinned traditional Hebrew mourning notices to the trees, alerting passersby to the “untimely death of the street ficus.” (In Israel, such activism has precedent: In the 1930s Tel Aviv poet Yehuda Karni published eulogies for every tree removed by the municipality, according to a book by the late Israeli historian Natan Dunevich.) Roughly 12,000 trees of different varieties (including ficus) stand in the path of the four planned light-rail lines. The NTA, the government company that is building the system, cannot say how many it will uproot in total, but thousands are already slated for removal. On the first line, the Red Line, which will connect Tel Aviv and four other small neighboring cities and is scheduled to open in 2021, the NTA has been authorized by the Israeli government to take down 3,000 trees. In their place, 6,000 new trees will be planted. But environmental groups are against the policy of replacing existing trees with new ones, saying that it fails to take into account the historical value of the ficus trees. They also contend that the new trees will never match the scale of the originals, which, planted when Tel Aviv was a less-developed city, had ample room to spread roots. The substitute trees will be hemmed in by urban density, unable, as one activist put it, to “express their potential.” (The NTA counters this claim. A spokesperson, Galit Porat, said that in 10 to 20 years the new trees will match the height of the originals.) The conservation group Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel says that Tel Aviv doesn’t do enough prioritize its trees. According to data SPNI acquired from the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality, in 2017 the city cut down more than three times the number of trees it planted (around 1,750 versus 500). “You cannot pretend you are doing sustainable development and planning if you cut all the trees,” said Philippe Brandes, an Israeli urban planner involved in the effort to save ficus trees. “That is the thing you start with; you preserve the green heritage.” Brandes was instrumental in what the environmentalists are calling their first win: the salvaging of 26 ficus trees on Jaffa’s Jerusalem Boulevard. According to Vered Navon, a photographer working on a book about the boulevard, the trees were planted in the 1950s, likely part of a bid to make Jaffa—once a Palestinian cultural center that was largely depopulated around Israel’s founding—look more like Tel Aviv. Navon’s forthcoming book includes a 1957 photo of Jerusalem Boulevard with the then-diminutive ficus trees. Those same trees are now four stories tall, covering the street in a rich, green canopy. After environmentalists learned that the NTA planned to remove the 26 trees, Brandes created an alternative plan showing that they could be saved by moving three stations a few dozen yards each. In early October, ahead of municipal elections in which the trees threatened to become a major campaign issue, the NTA said that, while it wasn’t adopting Brandes’s proposal, it would no longer need to uproot the trees to build the light rail. The NTA rejects the idea that it caved to activist pressure. In an interview near a work site, where a large panel with a cartoon beaver in a hard hat (the company’s mascot) shielded the construction from the street, spokesperson Porat said that the NTA’s plans on Jerusalem Boulevard “never changed.” In her version of the story, the NTA realized it could spare the trees as part of its process of refining plans ahead of construction. But Tel Aviv environmentalists are claiming victory, and hope to replicate their success elsewhere along the transit lines. In late December, construction started on the first section of the Purple Line along Arlozorov Street, another ficus-lined thoroughfare in central Tel Aviv. This time, activists have taken their campaign all the way to the Israeli government’s forestry department, which provides the authorization for tree removal. It appears to be working: According to a planner with the department, just days ago it ordered the NTA to spare 28 of the 77 trees it wanted removed on the initial section of the Purple Line. (Like the NTA, the forestry department denies that it yielded to pressure.) When asked if the NTA will do anything different to accommodate residents’ concerns about trees after the Jerusalem Boulevard fight, Porat said: “We are very happy with the positive dialogue and will be happy to continue [it].” A Tel Aviv bridge was demolished in a controlled explosion in 2015 to make way for the city's light rail. (Tsafrir Abayov/AP) The fight over the trees is a reflection of the complexity of the project. While cities in other countries incorporated mass transit early on, Israel failed to implement previous plans, leaving the NTA with the unenviable task of fitting a light rail and future subway into the fully built area of Tel Aviv and its environs. Porat called the planned system—which promises to double the use of public transit in the Tel Aviv area, from 20 to 40 percent—a way for Israel to “catch up with the rest of the world.” Galia Hanoch-Roe, the director of the Tel Aviv branch of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, sees the mass-transit system as a “very important environmental solution.” But she believes it doesn’t have to come at the expense of Tel Aviv’s ecological heritage. Her advice to the NTA? “Look at the trees as infrastructure.”",Construction of a new light-rail system could uproot trees that activists say help define the Israeli city.,2019-01-09T15:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Citylab.com'}",Why Activists Are Fighting to Save Tel Aviv’s Ficus Trees,https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/01/tel-aviv-activists-new-light-rail-jaffa-save-ficus-trees/579742/,https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2019/01/tel_aviv_ficus_trees/facebook.jpg?1546971142,,Citylab.com,uproot,1
Mary K. Mohler,"I’ll never forget one woman in my class on the calling to be a ministry wife. I always ask students what excites and concerns them most. Here’s what she said: I am most concerned that I will become like my mother. She is a bitter ministry wife. She and my dad have been through some rough times. She is doing a little better but has a long way to go. She has been miserable for as long as I can remember. What a tragic statement for a daughter to make. Thankfully, she recognized bitterness for what it is and was resolved to avoid it. If only more ministry wives resolved to avoid resentment. But sadly, Satan is cunning. He knows if he can get bitterness to take root and sprout like a tenacious weed, it won’t be long before it’s in full bloom and choking out good plants that would otherwise thrive. These weeds must be pulled out and killed. Let’s consider how they got there, what the Bible says about them, and how we can defeat resentment and prevent it from being a perennial threat. Resentment Can Come in All Shapes and Sizes Resentment can build in an number of ways. Sometimes, young wives are naïve about the demands of ministry. They expect conflict in the world—but not in the church. They expect other pastors to have problems—but not theirs. Then they enter the ministry and suffer years of bad experiences, and they become more and more bitter. This isn’t what I signed up for, they think. Other ministry wives weren’t naïve but were never really excited about this whole ministry endeavor in the first place. They see the church as their husband’s vocation, not theirs. When his time is in high demand, they’re resentful because ministry always seems to interfere with the family’s plans. This doesn’t go well. Still others are so thin-skinned that any criticism is considered a call to arms. They become suspicious of church members who are friendly to those who have raised issues. They’re reluctant to develop friendships in the church due to their fear of being betrayed. They’ve been used before, and the resulting bitterness is alive and well. All these scenarios spell disaster for the pastor’s wife. All are great ways for Satan to gain access as he “prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Pet. 5:8). All must be dealt with honestly using the straight edge of God’s Word. Put Away Bitterness Pastors’ wives can reduce resentment when they have realistic expectations. We must remember that the church is full of redeemed sinners, and we’ll continue to fall short until we’re together with Christ in glory. It serves no purpose to be filled with resentment about the bad behavior of others. Every pastor’s wife should memorize this: Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (Eph. 4:31–32) These verses are clear. It doesn’t say let most bitterness be put away. It says all. I realize this is easier said than done. But the second verse is what motivates us. God in Christ has forgiven us. What profound gratitude we have to God for forgiving us and restoring us to a right relationship with him. This gratitude should always be in the forefront of our minds, and it should make us want to show Christ’s love. It looks like this: Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful. (1 Cor. 13:4) When someone questions our husbands’ decisions, or says unkind things about us behind our backs, or misrepresents what we said, we aren’t supposed to insist on our own way, or to be irritable or resentful. This doesn’t mean we don’t stand for truth of the gospel. Let’s be clear that if the issue is a first-order doctrinal matter, we’ll be unable to continue fellowship in the same church or ministry. But many times, it’s over issues like the color of the carpet. With time, many of the wounds created from these encounters can heal, and we can learn from them. I’ve seen ministries ruined by wives of leaders who refuse to crawl out the shroud of bitterness. But we must always be mindful of the potential of resentment and bitterness to destroy. Prayerfully resolve to banish them from your heart. Seek trusted friends who will hold you accountable and candidly tell you if they see the root of bitterness sprouting and springing. If it has already sprouted, pray fervently for the Lord to do whatever it takes to free you from the hold it has on you. This is serious business. I’ve seen ministries ruined by wives of leaders who refuse to crawl out the shroud of bitterness. Pray for Your People It’s vital for you to pray for your husband, the leader. You know him better than anyone. He’s sometimes in a difficult position as sensitive situations arise that he can’t publicly discuss. People then rush to judgment and assume they know the whole story when they clearly don’t. I’ve seen this play out dozens of times in my decades as a ministry wife. Trust your husband to give you the details you need to know about a given conflict. Be sure to keep confidences even when you would love to set people straight. That’s not your job. Instead, pray for people. Pray hard. Pray for them by name—the supportive ones and the difficult ones. Then trust our sovereign Lord to handle all things. That same passage that warns about Satan prowling has a glorious conclusion: And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

Reuters Editorial,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces have killed 12 suspected militants in raids on their hideouts in north Sinai, state news agency MENA reported on Sunday, the latest in a campaign to uproot armed Islamists behind a wave of violence in the area. The deaths raised to at least 325 the number of suspected militants killed in the Sinai campaign which began in February, according to a Reuters count based on military statements. At least 35 military personnel have also been killed. The state news agency said security forces came under fire when they raided a walled compound in al-Arish, the capital of North Sinai province, without giving a time frame for the incident. It said the raiding forces responded in kind and 12 suspected militants were killed in the shootout. The authorities were trying to verify their identities. Five rifles, four of them automatic guns, were recovered from the scene as well as some ammunition and two ready-to-use bombs, MENA said. There were no reports of casualties among security forces. Sisi was re-elected in March in a landslide victory against one opponent seen as a token candidate. His critics say his presidency has brought a harsh crackdown on dissent, but supporters argue the measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

Anne Gherini,"There is something soothing about the sound of ocean waves, the smell of salt water, and the feeling of warm sand beneath our toes. Having grown up near the beach, I always classified my happiness on the beach as no more than nostalgia. Yet recent studies prove that a beach-type environment can have a profound impact on our brains and mental health. Although few people deny the importance of brain health, most of us don't focus as much effort on taking care of our brains as we do our bodies. The misnomer that physical fitness trumps mental health is at our detriment. The reality is that we need balance, both mentally and physically. Numerous studies help us appreciate why the beach may be the premier destination for us to unwind and recharge our minds. Some researchers have gone so far as to conclude that individuals who live by a beach have better physical and mental health. Listen to Crashing Waves Several months ago I partook in a deprivation float (the practice that many superstars such as, Steph Curry swear by). As my mind reached a meditative state, I could not help but hear a sound similar to that of waves crashing gently on the beach. This repetitive sound that was created as a result of my rhythmic breaths and my ears being submerged in salt water instantly put me at ease. ""These slow, whooshing noises are the sounds of non-threats, which is why they work to calm people,"" says Orfeu Buxton, an associate professor of biobehavioral health at Pennsylvania State University. ""It's like they're saying: ""Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry."" The sound of waves can help you achieve a meditative state, which is proven to heal and strengthen your brain. Remove the Blues Studies have shown that different colors often produce different psychological, emotional, and physical effects. The color blue, for instance, is often used in marketing material to convey a sense of calmness. The Global Healing Center advises individuals to actually surround themselves in blue as a way to reduce stress. According to Richard Shuster, PsyD, clinical psychologist, he agrees that blue has a profound calming effect on people. ""Staring at the ocean actually changes our brain waves' frequency and puts us into a mild meditative state,"" says Shuster. Smell the Ocean Mist When you first step out on the sand and allow your lungs to be filled with salty misty air, your brain may be receiving instant benefits. The negative ions (oxygen ions with an extra electron attached, produced via water molecules) in the ocean air can actually help calm your brain. Negative ions have been shown to have a pronounced anti-depressant effect as well. As early as 1932, American research engineer Dr. Clarence Hansell noticed that the mood of one of his colleagues fluctuated in response to the type of ions - cheerful when subjected to positive ions and gloomy when subjected to negative ones. Subsequent studies have found that the act of negatively ionized air -- the kind you receive when you get outside for a gulp of fresh air -- can alleviate symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Feel the Sand Between Your Toes Grounding, otherwise known as walking barefoot, has been proven to have a number of stimulating benefits to our bodies and minds. The reason is that our feet contain a rich network of nerves and acupuncture points. Our feet are able to absorb free ions on the earth surface in much the same way that our lungs are able to absorb ions in the air. A report in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine shed some more light on these benefits. The earth is negatively charged, so when you walk barefoot, you're connecting your body to a negatively charged supply of energy. The result is one that many of us feel as soon as we kick off our shoes. Walking barefoot on the beach can trigger tingling warm sensations produced as a result of us grounding to earth. ""There are all these cognitive and emotional benefits that we derive every time we spend time by water"" said Wallace J. Nichols, a marine biologist and best-selling author of the Blue Mind. ""Once you get into it, you realize that it's chemistry, it's biology, it's physiology. It's deeply personal but it's also strong science."" In 2012, a University of Exeter study found that simply living within close proximity to a beach improves one's health and wellbeing. While it may be unreasonable for some of us to uproot and move to a beach town, prioritizing getting outdoors and connecting with the earth will still help you stay mentally fit.",Numerous scientific studies have shown that the beach has multiple benefits to the body and the mind.,2017-11-20T21:52:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","How the Beach Benefits Your Brain, According to Science",https://www.inc.com/anne-gherini/how-beach-benefits-your-brain-according-to-science.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_521082088_331807.jpg,,Inc.com,uproot,1
"Kris Putnam-Walkerly, Contributor, Kris Putnam-Walkerly, Contributor https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisputnamwalkerly/","What to do to beat it back — or stop it before it even starts. We often hear about streamlining philanthropy — mostly with regard to efforts at simplifying grant applications, approval processes and reporting requirements. Streamlining is great. But when it comes to philanthropic bureaucracy, sometimes what we really need is a bulldozer.&amp;nbsp;Some bureaucratic processes are so ridiculous, they just need to be demolished. It’s time we got over ourselves and got on with the work and the focus on impact. Here’s a great example of philanthropic bureaucracy: 300-page board dockets. Imagine the joy on the board members’ faces when they receive those reams of paper in the mail. Imagine the hours and hours of foundation staff time that went into those reams of paper. Now, do you really think that anyone actually sits down and reads them? You can recognize when it’s time for demolition. You might need to start tearing down your internal processes if you are: Releasing proposal guidelines that are 14 pages long, single-spaced (for grant proposals that cannot exceed 8 pages) Giving four internal departments one week each to approve an RFP Requiring a minimum of 90 days to approve a grant and send the check, regardless of the priority or emergency nature of the grant Forcing a consultant or partner to send 14 follow-up emails and leave four voice messages before approving a contract that you requested and that is time sensitive Delaying interaction with the outside world (partners, grantees, consultants, in-laws) because you’re consumed by a three-month budgeting process Telling your vendors it will take two weeks for a staff person to approve a payment (when really it takes two minutes) If these sound familiar to you, here are three ways to demolish bureaucracy before it destroys your impact: 1. Conduct a bureaucracy-breaker audit. Gather a team and take an honest look at the practices and processes that you currently use. Where do they begin to lose their effectiveness because they are overcome by complexity or complications? How are the requirements or requests of one department hindering another? What can you do to remove needless requirements, approvals or other steps to streamline and get to effective outcomes more quickly and simply? 2. Commit to the 50% Principle. First, identify a single form of bureaucracy that currently clogs up the works in your foundation — maybe it takes eight months to make a grant, or you require at least three consultants to submit proposals before you hire the one you already know you should use or your board docket is two inches thick and no one will ever read it all. Then, brainstorm three things you can do to reduce it by half. What would it take to get grants out the door&amp;nbsp;in four months&amp;nbsp;instead of eight? How about if only one highly qualified consultant has to submit a proposal before you can hire her? And what unnecessary information and duplication can you remove to get your 200-page board docket down to 100 pages (or, better yet, 20 pages)? 3. Think like a two-year-old. As everyone knows, a two-year-old’s go-to question is “Why?” Tap into your inner child and apply this question to everything you do at your foundation. Are you about to make 14 copies of a grant proposal? Why? Are you about to send out an RFP for communications support when you already have a consultant you’re dying to work with? Why? Are you about to send your new grant guidelines to every internal department for review before you publish them? Why? Occasionally the answers to these questions deliver a satisfactory explanation, but what about the practices that have no good explanation? I encourage you to keep digging and keep asking why. You’re likely to uncover a false assumption upon which an entire bureaucracy has been constructed. These three steps can help you find the bureaucracy in your organization, but they are all contingent actions. You can only destroy bureaucracy after it has spread and caused the internal delays, blockages and poor customer service that are its hallmarks. How can you take preventive action to stop bureaucracy before it starts? Here are three solutions for keeping bureaucracy from sprouting in the first place. 1. Start out of the box. One new CEO at a new health conversion foundation decided to create innovative new practices that would streamline the operations right from the start. She polled other funders to find out about non-bureaucratic policies and practices they used that might be relevant to her own operation and then used that information to build her own bureaucracy-free system from the ground up. 2. Picture yourself as a supermodel. Ask yourself, “If this organization were to become a national model in effective [fill in the blank], what would that look like?” You can bet it would not look like a bloated government agency. Apply those attributes that are model-worthy and leave the rest behind. 3. Create a no-silo policy. Bureaucracy loves a silo. Isolated areas of work allow for bureaucracy to grow easily, and in return that bureaucracy reinforces a siloed structure. On the flip side, silos abhor open interaction and communication — so that should be a backbone of your no-bureaucracy operation. Open and frequent communication breaks down walls, streamlines processes and even sparks new and innovative ideas. I’ve been known to demolish some bureaucracy in my day, and I go after the task with gusto. But I’d prefer never to have to demolish anything in my own operation, or in those of the foundations and philanthropists I serve.

Johnson T A,"PM Narendra Modi at a rally in Kalaburagi on Wednesday. (PTI)
A coalition of opposition parties that is emerging ahead of the Lok Sabha polls is attempting root him out of power while he is trying to root out terrorism, poverty and corruption, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a BJP workers rally in the northern Karnataka city of Kalaburagi on Wednesday. They are coming together to remove Modi while Modi is working to uproot terrorism, poverty and corruption from the country, he said.
Modi said the Opposition parties are guided by selfish interests, and repeated the allegation at a rally in Tamil Nadus Kancheepuram later in the day.
When selfish politics is perpetrated by the Mahamilawat parties, the country will lose its strength. They think only about their own family and advancement. For their selfish ends they do not want to see a strong government in the country. They have created a weak government in Karnataka. They want to create the same situation in the country, he said in Kalaburagi.
Opposition parties are worried that their corrupt activities will be stopped if Modi is in power, he said. If the central government now sends one rupee from Delhi, the entire amount goes into the accounts of the poor. Nobody can grab the rights of the poor.
Unlike recent speeches delivered in the wake of the IAF strike in Pakistan, the PM dwelled more on the issue of corruption in his address.
Ahead of his address in Kalaburagi constituency, a Congress stronghold, the PM was hailed as the supreme commander or Maha Senani by local BJP leaders.
The PM remotely inaugurated a slew of projects during his visit. Congress MLA from Chincholi region of Kalaburagi, Umesh Jadhav, who resigned on Monday, was welcomed into the BJP by the PM.
At Kancheepuram, Modi said he was not bothered about threats against him. Citing a Karnataka Congress leaders remark on killing him, he said, Now one Congress leader talks of killing Modi, but I want to tell them I am not bothered about their threats and abuses. I am here to work.
Addressing the rally after the BJP inked a poll pact with AIADMK, he said: The careless conduct of the opposition on national security is well known… they are guided by politics and selfish interests. They neither want a strong India, nor strong armed forces.
Highlighting his backward class origins, he said that every drop of blood in his veins, every breath of mine, every second of my time is for India.
Acceding to the ruling partys demand, Modi said, We have decided to rename Chennai Central station after the great MGR.

Jagdeep Singh Deep,"Illegal mining at Khizrabad village in Mohali on Tuesday. (Express)
The residents of Khizrabad village have alleged that illegal sand mining is going on unabated in their village and the district authorities have not taken any action against it.
The residents also alleged that the illegal miners have uprooted trees on panchayat land for carrying out illegal mining.
On Monday, when I went to my fields, I saw that ten to twelve trees were lying uprooted on panchayat land. The trees were uprooted for making a temporary path, leading inside the fields, from where the miners dig up sand, Khizrabad resident, Gurwinder Singh, told Chandigarh Newsline.
He added that 13 acres of shamlat land (common land in the village), where illegal mining took place.
He alleged that despite the issue being reported to the local police, no action has been taken yet.
Navin Bansal, another resident of Khizrabad village, told Newsline that they also saw a JCB machine parked in the fields and the people operating the machine were outsiders.
They dug up the fields up to 40 to 50 feet over the last few months, despite our repeated requests to the district administration. Illegal mining continues in our village. We can not fight with these people as they could harm us, Bansal said.
Sher Mohammad, who lodged complaints regarding same in the past, said the villagers informed the district mining department as well as Majri police about the illegal mining in their village.
Two months ago, the mining officials sealed some crushers in the area as those crushers were operating illegally. Now the crushers have started operating again. We took up the issue of illegal sand mining, but to no avail, Sher Mohammad rued.
Khizrabad village, which is located around 10 km from Mullanpur Garibdas, is one of the most affected villages due to illegal sand mining in Kharar Sub-Division.
There is no approved mining sites in the entire sub-division despite the fact that illegal miners have dug up fields up to 40 to 50 feet in Khizrabad and neighbouring villages.
Kharar DSP Deep Kamal said he was yet to receive any complaint from the residents.
He added that after receiving a complaint, he will inform the mining department, verify claims and take suitable action.
Mohali Deputy Commissioner (DC) Gurpreet Kaur Sapra said she will check with the concerned officials.","Illegal mining goes on unabated in the village, no action taken by authorities despite the matter being reported.",2019-03-13T06:22:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}",Chandigarh: Khizrabad residents allege miners uproot trees in panchayat land for illegal mining,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/chandigarh-khizrabad-residents-allege-miners-uproot-trees-for-illegal-mining-5624015/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/03/mining-759.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,uproot,1

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the newly-appointed Congress general secretary of eastern Uttar Pradesh, took to roads of Lucknow Monday accompanied by brother Rahul Gandhi and senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia.
The nearly 25 km-long roadshow was aimed at establishing her presence in the politically crucial state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, after her official political debut last month. This was her maiden visit to the state capital post her appointment as a Congress functionary. FOLLOW CONGRESS LUCKNOW ROADSHOW HIGHLIGHTS HERE
Priyanka throughout the roadshow was seen waving at supporters, party workers and local onlookers as she stood atop the party bus surrounded by a cordon of security personnel. The show of strength in Lucknow holds significance as the grand old party has decided to venture alone in the state in the upcoming Lok Sabha election after it was snubbed by the combine of SP’s Akhilesh Yadav and BSP’s Mayawati. The two parties announced an alliance without the Congress, however, expressing that they will not place candidates on two Congress held bastions of Rae Bareli and Amethi.
Rahul Gandhi targets centre, vows to uproot BJP
Congress president Rahul Gandhi took the centre stage throughout the course of roadshow addressing the crowd at various stops targetting the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government over issues surrounding corruption, Rafale, employment and farm distress. Following the end of the roadshow, the Congress chief placed the responsibility of reviving Congress in UP on the shoulders of Priyanka and Scindia saying, “The hollowness within Modi ji has been exposed in front of India, its youth, farmers and the common people. Congress has no shortage of issues, fight with them on these issues and see the changes Congress goes through in UP.” He added that Congress respects Mayawati and Akhilesh ji but “we will fight with our best efforts in the state to change the politics in the state and fulfil the dreams of the youth in UP.” READ IN MALAYALAM

Gandhi urged Priyanka and Scinida to work with ground level workers of the party and bring them to forefront ahead of elections as they will get the party victory in the state. He reiterated the issues surrounding the Rafale deal and raised slogans of ‘Chowkidaar chor hai’ (the watchman is a thief), a reference he uses to attack the PM.
“Today people from Air Force and defence ministry say ‘Chowkidaar chor hai’.  PM Modi ended the corruption clause to give Rs 30000 crore to Anil Ambani and loot people of India. ‘Chowkidaar chor hai’ is resonating throughout the country,” he added.

Ray Lamont Staff Writer,"At a time when licensed businesses are venturing into selling recreational marijuana, Gloucester police are looking to crack down on a local resident who, based on evidence seized from his home last week, has allegedly been operating his own high-volume pot business.
Police responding to call for a well-being check on another person at a home on Western Avenue on Christmas night found more than 60 marijuana plants  over five times the legal limit. They seized the pot and are seeking the plants' apparent owner, whom they say has fled and is out of state.
Lt. Michael Gossom said Wednesday that the man, who is in his mid-20s, has not yet been formally charged or named by police. 
If and when the man is apprehended, he will face charges of illegal cultivation of a Class D substance, simple possession of marijuana, and possession with intent to distribute, in Gloucester District Court, Gossom said. He will also be charged with wrongly possessing edible marijuana products and the equipment used to make the edibles from the home-grown pot.
While marijuana is now legal for recreational use and sale in Massachusetts  and Gloucester is awaiting applications from businesses looking to sell or grow pot at various zoned locations within the city  individuals are limited to raising six marijuana plants on their property for their own use, with up to 12 plants allowed per household.
The more than 60 plants taken from the two-story house at 268 Western Ave. far exceeds those numbers, even though more than one person lives at the address, Gossom said. The home is owned by Sylvia Morrissey and her family, who also own property at 6 Middle St., according to city assessors' records. The suspect is not directly part of the ownership group, police indicated.
As far as police have been able to ascertain, the pot operation appears connected to just one person living at the address. But Gossom said the operation extends beyond the growing and cultivation project going on within the 4,122-square-foot, two-story home.
""We confiscated some business cards he had made up for himself to hand out (to clientele), as if it was a business, and we confiscated some ledgers,"" Gossom said. ""It seems like somebody kind of got carried away with what they can do legally and what they can't.""
Gossom said the case unfolded after police responding to the home for the Christmas night well-being check noted a few pot plants around the house, then observed a high number of plants growing throughout the home. While Sgt. Jerry Ciolino, Officers Dave D'Angelo and Alessandro D'Angelo  no relation  secured the scene, Gossom sought and was granted a search warrant for the premises. A full slate of officers then responded to remove the plants and other materials from the home.
Gossom said he and other police believe they know where the suspect is and are awaiting his return to the city to make an arrest.
He said it's not clear to whom the suspect has been marketing the pot, especially given the apparent seller's millennial age. State laws governing retail pot establishments ban the sale of any marijuana to anyone under the age of 21.    
Gossom said police are speaking with the office of Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett regarding how to proceed once the case heads to court. He conceded he's not surprised a resident would look to run a relatively high-volume and sophisticated marijuana business out of his home. He said he had no estimate for the street value of the pot that could be produced by the more than five dozen plants. 
""From a law enforcement standpoint, I know we don't really consider it a surprise,"" he said. ""When the law gives you a number of what you can have, I would say it's really easy for somebody to go over that number. So 12 (plants) can become 20, 20 become 40, 40 become 60 and so on. I'm not surprised at all.""

Arica L. Coleman,"When Starbucks closes 8,000 stores nationwide on Tuesday, the coffee chain’s employees will receive a day of anti-bias training. Though this is just one day — and, as many have argued, a single day seems insufficient to deal with racial bias that is inculcated in the American psyche — the event exposes a complicated but important factor at play in centuries of American history. The Starbucks move comes in response to an incident that took place last month at a Philadelphia store, in which two black male entrepreneurs who were waiting for a business partner to arrive were arrested after the manager called police because the men had not made a purchase. They were charged with deliberate trespassing and held in custody for hours but were released when the district attorney, amid public pressure, announced he would not pursue charges. Since then, there has been a surge in media reports of similar incidents in which white people have called the police on blacks — and, in one instance, two American Indian brothers — merely for their presence in public spaces. Implicit in these incidents of black bodies — which have been inscribed by history to be read as inferior and even criminal — “trespassing” in perceived “white spaces” are the legacies of de jure and de facto segregation, in which race and geography collide. The response given by police when a white female graduate student at Yale University called law enforcement on a black female graduate student who was napping in a common room was telling: an officer who demanded that the second student show them her university ID explained that “we need to make sure that you belong here.” The question of who belongs where is a central component of the history of racism, and many scholars have theorized that this collision of race and space helps to codify the constructs of difference and the Other. For example, in her book Demonic Grounds: Black Women and the Cartographies of Struggle, Katherine McKittick demonstrates the intersections of geography and race stating, “Black Matters are spatial matters.” Her work challenges the notion that geography is apolitical. In other words, the history of racial bias in the United States is a history of geography underscored by settler-colonialism that, as McKittick observes, reifies a racial hierarchy that promotes ideas “that some bodies belong, some bodies do not belong and some bodies are out of place.” Rashad Shabazz also explored issues of spatialized difference in his book Spatializing Blackness: Architectures of Confinement and Black Masculinity in Chicago. He argues that space has become racialized and gendered via constraints “built into architecture, urban planning, and systems of control that functioned through policing and the establishment of borders literally and figuratively create[ing] a prison like environment.” Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter In few places is this tension clearer than in Philadelphia, right in the neighborhood where the Starbucks incident took place. At the turn of the 20th century, W. E. B. DuBois’s seminal study The Philadelphia Negro explored the city’s Seventh Ward, which “stretched along a narrow strip west from Seventh and Lombard streets to the Schuylkill River, bordered by Spruce Street to the north and South Street to the south”; it was the hotbed of black life and culture. Although the area had a reputation for “filth, poverty, and crime,” Du Bois found a nuanced and complex community of African Americans, some locally born and others southern transplants trying to eke out a living. While some blacks beat the odds, becoming doctors, lawyers, businessmen, teachers, barbers and caterers, “a fresh wave of immigration from Europe would arrive and undermine the black middle class as it was emerging.” As Du Bois noted, these immigrants also displaced the coveted domestic positions held by blacks on Rittenhouse Square. The federal “urban renewal” program of the 1950s and ‘60s opened urban areas such as the Seventh Ward to developers, which in turn increased its real estate values as the black population sank from 30% to 7%. As displaced blacks relocated to other areas of the city, the general area once known as the Seventh Ward was divided into three sections, a portion of which incorporated the surrounding area of the park — and includes 18th and Spruce Streets, the home of the Rittenhouse Square Starbucks. It “is now an upper-middle-class community” stated sociologist Elijah Anderson in the foreword to the 2010 edition of DuBois’ book, “comprised of assimilated white ethnics” where “a strong caste line still exists.” It is an area that blacks pass through but where they seldom linger. In other words, though the neighborhood has a long history as a home to the city’s African American population, it has become one of the places where they do not “belong.” Likewise, Craig Steven Wilder, in his book Ebony and Ivy: Race Slavery and the Troubled History of America’s Universities, noted that Yale University as founded in 1701 relied on a slave-worked plantation. In 1834, though he was only allowed to audit classes, James Pennington, a fugitive slave, became the first African American to study at Yale Divinity School. Yale enrolled its first black student at the medical school in the 1850s; the first black student to enroll in Yale College was in 1870. It was nearly a century before Yale increased its efforts towards the admission of African Americans in any substantial way. By 2016, the percentage of African Americans at Yale was 7.1 %. This is a space founded on whiteness. Similarly, Colorado State University, where two Mohawk students were recently detained by police during a campus tour, was founded in 1870 during the period of intensified attacks on the tribes of Colorado. The university is less than 300 miles from the Southern Ute Tribe reservation, established in 1881. Indians reservations are an extreme example of the way geography and race intersect, as they became the legal means to spatialize indigeneity, based on the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which justified the further expansion of American territory on the bases of race and religion. While most American Indians currently live in urban and suburban areas, their being “off the reservation” can subject them to both micro- and macroaggressions similar to the CSU incident. As American Indian Michelle Lot stated during an interview with The Guardian, “I can’t find a spot that the government tells me I’m not trespassing on.” Race and geography are twin forces that have shaped American culture since the colonial era, long before “white only-colored only” signs dotted the South. The impact of those forces continues to this day and will take more than one day’s training at one company to uproot and dismantle. Indeed, it will require the effort of an entire nation.

Express Web Desk,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP president Amit Shah at a breakfast-meeting at the state guest house, in Patna on Thursday. (PTI) In one of the strongest display of bonhomie between BJP and JD(U) amid rumblings over seat sharing, BJP president Amit Shah and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met over breakfast on Thursday, with Shah confirming that both the parties would contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections together. Saying that BJP was firmly behind Kumar, Shah asserted that the BJP-JD(U) alliance was on a strong footing and won’t break. “The BJP-led NDA’s alliance with Nitish Kumar will not break, it will continue. We are with Nitish Kumar and will continue to be with him,” ANI quoted Shah as saying after the meeting with Kumar, in which both the leaders are understood to have discussed the seat-sharing formula for the 2019 elections. Shah, whose visit to Bihar was his first after the JD(U) re-joined the NDA last year, said the time had come to uproot Congress from the country and predicted that the alliance would win all the 40 seats in Bihar. “The end of Congress will take place in Bihar. The NDA is united and strong in Bihar. We will contest the Lok Sabha election together and will win all 40 seats in the state,” Shah said. More than the statements by Shah, the image of the two leaders smiling and bonding well during their 45-minute meeting in Patna sent a message that all was well between the alliance partners. The meeting comes in the wake of Kumar re-affirming the alliance in JD(U)’s executive council summit last week that quashed rumours over disquiet in the coalition. Speculation about the JD(U) mooting an exit from the NDA had also arisen in the wake of Kumar’s phone call to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad when he underwent a fistula surgery in Mumbai. However, Kumar dismissed such rumours as “hot air” and said there were no differences with BJP. The BJP president and Kumar are scheduled to meet again over dinner hosted at the chief minister’s residence.

Charlotte McDonald-Gibson / Brussels,"The 29 countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are not referred to in its statutes as members or signatories but as allies. As the military grouping nervously prepares for a July 11/12 summit, 28 of those nations’ leaders may be forgiven for wondering whether that word still describes the country led by the 29th. In the space of two weeks in June, U.S. President Donald Trump first baited his supposed friends into a trade war by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and other nations. He argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin – still under E.U. and U.S. sanctions for the annexation of Crimea – should be invited back into the G7, before rejecting the summit’s communique and personally insulting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. All that before he met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and called him a “ very talented ” leader. This dismantling of long-established norms of global diplomacy has many wondering whether NATO, the alliance that has preserved global stability since the darkest days of the Cold War, is the next foundation block of the current world order that the President plans to uproot. “All of that left the friends and allies of the United States wondering, who is the leader of the democratic world?” Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the previous secretary general of NATO, tells TIME. “And if that is repeated in Brussels in July it would be no less than a disaster, not only for the Western democratic world but for the democratic world globally.” There are many targets of Donald Trump’s ire, but NATO has long played a key role in his narrative of the U.S. footing the bill for the rest of the world at the expense of its own citizens. He has repeatedly railed against the U.S. putting up a disproportionate amount of funding for NATO. About 70% of the alliance’s overall expenditure on projects like military readiness, joint exercises, and initiatives to counter cyber-warfare is covered by the U.S. Under pressure from Washington — and reacting to Russian aggression — NATO members agreed in 2014 to each increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2014. But progress has been slow; so far only eight NATO countries meet that target. While many Europeans, including Rasmussen, agree with Trump’s general point about defense spending, his method of expressing it is exasperating allies. On June 10, a day after the G7 summit, Trump launched a Twitter tirade clearly aimed at Europe, lamenting that the U.S. spends money “protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade”, and warning that “change is coming”. On trade and the G7, European leaders are feeling empowered to punch back at the U.S. French President Emmanuel Macron said recently that the G7 could do without Trump, while on trade the E.U. this week retaliated with their own tariffs on US goods. “The initial idea of playing nice with Donald Trump, which several European leaders have tried, has been demonstrably proven to yield no benefits,” says Anthony Gardner, who acted as U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. from 2014 to 2017. But there is far more at stake when it comes to NATO, especially on the front line of the new antagonistic relationship with Russia. Since Putin annexed Crimea in 2014, nations along NATO’s eastern flank have been increasingly concerned by Russian aggression along their own borders, and still see the U.S. as the most important backer of their security. “Without the United States, European security would be in great danger,” Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics tells TIME. “We can’t simply build something that would exclude the United States – this is simply impossible: look at the resources, look at capabilities.” While he predicts “long, very difficult, very heated meetings” at the July summit, Rinkevics believes a consensus is still within reach. Trump’s abrupt cancelling of joint military exercises on the Korean peninsula after his meeting with Kim has also raised questions about whether war games in Europe could suffer a similar fate. Just this month, the U.S. led joint exercises in the Baltics and in Poland with 18 other nations. Rinkevics, whose country helped host these exercises, is confident the war games will continue. “I don’t believe that there is going to be such kind of development,” he says, even if Trump does make good on suggestions of a U.S.-Russia summit. Yet the tensions between the U.S. and Germany may again come to the fore. Not only does Germany spend comparatively less on defense than other major powers, but Trump has recently taken Chancellor Angela Merkel to task over her refugee policy that is currently the subject of a bitter domestic political feud. “He is picking on Germany more than anyone else for a simple reason: he wants Merkel to fail and he wants the migration issue to demonstrate the failure of her policies,” says Gardner. “It is a remarkable situation of the President of the United States attacking one of our closest and dearest allies, basically for domestic purposes.” The embattled Merkel will be keen to avoid a further spat with Trump, says Christian Mölling, deputy director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. With that in mind, German defense officials travelled to Washington for meetings ahead of the summit to try and sell to their U.S. counterparts a plan to increase defense spending to 1.5% by 2024. “She will definitely want to prevent a public fight with Trump, if that is possible, because he holds the cards given the fact that he can always choose to come up with the 2% discussion and Merkel would be on the defensive side,” says Mölling. Rasmussen urged NATO members to keep discussions about defense spending behind closed doors, cautioning that a public disagreement may raise public doubt over America’s commitment to Article 5, the clause which says that all NATO members will respond if one of their number is threatened. “Putin might take it as a signal that when push comes to shove, the Americans will not be ready to really defend its allies, so it sends a very dangerous signal to autocrats,” he says. The former NATO general secretary hopes that the President will take advice from figures like Defense Secretary James Mattis, who has served as a NATO Supreme Allied Commander and, he says, understands the importance of the alliance. At last year’s summit, Trump caused a stir by refusing to explicitly affirm his commitment to Article 5 in a speech in front of a memorial to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the U.S. became the first member to invoke the clause. He swiftly corrected that a few weeks later, most likely on the advice of his national security team. But the concern in European capitals is that Trump will ignore his counsellors this time around, says Heidi Obermeyer, a fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “Worst case is Trump goes in, even more angry that nobody is doing anything, and calls into question the validity of Article 5, or says that he is going to try and remove American troops from Europe – all gift-wrapped in a beautiful box for Vladimir Putin,” she says. And the best-case scenario? “A lack of criticism,” says Obermeyer. Given the President’s recent approach to diplomacy, even that may be too much to expect.","""Friends and allies of the United States are wondering, who is the leader of the democratic world?”",2018-06-22T13:34:50Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Trump Is Trying to Dismantle the World Order.

The main grievance of the farmers is related to the quantum of compensation. “The farmers said that they are not afraid of uprooting the concrete pillars, that have been laid in our farms by the officials to mark the area for the train corridor, if adequate compensation is not promised,” said Mehul Patel, an official from the Mahij Sarpanch office, who was present at the meeting between the farmers and the officials. Farmers in the village, that is part of Mehmedabad taluka of Kheda district, are set to lose about five hectares of land. According to the application, the farmers have said that their village falls under the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) as it borders Ahmedabad district, but they have refused to accept the current compensation, which is two times the jantri for urban areas. Jantri is a ready reckoner fixed by the state government for land valuation. “The farmers have said that they need four times the compensation that is being given to farmers in rural areas. As per the existing Jantri rates, the cost of one bigha of land is just Rs 4.5 lakh in our village. However, the market rates range between Rs 20-50 lakh for a bigha. The farmers have given an application opposing the land acquisition in it’s present form,” Patel said. In their application the farmers have also stated that before the formal land acquisition process begins they want a “written assurance” that they will be given right to passage to the portions of land that will be divided by the bullet train corridor. The farmers also demanded that they should be allowed to sell off the land which will be divided once the train corridor is built. “If these demands are not met, we are opposed to the land acquisition,” the application stated.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Russia's leading environmental activist is one of more than a million people - many of them young and well-educated - who have packed their bags and left the country in recent years, writes the BBC's Lucy Ash. Russian even has a word for the phenomenon, ""poravalism"". ""Do I feel homesick?"" says Evgenia Chirikova. ""Not really. Lots of people here speak my language. They are friendly, energetic and curiously polite. I'm living in the Russia of my dreams!"" She's talking about Estonia, her home for the last two-and-a-half years - a refuge from the persecution she faced as an environmental campaigner and an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Her career as an activist began 11 years ago, when Chirikova and her family were walking through the Khimki forest - a former Tsarist hunting ground filled with ancient oak trees, wild boar and rare butterflies. I lay awake at night wondering what I would do if I were sent to prison and my daughters to an orphanage ""I was pregnant, looking forward to a picnic with my eldest daughter and my husband when I saw something odd,"" she says. ""There were red crosses painted on several oaks and birches. I wondered why these perfectly healthy trees needed to be chopped down."" Khimki was a protected forest, the ""green lungs"" of Moscow. Chirikova and her husband, Mikhail, had deliberately moved to the area from the traffic-clogged city centre, in order to be close to it. On her return from the picnic, Chirikova got on the phone and alerted the authorities to what she had seen. She had assumed that a rogue company was trying to bend the rules, so she was astonished to discover officially sanctioned plans for a £5bn ($6.7bn) highway that would slice through the protected forest even though there were alternative, less environmentally damaging routes. Officials at the Ministry of Natural Resources and the State Committee for Nature Protection assured her that the decision had been approved by the president himself - and later, as prime minister, Vladimir Putin signed a decree changing the forest's protected status to allow for ""transport and infrastructure"". Chirikova suspected the real reason for allowing the road to go through the forest was to open up land near the capital to developers. She left her engineering job to organise public opposition. The first demonstration of her group, Save Khimki Forest, brought 5,000 people on to the streets - one of the largest environmental protests in Russian history - and gathered more than 50,000 signatures. Her crusade convinced the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank, major financial backers of the highway, to withdraw funding. Image copyright Getty Images But success came at a cost. Chirikova was arrested several times and other activists and journalists were set upon by unknown assailants. When Khimki newspaper editor Mikhail Beketov raised suspicions that local officials were profiting from the motorway project, his dog was killed, his car was set on fire and finally he was attacked so brutally that he suffered brain damage and never regained the power of speech. Chirikova remembers going to visit him in intensive care. He had lost several fingers, had a leg amputated and part of his skull was missing after a beating with an iron bar. ""My legs were shaking so badly that I just sat on the hospital floor,"" she says. ""For the first time, I was really afraid. Anyone who could do such a thing to another person has no moral principles and I understood that a bandit regime had seized power in my country."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beketov died of a heart attack a few years after he was attacked Chirikova herself was targeted in another way - through her ""weak spot"", her children. ""The authorities spread lies about me saying I smacked my daughters and didn't feed them properly,"" she says. ""A guy from the security services came to our apartment block and asked my neighbours to sign a document saying I was a bad mother."" Her elder daughter was so upset by the sight of men in unmarked cars watching the family that she was too scared to go to school. When strangers knocked on the door, the girls would hide under their beds. Eventually the family had to move to a new neighbourhood closer to the centre of Moscow but the harassment continued, now in the form of threatening phone calls.

Her own anxiety continued to grow, however, especially when the Child Protection Service hinted that it might take her ""abused"" daughters away from her. ""I lay awake at night wondering what I would do if I were sent to prison and my daughters to an orphanage,"" she says. ""In the end that is why I decided to leave the country."" Although she won a prestigious international award for her campaigning, Chirikova could not stop the highway linking Moscow to St Petersburg. But she believes that the original plans were modified and a smaller area of trees was destroyed as a result. ""More importantly,"" she says, ""our movement showed other Russians that it is possible to fight against injustice, expose corruption and to hold the authorities accountable."" Image caption Chirikova near her home in Tallinn From Estonia she continues to encourage environmental activists across Russia via a new website, activatica.org, which runs stories about the campaign to save a Moscow park, about poisonous smog or the danger to Lake Baikal from new hydroelectric power stations. I'm probably the only one of my election observer friends who has never been in prison Asya Parvenova, Escape Room ""I feel like an expat in Estonia, not an exile,"" Chirikova says, ""and it's close enough that I can travel to Russia whenever I need to."" Between 2000 and 2014, approximately 1.8 million Russians left the country, according to Alina Polyakova, director of research for Europe and Eurasia at the Atlantic Council in Washington. Earlier this year she warned the trend was intensifying and called this outward migration of largely well-educated young people ""a significant national security threat to the Russian Federation"". Calculating the numbers of people who have left the country is complicated by the fact that most retain their Russian passports even if they gain passports or residence permits in other countries. The State Statistics Service counted 350,000 emigrants in 2015 - 10 times more than in 2010. On the top floor of a shopping mall in Berlin I meet another of the new emigres, 33-year-old Asya Parfenova. She used to be a journalist in Moscow and took part in the Election Observers movement in 2012 and 2013, reporting on voters being ferried around polling stations - apparently voting multiple times - and on suspiciously stuffed ballot boxes. ""I'm probably the only one of my election observer friends who has never been in prison,"" she says, raising an eyebrow. Asya started a company which enabled her to get a working visa in Germany. She runs an Escape Room - a team game in which players are locked up and have to solve complex puzzles, as a clock is ticking, to win their freedom. My little daughter Lydia started to tell me about fascists who want to invade our country Artemy Troitsky, Music critic ""I like rules which are clear and we don't have those in Russia,"" she says. ""The government is always pushing the idea of stability but Russia is actually the least stable place now because nobody can predict what will happen tomorrow, how laws will be interpreted - and this is very damaging for business."" Parfenova adds that many successful entrepreneurs in Russia are now trying to get a foothold in foreign markets. ""They are trying to prepare, as we say, a 'spare airport', a safe place to land in case there is no possibility of landing in Russia any more."" Another new slang word has crept into the Russian language, says Artemy Troitsky, Russia's leading music critic - poravalism, or ""time-to-get-out-of-here-ism"". A high-profile poravalist himself, Troitsky now lives in Estonia, like Chirikova. In 2011, he and several well-known intellectuals and opposition figures took part in demonstrations against election fraud. All wore symbolic white ribbons, and a rattled Vladimir Putin ridiculed them for ""looking like condoms"". In high spirits, Troitsky took to the stage dressed in a white, rubbery-looking sheath. Image copyright Jeremy Nicholl Later that year he faced an onslaught of defamation suits - but it took more than that to uproot him. For Troitsky the decisive moment came after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine, when he was dismayed by what he calls ""a nasty festival of nationalism, militarism and orthodoxy"" in Russia. Like Chirikova, he says concern for his children was the determining factor in his decision to leave. ""It really made me sick when I heard from them some things that they picked up at school or at the kindergarten. My little daughter Lydia started to tell me about fascists who want to invade our country and that we have to defend ourselves, that Putin is a great person and so on."" Troitsky, however, does get homesick and he remains immersed in Russian culture. Although he still visits Russia, he hopes one day to return for good. He isn't sure younger generations will feel the same attachment, though. He says only a quarter of his friends' children in their 20s have opted to stay in Russia - the rest are studying, working and building new lives abroad. An exile online Image copyright Alamy Image caption Mikhail Khodorkovsky addresses journalists in Moscow via video link (2015) London is another popular destination for Russian emigres, though one of the best-known now spends the majority of his life online, trying to change his country from outside. Mikhail Khodorkovsky ran the Yukos oil company before he was jailed in 2003 on charges widely seen as politically motivated. After 10 years behind bars he wrote to Putin asking to be freed so he could say farewell to his dying mother. ""I was taken to the steps of the plane as a prisoner in a convoy. And when people in the Kremlin circle began discussions as to whether or not I could return I said, 'OK, I would be happy to come back to Russia. Just tell me, are there any strings attached,'"" he says. He leans back in his chair with a wry smile. ""Literally within a month it was announced that a new criminal case would be brought against me, so the only way I could return was straight into a prison cell."" Like Chirikova, Khodorkovsky sees the internet as his ""battlefield"". ""They could think people like me are out of touch with day-to-day Russian reality,"" says the oligarch from the wood-panelled office of his Open Russia foundation. ""And I need to convince them otherwise - so yes, you could say I live in a virtual world. That's the choice that I have made."" A campaigner who stayed Image copyright Getty Images Asked what she loves about Russia, Nadya Tolokonnikova, replies: ""It's like asking, 'What do you love about your mother?' It is just my mother and I cannot imagine myself without it."" She shot to fame aged 22 when she and two others from the Pussy Riot punk group were arrested for singing, ""Virgin Mary, Mother of God, Get rid of Putin!"" in a Moscow cathedral. I really do love to be inside of this courageous community of people who are risking their lives trying to change their country - it gives sense to my life Tolokonnikova spent nearly two years in a prison camp, sewing policemen's uniforms for 16 hours a day. So why is she still passionately committed to staying in Russia? ""Language first of all, because now I feel like an idiot trying to explain my thoughts in different language. You cannot use details and semitones and melody of foreign languages as you can with your own. And that's precious. And culture and icons and religion, and cinematography and literature, and Russian people who are wild, dangerous, creative, and extremely brave. ""I really do love to be inside of this courageous community of people who are risking their lives trying to change their country. It gives sense to my life."" After her release from prison, she set up MediaZona, an independent news website that focuses on the legal system, and Zona Prava (Zone of Justice), which campaigns for better prison conditions. When she was behind bars in Mordovia, in northern Russia, she was appalled that seriously ill inmates were denied medication. ""And right now we have a couple of dozens of cases that we won in the European Court of Human Rights and it helps, it helps not just individuals but hopefully it pushes the whole prison system to be scared of NGOs and human rights workers because nobody wanted to be exposed."" Tolokonnikova says most of MediaZona's readers are under 35, they have inquiring minds and they're increasingly impatient for change. She believes that a thirst for adventure, for meaningful action and pride in Russia - not to be confused with nationalism - might just stop some leaving, and bring others back. The young people who protested against corruption in many cities earlier this year also give her hope. ""They're real patriots. They are not the Putin type of patriots who prefer to live abroad but just take money from the oil and gas industry. Those people who are protesting right now against Vladimir Putin, they want to make life better in their own country. They want to develop economy, art, media. They want to have better television channels, not only propaganda machine as it is right now.""

"Special to USA TODAY, David Agren, Special to USA TODAY","Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador delivers a speech during the final event of the 2018 presidential campaign at Azteca Stadium on June 27, 2018, in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo: Manuel Velasquez, Getty Images) MEXICO CITY – Silvia Mancera has never voted in a Mexican presidential election, figuring the candidates were “all the same.” But as campaigns concluded for Sunday's vote, the 33-year-old schoolteacher filed into the Estadio Azteca to support a politician she’s convinced will change Mexico: Andrés Manuel López Obrador – the three-time candidate, who leads all polls by double digits. “The country is on its head in every way imaginable: socially, politically, economically,” she said. “Obviously, he’s not going to achieve total change. But at least I feel like he cares.” Voters are set to pick a new president, renew both houses of Congress and thousands of public positions in the states. Most are heading to the ballot box angry and ready for something different. A survey in the Reforma newspaper found 79 percent of voters wanted a change in the party in power. Some 85 percent of voters think the country is on the wrong track, according to Ipsos. Mexico suffered its most murderous year in memory in 2017 with 29,168 homicides as the longtime drug war shows few signs of abating. Perceptions of corruption have soared as massive acts of graft go unpunished. Economic performance has underwhelmed, prices have climbed, purchasing power continues to erode and salaries stay stagnant. “It’s a referendum on the last 12 years … on corruption, the drug war and inequality,” said Esteban Illades, editor of the magazine Nexos. “López Obrador is the only one promising something different.” López Obrador, 64, has pursued the presidency since 2006 – and appears poised to win on his third attempt. He entered the Azteca Stadium to a crowd of 80,000 supporters Wednesday night. The slow-speaking man – commonly called “AMLO” – took to the stage like a rock star and reeled off promises: increased social spending, fiscal prudence, an end to gasoline price hikes – an issue especially close to Mexicans, who were promised lower prices after the government opened the state-run oil industry to private investment. López Obrador especially railed against corruption – perceptions of which have worsened as graft scandals engulfed the country’s governors and accusations of conflict of interest, including first lady Angelica Rivera purchasing a $7 million mansion from a crony contractor, sent President Enrique Peña Nieto’s popularity plunging. “(Our) plan is to uproot this corrupt regime of injustices and privilege,” López Obrador said. “The central problem is corruption, which is the main cause of social and economic inequality, violence and other ills.” A native of southeastern Tabasco state – where he led protests against petroleum contamination and marches to Mexico City to denounce electoral fraud – López Obrador is no stranger to voters. More: As hundreds of thousands prepare to rally, here's where things stand on immigration He moved to Mexico City and became mayor in 2000 – attracting attention for his austere ways and being chauffeured around the national capital in a small Nissan sedan. As mayor, he started programs such as providing seniors and single mothers with monthly stipends. He also appealed to the middle class by building elevated freeways. López Obrador left the mayor’s office early to run for president in 2006. His agenda was putting “the poor first,"" but he lost a tight election after attack ads branded him a danger for Mexico and compared him with former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. He lost again in 2012. “In 2006, Andrés Manuel was identified as much more on the left than now,” said Emiliano Ruiz, a journalist who covered AMLO’s 2006 campaign. “He’s been moving to the center and he’s clearly now in the center.” Details of some of López Obrador’s proposals are still lacking. He has promised to reverse a change in education and mused about reviewing the contracts signed with foreign oil companies. He’s promoted an amnesty for those in the illegal drug business, which would apply to low-level figures such campesinos growing opium poppies, not cartel kingpins. López Obrador expresses full support for NAFTA and promises cooperation and cordial relations with the United States – while also aggressively defending undocumented Mexicans living north of the border. “We won’t do the dirty work of any foreign government,” he said on the topic of stopping Central America migrants trying to reach the U.S. border. “Andrés Manuel wants to collaborate, but also wants our relationship to be more equal,” Olga Sánchez Cordero, a former supreme court justice tapped to be interior minister in an AMLO administration, said in an interview. “He wants it to be different, wants it so the Americans and us have a relationship of dignity on both sides.” Critics contend López Obrador hasn’t changed much. He tours the country and mocks his opponents as “the mafia in power,” promises to strip former presidents of their pensions and says he’ll sell the presidential airplane to U.S. President Donald Trump. “He has a polarizing discourse.... He incarnates a social justice avenger, a redeemer of the poor,” said Fernando Dworak, a political consultant. “AMLO has had consistent strategies over the past 30 years that no one has known how to stop.” Scare tactics stopped López Obrador at times over the past 12 years, but appear to be dissuading fewer Mexicans this year. “The deterioration of daily life is such in questions of security, in questions of public services … and the enrichment of politicians is very noticeable and then they tell you: ‘if AMLO wins, it's going to be worse!’” said Aldo Muñoz, political science professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State. “This discourse of fear has completely collapsed in the face of reality.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2KiW2Ta","López Obrador, 64, has pursued the presidency since 2006 – and appears poised to win on this third attempt.",2018-06-29T16:06:29Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Andrés Manuel López Obrador is likely to be Mexico's next president.

Pratik Dholakiya,"While the business travel industry can take comfort in the fact that our globe’s growing economic interdependence will always provide a continuous stream of travelers, the other fact that the industry is being heavily disrupted, should not be ignored. The rise of the sharing economy, changing demographic expectations, big data, political turmoil, AI, and currency shifts are just a few of the many forces that are putting pressure on the industry to remain in a state of perpetual adaptation. As the end of 2017 draws closer, it’s time for us to ask ourselves how this industry will continue to evolve in 2018. Here are 5 changes that we can expect. 1. Business travel picks up speed According to a report by the Global Business Travel Association, expected business travel spending is to grow by 6.1 percent in 2018, up from the expected 5.1 percent in 2017. This is a part of a larger trend. Terrorist attacks, political instability, pandemics, and natural disasters slowed the industry in 2016, but it still grew by 3.5 percent. According to the report, the optimism in the business travel industry is driven by accelerating global trade, despite echoes of the recession, in recent memory. Growth in manufacturing and in emerging markets is also major factors. The downside of that economic trust will be the increase in travel costs, with airfares expected to rise by 3.5 percent and hotel prices 3.7 percent. In terms of corporate travel procurement opinion, predictions are similar. The Morgan Stanley 2018 Global Corporate Travel Outlook Survey discovered that over two thirds of corporate travel buyers expected air traffic volumes to increase by an average of 4.8 percent. They did not, however, expect prices to increase very much, an average of 1.8 percent. 2. Blockchain starts to be taken seriously Until recently, Blockchain technology and its cousin Bitcoin have been largely seen either as currency for nerds or for dangerous black markets. However, business travel and international commerce may be due for a massive shift towards the use of Blockchain in the very near future. This month, American Express announced cross-border blockchain-enabled business-to-business transactions. The initiative is being implemented in tandem with blockchain startup Ripple. In October, Visa announced launching similar capabilities in concert with a startup Chain. MasterCard, meanwhile, filed a patent in blockchain-based transaction processing, in November. Blockchain will bring increased speed and transparency to international transactions, as well as reduced costs, while travel suppliers like Lufthansa and Innfinity Software Systems begin to embrace blockchain-based distribution platforms. While 2018 is unlikely to be the year that blockchain eliminates all cross-border payment issues, it is looking like the year where we start to see meaningful impact. 3. The sharing economy completes its transition to business mainstream A survey conducted by FreshBooks reveals that the influence of the sharing economy on small business travel happened incredibly fast, so fast that we may even be approaching saturation by the end of 2018. In 2014, small business owners chose taxis over Uber by a factor of 3 to 1, but by late 2017 that number has flipped, with small businesses choosing Uber over taxis by 3 to 1. Airbnb may also be approaching saturation. In 2014, small business owners chose hotels over Airbnb by a factor of 16 to 1. By late 2017, that lead is down to 6 to 1. Clearly, there is some resistance to embracing the sharing economy when it comes to sleeping arrangements, but even those going the hotel route are likely to see changes in a more casual direction. Hipmunk, which build its brand on user-friendly leisure, is now turning its attention toward small businesses with Concur Hipmunk. This is part of a larger trend towards the “consumerization” of business, which is likely to become increasingly important for business travel, especially for businesses hoping to hold top talent in recruitment, negotiation, and other travel-heavy positions. 4. Self-driven cars begin to play a real part Uber surprised everybody in August of 2016 by launching a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh. While humans in the driver seat monitored the cars, it was much sooner than anybody thought a major company would be going commercial with self-driving cars, in any capacity. The gravity of how quickly this shift could take place hit home in late November, with the announcement of a deal that would put 24,000 Volvo self-driving cars in Uber’s fleet. The cars will begin to hit the streets in 2019, but the fact that this major deal was brokered should have important implications for the direction of the business travel over the next year. Uber’s competitor Lyft, meanwhile, is in dealings with Waymo to put self-driving cars on the road. 5. AI hits the industry in a big way While the influence of self-driving cars is more likely to be on the horizon in 2018 than on the front doorstep, the broader world of AI will likely be making a big impact. According to an IBM report, more than a third of travel industry leaders will have four or more cognitive projects underway in 2018, and 41 percent plan to launch a cognitive project. Most of the investment is currently going towards chat bots to assist with customer service, whether in the form of messaging or call center service. IBM’s report found that the most cognitive-ready businesses in the industry considered personalization of the traveler experience one of the most important points to focus on. The report stated that an unnamed global airline was investing in a Siri-like AI that would communicate with travelers in natural language to put together a personalized travel plan. That personalization would be bolstered by analysis of interactions with other travelers and large data sets about preferences. Meanwhile, Quantas Airways is already using self-service tech to cut check-in times by 90 percent, the Watson Virtual Assistant is improving call center performance, Hipmunk has rolled out an app you can talk to like a person, and Amadeus is building custom offers for people based off of their social media profiles (with permission, it should be noted). An innovative industry Business travel is, by now, an old industry. Thankfully, most of the professional leadership in the industry seems to be well aware of how dramatically technology can uproot the marketplace. Shifting demographics and emerging economies are at the same time creating waves of change, and globalization continues to be an ever-present force on the growth of the industry.

Charles Bethea,"Two dozen gleaners—not to be confused with foragers or dumpster divers—showed up for the second annual International Gleaners Symposium, held recently at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta. They were there to discuss the finer points of gathering neglected foodstuffs from roadsides, back yards, and other nonpublic places, and then donating them to the hungry. The gleaners sat in a classroom, drinking coffee and eating store-bought grapes. They were awaiting remarks from Ashley Pruitt, a local lawyer specializing in civil litigation, who had volunteered to explain the surprising number of ways that one can run afoul of the law while picking unharvested fruits and nuts for homeless shelters and food banks, as more than four hundred volunteer groups in the United States now do. “A few weeks ago, I didn’t even know protection for food donation was a thing,” Pruitt, who wore a silk scarf around her neck, said before she began. “But I’ve been studying the case law. ” One attendee, Jennifer Jans, described herself as an “outreach raccoon” for Hidden Harvest, a gleaning outfit in Ottawa. “We rescue fruit and nuts, largely from yards,” she said. “People will sign up their trees. Maybe they don’t want to harvest them, or they have too much fruit.” She listed some commonly gleaned Ottawan comestibles: “cherries, pears, black walnuts, and the rare apricot tree.” Also, “lots and lots of crab apples, which I whine about, even though they’re nutritious and delicious.” Emily Worm, a network manager for After the Harvest, in Kansas City, Missouri, explained the history of gleaning. “It goes back to the Bible,” she said. “Farmers were supposed to leave the corners of their fields unharvested for strangers, widows, and orphans.” She added, “I think that’s in Ruth? That’s a book in the Bible, right?” She gleans sixty kinds of produce—“everything from sweet corn to sweet potatoes,” she said. “Strawberries to mustard greens.” The lecture began. “How do you lose your protection under the Bill Emerson Act?” Pruitt asked the gleaners, referring to a piece of pro-gleaner legislation enacted by Bill Clinton in 1996. (Donald Trump has never tweeted the terms “food waste,” “food bank,” or “gleaning,” although he once wrote, “My two sons, Eric &amp; Don... go on safaris &amp; give animals to the poor &amp; starving villagers!”) Pruitt went on, “Let’s say you pick up products from farmers and you donate them. And one day you decide, ‘I don’t want to check the food for bugs or other infestation.’ That may be considered gross negligence.” She added, “Don’t do that.” A gleaner raised her hand. “Do worms count as an infestation?” Dave Laskarzewski, from UpRoot Colorado, interrupted. “I think if you knew the fields you were gleaning in had animal waste—then maybe that’s negligent?” “Definitely gross,” someone said. Shawn Peterson, the director of Green Urban Lunch Box, in Salt Lake City, said, “You’re talking about apple worms, right? Well, codling moths have been found to have no harm to humans.” “Yeah, same with aphids,” a woman said. Next, the group parsed a bit of legalese regarding the protections afforded the hosts of gleaners. Craig Durkin, a gleaner with Concrete Jungle, in Atlanta, said, “This is basically stating, as I understand it, ‘We came into your yard to pick apples. If someone falls out of a tree, they can’t sue you, because you’re letting them in on good faith to pick fruit.’ ” Someone asked, “But can our volunteers sue us ?” “No, it’s not your property,” Pruitt said. “Unless they fell out of a tree, and then you step on them intentionally.” “Well, let’s say we’re using my ladder,” Peterson said. “And this volunteer falls off my ladder and gets hurt.” “You could be protected,” Pruitt said. “Now, if they go to your house and use a ladder to save a squirrel, that’s different. The purpose of going up that ladder was not to pick apples.” A few gleaners nodded thoughtfully. After lunch, Durkin led a walking tour of the campus’s fruit trees. “This is a serviceberry,” he said, stopping at a small, fruitless tree. “There’s probably a hundred on campus. They have this great little white flower and this really delicious berry that comes in around late May here. Like a blueberry. Excellent pie.” “Do you harvest often on campus?” someone asked. “Yes,” Durkin said. “Do you have to get permission?” Barbara Eiswerth, a gleaner from Arizona, asked. “I couldn’t hear that question,” Durkin said. Next up: the eastern redbud tree. “Everything on it is edible,” Durkin said, grabbing a branch. “The bud is kind of sweet and vegetable-y. Like a snap pea.” Eiswerth popped one in her mouth. “More like pineapple guava,” she said. A passing student tried a bud. “About how I’d expect a plant to taste,” he said. Pruitt nodded: “A lot like eating grass, I’d imagine.” ♦",A society of gleaners (not to be confused with dumpster divers) learn the rules of harvesting food in unusual places.,2018-04-23T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newyorker.com'}",The Robin Hoods of Food Waste,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/the-robin-hoods-of-food-waste,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ada724025e5f9763807cf2d/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Bethea-Talk-042018-FB.jpg",,Newyorker.com,uproot,1
Express Web Desk,"Goa’s Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao, in his annual pastoral letter, said the community should work hard towards protecting the Constitution. (Source: YouTube) Two weeks after Delhi Archbishop Anil Couto’s remarks on the “turbulent political atmosphere” created a row, his Goa counterpart has said the Constitution was in danger while alleging that human rights were being trampled in the name of development. Urging Catholics to play an active role in politics, Goa’s Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao, in his annual pastoral letter, said the community should work hard towards protecting the Constitution, more so because the 2019 general elections were around the corner. “Today, our Constitution is in danger, (it is a) reason why most of the people live in insecurity. In this context, particularly as the general elections are fast approaching, we must strive to know our Constitution better and work harder to protect it,” IANS quoted Ferrao as saying in the pastoral letter for 2018-19, which was formally released on Sunday. Catholics account for 26 per cent of Goa’s population and wield significant influence. Alleging that a new trend of mono-culturism was emerging in the country, the archbishop said, “In recent times, we see a new trend emerging in our country, which demands uniformity in what and how we ear, dress, live and even worship. Human rights are under attack and democracy appears to be in peril.” Ferrao further said minorities feared for their safety while development was being used as a ruse to uproot people from their land. “The various minorities fear for their safety. People are being uprooted from their land and homes in the name of development. The first victim of development is the poor person. It is easier to trample upon the rights of the poor because those who will raise their voice for them are very few,” he said. It may be recalled that a similar remark was made by Cardinal Oswal Gracias, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI), last month. Gracias had said there was “growing anxiety” among minority communities “because the government is not acting enough” to protect them. Urging the Catholics to shun “sycophantic” politics and help strengthen democracy, the letter said, “It is advisable that the faithful play an active role in the political field; they should, however, follow the dictates of their conscience while doing so and shun ‘sycophantic’ politics. They should thus strengthen democracy and, on the other hand, help to improve the functioning of the state administration.” While many saw Delhi Archbishop Couto’s remarks aimed at the BJP government, even though he denied targetting any particular political party, it leaves little to imagination Ferrao’s letter was directed at whom. Criticising Couto, Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said there was “no discrimination against anyone”, while BJP president Amit Shah said “polarising people in the name of religion” was “not appropriate”, even as opposition leaders like Mamata Banerjee and CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury backed the Delhi archbishop.

Express Web Desk,"PM Narendra Modi. (Source: PTI)
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. I begin Mann Ki Baat today with a heavy heart. 10 days ago, Mother India had to bear the loss of many of her valiant sons. These brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred &amp; twenty-five crore Indians. In order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully, these brave sons toiled relentlessly, day or night. As a consequence of the Pulwama terror attack and the sacrifice of the brave jawans, people across the country are agonized and enraged. All around, there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs &amp; their family members. The outrage that singes your being and mine on account of the terrorizing violence replicates itself in the collective inner psyche of every citizen of the country; it also echoes in pro-humanity communities of the world, which sincerely believe in humanity. I respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country, who laid down their lives, protecting the honour of their motherland, India. This martyrdom will keep inspiring us relentlessly to uproot the very base of terrorism; it will fortify our resolve. We shall have to take up this challenge facing our country, forgetting all barriers of casteism, communalism, regionalism and other difference, so that, our steps against terror are firmer, stronger and more decisive. Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour. On the one hand, they have displayed exemplary capabilities in restoring peace; on the other, they have retaliated in equal measure, in a language the attackers understand.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished. The Army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers. The martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore, through the media, touching, inspiring stories of their kin, which give hope and strength to the entire country. The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjan ji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring. He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy; if need be, he himself would go and fight. The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha. She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF. When the mortal remains of Martyr Vijay Soren, draped in the tricolor reached Gumla, Jharkhand, his innocent son iterated that he too would join the armed forces. The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each &amp; every child of the Nation today. Similar sentiments are coming to the fore in the households of our brave heart martyrs. No martyr, no family is an exception to that.

Whether it be the family of Martyr Vijay Maurya of Devariya, the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration. I urge the young generation to know and understand the fortitude and the sentiment displayed by these families. To understand the virtues of patriotism, sacrifice and perseverance, one doesnt need to revert to historical events. These are but living examples before your eyes these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising &amp; glowing India.
My dear countrymen, the rather long wait after Independence for a War Memorial is about to be over. It is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it. On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty ji of Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness on the completion of the National War Memorial. India not having a National War Memorial used to surprise me, pain me a Memorial that would house the valour saga series of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives, safe guarding their nations security. And I took a resolve that the country must have such a Memorial.
We decided to erect the National War Memorial and I am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time. Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Armed Forces. On part of the nation, this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti. I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place. The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the nations gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence. The Memorials design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers. The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles, which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being, culminating in his martyrdom. The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier. The second circle, Veerta Chakra, depicts the courage and bravery of our soldiers. It is a gallery whose walls are inscribed with soldiers tales of valour. This is followed by the Tyag Chakra. This circle stands for the sacrifice of our soldiers.
HIGHLIGHTS: PM Modi’s Mann ki Baat address
This bears the names of soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice, in letters of gold. Following that is the Rakshak Chakra which depicts the spirit of security. This circle houses a row of dense trees. These trees represent soldiers and send a reassuring message to the countrys citizens that our soldiers vigilantly guard borders round the clock and that they, the citizens are safe. If you take a holistic view, the National Soldiers Memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site, where people will throng, to get information on our great martyrs, to express their gratitude, to conduct further research on them. This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe &amp; secure, paving the way for development. One falls short of words in assessing the enormous contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces in the strides of progress achieved by the country.
In the month of October last year, I was blessed with the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation. That too echoed the same sentiment, and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen &amp; policewomen, who relentlessly ensure our safety &amp; security. I do hope that you will pay a visit to the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial. Whenever you are there, do capture images and share them on social media so that others get inspired to come &amp; visit this sacred site with eagerness.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting thousands of letters and comments from your side, on various platforms. Once while I was going through your comments, I came across an interesting point by Atish Mukhopadhyay ji. He has written that on the 3rd of March, 1900, the British arrested Birsa Munda, when he was just 25 years old. Coincidentally, the 3rd of March is also the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata. He further states that despite both personalities hailing from diverse family backgrounds, they enriched the legacy and the history of Jharkhand. Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata is, in a way, salutation to the glorious legacy and history of Jharkhand.
These two distinguished personalities brought glory &amp; honour not just to Jharkhand, but the entire country. The country is indeed grateful for their contribution. Today, if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth, it certainly is that of Bhagwan Birsa Munda. The British tree treacherously arrested him when he was asleep, in a covert manner. Do you know why they had to resort to such a cowardly operation? Because even the British who raised a mighty empire used to be terrified of him. Bhagwan Birsa Munda took on the might of the guns &amp; cannons of the British, using traditional bows and arrows, to shake them apart. The fact is, when people are blessed with exemplary leadership, the might of arms pales in comparison to the collective will power of the people. Bhagwan Birsa Munda not only waged a struggle against the British for political freedom; he also actively fought for the social &amp; economic rights of the tribal folk. And he accomplished all this in his rather short life.
He let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed. Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five. Illustrious sons of Mother India, such as Birsa Munda have come into being in each &amp; every part of the country. There mustve been hardly any part of India, which did not produce someone who contributed in the long freedom struggle, that spanned centuries. But its a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations. If the valourous Bhagwan Birsa Munda made us aware of our existence &amp; identity, far-sighted Jamsetji Tata created great institutions for the country. Jamsetji Tata was a true visionary, who not only foresaw Indias future, but also duly laid strong foundations. He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry was imperative for her future. It was his vision that culminated in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, which we know as Indian Institute of Science today. Not just that, he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as Tata Steel. On a voyage to America, Jamsetji Tata met Swami Vivekananda on the ship, and an important topic of their discussion was the outreach &amp; spread of Science &amp; Technology in India. It is said this very discussion led to the founding of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on the 29th of February. All of you know that this day comes just once in four years. A simple, peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders. In Independent India, the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by Morarji bhai Desai. Morarji Desai steered the course of the country through some difficult times, when the very democratic fabric of the country was under a threat. To save democracy, Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against imposition of Emergency. For this, he had to pay a heavy price in his old age. The government of that time arrested and incarcerated him. But when the Janata Party won the general elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country. During his tenure, the 44th constitutional amendment was introduced. This was important because the 42nd amendment which was brought during the emergency, curtailed the powers of the Supreme Court and implemented provisions which stood to violate our democratic values, was struck down. The 44th amendment, made it mandatory that the proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies were made public through the newspapers. This amendment, restored certain powers of Supreme Court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abrogated during the Emergency.
For the first time constitutional safeguards guaranteed that the President could only announce the emergency upon the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and that the period of emergency could not be extended more than six months at any stretch of time. In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of emergency, could never be repeated again in the future. The upcoming generations of our nation will always remember his priceless contribution in maintaining the sanctity of Indian democracy. Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
My beloved countrymen, this year too, there was a great buzz about the Padma award. Today as we head towards a new India, in which we want to honour those who are doing their work at the grass-root level without any care for a reward. They, by their diligence, are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways. In reality they are true Karmyogis, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and, above all, in the service to the nation. You must have been a witness yourself to the curiosity in the air when the Padma awards are announced, and people are inquisitive about the awardees. In a way, I consider this to be a huge pat on the back because these are people who are not on the front page of a Magazine or Newspaper or on our TV screens. They are far removed from the world of glitter and glare, and are people who do not care about name or fame but simply believe in toiling at the proletarian level.
They believe in living in the manner as preached by the shloka of Srimadbhagvad Gita ‘Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam’, or excellence in action is yoga. I would like to tell you about some of these people. You must have heard about Odisha’s Daitari Nayak, who is not nicknamed the ‘Canal Man of Odisha’ for nothing, Daitari Nayak chiselled through the mountain literally with his hands and carved a three kilometers long canal in his village, and put to rest forever the problem of irrigation and water by the sheer dint of his labour. Take the case of Abdul Ghafoor Khatri of Gujarat, who has done an amazing job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting form of Kutch. He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation. I had gifted a Rogan painting titled ‘Tree of Life’ done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata. The manner he has spent his entire life in the service of Gau-mata, is unique in itself. Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who at first tried to empower the downtrodden and the exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based micro financing. America’s Tao Porchon-Lynch will leave you astounded, Lynch has become a living institution of yoga today. Even at the age of 100, she is training yoga to people from all over the world and till now has trained 1500 as yoga teachers. Jamuna Tudu, famous nicknamed ‘Lady Tarzan’ in Jharkhand, most valiantly took on the Timber Mafia and Naxalites, and not only saved the 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to unite and protect the trees and wildlife. It is a tribute to Jamuna ji’s diligence that today, on the birth of every child, villagers plant 18 trees. Also, 10 trees are planted on the marriage of a girl in the village.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagali of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration despite being a divyang herself, it is difficult to find an example than what Muktaben did for the upliftment of divyang women by establishing the institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, through the medium of which she has been engaged in a virtuous endeavour to make visually challenged children self-reliant. The story of Kisan Chachi, i.e. Farmer Aunty of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, or Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring. She has established a precedent in the direction of women empowerment and farming. Rajkumari Devi added 300 women of her area to a ‘Self Help Group’ and motivated the entire lot become financially self-reliant. She not only trained the women of the village in pursuing other gainful means of employment, but most importantly she integrated technology with agriculture and my dear countrymen, it has perhaps happened for the first time, that in the roll of Padma awards bestowed this year, 12 farmers have been the recipients. Generally, very few people associated with the agricultural world or those very few who can be labeled as real farmers have ever found their name in the list of Padmashree awards. This in itself presents the live and vibrant image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which Ive been wanting to do past few days. At present, whenever Im touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of PMJAY scheme under Ayushman Bharats umbrella. PMJAY means to some of the beneficiaries, like the single mother whose unable to set her small children treated due to lack of money or the head of the family who was sustaining his family by the sweat of his brow and met with an accident and was unable to work, he too has benefitted due to this scheme, regained his health and is virtually living a new life!
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakh impoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months. I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots. If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme. In fact this scheme is meant for the benefit of such underprivileged people.
My dear countrymen, exam time in schools throughout the nation is soon going to dawn upon us. In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards. My best wishes to all the students whore going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme. In this Town Hall programme, I had the opportunity to talk with crores of students from India and abroad, and also with their parents and teachers; a possibility through the aegis of technology. One of the focal points of ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ was that there were lively interactions on various topics related with the entire process of examinations. There are many such aspects which emerged out of these discussions which are definitely going to be beneficial for the students. All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the recording of this entire event on YouTube, and I take this opportunity to wish all the best to all my exam warriors, for their upcoming examinations.
My dear countrymen, no mention of India can be complete without citing its festivals. It is just not possible that a day passes without any significance associated with it, or does not herald a festival! Our culture has a continuum spread over many millennia and it is a part of our heritage. In a few days from now, Mahashivrartri will be celebrated, and that too on a Monday, and when a Shivratri falls on a Monday, it becomes all that special in our heart of our hearts! I extend felicitations on this pious occasion of Mahashivratri to you all.
My dear countrymen, some days ago I went to Kashi and there I got a chance to spend time with my divyang brothers and sisters. Many topics were discussed in their company and their confidence was really striking it was inspiring. During the conversation with one of them, a visually challenged young man, and he mentioned that he happened to be a stage artist, and specialized in mimicry during entertainment programs, so just like that I asked him as to who all he could imitate! And he told me that he could mimic the Prime Minister. So I requested a demonstration and a pleasant surprise was in store for me. He mimicked the very exact way I converse with you during Mann Ki Baat. I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to Mann KI Baat but also remember it on many occasions. I was really impressed with the prowess of that divyang young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you, courtesy the Mann Ki Baat program has been a really wonderful experience for me. Through radio I connect every month with millions of families. Many times while conversing with you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts sent on the phone, I feel that you have adopted me as part of your family. This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy. In the next two months, we will be busy in the hurly-burly of the general elections. I myself will also be a candidate during this election. In maintaining respect for healthy democratic traditions, the next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast on the last Sunday of the month of May. This means I shall take up our thoughts and ideas accumulated over the three months of March, April &amp; entire May after the Elections, with confidence anew. With the power of your blessings, once again I shall begin this series of conversations through Mann Ki Baat and shall keep doing Mann Ki Baat with you for years. Once again, I thank all of you from the core of my heart.","I respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country, who laid down their lives, protecting the honour of their motherland, India.

"Special to USA TODAY, David Agren, Special to USA TODAY","Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves after voting in Mexico's presidential election on July 1, 2018, in Mexico City. (Photo: Pedro Mera, Getty Images) MEXICO CITY – Mexican voters went to the polls Sunday and could upend the country's political order by ushering in a left-leaning populist as the next president who vows to make changes. Front-runner Andrés Manuel López Obrador cast his ballot early in the day, saying, “More than an election, it’s going to be a referendum. People will decide between more of the same or real change.” López Obrador, 64, commonly known as AMLO and making his third bid for the presidency, held a commanding lead in the polls ahead of Sunday's vote. The former mayor of Mexico City has promised to “uproot corruption,” increase social spending and pursue a different approach to crack down on drug cartels – even floating the idea of amnesty for those involved in the drug business if not accused of serious offences. The silver-haired López Obrador condemned the two parties that traditionally have held the presidency as “the mafia in power” and promised to “abolish corruption in Mexico” and bring organized crime to heel – with an approach of “hugs not bullets.” And he will address what he considers the root cause of crime and violence: poverty. While his surge in the polls spooked many politicians and businessmen because of his leftist rhetoric, López Obrador said he supports NAFTA and promised to pursue cordial relations with President Donald Trump, who also had campaigned as an outsider, although leaning to the right. López Obrador said he will defend undocumented Mexican migrants living in the United States. He also said Mexico will not be “doing the dirty work” of the USA in stopping Central Americans who try to reach the United States. While campaigning this year, AMLO moderated his positions to appeal to the middle class and to people in northern border regions who would be uneasy voting for a candidate on the left. He also capitalized on discontent. Mexico experienced its most murderous year in memory in 2017, perceptions of corruption have climbed and the outgoing administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto included a spate of scandals. Last Slide Next Slide “There’s a fair bit of luck that finally favored him (AMLO),” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “He was also very capable of shifting, of moderating, of using this peculiar rhetoric of his to attack the same demons, but to do so nicely.” Also helping were missteps by his opponents, especially as they attacked each other to position themselves as the option of anybody but AMLO. “He had a four goal lead and all he had to to was sit back and play smart defense,” Estévez said. Pre-election polls put AMLO 20 points ahead of rivals Ricardo Anaya of a left-right coalition; José Antonio Meade, a former finance minister on the ballot for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); and Jaíme Calderón, a cowboy-turned-governor running as an independent whose campaign included such outlandish proposals as chopping off the hands of corrupt public servants. More: Andrés Manuel López Obrador is likely to be Mexico's next president. Who is he? More: 'They killed my mother, killed my father:' Central Americans risk lives to reach US border More: Amnesty for drug dealers? This Mexico presidential candidate is pushing for forgiveness Voters favoring López Obrador expressed fatigue with the status quo. “I’m tired of so much looting, so many corrupt politicians,” said Beatriz Coulder, a research scientist after she voted for AMLO. She pointed to her home town in Oaxaca state, which was flattened by an earthquake. She said government relief arrived late and suspected some it was squirreled away by politicians. “They get rich and do nothing for the country,” Patricia García, a publishing industry employee, said about politicians after voting for AMLO. “It’s going to be difficult to fix the country because it’s in such bad shape. But I think (AMLO) can put it on the right path. Even those not voting for López Obrador seemed hungry for change. López Obrador “hasn’t explained how he is going to achieve all these wonderful things he’s promised,” said Édgar Romero, a small business owner who voted for Anaya. “People are voting out of frustration and fatigue. It’s a punishment vote against past governments. But we’re punishing ourselves.” “People are tired of PRI excesses and corruption and the violence in the times the PAN (Anaya's National Action Party) governed"" from 2000-2012, said Gerardo Priego, a politician with the PAN supporting Anaya. “People feel like they’ve tried the other two (parties) and should try the other that’s left.” But he described voting for López Obrador's party in hopes of change ""is like divorcing your wife to marry your mother-in-law.” Voters are not just picking a new president to serve a single, six-year term, but also both houses of congress, governors in eight states and hundreds of local-level offices. Mexico City also elects a new mayor. More than 130 politicians and candidates were murdered over the past nine months, according to Etellekt, a risk consultancy. In the heroin-producing heartland of Guerrero state, some races were left without candidates as parties couldn’t find people to run amid the killings. “They’re doing it to send messages and leave clear who controls a certain territory,” Priego said of the slayings, which he attributed to organized crime trying to influence elections. “It’s also a warning that whoever wins office will have to deal with them.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2tPb1ZY","Mexican voters went to the polls Sunday and likely could upend the country's political order by ushering in a left-leaning populist as the next president who vows to make changes.

Deepak Patel,"Written by Deepak Patel | New Delhi | Published: June 7, 2018 1:17:09 am The Sterlite Copper unit led to pollution fears, protests. Almost two weeks after the police firing on protestors in which 13 persons were died marching towards the Tuticorin collectorate demanding the closure of Sterlite Copper plant over pollution fears, the Vedanta group company on Wednesday stated that it is “committed” to Tuticorin and it has been there for around 20 years so it can’t “just uproot and get away from there”. “We are committed to Tuticorin, we have been there close to twenty years now… we cannot just uproot and get away from there,” said P Ramnath, chief executive officer (CEO), Sterlite Copper, on Wednesday in New Delhi. “We have to not only get the licence to operate from pollution control board but we also need a licence to be in Tuticorin itself and its community. Of course, the things are now cooling down. Give it some time and then we may approach through district administration. We have to work out how to approach the community,” Ramnath added. Vedanta’s Sterlite and Aditya Birla Group’s Hindalco Industries Ltd are the two biggest copper producers in India. “We have always been in touch with the collectrorate and we have always been in touch with all the villages. We have an ongoing CSR program and all these villages are covered…Even the village where it started, just a month ago before that, they had approached us for refurbishing of community hall etc. That was about to begin. Suddenly, this whole thing started, so we were taken a little aback,” Ramanth added. Concerns over pollution have dogged Sterlite Copper unit that has been in operation in Tuticorin for over two decades.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
If you are in the first few years of your business, plugging along and oh-so-close to a tipping point, read this article and bookmark it for the day you know is coming soon. The day when a massive order finally comes through, you land a press spot for your product on the Today show, a celebrity decides to endorse your services on Instagram, etc. Use your next “big break” of sorts to take your entire operation to the next level.
Anjelah Johnson is a great case study. Though she was primarily focused on her acting career, a video clip of one of her first few stand-up comedy sets unexpectedly went viral. The video quickly amassed millions of views, pushing her to launch a comedy career that is still thriving today. The “Nail Salon” bit launched many stand-up, television and film opportunities and a spot as MADtv as a series regular. On MADtv, she created another internet sensation, “Bon Qui Qui,” an original comedic character viewed and replicated by over 65 million people worldwide. As that beloved character she’s produced sold out tours and released multiple records with Warner Bros. Records. She’s appeared in multiple national commercials, guest-starred on shows such as Ugly Betty and Curb Your Enthusiasm and recorded four, one-hour comedy television specials. It was recently announced that she will star in a new half-hour sitcom from NBC and executive producer Kevin Hart entitled All Fancy, which is based on her life.
All of the above success basically came from one tipping point, during a time when she was a very green comedian without funds or connections. Here are the top few lessons I believe entrepreneurs and creators can learn from her sustained success.
Keep striking while the iron is hot
When Johnson’s video exploded, she immediately went into writing mode since. At the time, she “only had 12 minutes of jokes.” Think of other products or services you could offer that will appeal to your new, larger pool of potential customers. If an influencer gives you an unexpected shoutout, what else do you have that they might love? Send that to them with a thank-you note. If a post or video of yours goes viral, brainstorm similar concepts that will appeal to the same audience and get creating, and fast.
One of the most important things you will want to do right away is create a way to get all of your new admirers into your email database. Make sure all of your opt-ins are functional and GDPR compliant. Create a targeted, valuable opt-in offer or freemium piece of content to get new fans to sign up.
Staff up to sustain growth
Another immediate action item for Johnson was to set up meetings to find an agent and manager to help her navigate the entertainment industry. You may need to hire an assistant, a business manager, an accountant or hourly employees to help you fulfill orders.
When hiring don’t just take care of the immediate need. Instead also consider your long term goal of taking this big break and turning it into lasting income. I loved Johnson’s advice for finding the right people, since now she has a few people working for her brand beyond her agents. “Who is around you? Who has shown an investment in your career, your brand, your dreams, the things that you love? Actively called you [with ideas]? Start assigning them something.""
Remember your bigger purpose
When you reach a big break for your brand or business, things will get hectic. As exciting as it will be, you will also find yourself overwhelmed, exhausted, and probably a little unsure. Plus, after the initial excitement wears off, you have to actually do the work of fulfilling that giant order or creating what your proposal outlined or fielding hundreds of new customer questions. Johnson had a bigger purpose, a feeling that her work was a calling, which brought her peace and clarity.
If you are unsure of your purpose, check out Simon Sinek’s Start With Why and narrow down your purpose. Then, Keep that purpose front of mind. Many of my massively successful guests swear by meditation, journaling and/or prayer.
“However it is that you seek out those visions -- maybe it's meditation, maybe it's prayer, maybe it's therapy and counseling. However it is, find yourself a space where you can turn off the outside, external circumstances and go deep within yourself and your heart, and give into your own desires,” Johnson explained.
Continue to live a full life outside of work
When the calls are coming in and you can’t keep up with orders, you’ll obviously be excited and energized. You will also probably have no choice to ramp up production to keep up. However, don’t let yourself become consumed, Johnson advised.
“Just keep living. Just keep living your life, because that's where the ideas come from. You getting up and going with your friends out to a night of cocktails, and then maybe going to a music festival - living and experiencing things is where you get inspired. If you're just home being like, ‘Okay, what's my next idea? Let me try to journal, let me sit here and pray, what's my idea? Let me just scroll through Instagram, what is everybody else doing? I'm tired, so let me just stay home.’ That's not where inspiration and ideas are going to come from.”
Prioritize relationships ...
Johnson shared that she made some relational mistakes during her explosive growth. All industries are small industries and word travels fast. Make sure to slow down and prioritize relationship and communicate politely and professionally with everyone, no matter how swamped you are.  
... especially the fan/customer/cudience relationship
To modify one of my favorite Oprah Winfrey quotes -- even when you make it to the limo, you need to remember the fans, customers or clients who were with you on the bus. Continue to make your audience a top priority. I asked Johnson if she got tired of telling the famous “Nail Salon” bit over and over again. Of course she does. “It's my joke that people want to hear every time. I went through a season where I didn’t want to do it, but I'm kind of in this place now where I respect my fans so much that I understand I am where I am because of them, and this is what they want to hear, so let me give them what they want to here. I enjoy telling the joke again, because I tell it as a gift and not as a burden.”
Focus on what’s working
Johnson’s dream was to be an actor, not a comedian. She followed opportunities and gave her audience what they wanted, which meant leaving acting behind to focus on the crop that was in season, so to speak.
“Right now, stand-up is what's blooming,” she said. “So, I'm not going to cut this flower or uproot this plant and try to put it over here in this acting world, because when that's ready, it will start blooming and it will organically grow. I'm not saying don't study, don't be prepared, always be prepared. But, where you focus your time and your energy is on what's growing. There are different seasons. You're not going to try to grow strawberries when it's not strawberry season. You're going to have a harder time. Why don't you grow cucumbers, because that's what's in season right now? That's what's going to flourish.”",So you've gotten a big break.

Express News Service,"Amit Shah in Kutch on Sunday. (Source: Twitter) Campaigning in the tribal-dominated Vyara Assembly seat, BJP president Amit Shah on Monday asked people to “uproot” the Congress and elect the BJP which will provide 24-hour electricity and cows and buffaloes, instead of “kukda-bakra wali Congress”, which distributes cocks and goats. “Do you want to bring in a kukda-bakra wali Congress or the BJP that will give you 24-hour electricity, a cow and a buffalo at your home? Do you know what happens in a Congress adivasi vikaas (tribal development) programme? They will give a cock, a goat and a hen, and these Congress leaders will sit on the dais wearing new clothes and watch closely who was taking the cock, hen and goat. By evening, their leaders’ car reaches your home and the animals are sacrificed. (Prime Minister) Narendrabhai (Modi) has changed this ‘murgi-bakri’ definition of tribal development to a 10-point programme, covering health, jobs, farming and roads,” Shah said at an election meeting. “For the uplift of tribals, the BJP opened 134 Eklavya Model Residential Schools, 43 new girls residential schools and two new Sainik schools so that 2.25 lakh students can study and live. We gave away 1.04 lakh cows and buffaloes to our tribal sisters so that they could become a part of the dairy industry and earn money,” he had earlier tweeted. At the election meeting, Shah said that the Birsa Munda University, established at the cost of Rs 1,000 crore, carried out skill development programmes for nine lakh tribal children, training them to be plumbers, electricians, sprinkler technicians. He said that the BJP government conducted 670 job fairs and “gave them (tribals) jobs at different builders’ (sites)”. Vyara, a Scheduled Tribe reserved seat, is dominated by Christians and tribals. Considered a Congress bastion, the BJP had lost from Vyara in 2012 Assembly elections by over 14,000 votes. This time, the BJP has fielded Arvindbhai Chaudhary, who is pitted against the sitting Congress MLA, Punabhai Gamit.

Philip Issa / AP,"(BEIRUT) — World leaders called Thursday for an urgent cease-fire in Syria as government forces pounded the opposition-controlled eastern suburbs of the capital in a crushing campaign that has left hundreds of people dead in recent days. The U.N. Security Council heard a briefing from U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock on what he called “the humanitarian disaster unfolding before our eyes” in the rebel-held suburbs known as eastern Ghouta. Sweden and Kuwait were seeking a vote on a resolution ordering a 30-day cease-fire to allow relief agencies to deliver aid and evacuate the critically sick and wounded from besieged areas to receive medical care. But Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, who called Thursday’s meeting, put forward last-minute amendments, saying the proposed resolution was “simply unrealistic.” Russia’s amendments would rule out an immediate cease-fire and instead demand that all parties “stop hostilities as soon as possible,” and “work for an immediate and unconditional de-escalation of violence” and 30-day “humanitarian pause.” The Russian proposal would also condemn the “relentless shelling” of Damascus from eastern Ghouta, and deplore “the ongoing attempts by terrorist groups to retake areas and attack civilians and civilian objects.” Several council diplomats who examined the draft, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unacceptable. Nebenzia accused global media outlets of a massive disinformation campaign that ignored what he claimed were thousands of fighters, including al-Qaida-linked militants, that were shelling Damascus from eastern Ghouta and taking refuge in hospitals and schools. Council members said they needed to study the Russian proposals. “We will try and find a way forward that works for everyone,” Sweden’s U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog told reporters, adding that a vote was likely on Friday. In eastern Ghouta, medical workers said they hadn’t been able to see their families for days as they worked round the clock at hospitals that have been moved underground to protect them from bombing, while their spouses and children stay in shelters. “You can’t be above ground for even 15 minutes,” said a nurse in the town of Kafr Batna, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect the identity of family members still living in government areas. “At any moment I expect to have to treat my relatives for wounds,” he said. In the background the deep boom of a bomb could be heard exploding as the nurse spoke by Skype to The Associated Press. He said a barrel bomb had fallen less than half a kilometer (one-third mile) away. A spokesman for the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group said eastern Ghouta was being targeted for “extermination.” “This is a war against civilians,” said the spokesman, Siraj Mahmoud. “The civil defense is being targeted as they rescue women and children, evacuate civilians from targeted areas and put out fires.” Four rescue workers of the organization, also known as the White Helmets, have been killed since Sunday, Mahmoud said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said 400 people, including dozens of children, have been killed since Sunday. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said al-Qaida-linked fighters were using civilians as human shields in the rebel-held suburbs outside Damascus. Al-Qaida’s Syria affiliate is not known to have many fighters in eastern Ghouta, and government forces on Thursday concentrated their fire on hospitals, ambulances, apartment blocks and other civilian sites, according to rescue workers, war monitors, human rights groups, and several videos emerging from the war-scarred region. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate suspension of “all war activities” in the area where he said people were living “in hell on Earth.” The Russian military is supporting Assad’s forces in the assault on eastern Ghouta, as it did in the 2016 campaign that drove the rebels from the enclaves they controlled in Syria’s largest city, Aleppo. Then, as now, it cited the presence of al-Qaida-linked groups as grounds for the sweeping operation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on the European Union to step up pressure on Russia and Iran to end the violence in Syria. “The regime is not fighting against terrorists, but against its own people, killing children, destroying hospitals, and this is a massacre to be condemned,” she told Parliament. Besides President Bashar Assad, Merkel said “Iran and Russia have a particular responsibility” as they are both supporting the government forces. “We need to do everything in our power to put an end to this massacre,” she said. Lavrov said in remarks in Belgrade, Serbia, that an al-Qaida-linked group blocked a proposal by Russia’s military earlier this week to allow opposition fighters to leave eastern Ghouta in exchange for ending the government’s offensive. That contradicted an assertion by one of the largest rebel groups in eastern Ghouta, which told the AP that Russia refused to allow al-Qaida fighters to leave in November, and accused Moscow of wanting to keep the fighters there as a pretext for a comprehensive military campaign. Russian news reports said Moscow has beefed up its forces in Syria with additional warplanes, including its latest fighter jets. The Kremlin wouldn’t comment on the reports, referring questions to the military, which has remained mum about the deployment. Russia has rejected allegations it was responsible for the mounting civilian casualties in eastern Ghouta, but anger has grown along with the death toll. On Thursday, scores of protesters, including prominent Syrian opposition figures, gathered outside the Russian Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, chanting, “Russia get out of Syria” and “Iran get out of Syria” in Turkish and Arabic. Syria’s conflict, which has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced millions in the past seven years, has escalated in recent weeks as Assad and his allies push to retake remaining rebel-held areas in the country. Turkey has also opened a new front against Syrian Kurdish fighters in the north, launching an air and ground offensive on the Kurdish-controlled enclave of Afrin last month. Hundreds of pro-Syrian government fighters entered Afrin this week as part of an agreement with the Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, to bolster resistance to Turkey’s assault. Hundreds of people gathered in Afrin’s main square Thursday, celebrating the pro-government fighters’ arrival. TV footage showed fighters in camouflage uniforms standing among scores of men who gathered in the square waving posters of Assad. Turkish warplanes could be heard flying overhead, sending some fleeing the area. The pro-government daily Al-Watan said some 500 pro-government fighters have entered Afrin since Tuesday, taking positions along the region’s borders. A YPG spokesman, Nuri Mehmud, said the pro-government fighters brought in armored vehicles but said more was needed to withstand Turkey’s military campaign. “There needs to be a no-fly zone,” Mehmud said. “The Syrian army must protect Syrian lands.” Turkey launched the operation to uproot the YPG from Afrin on Jan. 20, saying the group is linked to a Kurdish insurgency inside its own borders.","Russia's U.N. ambassador called the proposed resolution ""simply unrealistic""",2018-02-23T02:32:16Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Russia Blocks U.N.

Nine Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed today after suspected Naxals blew up their mine-protected vehicle in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma, around a year after a dozen jawans were killed in a similar ambush in the district. Two other jawans suffered injuries in the attack. “The martyrdom of security personnel who sacrificed their lives while discharging their duties will always be remembered,” Mr.Singh said in a statement. He also extended condolences to the bereaved families. In the tribal-dominated districts like Sukma, every kind of development work is being carried out to ensure basic facilities like roads, electricity supply, drinking water, better education and health to people, he said. “Maoists feared that the development works in Bastar will uproot them from the region, therefore, they committed such a cowardly and shameful attack,” he said.

"Rebecca Onion, Rebecca Onion","A general view of the Auschwitz main gate during the 73 rd anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau, in Oświęcim. We’re forgetting about the Holocaust. Or so argues a survey by the Claims Conference, released Thursday and written up in the New York Times under the desolate headline “Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds.” Among the startling statistics: 11 percent of all U.S. adults, and 22 percent of millennials, are “unaware” or “not sure” of the Holocaust. And 31 percent of adults (and 41 percent of millennials) think that 2 million Jews, or fewer, had been killed. (The real number is 6 million.) Also, 41 percent of adults couldn’t identify Auschwitz as a concentration camp, a death/extermination camp, or a forced-labor camp. The Claims Conference’s survey, and the Times’ write-up, presumes that our knowledge gaps are getting worse and will only become more dire as we move forward in time. The emphasis on millennials’ relative ignorance drives this point home. Because things today feel worse (see: creeping ambient fascism and anti-Semitism), this conclusion seems to make a kind of dark, intuitive sense. But how did people’s knowledge of the Holocaust in years past compare to our bad showing in 2018? And are we really, as the Times’ coverage implies, less committed to remembering the genocide than we were in years past, when we had more survivors on hand to testify to what they saw? Historian Peter Shulman, who runs the @HistOpinion Twitter feed and likes looking at historical opinion research, compiled a number of answers from old polls on Thursday morning, showing that the narrative of declining knowledge that’s depressed so many Times readers may not be entirely correct. In the polls Shulman referenced, questions asking people of the 1980s and 1990s for factual knowledge about the Holocaust returned blank spots just as glaring as our own. In 1985, Roper found that 32 percent of respondents said they weren’t sure, or volunteered the wrong answer, when asked, “What is or was the Holocaust?” In responding to surveyors’ questions about the numbers of dead, 25 percent of the respondents in a 1992 Roper poll guessed 2 million Jews or fewer had been killed; 10 percent guessed 20 million; 20 percent chose not to answer. That same year, 38 percent of respondents couldn’t identify Auschwitz, Dachau, and Treblinka as concentration camps—a blooper even more notable, as Shulman writes, because those respondents (unlike the 2018 group) were given three names to jog their memories. The report puts a heavy emphasis on millennials’ relative ignorance. When it came to attitudes about the importance of this history, it seems that Americans of a few decades ago weren’t necessarily more committed to Holocaust education and memory than those responding to the recent survey. In 1992, Shulman found, a majority of respondents surveyed by Roper shared the belief that it’s morally imperative to know about this history. 72 percent said it was “essential” or “very important” for “Americans to know about and understand the Holocaust.” But that left 28 percent of respondents who wouldn’t commit to that position. In 1994, only 87 percent of Roper respondents were willing to say that learning about the Holocaust in school was “very” or “somewhat important.” In 2006, only 79 percent would respond “strongly support” or “somewhat support” to the proposition of “mandatory genocide education in public schools.” If you compare those numbers to today’s results—93 percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement “All students should learn about the Holocaust while at school”—it starts to look like we’re doing pretty well. Shulman didn’t share older data on Holocaust denialism, but it’s also important to remember that the weaponization of ignorance about the Holocaust is decades in the making. A culture of Holocaust denialism in the United States, as this timeline put together by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum shows, dates back at least to the publication of Gerald L.K. Smith’s Cross and the Flag in 1959. Given that long history, maybe it’s good news that 96 percent of the 2018 respondents believed that the Holocaust actually occurred. (That depends on how you see things, I suppose. The Times piece called denial “rare,” but 4 percent who will refuse such abundant evidence still feels like an uncomfortably large number to me.) What’s the ultimate takeaway from this mixed bag of results? We could start with a maxim: Never get too upset about apparent evidence of historical ignorance. Ever since I read historian Sam Wineburg’s 2004 article in the Journal of American History, I’ve been wary of the way people use tests of knowledge to show that present-day Americans are uniquely bad at remembering the past. Wineburg illustrates that surveys asking for historical facts have long shown that Americans, especially young people, are “deficient” in their ability to rattle off dates and names. Among the pieces of evidence Wineburg uses in that article is a 1915–16 study of historical factual knowledge. The test, administered to 1,500 students in Texas, found that the young people committed blunders like confusing Thomas Jefferson with Jefferson Davis, “uproot[ing] the Articles of Confederation from the eighteenth century and plunk[ing] them down in the Confederacy,” and having zero idea of the significance of the year 1846 in the history of their state. “A sober look at a century of history testing provides no evidence for the ‘gradual disintegration of cultural memory’ or ‘a growing historical ignorance,’ ” Wineburg contends. “The only thing growing seems to be our amnesia of past ignorance.” Of course, hearing that people in 2018 have a lack of knowledge about the Holocaust feels different than hearing that people in 1915 had a lack of knowledge about Jefferson Davis. But I think the positive results of the survey questions that ask whether people think others should know, and care, about this history are far more important—and heartening. And, as Shulman points out, knowledge and care about a historical event don’t necessarily have to fade as the event recedes further into the past. But the framing here is troubling -- that historical knowledge and care about the Holocaust is dependent on closeness in time, and that as survivors and memories slip away, we are doomed. That's just not true. — Peter A. Shulman 📚 (@pashulman) April 12, 2018 Of course, we should mourn the loss of the survivors who’ve spent years telling us what happened. Their testimony was crucial; they’re leaving us just as we face a global crisis that’s testing whether historical memory of fascism’s effects will prevent disaster. But as long as we’ve got the will to remember, there’s hope.","We’re forgetting about the Holocaust.

Mike Pesca,"Pete Buttigieg speaks at the National Action Network Convention on Thursday in New York City.
Reports: Mueller Team Lived in Magic Fantasy World, Expected Trump to Handle Its Conclusions in Good Faith
Its Been a Tremendous Week for the Dignity and Influence of the Office of the Presidency
Joe Biden Is Not What Matters Here
Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos Agree to Gigantic Divorce Settlement
So far, every major Democratic candidate for president has had to face down some serious issues about past actions that are being scrutinized in a new light.
We may be too close to the cascading stories of Joe Bidens handsiness to properly assess whether the New York Times repeated use of the word crisis to describe Nuzzlegate is overblown, but I think overblown it may well be. Beto ORourke took donations from people who work in the oil business, which can be explained by the fact that as a U.S. representative from El Paso he was representing people from El Paso. Kamala Harris, while a prosecutor, seems to have been almost prosecutorial in her treatment of criminals, whom she often treated like they were criminals of some sort. And then theres Amy Klobuchar, who allegedly threw fits and office supplies at members of her staff. Peoplehey, you cant throw binders at them, you cant rub noses with them. Whats a Democratic politician to do?
Then theres Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Recently, a supposed controversy involving Buttigieg bubbled up: It was revealed that in a speech he gave four years ago, he uttered the words all lives matter. But he also spoke at length about racism, diversity, and the relevance of those issues on policing.
More importantly, the idea that all lives matter were fighting wordsan insensitive, trollish rebuke to Black Lives Matterwas not as fully in the air back then. Buttigieg says he didnt understand the implication then, in his 2015 State of the City address, and I believe him.
Ill walk through a timeline of the phrases usage to explain why.
Back in 2015, Jamelle Bouie wrote for Slate about then candidate Martin OMalley responding to Black Lives Matter protesters by saying, Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter. OMalley, trying to appeal to a black audience, unwittingly stepped in it. Bouie explained it was as if someone were to respond to an annual breast cancer drive with Breast cancer matters. Prostate cancer matters. All cancer matters. It sounds like a dismissal, and thats how it was received. At the time Bouies explanation was necessary because many white peopleand evidently white politicianshad yet to realize that all lives matter had the qualities of rebuke or dismissal.
OMalleys statement wasnt totally benign, because he did use the phrase in response to the criticism that black lives matter. A month earlier, speaking before the black congregants at Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Missouri, Hillary Clinton also used the phrase all lives matter, summing up lessons she learned from her mother: I asked her, What kept you going? Her answer was very simple. Kindness along the way from someone who believed she mattered. All lives matter. Upon hearing these words the mostly black audience applauded.
Note that Hillarys utterance, which did receive blowback online, wasnt seen as so tone-deaf as to prevent the famously cautious Hillary Clinton from saying it. It was more than three months earlier that Buttigieg said all lives matter as he addressed tension facing his police department. And he didnt say it in response to a question of whether black lives matter, which hes affirmed many times, including this week at the National Action Network Convention. The phrase was uttered at the end of Buttigieg spending close to 1,000 words speaking on issues of race, diversity, and policing. At one point in the 2015 State of the City address he said this:
There is no escaping the fact that the most grievous injustices experienced by minorities in American history were often served at the hands of police officers. And every police officer today, even the most forward-thinking among them, even police officers who are themselves African American, is forced to deal with the fact that even if they had nothing personally to do with those injustices, the uniform did. And so for all the good reasons that our men and women have to be proud of that uniform and the service and sacrifice it represents, it also remains the case that the uniform has a lot to overcome.
Thats a pretty strong statement that I would think would please anyone with a commitment to criminal justice. And the three-word phrase that also appears in the speech is weak evidence of Pete Buttigiegs imperfection on this issue. I think wethe media, activists, people who earnestly want a president worthy of the titlein a quest to uproot a current president who deals in statements unmoored from their context, can do better than falling into those exact bad habits ourselves.

Anand Mohan J,"Written by Anand Mohan J | Noida | Published:November 11, 2017 5:53 am At the railway station For the last two days, trains have been delayed due to the intermittent smog at Shahdara railway station. However, on Thursday night, more than 40 irate passengers, who had been waiting for a train to Shamli, pelted stones, uprooted benches and shattered glass windows of the power cabin at Platform number 4. According to police, two passengers, who were caught uprooting benches, have been arrested from the spot. More than 40 passengers are being identified through CCTV cameras, and their photographs are being developed, said Shashi Kumar, Senior Divisional Security Commissioner (DSC). According to a Railway Police Force (RPF) officer stationed at Shahdara railway station, two passenger trains operating from Shamli to Delhi had been delayed by more than two hours. Meanwhile, the passengers had been waiting at the station from 6 pm. Furious over the delay, more than 40 passengers gathered outside the power cabin where the station master was sitting. “They started demanding that the station master give the location of the trains. However, when he could not meet their demands, the people started to pelt stones at his office. The office was housed several metres above the ground so the railway staff was safe. However, the stones broke though the window panes and damaged the door,” the RPF officer said. A combined police force reached the station and managed to pacify the passengers, the officer said, adding that the trains finally arrived at 8.35 pm.

"Mark Joseph Stern, Mark Joseph Stern","Randy Bryce at the “The Power Vote: Latinos’ Crucial Role in the 2018 and 2020 Elections” panel during Politicon at the Pasadena Convention Center on July 30 in Pasadena, California. Donald Trump rode to office promising a deportation force that would arrest and expel undocumented immigrants across the country. He has done what he promised. Shortly after assuming the presidency, Trump reversed the Obama administration’s policy of deprioritizing the deportation of noncriminal immigrants. He also encouraged Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents to step up their raids and collaborate with local police. The result has been an unprecedented crackdown on immigrant communities. ICE has arrested parents dropping off their kids at school and assault victims obtaining protective orders. It has seized disabled children, raided hospitals, and refused to release pregnant detainees. Its agents have been accused of falsifying evidence and subjecting immigrants to sexual abuse and physical assault. They’ve deported individuals who helped the U.S. government combat terrorism and gang violence back to their home countries, where they face certain persecution and possible death. Currently, ICE is attempting to deport an honorably discharged veteran who may have been the victim of entrapment. In light of these brutal tactics, a growing number of progressives have questioned whether ICE is past the point of reform. Sean McElwee, a policy analyst who helped start the movement to abolish ICE, has been pressing congressional candidates on their positions toward the agency, which was created just 15 years ago. Thus far, 14 Democrats have announced their support for defunding or abolishing ICE. This week, Randy Bryce, a candidate in Wisconsin who is vying for the seat that now belongs to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, became perhaps the most high-profile Democrat to declare that he wants to abolish the agency. A December poll commissioned by Democrats found a tight race, with Ryan holding a 6-point lead. On Wednesday, I spoke with Bryce over email about his criticism of ICE and hopes for reforming immigration enforcement in the U.S. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Mark Joseph Stern: Why did you decide to call for the abolition of ICE? Randy Bryce: I’ve met a lot of good people who live in terror on a daily basis. They didn’t want to uproot from their native country, but they felt they had no choice, no other way to provide a better future for their kids. I can understand that. I would do anything for my son. And I certainly wouldn’t stay somewhere if I felt he couldn’t thrive there, or I couldn’t provide a safe home for him. These immigrant families I’ve met and worked alongside—they work incredibly hard, they give back to their community, they create jobs and run small businesses. They embody the American dream. If our country provided them with any sort of real pathway to legal residency, I know they would jump through any number of hoops to do so. But we don’t—Paul Ryan and the president have failed to do that. Instead, they have given more and more funding and power to an agency that has abused it—deporting an increasing number of women, children, and asylum seekers with no criminal record back to countries where their lives are at risk, tearing apart their families. When agencies abuse their power that way, when they stray so far from their mission, and act in such contradiction with our shared American values, it’s fair to question whether that agency should exist at all. I am confident that other parts of the federal government could effectively carry out the functions of immigration and customs enforcement that are necessary, as they did 15 years ago before ICE was created. Do you support sanctuary laws like California’s, which limit local cooperation with federal immigration authorities? I don’t believe local law enforcement should be asked to do ICE’s job. My father is a retired cop. I know from his experiences how important police-community trust is, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions is threatening that by imposing new burdens on local law enforcement regarding their cooperation with ICE. Many police chiefs are reluctant to take on these additional responsibilities because it will hurt police-community trust and, consequently, weaken public safety. If victims and witnesses are unwilling to report crimes for fear of deportation, then dangerous criminals don’t get put behind bars. Studies suggest that localities where ICE and local law enforcement keep their responsibilities separate are actually safer, and, as a result, the Major Cities Chiefs Association has condemned the attorney general’s actions. Despite this opposition from law enforcement, the Trump administration has threatened to remove critical, unrelated federal funding from local communities if their local law enforcement agency does not comply with ICE’s mandates. As a congressman, I would oppose any efforts to defund so-called sanctuary jurisdictions. Do you have any concerns about Customs and Border Protection, another DHS agency? Since Trump took office, CBP has broken the law in its overzealous enforcement of Trump’s travel ban, destroyed humanitarian supplies left for migrants, and stretched its powers to search and seize individuals far from the border in states like New Hampshire. I oppose the travel ban. I see it as Islamophobic and I think it actually weakens our national security rather than enhancing it. But even those on the right who disagree with me on those points agree that the way the travel ban was implemented was incredibly poorly done. It stranded people midflight, caused massive confusion and civil unrest, and it violated basic rights. I do think that degree of dysfunction merits a formal congressional hearing into the DHS’s role in the implementation of that ban. I also think there should be a strict ban on the destruction of humanitarian aid provided by charitable groups. And the incident in New Hampshire does raise valid questions about whether we need to authorize CBP to act within 100 miles of the closest border. I’d like to learn more about how that radius was chosen and see if a more narrow restriction would be appropriate. What about the DHS itself? Some progressives have called for the whole department —which was formed just 15 years ago—to be dismantled. Would you support dismantling the DHS and devolving its agencies back to where they came from? I’m most familiar with ICE’s role because of the impact they’ve had on the First District. But I think with anything so newly created, we have to do a formal assessment of whether it’s working. I think Congress could orchestrate that assessment, and I would like to be a part of that if I’m elected.

Jeffry Bartash,"People living in big cities and surrounding areas have always had far more job opportunities than those living in rural America, but the divide between city and country has grown in the wake of the Great Recession. 
City dwellers really do have it much better than rural inhabitants, at least when it comes to job opportunities in the 21st century.
After looking at whos working in urban and rural areas, the Federal Reserve found that the labor market began to recover earlier and improve much faster in cities than in the countryside. While theres always been a gap, its become more severe during the current expansion 
The yawning gap between city and country is most glaring in whats known as the labor force participation rate. That is, the percentage of the working-age population that either has a job or is looking for one.
Lets start with urbanites. The percentage of prime-aged (25-54-year-old) residents who were working or looking for work climbed to 83% at the end of 2018 and finally topped the pre-recession average. 
By contrast, the participation rate for prime-aged rural Americans has recovered more slowly and is still under 80%. The rate had fallen to as low as 78.5% in the wake of the recession.
Why such as divide? 
The chief reason appears to be the long and ongoing shift in the economy from one based on manufacturing to one based on services, a process that began decades ago.
In modern times manufacturing has accounted for a bigger slice of rural jobs compared to service industries like finance, health care, technology and the like. Yet until 2017 the recovery in manufacturing employment was slow and halting.
Despite the strength in the past two years, the share of total employment in manufacturing has remained near its post-recession low, the Fed concluded.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell discussed rural poverty in a recent speech.
In Appalachia for instance, timber, coal mining, tobacco, and textiles have long been in decline, he said. Likewise, the number of jobs in agriculture and low-skilled manufacturing, mainstays of the Deltas economy, is decreasing as a result of automation and outsourcing.

The same cannot be said for service-oriented jobs. Theyve been on a tear, especially in areas such as white-collar employment and health care that tend to require greater education. Education levels tend to be higher in large metros where most service companies concentrate.
Its long been the case that lower levels of education in small-town America have contributed to the persistent urban-rural divide in the labor force. Yet education disparities do not explain why problem has become worse. 
The Fed, for example said the percentage of well-educated people in the labor force used to be higher in rural areas than in urban ones, but that is no longer so. The central bank said the shift in fortunes offers more proof that broader trends in the economy are mainly responsible.

In the past, Americans with declining job prospects in rural areas would usually migrate to the countrys population centers. Yet the Fed said the evidence suggests people have become far less willing to uproot in recent decades.
What has become of them?

90Min,"Crystal Palace have reportedly entered discussions with West Ham over midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate, as the club looks set to finally kick start their summer transfer window. The 28-year-old Senegalese International has been a mainstay in the first team for his four years at West Ham. He made 37 appearances for the club last season, as they narrowly avoided relegation from the top flight. New boss Manuel Pellegrini has been quick to stamp his mark on the squad though and has added Jack Wilshere and Felipe Anderson to the ranks. Pellegrini also has plenty of other central midfield options, and has allegedly told Kouyate he does not feature in his plans for next season. It was reported only recently that FC Porto were preparing to lure the combative midfielder to the Primeira Liga. Kouyate was being lined up for a potential £14m switch to the Portuguese top flight but according to Sky sources, Crystal Palace are set to offer the player a Premier League lifeline. Palace are hoping the mere 15-mile move could appeal more to Kouyate who won’t need to uproot his family to continue his playing career and are allegedly preparing a £10m bid. The Eagles allowed Yohan Cabaye to leave at the end of the season and have been on the lookout for a central midfield replacement. The south London club have been unable to complete any deals so far this summer other than the arrival of Vicente Guaita on a free transfer. Manager Roy Hodgson will be eager to add to a side that was under serious threat of relegation for the majority of last season.

Barak Barfi,"ANKARA – As Turkey intensifies its military campaign against Syrian Kurdish fighters, it is tempting to blame the violence on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’s strident jingoism and xenophobia. After all, Erdoğan has long warned that Turkey would never tolerate a Kurdish military presence on the country’s southern border; the recent offensive would seem to suggest that his words are being met with action. The Year Ahead 2018 The world’s leading thinkers and policymakers examine what’s come apart in the past year, and anticipate what will define the year ahead. Order now And yet, while Erdoğan may have ordered “ Operation Olive Branch,” the real culprit is the United States’ myopic focus on vanquishing regional jihadism. Bereft of a coherent Syria policy, successive US administrations have obsessed over targeting the Islamic State (ISIS) without considering the full ramifications of their actions. Turkey’s incursion into northwestern Syria is just one consequence. In July 2012, when the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) took over a string of Syrian border towns, Turkey was alarmed. The PYD is the Syrian branch of the Turkish Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been waging a guerrilla-style war against Turkey’s government since 1984. Initially, the US shared Erdoğan’s concerns. In August 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that, “Syria must not become a haven for PKK terrorists.” But after ISIS captured large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq, America found in the PYD a useful ally. Soon, the US was providing weapons and training to the PYD’s armed wing. Angered by these moves, Erdoğan sought assurances that American support for the Kurds would be temporary, and that Kurdish fighters would not cross the Euphrates river. But, after the Turks received the guarantees they wanted, the well-armed Kurds crossed the Euphrates anyway. Then, in August 2016, Vice President Joseph Biden publicly admonished the PYD fighters, warning that they would lose US support if they did not retreat. But the militants never fell back, and the US continued to arm and train them. In April 2017, an incensed Erdoğan declared that the Obama administration had “deceived” Turkey on the PKK. “I don’t believe the Trump administration will do the same,” he predicted. &amp;nbsp;YURI KOCHETKOV/AFP/Getty Images Feb 1, 2018 Christopher Walker says the term “soft power” fails to capture how authoritarian regimes are exercising global influence. 1 Add to Bookmarks Joe Sohm/Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images Jan 31, 2018 Carmen M.

Despite reportedly promising that US weapons transfers would halt, President Donald Trump has not changed course, and American arms continue to flow to the Kurds. For these reasons, Turkey’s leaders have lost faith in anything the US government says. The two countries cannot even agree on the contents of a presidential phone call, as their conflicting accounts of a conversation last month illustrates. How did relations between two NATO allies reach such a low point? Much of the answer can be traced to President Barack Obama’s refusal to deploy combat troops against ISIS, in favor of a light footprint using local forces aided by US airstrikes and training. This approach was first tried in Iraq, but backfired when the Iranian-supported Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) seized territory. The consequences of that decision, which the US has largely chosen to ignore, will come to a head in April, when PMF commanders plan to run in Iraq’s parliamentary election. In Syria, the Kurds have proved to be a more reliable proxy. But their allegiance to the US has come at a cost. Obama was willing to overlook their fighters’ ties to the PKK, using subtle hairsplitting to differentiate between indistinguishable groups. Never truly appreciating Erdoğan’s apprehension, Obama chose to address Turkey’s concerns only superficially. When Trump came to office, his lack of interest in details and inclination to grandstand exacerbated tensions. A key feature of Trump’s presidency has been his desire to ingratiate himself with guests by offering what he cannot deliver (as he did during a recent meeting with congressional Democrats on immigration). This penchant to please appears to have resulted in Trump making promises to Erdoğan that the Pentagon decision-makers guiding America’s Iraq and Syria policies never intended to keep. But, unlike US lawmakers, Erdoğan has an army that marches at his discretion. And Turkey views the PKK as an existential threat, and regards the PYD as its Syrian lethal appendage. America’s muddled messaging, delivered by a president unskilled in policy nuance or diplomacy, has inflamed a critical relationship, and in turn, jeopardized the fight against ISIS. Despite Trump’s State of the Union claim that ISIS is nearly defeated, some 3,000 fighters remain in Syria, occasionally even capturing territory. In short, America’s policy is self-defeating. Not only is it emboldening adversaries such as Iran and its PMF proxies; it is also imperiling some 2,000 US soldiers who are working with the Kurds in Syria. Obama’s instincts were not wrong. Full-scale invasions rarely succeed in uprooting jihadist threats. But America’s subcontracting of its battles to local fighters in Syria has created new perils. If Trump is to break with the past and earn the credit he is claiming, the US must find a new way to achieve its security goals without deploying entire divisions. At the moment, however, the US is offering Turkey – and the region – only incoherence and more empty promises.","The Trump administration's muddled messaging to Turkey on US efforts to uproot ISIS in Syria has inflamed tensions between two NATO allies.

90Min,"Last month, Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud was adamant that he would fight for his career at the club. In the face of transfer rumours he insisted that his Arsenal 'story' was unfinished, though it looks now that the Frenchmen will have to bookmark his story, as he searches for more playing time. According to the Mirror, Arsenal look set to lose Giroud in January as the player will now push for a loan move. The 31-year-old striker will seek more playing time, which will put several Premier League clubs on alert. Though, with his wife Jennifer expecting a third child, it narrows the search down to London clubs only, meaning both West Ham and Crystal Palace will be front-runners for his signature. A nameless source close to the ­situation at Arsenal said: “Olivier does not want to disturb and uproot his family. “Ideally, he wants to stay but he needs football – there are options in London for him.” (via Mirror ) With the Europa League group stage now finished, gone are Giroud's assurance of game time with it. The competition presented opportunities for the striker to start for the club, though with the competition on hiatus until February he'll have to wait on either the FA cup or wait morbidly on injuries to the team for playing time. These options don't seem viable for the French forward who needs to impress for his participation at next summer's World Cup.

thesson@politico.com (Ted Hesson),"The decision to end the program will uproot the lives of Haitians who have been in the United States for years. Children hold posters asking the federal government to renew temporary protected status in Miami, Florida on Nov. 6. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images The Trump administration will terminate a humanitarian status extended to roughly 59,000 Haitians living in the United States, but with an 18-month delay, the Homeland Security Department announced Monday evening. Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke faced a Thanksgiving Day deadline to decide whether to renew so-called temporary protected status for Haitians, who were initially granted that status after a destructive earthquake hit the island nation in 2010. Story Continued Below After consulting U.S. and Haitian officials, Duke decided that on-the-ground conditions in Haiti no longer warranted the protection granted under the program. The move means that the Haitians given temporary protected status, or TPS, may remain until July 22, 2019, but could face deportation after that date. The decision came after “an intense interagency review process” that also took into account Haiti’s ability to repatriate tens of thousands of people, a senior administration official said on a background call with reporters. Temporary protected status allows nationals of a country beset by a natural disaster or armed conflict to remain in the United States and apply for work permits, but the designation needs to be renewed by the DHS secretary every six to 18 months. In the past such renewals have been granted routinely. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. But the Trump administration has taken a stricter view of renewal criteria. When then-DHS Secretary John Kelly awarded Haitian recipients a six-month extension in May, he cautioned enrollees to prepare to depart the U.S. The decision to end TPS for Haitians represents a defeat for a broad range of forces who lobbied to preserve the protections, including Republican and Democratic lawmakers from states such as Florida, New Jersey and New York. Haitian officials also pressed Duke to renew the status. Haitian Ambassador Paul Altidor and Foreign Affairs Minister Antonio Rodrigue met with Duke one week ago to petition for an extension, administration officials confirmed Monday. In the meeting, the pair laid out their case for a renewal, Altidor told POLITICO last week. Roughly 40,000 people who lost their homes in the earthquake still live in camps for the displaced, the ambassador said in a letter to DHS earlier this month. Altidor also cited a cholera epidemic that killed thousands of people in the aftermath of the earthquake. The TPS renewal process, an obscure bureaucratic matter under past administrations, veered into more dramatic territory in recent weeks. When Duke faced TPS decisions for Honduras and Nicaragua earlier this month, White House chief of staff John Kelly reportedly phoned her to press for a termination, saying further delay ""prevents our wider strategic goal"" on immigration, according to the Washington Post. But Duke bucked the White House and granted six month renewal of TPS for 86,000 Hondurans. She simultaneously ended TPS for 5,300 Nicaraguans, but gave them until January 2019 to leave the country or adjust to another immigration status. A senior administration official told POLITICO the decision to allow an automatic renewal for Hondurans was due to “late arriving and conflicting information” about the conditions in the country. Duke needed more time to fully consider the decision, the official said. In contrast, the department had been gathering information about Haiti's enrollment for months, according to the official. “The administration had been intensively discussing these issues with the Haitian government since General Kelly issued a six-month extension in May,” the official said. The decision to end the program will uproot the lives of Haitians who have been in the United States for years. The move will hit hardest in Florida, home to roughly two-thirds of Haitian TPS enrollees, according to data from the non-profit Center for Migration Studies. Sens. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) urged Duke to grant Haitians a full 18-month extension in a letter sent to Duke late last week. The pair were joined by eight other lawmakers from the Florida delegation who said ""the need for a full extension is clear."" Rubio also penned an op-ed Friday in the Miami Herald. “If TPS is not extended,” he wrote, “Haitians sent home will face dire conditions, including lack of housing, inadequate health services and low prospects for employment.” This article tagged under: Missing out on the latest scoops?

Richard Janvrin,"Tony Dejak/Associated Press For the second year in a row, the Cleveland Cavaliers fell to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. But this time they got swept, and now the trajectory of the team as a whole could drastically change. It all depends on LeBron James and his offseason decision. And although they got swept, James averaged 34 points per game as well as 10 assists and 8.5 rebounds. It's clear to say that he did more than his fair share. After putting up those kinds of numbers and still getting swept, how does that factor into his future plans? According to Brian Windhorst of ESPN on the Lowe Post podcast (h/t Chris Ross of LeBronWire), it's his ""feel"" that James will opt out of his deal, and the two real choices will come down to the Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. Windhorst also noted that the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs would then be out of the market for James, though the Philadelphia 76ers would have a shot still. Windhorst also reported (h/t Erik García Gundersen of LeBronWire) days later that the Cavaliers are in a position to move on without James. With their first-round pick in this year's draft, they took Collin Sexton out of Alabama, but LeBron had no influence on the pick. It was also reported that the Kyrie Irving trade to the Boston Celtics was part of their ""life without James"" plan and just moving forward altogether. To summarize this, it sounds like the Cavaliers still have a great chance to retain the King, but they're prepared to move on without him if necessary. Without James, the Cavaliers would be reduced to one of the worst teams in the entire NBA, but perhaps with Kevin Love in the fold and in a weak Eastern Conference, they could swing a low playoff seed. The Lakers, and teaming up with Lonzo Ball and potentially Kawhi Leonard seems like a legitimate landing spot for James. Leonard would be what it would take for James to go there too it seems, as LeBron would likely be reluctant to head to Los Angeles if he's the only star there. If he were to join the Lakers he'd be in the Western Conference, meaning he'd have to face the Warriors prior to a championship. That's what makes staying in Cleveland interesting. He stays in the East, doesn't need to uproot his family and can lure guys like Paul George to join him. Expect this decision to drag out for a little while. The Lakers are the current favorites at -150 (bet $150 to win $100) for James' services, according to OddsShark. Could we see James leave once again?","For the second year in a row, the Cleveland Cavaliers fell to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals.

Melissa Locker,"In January of this year, Lin-Manuel Miranda returned to Puerto Rico, where his parents grew up, and brought the entire stage production of Hamilton with him. The idea was to use the Broadway smash as a fundraiser to help the island and its struggling arts scene to rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. To sweeten the deal, Miranda would return to the role he created, playing Alexander Hamilton for a three-week-long fundraiser in San Juan. The ploy worked: Hamilton fans jumped at the chance to see Miranda reprise the role and were willing to fork over up to $5,000 for tickets.
It was all to help Puerto Rico’s arts community, which had very little funding even before the hurricane. In fact, Miranda was planning on doing the fundraiser even before the hurricane struck.
“The Mirandas wanted to invest in a key, key, key fundamental piece of the island, which is its arts and culture,” says Kristin Ehrgood, the CEO and board chair of the Flamboyan Foundation, which worked with the Miranda family to launch the Flamboyan Arts Fund. Flamboyan Arts is a limited-term fund created to funnel Hamilton proceeds to support institutions, arts groups, and independent artists in Puerto Rico, particularly helping them rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Early beneficiaries of the arts fund include, among others, the Puerto Rico Art Museum, puppet theater company Y No Habia Luz, and Andanza, a dance troupe. Recipients of the fund’s grants are selected by a board, which the Miranda family sits on.
While some people may scoff that the arts are a poor investment, the arts can play an important role in building hope, restoring the heart and soul of the island’s inhabitants, and, as it turns out, dramatically stimulating the economy. “Since day one, our administration has focused on promoting the growth of Puerto Rico’s economy and identified tourism as one of the segments with the most potential for development,” Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rosselló Nevares told Fast Company.
That’s why one of his first acts as governor was to set up Puerto Rico’s destination marketing organization, Discover Puerto Rico, which is tasked with drawing visitors to the Caribbean island. While the government’s priorities shifted a bit in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, as the island works to rebuild, tourism, particularly arts-fueled tourism, is playing a significant role. For proof that it works, look to the fact that Hamilton helped raise $14 million for the arts fund, and brought visitors to the island who stayed at hotels, ate local food, and otherwise helped bring money to the island.
“This is much, much bigger than the production onstage for three weeks,” says Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico. “We view this as a launching pad for the repositioning of the brand of Puerto Rico as a destination for the arts. We believe that the real strength of Puerto Rico as a tourism destination is in the rich vibrant culture.”
It was Discover Puerto Rico that told Marriott—which owns several hotels across the island—that Hamilton with Miranda at the helm was coming to the island. “We knew we wanted to get involved,” said Diana Plazas, a Marriott International marketing executive for the Caribbean and Latin America. “We wanted to make sure we were doing our part to support the island, doing our part to support the recovery, but also the community of the island.” In addition to being a corporate sponsor, Marriott also provided hotel rooms for the show’s cast and crew.
Marriott hotels has guaranteed a minimum donation of $300,000 to the arts fund. To help them meet that donation goal, Marriott donated $1 for every room booked at some of its properties. It’s not alone in wanting to be involved in Hamilton’s visit to the island and the goodwill it invoked. Other corporate sponsors like JetBlue, Banco Popular, Church’s Chicken, Airbnb, and Warner Bros. all donated funds of more than $200,000 to the Arts Fund.
More work to be done
It’s not just the money, though. While bringing Hamilton to Puerto Rico certainly raised plenty of that, it also drew attention the island’s ongoing struggles. “People are going to come to Puerto Rico because of Hamilton, and hopefully spend a lot of money here,” Miranda told the New York Times in an interview. “But they’re also going to see blue tarps and they’re also going to see how much work there is to be done.”
“Every show has felt like opening night,” Donald Webber Jr., who played Aaron Burr during the Hamilton run in Puerto Rico, told Fast Company. “A lot of it has to do with Lin being here, being back in this place where he spent just about every summer . . . Even though this crazy unbelievable thing happened that destroyed his town, he, just like the Puerto Rican people, persevered. He didn’t let the hurricane define him. He came out stronger and better. It is unbelievable to watch every night, seeing Lin actively fighting back those emotions to perform.”

Open for business
Miranda’s bold decision to uproot his entire Broadway show and take it to the island already inspired other performers to follow suit—specifically, Jimmy Fallon, who was inspired by Miranda to bring The Tonight Show to the island to help boost tourism, and let viewers know about other ways to help in the rebuilding process. “I gotta say, we had Lin-Manuel Miranda announce he was taking (Hamilton) to Puerto Rico,” Fallon told NBC News. “I was just inspired because that’s so hard to do. I don’t think people understand how hard it is to take a Broadway show outside of Broadway.” They went to Puerto Rico in January to tape an episode and, of course, see Hamilton.
The resulting episode was a celebration of Puerto Rico, complete with Fallon and musicians Questlove and Bad Bunny leading a carnival parade through the streets of Old San Juan, chef Jose Andres taking Fallon on a tour of beachside food kiosks in Piñones, and musicians Jose Feliciano and Ozuna singing “En Mi Viejo San Juan” at La Fortaleza.
“It’s a love song about a Puerto Rican who has left the island but dreams about going home,” explains Jennifer Long, a consulting producer for this episode of The Tonight Show, who grew up in San Juan. “There is no song more special to Puerto Ricans and no song more appropriate for this moment in time.”
While the episode was fun to watch, it carried with it a very important message: Puerto Rico is open for business. “Without a doubt, the best thing we could hope for—and I know this is so important to Jimmy—is go visit! Puerto Rico is up and running for business and they want your business and, quite frankly, they need it.”
That echoes what Manuel Laboy, secretary of the Department of Economic Development and Commerce for Puerto Rico, told Fast Company a year ago: “You want to help Puerto Rico? Go on vacation there.” It remains true.
While Hamilton has ended its run, the island has an ongoing rich cultural scene, spurred on by the influx of cash to the grantees of the Flamboyan Arts Fund. “Puerto Rico has the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean and has unique cultural offerings such as museums, year-round cultural festivals, theater opportunities, musical concerts, and historic zones that appeal to all types of visitors,” Governor Rosselló said. “We want the world to know that Puerto Rico is Open for Business, that as we recover and rebuild, our island stands as the most exciting place in the United States for people to come visit.”

Chester Dawson,"But during Mr. Kellys 30 years with the Japanese auto maker, say former executives who worked with him, he became well-known inside the companymost significantly in the last decade as gatekeeper and confidant to Mr. Ghosn, who ran Nissan for more than 15 years as chief executive officer. Japanese prosecutors suspect that Mr. Kelly helped Mr. Ghosn understate his compensation on Nissan securities reports for the five years through March 2015. The two men, who havent been formally charged with any crime, are now in custody at a Tokyo jail and couldnt be reached for comment. Mr. Kelly, a U.S. citizen, was one of the few Americans to hold senior leadership roles at a company led mostly by European and Japanese executives. He was also the first and only American to become a senior-ranking director on Nissans board when he joined it in 2012, putting him alongside Mr. Ghosn and Hiroto Saikawa, who took over Nissan as CEO last year. Auto executive, Carlos Ghosn, was the architect of an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, a rare success story of auto makers working together. WSJ reporters analyze the impact on his legacy following his arrest over financial misconduct. Photo: Getty Images During a press conference Monday, Mr. Saikawa described Mr. Kelly as a Ghosn adviser and said an internal investigation at Nissan showed him to be the mastermind behind the alleged financial misconduct. Mr. Saikawa didnt elaborate on the findings of the investigation, which Nissan brought to prosecutors. At the time of their arrest, Messrs. Ghosn and Kelly were in Japan for a board meeting, but they didnt arrive together, according to people briefed on their plans. Mr. Kelly was viewed within Nissan as wielding considerable influence at the auto maker, where he at one point served as Mr. Ghosns most senior aide and controlled his daily schedule; former executives described him as a sort of chief of staff. The 62-year-old company veteran was known for being fiercely loyal to Mr. Ghosn, who often turned to him to troubleshoot problems and deal with personnel matters, these people said. He was Carlos Ghosns shield. His inside man, said a former subordinate of Mr. Kelly. But Mr. Kelly made few public appearances and worked mostly behind the scenes, even after he was put in charge of Nissans corporate communications during his years in Japan, the former colleagues said. Several described him as ghostlike. He was very discreet, a bit of a ghost, said one executive who worked with him. Mr. Kelly once headed global human resources, a powerful position at a company where lifelong employment is typical in Japan and managers are often moved around the world. His other roles as head of corporate communications and the legal department at Nissan gave him some control over the information flow within the company. Nissan said it couldnt comment on the specifics of the monthslong investigation. Obviously, as a company we are not taking them lightly, said a company spokesman, who agreed with the description of Mr. Kelly as gatekeeper close to Mr. Ghosn. Jim Press, a longtime auto industry executive who has served as an adviser for Nissans alliance with Renault SA, RNO 1.10% said he was taken aback by the allegations involving Mr. Kelly. Greg is one of the most capable, ethical executives Ive ever met, Mr. Press said. After getting his law degree in 1981, Mr. Kelly worked for a few years as an attorney before joining the legal department at Nissans U.S. subsidiary in 1988. He quietly rose through the ranks; when he helped orchestrate the relocation of the companys U.S. headquarters from California to Nashville in 2006, many executives left the company because they didnt want to uproot, the former executives said. As head of human resources in North America, Mr. Kelly hired many of their replacements. In 2008, he moved to Japan to run the legal department for Nissan and became the head of the CEOs office later that year, a job for which he ran board meetings. In 2009, he added the roles of global human resources chief and communications director for Nissan. He joined the board in 2012. He would occasionally join close colleagues for a drink after work during his time in Japan, former colleagues said. He limited interactions with most staff in the office to troubleshooting problems, they said. Mr. Kelly was a very professional, stand-up guy, and could be extremely cordial, but could be tough when things went sideways, said one of the former executives who worked with him. Mr. Kelly was very close to Mr. Ghosn and worked with him around the clock, even while keeping a low profile, a former executive said. As human resources chief, he helped his boss decide on promotionsa role Mr. Kellys former subordinate said made employees nervous about crossing him. He was known to sideline people who he didnt see as team players, said former executives. He groomed many senior executives, the former executives said, before stepping away from his day-to-day operational roles in 2015. In recent years, he spent much of his time at his house on Sanibel Island in Florida, where he was an avid fisherman and owned a twin hull boat, according to public records and an executive who worked with him. But he remained a member of the Nissan board of directors and a frequent presence at the companys U.S. headquarters outside Nashville, according to another former executive.

Leonid Bershidsky,"British writer David Goodhart's ""somewhere vs. anywhere"" framework, pitting those who are left behind by modernity versus globalist cosmopolitans, has worked for many people as an explanation of recent populist successes throughout the Western world. But what if the places in which rooted ""somewheres"" live explain the populist phenomenon better than any other problems these people face in adapting to what passes for progress these days? That, in a nutshell, is the idea London School of Economics professor of economic geography Andres Rodriguez-Pose puts forward : in other words, that populist ballot-box successes are a ""revenge of the places that don't matter."" Interpersonal inequality, he argues, isn't the driving force here. Territorial inequality is. ""Lagging or declining regions voted differently to prosperous ones,"" Rodriguez-Pose writes, in the Brexit referendum, the 2016 U.S. and Austrian presidential elections, the 2017 French presidential and German parliamentary elections -- as well as, for example, in Thailand's 2011 election. One could add plenty of examples to this list. This year's Czech presidential ballot, for example, was a clear case of relatively depressed countryside vs. dynamic cities, with the former ensuring President Milos Zeman's reelection. The economically struggling south and eastern parts of Poland provided strong support for the Law &amp; Justice Party. Even in Russia, were elections are more of a fiction than almost anywhere in the West, it's evident that President Vladimir Putin's dominance stems from depressed and rural regions; in the country's all-important major cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, his support is relatively low. A similar pattern is in evidence for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Intuitively, the idea of shifting blame for the rise of populism from demographics to economic geography doesn't necessarily seem productive. Big, dynamic cities just have greater shares of ""achievers"" and smaller ones of ""the left behind,"" who may vote the same as peers in the hinterland but whose will is obscured in the statistics because they are not the majority. At first glance, this is just another way to package, perhaps less offensively, the proposition that smart cosmopolitans resist the dark tide, while their less enlightened country cousins don't. But the geographic focus can lead to important insights. ""Anywhere"" people, too, live somewhere, namely in cosmopolitan boomtowns such as London or New York; one often hears from them that they associate with the city much more than with the surrounding country. ""Left behind"" is an expression with geographical roots: From one of the great urban centers, people living in ""flyover country"" look like those who wanted to catch a plane somewhere better but missed it. But many of them, as Rodriguez-Pose points out, may be too emotionally attached to the places where they live to uproot themselves. That's not about being ""left behind"" -- it's about putting those cultural and community roots above economic interests. The way in which ""places that don't matter"" have taken their political revenge fits this pattern, too. They have put a premium on drawing attention to themselves even if it costs them. Brexit, for example, will disproportionally hurt the regions that voted for it. This interpretation of the populist voting patterns makes things difficult for policymakers. If regional inequality is the heart of the problem, then focusing on the prosperous areas that attract the most achievement-focused people from everywhere else and hoping their tide will lift all boats is fundamentally wrong, especially in countries where regional voting patterns are important -- such as the U.S. In fact, even within such constellations of prosperity, there are ""places that don't matter."" In cosmopolitan Berlin, the eastern boroughs, filled with Communist-era high-rise buildings, vote consistently for the far left. In Moscow, the lower the average real estate price in a neighborhood, the higher Putin's percentage of the vote. Fixing populism means smarter regional development policies. Rodriguez-Pose and two LSE colleagues, Simona Iammarino and Michael Storper, proposed some ideas for them in a 2017 paper, but most of them are in the ""easier said than done"" category: Improving government quality and eradicating corruption, investing more in infrastructure, overhauling educational systems, cutting red tape to stimulate business growth. If national governments were good at this kind of thing, the problem wouldn't exist today. And populist governments aren't really interested in fixing the regional disparities because big city envy is an easy resource to tap. The current phase of global economic development is about the growth and outsized influence of major cities, but politically and practically it makes no sense to have them make all the big decisions. Governments interested in reducing political division may need to focus on devising policies to counter the trend -- without turning the poorer regions into permanently aid-dependent ones.

Jenny Drezin,"Last week my startup was accepted to a New York City-based accelerator. I jumped at the opportunity, both because of the doors it could open and the generous funding it would provide. But I was aware of the challenges, as my previous startup was part of an accelerator in London not long ago.
At that time, I believed the U.K.-based accelerator was exactly what our company needed. We had chosen London as the first city to launch our app, and reasoned that this program would offer us instant office space, networking, and mentorship. It was the perfect way to test our product–an urban discovery app–at the source, as well as understand the mind-set of potential users.
There was only one problem: I live in Tel Aviv, thousands of miles away from London and am a mom to two young kids. In my heart, I knew we had to do the program. There was no way we could create the right product without spending a significant amount of time onsite.
But what about my family? The most obvious choice would be for me to “commute” to London, traveling back and forth, every couple of weeks. But this would be expensive, tiring, and difficult, not to mention creating separation scenarios with my kids on a regular basis. 
Another thought was for our whole family to pack up and go to London together. But the expense and logistics of doing this were daunting. It simply didn’t make sense to uproot the kids from school for only a couple of months. So I chose the “easiest” option, which was also the toughest decision of my life. I chose to go to London for the full two months on my own.
I have to admit, one part of me was excited. To have time to myself in a world-class city was a luxury I hadn’t experienced since my first daughter was born. I was so conditioned to planning trips through a child-friendly lens, I believed I would hardly know what to do with the extra hours I would have spent caring for the children.
Furthermore, I was in a privileged position of having a husband who was not only supportive of my move but was also domestic. I had no worries that the house would fall apart in my absence. And my kids–while still young–were not babies. They no longer needed me by their side every moment.  
Then guilt started to creep in. My internal doubts were magnified when I told other moms what I was planning. “How could you do that? I could never spend such a long time away from my kids,” was a common response. I wondered if I was crazy or selfish for even considering such a thing. Would it hurt my children? Would it make me a terrible mom? Then again, would a man even have this dilemma?
I imagine other female (and male) entrepreneurs who are parents have faced similar conflicts. Y Combinator, for example, the most selective American accelerator program, requires founders to be onsite in Silicon Valley for three months. They also encourage founding teams to live together, to foster the kinds of spontaneous collaborations and brainstorming common among college dorm mates. But how does this model work unless everyone who participates is single and childless? Does every innovator need to fit the same mold?  
One day a woman in my coworking space approached me. “You’re so brave!” she said. “I overheard you making plans to stay in London. I also need to spend a few months abroad for my business, but I’m not sure how it will affect my kids.”
That’s when it hit me that one person’s courageous is another person’s crazy. Rather than lead a stable, more comfortable life, I had already made unusual choices, starting with my decision to found a startup at this point in my life. I was not your typical parent with a stable job, set salary, and defined schedule. This choice to go to London wasn’t really all that different.
Rather, it was part of the many sacrifices I would make as a founder. One of the biggest issues in the startup world is the glorification of struggle–the idea that a founder needs to do anything humanly possible to make his or her company succeed. Someone even coined a name for it: “struggle porn.” But the stereotypical struggle is a twentysomething guy sleeping on his friend’s couch, eating ramen noodles long enough to raise money from Silicon Valley investors. It’s not a mom of two, faced with the dilemma of spending months away from her children to increase her chances of success.
In the end, despite the fact that I hadn’t lived with a roommate in more than a decade, I began to search for a flat share in London and moved in. There were many difficult days when the mommy guilt crept in. While I kept in regular contact with my family, sometimes I’d get home too late from a pitch competition or networking party to video chat with the kids. I missed a few of my daughter’s performances, several holidays, and spent my birthday on my own. Sometimes it felt like I was living two parallel lives, and wondered if I could be both a great parent and a great entrepreneur. But staying in London helped me recharge personally. And in that time, I created awesome connections and advanced the company immensely. My kids were none the worse for wear when we reunited several months later.
While I don’t regret the decision I made, it’s not for everyone. I wish there were more structures in place to help women, parents, and nontraditional startup founders find more balance in their lives–things like online accelerators, mama founder groups, and coworking spaces with childcare. I wish the startup world put less emphasis on struggle and more on mental health and support. I definitely could have used it in my toughest days abroad, and I could certainly use the support today. But I believe that the happier and more fulfilled I am as a human being and a professional, the better parent I will ultimately be.

Jason Del Rey,"Matt Kaness, the former CEO of ModCloth who sold the women’s fashion retailer to Walmart one year ago, has recently left the mammoth brick-and-mortar retailer, multiple sources have told Recode. Walmart acquired ModCloth in March of last year to help boost the fashion assortment of its subsidiary Jet.com, and Kaness continued to run that retail operation for the next few months. But the retail industry veteran later turned down a move from San Francisco to Los Angeles after Walmart management decided that the CEO role should be based there, ultimately paving the way for his exit, according to one source. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the departure and added: “We thank Matt for his contributions to ModCloth and wish him all the best in the future.” Kaness did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment. Kaness joined ModCloth as CEO in early 2015 after a stint as chief strategy officer of Urban Outfitters. Under Kaness’ leadership, the vintage-inspired clothing retailer grew its private-label business and tested out physical showrooms. But ModCloth found itself in trouble last year as a debt repayment came due and the company was unable to secure new venture funding. That scenario set up a fire sale to Walmart for a price reportedly under $50 million. When Walmart continued its acquisition spree by acquiring menswear brand Bonobos in June, e-commerce chief Marc Lore decided that ModCloth leadership would report to Bonobos co-founder and CEO Andy Dunn. And Dunn and Walmart management decided that whoever ran ModCloth as CEO needed to be based in Los Angeles, where important divisions like design and merchandising were already based, according to one source. Kaness declined to make that move, at least in part because he did not want to uproot his family from the San Francisco Bay Area, these people said. ModCloth’s CEO role is now held by former Bonobos Chief Financial Officer Antonio Nieves, who also previously held the same role at ModCloth. Kaness stayed at Walmart for a few months after declining the move to Los Angeles, and held the title of EIR — or executive in residence — according to his Twitter bio. It is believed that at some point Kaness was charged with finding a company for Walmart to acquire that he would then run, according to a source, but that opportunity apparently never materialized. recode_logomark Recode Daily Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Marshall Project, Yolanda Martinez and Celina Fang, The Marshall Project","Editor's note: Essay published in partnership with The Marshall Project. Police departments around the United States deal with a litany of challenges, such as limited resources, strained community relations and a growing opioid crisis. In hundreds of small communities nationwide, there are officers who manage all of this alone — they are one-person law enforcement agencies. When you’re the only cop on the beat, the work can be challenging, especially responding to reports of burglaries or domestic violence without backup. “You know everybody, and you know how they are. You're seeing them at their worst, but you know how they are at their best, too,” says Robin Daniels, the chief of police in Seldovia, Alaska, which has a population of 600. “You're locking up people you know.” Much of the time, the job can also be slow-moving, dealing with the everyday routines of small town life. Photographer Harris Mizrahi spent time with three solo police chiefs to observe how they deal with the demands of policing on their own. Galleries viewed best at full screen. Ellendale, Delaware, police chief Bruce Von Goerres allows a man to collect his belongings after an arrest. (Photo: Harris Mizrahi/For The Marshall Project) 'Broken-windows' approach to policing Officer: Bruce E. Von Goerres Town: Ellendale, Delaware Population: 431 2017 arrests: 176 In 2015, Bruce E. Von Goerres became chief of police in Ellendale, Delaware, after a 30-year career with state law enforcement. In the 1970s, the town created its first police department. But that was shut down a decade later because of a lack of funds. The town opened another police department in the 1990s. Von Goerres uses a “broken-windows” approach to policing, focusing on small, nuisance offenses that are thought to lead to more serious crimes. He most often deals with property and drug crimes, and he's regularly confronted with the local effects of the opioid epidemic — drug deals, prostitution and overdoses. After a close call with a woman who overdosed in the backseat of a car, he now carries Narcan, a nasal spray that can reverse an opioid overdose. Ellendale’s police department is housed in a small room in the same building as its town hall. Often Von Goerres heads seven miles away to Milton to process his arrests where he can use their live-scan fingerprinting station and video conference with a magistrate. Twice a week, chief Chad Johanning, center, meets with fire chief Russell Stephenson, left, and former police chief B.J. Smith. (Photo: Harris Mizrahi/For The Marshall Project) Concealed carry and firearms drills Officer: Chad Johanning Town: Little River, Kansas Population: About 600 2017 arrests: 9 In rural Nickerson, Kansas, where Chad Johanning grew up, the only law enforcement officer around was a county sheriff. It wasn't until after he graduated from high school that the town hired its own cop. Now he’s a one-man police department in an equally small Kansas town. After years of working for a half-dozen police and sheriff’s departments in Central Kansas, he took the job in Little River when its chief retired last year. Little River, about 230 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, has a total area of less than half a square mile. Once a salt-mining town, it now consists of a few businesses — a local cafe, a pub and a small post office. Johanning handles everything from school fights and loud music complaints to domestic battery. In Kansas, gun owners can carry a concealed firearm, even without a license, and Johanning says that plays into how he approaches policing. “My philosophy is as long as you don't pull it on me, I won't pull it on you,” he says. But after school shootings around the country, the principal of the local high school expressed concern, and Johanning now holds active shooter trainings for the students and teachers. Not all of his policing focuses on crime. Sometimes, Johanning provides a service that some people in his community desperately need: He listens. The only way to reach Seldovia, where Robin Daniels is chief, is by air or sea no roads connect it to neighboring communities. (Photo: Harris Mizrahi/For The Marshall Project) Daniels mends his bulletproof vest in his kitchen. His department has a small budget for equipment, so he often provides his own. (Photo: Harris Mizrahi/For The Marshall Project) Man's death showed addiction 'can happen here' Officer: Robin Daniels Town: Seldovia, Alaska Population: Close to 600 year-round residents 2017 Arrests: 6 Two years ago, after more than a decade as a police officer in Alabama, Robin Daniels decided to uproot his life and become the chief of Seldovia. The only way to reach the town, which is on a peninsula in the Gulf of Alaska, is by air or sea — no roads connect it to neighboring communities. Sustained by the commercial fishing industry, Seldovia has dubbed itself ""Alaska’s best kept secret."" Mornings are quiet for Daniels. He starts the day by fielding phone calls. He then conducts a patrol through town and hits some of the recreational areas — including beaches and parks — in his Ford F-150 truck. Afterward, he stops by the office to check messages and meet with residents. Some of the challenges Daniels faces in this new town are vastly different from those he worried about in Alabama. On his third day at work, some women brought a live bear into his office (and it got loose). But some issues — namely opioid addiction — have followed him. Last year, a young man died from an overdose. “It was heroin combined with fentanyl,” Daniels says. “It just really demonstrated to the community in general the dangers of it, that it can happen here. It can happen quickly.” Yolanda Martinez is a graphics producer for The Marshall Project. Celina Fang is the publication's multimedia editor.

Special Correspondent,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday slammed the attack on two Kashmiri vendors in Lucknow and lauded Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for promptly arresting the accused.
 Addressing a meeting in Kanpur, Mr. Modi stressed the need for unity to uproot terrorism.
Referring to those who attacked our Kashmiri brothers as sarfire (lunatics), he asked other States to take the harshest action against those who commit such acts.
In a fresh charge against the Opposition over their questions regarding the Balakot airstrikes, he said his opponents due to selfish politics were deliberately making statements, which patrons of terrorists were taking advantage of. With the dirty allegations they are making against the government, they give strength to the enemies of the country, said the PM.
The PM said there was an attempt in the country to demean the Army and that those sitting in India were giving statements that Pakistan liked. Today Pakistan is under pressure from the whole world. It has been caught red-handed in terrorism. At such a time, some statements by our people are helping Pakistan, Mr. Modi said.","Referring to those who attacked “our Kashmiri brothers” as “sarfire” (lunatics), he asked other States to take the “harshest action” against those who commit such acts.",2019-03-08T19:33:25Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",PM Modi slams assault on Kashmiris vendors in Lucknow,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-slams-assault-on-kashmiris/article26476338.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/af6g2z/article26476337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI382019000103ATHNAK,the-hindu,The Hindu,uproot,1
Alfred Ng,"Officials at Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, with new biometric facial recognition scanners.
Bill O'Leary/Getty Images
Facial recognition is everywhere, but there aren't any laws that limit what businesses can do with that data. At least not yet.
On Thursday, two US senators introduced proposed legislation called the Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act, which would prevent businesses from collecting facial recognition data on customers without their knowledge or using it without their consent. 
That would mean businesses couldn't use facial recognition to identify and track customers that walk into their stores unless they're given permission.
Facial recognition is powerful technology that allows businesses and government agencies to identify people based on their image alone. It's primarily used by police, but increasingly, more businesses are adopting the technology. 
It is currently being used at airports, concerts and venues like Madison Square Garden -- all without any privacy regulations limiting what these businesses can do with the data it's collected on people's faces. 
If passed, the proposed legislation would be the first federal law on facial recognition and privacy. The bipartisan bill was introduced by senators Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, and Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. 
""Our faces are our identities. They're personal. So the responsibility is on companies to ask people for their permission before they track and analyze their faces,"" Sen. Schatz said in a statement. 
The call for regulation on facial recognition doesn't just come from lawmakers -- tech giants in Silicon Valley have also warned about the its potential to uproot your privacy. That includes Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, who supported the proposed bill. 
In a statement, Smith said that facial recognition ""needs to be regulated to protect against acts of bias and discrimination, preserve consumer privacy, and uphold our basic democratic freedoms."" 
Privacy advocates have also spoken out against facial recognition use, which has the potential to log a person's location and shopping habits and track it over time. 
Businesses also often share and sell that biometric data with each other, as there's no limits on what they can do with the technology. 
The bill would require companies to notify people when facial recognition is being used, and mandatory testing to address accuracy and bias issues.
If passed, it would prevent companies from selling facial recognition data to third parties without consent. 
""Consumers are increasingly concerned about how their data is being collected and used, including data collected through facial recognition technology,"" Sen. Blunt said in a statement.
While this is the first proposed federal legislation looking to take on commercial facial recognition, there are state laws similar to Schatz and Blunt's bill. 
Illinois has a Biometric Information Privacy Act that prevents businesses from collecting data like your fingerprints and facial recognition without your consent. 
Until a federal law passes on facial recognition, businesses can continue using the technology and selling that data. 
""We deserve clear rules and limits on how our faces can be analyzed, identified, and tracked over time,"" Chris Calabrese, the vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said in a statement.

(Express Photo) WITH ASSEMBLY elections in Chhattisgarh coming up this year, Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held his first rally in the state on Sunday. He accused both BJP and Congress, the two principal parties in the state, of being hand-in-glove in corruption and referred multiple times to his government’s work in Delhi, especially in schools. He said now even “rich people want to send their children to government schools”. Addressing around 5,000 people at Science College Ground here, he said, “This crowd hasn’t come to hear me. I am nobody, I have no worth. They have come to uproot the government of Raman Singh. They are narrating their pain with this government… it is a matter of shame that in a state that has coal, steel, diamonds, the youth have no jobs, and the people are poor.” With schools and health a focus area of the Delhi government, Kejriwal said earlier the state of “Delhi schools was even worse than Chhattisgarh”. “But now even rich people want to send their children to government schools. This is what a government can do. There is a corrupt government in Chhattisgarh and the Congress is sitting in the BJP’s lap… Chhattisgarh supplies electricity, but in Delhi which has no production of its own, our electricity is much cheaper,” he said. AAP’s Chhattisgarh in-charge, Delhi Labour Minister Gopal Rai, said there was no other state where the opposition and the government were this complicit in the “loot of the state”. “We had warned Raman Singh that if he did not treat farmers well, we would uproot him in 2018… we take the responsibility that we will not allow you to steal mining wealth from the state.

Blair Braverman and Wes Siler,"The number of huskies being abandoned has reached a record high. People buy the breed for its looks without considering what they’re like to live with as high-energy creatures that need a lot of exercise and freedom. This is our attempt to fix that. Whether you’re shopping for a husky now or have one that’s already destroying your couch, let’s look at what huskies require from their owners and how you can live harmoniously with one. Who are we to give this advice? Well, Blair’s a dogsled racer who lives in the woods of northern Wisconsin, and Wes lives in Hollywood with his five-year-old Spitz-type mutt named Wiley and a nine-month-old half-husky, half-German shepherd named Bowie. We’ve made our dogs happy and think you can, too. https://twitter.com/BlairBraverman/status/948001779635105792 Why Are Huskies So Popular? “We understand that due to the direwolves’ huge popularity, many folks are going out and buying huskies,” says Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister on HBO’s Game of Thrones. “Not only does this hurt all the deserving homeless dogs waiting for a chance at a good home in shelters, but shelters are also reporting that many of these huskies are being abandoned—as often happens when dogs are bought on impulse, without understanding their needs.” Hollywood’s focus on wolves isn’t entirely to blame. The internet has made ordering a totally unsuitable pure-bred dog extraordinarily easy. The American Kennel Club’s website lists 182 husky puppies for sale. Ordering one isn’t quite as easy as clicking “buy it now,” but after filling out some forms and making a phone call, you could be picking up a husky at your local airport in a week or two. I have 21 huskies, and only two of them want to be pets. I know because when the other dogs come into the house, they wail at the door until I let them out again. They enjoy but do not crave human attention, and they are generally happiest when they’re outside, running and playing with their friends. They’re sled dogs through and through, and those perfectly adapted to indoor life are the rare exception: the dogsledding dropouts, so to speak. —Blair Braverman Combining fantasy, fashion, and immediate gratification just isn’t a great combination when it comes to living creatures that require significant amounts of time, energy, and ongoing expenses. Rescue facilities in the United States and Europe report that the number of abandoned huskies has roughly doubled since Game of Thrones premiered in 2011. BcXcYAJDxUQ Why Are Huskies So Problematic? It’s tempting to say that huskies aren’t the problem—the owners are. But that would only be half true—this is one of the most challenging dog breeds around. Energetic and intelligent, huskies easily grow bored. Combine endless amounts of pent-up energy with levels of creativity and problem-solving that rival those of a two-year-old child, and you have a recipe for mischief-making of the highest order. Plus, your two-year-old can’t jump a six-foot fence. And it can’t dig under one. Your kid’s jaws aren’t perfectly adapted to destroying furniture. Unless you really screwed up, it probably doesn’t have a strong prey drive, either. Or the ability to kill and eat every small animal it comes across. A kid might howl like a husky, but landlords and neighbors tend to be more understanding when it’s a human making the noise. Bowie gets about ten miles of off-leash running in most days. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to get out on his own. So far, he’s escaped our yard twice. I caught him both times because he stopped running momentarily to try and eat a cat. —Wes Siler Huskies require huge amounts of exercise, don’t take easily to training, are notorious escape artists, have a very high prey drive, love to dig, are heavy shedders, make a ton of noise, and do best as part of a pack. Can you realistically deal with that if you live in a city, or even the suburbs? Bc5fZwAjQqR What Huskies Require Let’s work through the breed’s requirements, one by one, and how you can best address them. They can run more than 100 miles a day, day after day—a migration that, in a wild species, would make them one of the fastest-moving land animals on the planet. —Blair Exercise: Huskies need to run and are designed to pull. They make great trail dogs, so they’re an ideal companion for trail runners, mountain bikers, backcountry skiers, and the like. While on-leash walks and regular bathroom breaks if you live in an apartment are obviously a requirement, a husky also requires significant daily off-leash exercise. Dog-friendly hiking trails are ideal, but a small dog park or a simple game of fetch will not suffice. Five to ten miles of off-leash running a day (that’s for adult dogs; refer to our previous puppy guidance for younger dogs) will produce a happy husky. A well-exercised dog will be a well-behaved dog; exercise will mitigate most of the husky’s other issues. Training: Incredibly intelligent, huskies are adept learners, but they’re also sensitive and willful, don’t take to harsh methods, and retain a high degree of self-determination. Only positive reinforcement methods should be used and repeated regularly throughout the dog’s life, and a husky will always work best with motivation. Patience and consistency are key. They can sprint up to 30 miles an hour, which means that if you turn away for six minutes, they could be anywhere within a three-mile radius. —Blair Escaping: Huskies need a yard that’s completely enclosed by at least a six-foot fence. Huskies can climb simple chain link, so a privacy fence will work best. Burying the fence at least a foot into the ground and surrounding it with concrete slab or employing other anti-digging measures should be considered a requirement. Gates should be equally tall and impossible to dig under and should feature automatic closures, if not also auto-locking mechanisms. Prey Drive: Keep your husky on-leash in places where you don’t want it to hunt, kill, and eat small animals. Lots of toys and frequent play help direct the dog’s urges, but a husky will do best if it regularly gets the opportunity to pursue things like rabbits, squirrels, and rats in a safe an appropriate environment. Squeamish owners need not apply. When Bowie was five months old, I rescued a baby fox squirrel. The baby was in a box on the kitchen counter, but I needed a syringe to administer Pedialyte. So I locked the dogs outside and ran to Rite Aid. While I was gone, Bowie taught himself how to work a door latch, opened two of them, and got the squirrel off the counter. As soon as he saw me, he tossed his head back and swallowed the baby squirrel whole. —Wes Digging: Like prey drive, the urge to dig isn’t something you can just wish away. Give your dog a permitted place in the yard for it to dig, and squirt it with a water gun when you catch it digging elsewhere. Fill in undesired holes, possibly with bricks and the like, to further discourage digging in those areas. Shedding: Fur is another thing you’re just going to have to welcome into your life if you want a husky. Regular combing helps, particularly in summer, when they need to be combed to help thin their inner coat. Expect your husky to blow its coat twice a year, producing an entire dog’s worth of excess fur during a very short time period. Brush even more often while that’s happening. A robot vacuum and a quality human-operated vacuum designed to catch pet hair are both essentials for a husky owner, but you’ll probably benefit from hiring a cleaning service, too. Noise: Huskies don’t tend to be problem barkers, but they do express themselves by howling regularly. Expect to hear your dog howl when you leave, when you come home, when your husky is hungry, when it wants to play, or when you leave it alone. Apartment dwellers should consider their building’s insulation levels and tolerance for noise. Homeowners should make nice with their immediate neighbors several houses in either direction. In their winter coats, huskies think freezing temperatures are too hot. Every aspect of their physiology is adapted for deep cold, from their metabolisms to their soft ears and the fluffy tails they curl over their noses to sleep in the snow. —Blair Pack Instinct: Huskies aren’t necessarily very human-focused, but they do need companionship. For this reason, they can become noisy and destructive when left alone. Huskies work best when they have company. That can be another dog or dogs, a human who works at home, a dog-friendly work environment, or a house where multiple people live and whose presence mostly overlaps. When with your husky, you can expect it to want your attention, if not demand it. Heat Tolerance: You can’t talk about husky ownership without talking about hot temperatures. Designed to work outside in temperatures as low as minus 75 degrees Fahrenheit, huskies will obviously do better in colder climates. But the thick double coat that makes them thrive in the cold can also help insulate them from extreme heat, which is why you should never shave a husky. Dogs will adapt to the environment they live in and shed as much fur as necessary for the weather they’re experiencing. Help them through this by combing them frequently. Care should also be taken while exercising when it’s hot outside. Do that early in the morning or late at night when temperatures are coolest. Take care to provide your dog with adequate water while exercising, and pay attention for signs of overheating. Also, don’t leave a dog that’s used to warm temperatures out in the cold. BaxNmOBDOSV Is This Realistic? It’s possible. People successfully own huskies in small apartments and in hot, humid cities and while holding down normal jobs. But those people are the exceptions. The more time and space you have, and the more exercise you enjoy or need, the easier life with a husky is going to be. If you want a successful life with a husky, you’ll have to shape its world to be as well-suited to its instincts as possible. —Blair The common factor that unites successful husky owners, whether they’re in Alaska or Los Angeles, is commitment. You need to ask yourself if you’re prepared to commit to this much exercise, if you can afford to spend this much time with a dog, and if you want to alter your entire lifestyle to suit a pet. Honestly, for most people the answer will be no. But those who can manage it will be rewarded with an incredible partner. He’s still a baby, but Bowie’s already the smartest, most athletic dog I’ve ever owned. Just wish he’d use all that for something other than evil. —Wes",The megapopular breed is possibly the worst city dog.

Shlomi Zadok,"When we think of our dream career, and by extension our dream life, we rarely picture jumping into the unknown to attain it. We seldom imagine replacing the comfortable life we already have with an entirely new, unfamiliar environment. That is even more true when you have a family to think about, too.
And yet, just last year, thats exactly what I found myself doing, moving my family and embarking on a new chapter of life with Intercom in Dublin. How did I know such upheaval would be worth it?
“It can be all too easy to fall into a trap of analysis paralysis”
The truth is, you can never be sure, but when faced with the opportunity to uproot your life and take an opportunity in a new city or new country, there is a lot to consider. It can be all too easy to fall into a trap of analysis paralysis, trying to weigh the upsides to staying put, the familiar status quo, with the unknown upsides of making the move.
A framework for moving your life
While its easy to be attracted to an impressive job title or a significant wage increase, ultimately, moving your life in such a fundamental way needs to be motivated by more than that.
In my experience, there are three key factors to consider, a simple framework for assessing whether the move will be worth it.
The professional challenges you will be facing in your new role does it offer room for you to grow in a way your current job does not? How long will it realistically last for?
The company, its culture and above all its trajectory, and how it differs from your current situation.
The new city and especially the opportunities it presents for your family.
Consider these factors the three legs on the stool – without any one of them, it will fall over. Should I move my life for a new job?
In short then, the equation looks like this:
Opportunity of role x trajectory of company x appeal of location = your answer
Of course, if you have a family to consider, this equation becomes far more complicated, and your partners answers to these questions will help determine the result.
How green is the grass
Most of us understand the phrase the grass is always greener on the other side, in that we all feel at some level the allure of that which is different over what we know and have right now.
Many of us may dream about embarking on new chapters in our life while never working up the courage to do so. But this framework can help you work up that courage as you assess the opportunities that come your way.
“Many of us may dream about embarking on new chapters in our life while never working up the courage to do so”
I moved my life for Intercom because the position I took presented so many challenges and growth opportunities (and to be honest I never imagined how challenging it could be ).
I moved my life for Intercom because I deeply related to Intercoms values and mission making internet business personal. I wanted to be part of the amazing team of people who execute Intercoms vision.
I moved my life for Intercom because I wanted my family and myself to experience life in a different place, and Dublin is one of the most welcoming, multicultural and beautiful cities to live in. My kids are at school, learning new languages, new cultures and are making new friends. Everything is new and exciting for us, our horizons are broadening, our world is expanding.
Opening a new chapter
Beyond the new possibilities I am experiencing at work, the move itself is a new life skill as a family, we are building up a new network, developing a new sense of home, and that will stand to us in future.
“On the one hand, time seems to have slowed down; on the other hand, time also flies like crazy”
That excitement, that newness, has also created a bizarre appreciation of time that I could not have predicted. On the one hand, time seems to have slowed down – I have become more aware of the passing of every day, week and month as I adjust to our new life and absorb everything that is novel and unusual. On the other hand, time also flies like crazy – I cannot believe I am here for nearly a year now.
This is not to say I dont miss home, or that there hasnt been moments where my family and I havent missed the familiar patterns of life that we were used to. Its natural, and in a sense, its also valuable its part of the experience, part of our growth, as a family and as individuals.
Moving your life is a huge thing to do a massive, life-changing decision that will shape your future in all sorts of ways you cant predict. So make sure you do it for the right reasons I know I did.","When faced with the opportunity to uproot your life and take an opportunity in a new city or new country, there is a lot to weigh up.

Megan Reynolds,"In a rousing speech at the Women’s March #PowertothePolls rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards implored her comrades—white women—to “do better.” According to CNN, Richards credited the 2017 Women’s March for providing much-needed momentum and awakening the activist within “doctors and teachers and mothers” across the country. Inspired and outraged by the various political horrors of the past year, including the Muslim ban and the current reckoning against sexual predators in Hollywood and beyond, women have united in the face of a deeply sexist society to do the hard work of attempting to right some of history’s wrongs. A lot of that work has fallen on the backs of women of color, Richards argued. “From Virginia to Alabama and to last week in Wisconsin, women have beaten the odds to elect our own to office.... Women of color, transgender women, rural and urban women,” she said. “These victories were led and made possible by women of color.” On Tuesday evening, 63 percent of white women voted for Roy Moore, a man accused of assaulting… Read more Read Indeed, the tradition of white women bolstering racist, sexist or otherwise deplorable political candidates runs deep throughout this country’s history. Consider the astonishing 63 percent of white women who voted for Alabama Senate candidate and accused sexual predator Roy Moore. Moore’s defeat—which he refused to concede —allowed for Doug Jones to be the first Democratic senator in the state in 25 years and was thanks in large part to the overwhelming 96 percent of black voters who turned out to the polls in support of Jones—98 percent of whom were women. Richards urged consistent action but didn’t elaborate on any particular strategies for white women looking to do better—a tactic that essentially comes off as an empty platitude. Recall the galling statistic bandied about after the election that 53 percent of white women voted for Donald Trump and the panicked insistence that spread throughout “ good” white women who insisted that they weren’t part of the problem. Recognizing white women’s complicity is one thing, but actually taking steps to fix it is quite another. Instead of trumpeting praise for black women sporadically only when their efforts have achieved victory that is beneficial to everyone, white women should not just acknowledge but uproot their political tendency to prioritize their own immediate needs over the realities and struggles of other women. In the case of the recent election in Alabama, they could also stand to evolve their thinking on criminal justice reform, access to civil services, and—more broadly—the inherent bias within our reckoning for sexual predators in power. The pain of white women, as Gabrielle Union noted in an interview with the New York Times, has been regarded with a full consideration that might not have been paid to a woman of color speaking out initially. “If they hadn’t been people who have had access to parts and roles and true inclusion in Hollywood, would we have believed?” she said of the women who first spoke out against Harvey Weinstein. It’s a sobering thought, which shouldn’t shame white women into feeling badly about their own biases, but instead spur them to action. We’re beyond the notion that a drop of self-awareness is sufficient—we need more than that. As Doreen St. Félix wrote so eloquently in The New Yorker the day after Moore’s defeat, “The recent expression of awe for the black woman voter is particularly troubling, because it feels like a kind of disclosure: you’d have to be truly isolated from the day-to-day realities of black existence to be shaken by the racial and gendered dimension of Jones’s win. You’d have to be convinced that the mammy is real.”","In a rousing speech at the Women’s March #PowertothePolls rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards implored her comrades—white women—to “do better.” Read more...",2018-01-22T19:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Jezebel.com'}","Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood, Tells White Women to 'Do Better'",https://jezebel.com/cecile-richards-president-of-planned-parenthood-tells-1822300796,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--HMHgiXq6--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/z1haocuci6s93izdviqr.jpg",,Jezebel.com,uproot,1

Reuters,"DETROIT — Trump administration demands in NAFTA trade negotiations meant to push auto jobs back to the United States may not be enough to spark a shift in where automakers build cars and trucks. New math to determine what qualifies as vehicle content, what limits apply to allow tariff-free auto imports and how long companies would have to comply under a new NAFTA agreement will likely not move the needle for Detroit automakers in particular, industry executives and supply chain experts said. Automakers are unlikely to uproot billions of dollars of investments in plants and supply chains. And those that cannot comply with standards for passenger cars could simply pay tariffs of around $800 to $900 per vehicle and buy low-cost parts from Asia to offset the cost, industry experts said. ""Broadly speaking, the (tariff) increase isn't big enough to make a wholesale change,"" said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. ""No one is likely to shut down an active factory in Mexico and build a new one to replace that in the U.S."" Tough U.S. proposals on autos are meant to bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs and are central to the Trump administration's approach to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States. General Motors, soon to be the only Detroit Three automaker building pickup trucks in Mexico, is confident it could comply with content requirements for trucks the United States proposes without shifting production, a person familiar with the company's plans said. But GM's Mexican-made trucks already have a significant share of their value, such as engines, produced in the United States at United Auto Workers union-represented factories, and GM would get another boost if it is allowed to tally engineering done in Michigan. GM is retooling a high-volume factory to build a new generation of large Chevrolet and GMC pickups in Silao, Mexico. Pickup trucks that do not have enough U.S. or North American content under NAFTA rules could be hit with a crippling 25 percent tariff. Last year GM churned out more than 400,000 large pickup trucks from Silao, more than 40 percent of its 2017 U.S. pickup truck sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday a revised treaty could prompt FCA to ""redirect"" some Mexican production but would not cause it to further dial back its presence in Mexico. In January FCA had said it would shift production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020 to reduce the profit risks should the United States pull out of NAFTA. Senior U.S., Canadian and Mexican officials on Friday ended a week of talks without a deal to modernize NAFTA, agreeing instead to resume negotiations soon, ahead of a deadline next week. The United States wants 40 percent of the value of light-duty passenger vehicles and 45 percent of a truck's content to be built at hourly wages of $16 to qualify for tariff-free import from Mexico. Those demands are aimed at preserving relatively higher-wage U.S. and Canadian production and pressuring Mexico's low auto wages. Mexico wants 70 percent of a vehicle's content to be made within North America, less than the 75 percent U.S. negotiators propose. Automakers that do not comply with tougher U.S. or North American content and wage rules, if adopted, could face 2.5 percent tariffs on cars or sport utility vehicles shipped to the United States from Mexico. That may be a level of pain they can live with. Automakers producing sedans, SUVs and crossovers in Mexico include Ford, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Honda and Volkswagen AG. The U.S. proposal would allow automakers to count salaries for engineering, research, sales, software and product development jobs, a provision favoring Detroit automakers versus foreign brands. And companies would have two, four or nine years to comply, depending on the specific condition involved. Still, some automakers are more of a question mark, especially when it comes to trucks. Toyota plans to expand production in Mexico of its Tacoma pickup trucks, part of a realignment of its North American manufacturing that includes a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in Alabama. It also makes Tacomas in San Antonio, Texas, so could in theory switch production. The automaker declined to comment. And the Trump administration proposals could complicate matters for electric vehicles and self-driving cars automakers want to build in Mexico. The U.S. proposals call for 75 percent of an electric or autonomous vehicle's value to be made within North America to avoid tariffs. Since much of those vehicle's value can come from batteries made overseas, that means automakers must make up for the content largely on the human side. At nine years, electronic vehicles are subject to the longest period until they must comply. ""EVs and AVs have so much electronic content, and there is no electronics industry here,"" said Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ""Nine years is not enough to build up an electronics industry to that scale.""

"Special to USA TODAY, David Agren, Special to USA TODAY","Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves after voting in Mexico's presidential election on July 1, 2018, in Mexico City. (Photo: Pedro Mera, Getty Images) MEXICO CITY — Left-leaning populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador easily won Mexico’s presidential election Sunday, according to exit polls, a victory portending change and potentially upending of the country’s political order. All of his major rivals conceded quickly after polls closed at 9 p.m. Eastern. An exit poll from news outlet El Financiero put López Obrador’s support at 49 percent — 22 points ahead of this closest rival, Ricardo Anaya of a left-right coalition. A late-night official quick count from electoral authorities forecast that Lopez Obrador would win with between 53 percent and 53.8 percent of the vote, a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years, the Associated Press reported. AP reported that in brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarizing campaign and promised profound change that respects the law and constitutional order. José Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) received just 18 percent of the vote, according to El Financiero. Meade — a former finance minister who ran as a clean candidate, but became bogged down by graft scandals engulfing others in the PRI — quickly conceded the race. More: Andrés Manuel López Obrador: Who is he? More: 'They killed my mother, killed my father:' Central Americans risk lives to reach US border More: Amnesty for drug dealers? This Mexico presidential candidate is pushing for forgiveness Anaya and independent candidate Jaime Rodreiguez, who is also known as “El Bronco,” also conceded quickly. López Obrador had cast his ballot early in the day, saying, “More than an election, it’s going to be a referendum. People will decide between more of the same or real change.” López Obrador beckoned supporters to the massive Zócalo square in central Mexico City – where leaders have projected power to the people since Azteca times — for a statement soon after the official results are announced. López Obrador, 64 cast his ballot early in the day, saying, “More than an election, it’s going to be a referendum. People will decide between more of the same or real change.” Commonly known as AMLO and making his third bid for the presidency, López Obrador, held a commanding lead in the polls ahead of the vote. The former mayor of Mexico City has promised to “uproot corruption,” increase social spending and pursue a different approach to crack down on drug cartels – even floating the idea of amnesty for those involved in the drug business if not accused of serious offences. The silver-haired López Obrador condemned the two parties that traditionally have held the presidency as “the mafia in power” and promised to “abolish corruption in Mexico” and bring organized crime to heel – with an approach of “hugs not bullets.” And he will address what he considers the root cause of crime and violence: poverty. Last Slide Next Slide While his surge in the polls spooked many politicians and businessmen because of his leftist rhetoric, López Obrador said he supports NAFTA and promised to pursue cordial relations with President Donald Trump, who also had campaigned as an outsider, although leaning to the right. López Obrador said he will defend undocumented Mexican migrants living in the United States. He also said Mexico will not be “doing the dirty work” of the USA in stopping Central Americans who try to reach the United States. While campaigning this year, AMLO moderated his positions to appeal to the middle class and to people in northern border regions who would be uneasy voting for a candidate on the left. He also capitalized on discontent. Mexico experienced its most murderous year in memory in 2017, perceptions of corruption have climbed and the outgoing administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto included a spate of scandals. “There’s a fair bit of luck that finally favored him (AMLO),” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “He was also very capable of shifting, of moderating, of using this peculiar rhetoric of his to attack the same demons, but to do so nicely.” Also helping were missteps by his opponents, especially as they attacked each other ito position themselves as the option of anybody but AMLO. “He had a four goal lead and all he had to to was sit back and play smart defense,” Estévez said. Pre-election polls put AMLO 20 points ahead of rivals Ricardo Anaya of a left-right coalition; José Antonio Meade, a former finance minister on the ballot for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); and Jaíme Calderón, a cowboy-turned-governor running as an independent whose campaign included such outlandish proposals as chopping off the hands of corrupt public servants. Voters favoring López Obrador expressed fatigue with the status quo. “I’m tired of so much looting, so many corrupt politicians,” said Beatriz Coulder, a research scientist after she voted for AMLO. She pointed to her home town in Oaxaca state, which was flattened by an earthquake. She said government relief arrived late and suspected some it was squirreled away by politicians. “They get rich and do nothing for the country,” Patricia García, a publishing industry employee, said about politicians after voting for AMLO. “It’s going to be difficult to fix the country because it’s in such bad shape. But I think (AMLO) can put it on the right path. Even those not voting for López Obrador seemed hungry for change. López Obrador “hasn’t explained how he is going to achieve all these wonderful things he’s promised,” said Édgar Romero, a small business owner who voted for Anaya. “People are voting out of frustration and fatigue. It’s a punishment vote against past governments. But we’re punishing ourselves.” “People are tired of PRI excesses and corruption and the violence in the times the PAN (Anaya's National Action Party) governed"" from 2000-2012, said Gerardo Priego, a politician with the PAN supporting Anaya. “People feel like they’ve tried the other two (parties) and should try the other that’s left.” But he described voting for López Obrador's party in hopes of change ""is like divorcing your wife to marry your mother-in-law.” Voters are not just picking a new president to serve a single, six-year term, but also both houses of congress, governors in eight states and hundreds of local-level offices. Mexico City also elects a new mayor. More than 130 politicians and candidates were murdered over the past nine months, according to Etellekt, a risk consultancy. In the heroin-producing heartland of Guerrero state, some races were left without candidates as parties couldn’t find people to run amid the killings. “They’re doing it to send messages and leave clear who controls a certain territory,” Priego said of the slayings, which he attributed to organized crime trying to influence elections. “It’s also a warning that whoever wins office will have to deal with them.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2KDDOrI","Andrés Manuel López Obrador, 64, won in his third bid for the presidency.",2018-07-02T05:43:55Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Mexico elects left-leaning populist as president by wide margin,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/02/mexico-president-left-leaning-populist-elected-wide-margin/750191002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c43c372f6874b971744c307fb1f110be369bfd07/c=0-180-3543-2182/local/-/media/2018/07/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636660596873952871-GTY-988880354.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop,usa-today,USA Today,uproot,1
Meredith Cash,"After spending its entire history in California, the Raiders franchise plans to relocate to a new stadium in Las Vegas in time for the start of the 2020 season. But the team's current lease with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum is set to expire at the end of the season, and with the city of Oakland gearing up for a multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against them, the Raiders may be forced to take a temporary detour before arriving in Sin City. Construction on the franchise's state-of-the-art new home, Las Vegas Stadium, will not be complete until 2020. According to Gary Peterson of The Mercury News, the $1.8 billion arena will boast a translucent ceiling, a large veranda with views of the Strip, and nine clubs with seating for 8,000 people. Check out this virtual tour of the proposed stadium: In the meantime, the team has been working to extend its contract with the Coliseum for another year or two until its new home in Las Vegas is complete, but the Raiders refuse to sign the extension if a suit is filed against them. ""They told me we might as well take the contract and rip it up,"" Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority Executive Director Scott McKibben told Phil Matier and Andy Ross at the San Francisco Chronicle Sept. 4. According to a Sunday report from CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora, the franchise has at least considered a very temporary stint in San Diego, as there has been some contact between the team and the mayor's office. The Los Angeles Chargers left San Diego County Credit Union Stadium at the end of the 2016 NFL season, so there is plenty of room for the Raiders to move in for the year. Still, the chances of the Silver and Black making a home in Southern California seem remote, as both the Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams already play in Southern California and hope to tap into San Diego's newly vacated market. According to La Canfora, a more probable landing spot for the Raiders could be Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, home to the San Francisco 49ers. The team could also potentially move to Las Vegas a year early, but the only available venue would be Sam Boyd Stadium, home of the UNLV football team. With only 40,000 seats, the 46-year-old arena would require serious renovations before hosting regular-season NFL games. ""We have not heard from the Raiders regarding the 2019 season, but UNLV has always been willing to work with our new partners if that ever became a possibility,"" UNLV Athletic Director Desiree Reed-Francois told Mick Akers at the Las Vegas Sun. Regardless of where the Raiders land next season, Oakland fans likely will not be happy with the leadership of their beloved franchise. Raider Nation has been outspoken in its opposition to the move:","In March 2017, the Raiders announced that they would uproot their franchise from Oakland and move to Las Vegas for either the 2019 or 2020 NFL seasons.

"Des Moines Register, Rekha Basu, Des Moines Register","Hearts are heavy in Brooklyn as news sweeps the small Iowa community that a body believed to be Mollie Tibbetts' has been found. Des Moines Register Mollie Tibbetts (Photo: Dann Hayes/Poweshiek County CR) “Don’t talk to strangers,” we tell our daughters when they are little. “Look both ways when you cross the road.” Later, we will warn them about the unintended consequences of alcohol and drugs, and unprotected sex. We will encourage them to feel confident and stand up for themselves, but exercise caution and avoid unfamiliar places after dark. Our society will urge them to heed the advice of doctors and maybe clergy, their parents and grandparents. Meanwhile, bit by bit, we see the value of those lessons diminish. It is likely none of those standard admonitions could have saved Mollie Tibbetts. As of this writing, we don’t know the full details of her death, only that her body was found in a cornfield and police believe they have the murderer. We know she had gone out for an evening jog. We know he followed her. And we know from history that that simple activity, which enhances women’s strength and independence, can also make them vulnerable. Every 98 seconds someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted, according to the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network. Tibbetts was a college student and female, making her a member of a group three times more likely than women in general to fall victim. Remember Tammy Zywicki In 1992, after 21-year-old Grinnell College student Tammy Zywicki was found murdered and sexually assaulted on her way back to college from her New Jersey home, I remember thinking how low the odds were that some sexual predator would be driving along the same route as hers and get access to her. Now I know better. More than 570 people are victims of sexual violence every day in this country. It can happen anywhere, any time. It has happened on an Iowa doctor's examining table and during outings with priests. It has happened on an overnight visit to grandparents. In those cases, there is often more than one culprit involved. Maybe the staffer who covered it up or made excuses. Maybe the bishop. Maybe even the grandmother; they help 99 percent of perpetrators walk free. Another view: My son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die. On the issue of immigration: I came to the US because of chain migration. Is there a problem with that? More: I'm a DREAMer, I just want to contribute to my community. Why does my government want me out? I wrote a piece a year later, prompted by the discovery of 36-year-old woman's body in a Des Moines, Iowa, area hotel. She was in the process of moving here from Denver, Colorado, to begin a supervisory job. Once again, it underscored our precarious footing as women in a world dotted with unforeseeable risks. ""In the march for equal rights between the sexes, women's safety remains an arena of profound sexual inequality, a realm where inroads made by women in work and political office find no reflection,"" said the column published Aug. 27, 1993. ""Threats to safety are a growing fact of life for everyone, but are an integral part of the way women experience the world. No woman is immune to assault, at home or on the street, in public places or in private ones."" Using a murder as political currency Yet rather than focus on reducing violence against women, some top Republicans from President Donald Trump to Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds to Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, had another agenda. They rushed to blame arrested suspect Cristhian Bahena Rivera's immigration status, which itself remains unclear. The state Division of Criminal Investigation called him an illegal immigrant. But his lawyer said he was in the country legally, and his employer, Craig Lang of Yarrabee Farms, said his legal status had been verified, but later said he had been hired under a different name. It's conceivable they didn't vet him properly or that they knew and hired him anyway, much like managers at Agriprocessors meat-packing plant in Postville were accused of doing before the 2008 raid there. Notice how after every mass shooting, some top Republicans are in a hurry to deny the proliferation of guns was in any way responsible. Lately, they've been blaming mental illness. But in Rivera's case, there is political currency in conflating the lack of a visa with violence, even though studies show undocumented immigrants commit no more violent crimes than the native-born population. A 2016 study showed the U.S. immigrant population rose 118 percent from 1980 through 2016 but the rate of violent crimes fell by 36 percent. A Justice Department report released in January found only 5.6 percent of inmates in federal, state and local prisons are foreign-born. And that includes people like me, a U.S. citizen who was a legal immigrant before being naturalized. Together, the foreign born are 13 percent of the U.S. population. To their immense credit, some members of Tibbetts' family used Facebook to criticize efforts to whip up hatred of immigrants over their tragedy. Billie Jo Calderwood, whom Vox reported is a relative of Tibbetts, posted, “Please remember, Evil comes in EVERY color."" And later, “Please do not compound the atrocity of what happened to her by adding racism and hate to the equation.” Someone also shared with me a post last week from the sister of Iowan Cara McGrane who was killed during the 1992 Drake Diner shootings. Not only had her family not bought into calls for the death penalty, Molly McGrane wrote, but ""there is never a time to generalize against any group of people."" But we can make some generalizations about the violence against women that poisons our communities. We can work together to uproot it so that hurting females becomes not just illegal but culturally unacceptable. We must replace it with cultures of empathy and compassion. And when someone shows signs of trouble, we must intervene before it's too late. Then, someday, we will have truly honored Mollie and Drew and Lyric and Kathlynn and Jodi and Ashley and Anna Marie and all the other women who may have done everything we told them, but still had no chance.

Express News Service,"Himachal Congress president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, party’s Himachal co-in-charge Ranjeeta Ranjan and other Congress leaders in Mandi Saturday. (Express Photo/Pradeep Kumar) At its one-day convention held in Mandi on Saturday, the Himachal Congress adopted five resolutions resolving to wipe out the BJP from the state in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It also resolved to expose PM Narendra Modi ’s alleged falsehood on jobs, corruption and checking prices of essential commodities. The convention called by PCC president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu in Mandi, a district where the Congress lost all 10 Assembly seats and where one of its ministers, Anil Sharma, switched over to the BJP ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls, was marked by absence of former CM Virbhadra Singh, his MLA son Vikramaditya Singh and some others from his camp. Those who attended the meet included Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan, who is also party’s co-incharge of Himachal, state Congress leaders Kaul Singh Thakur and G S Bali, besides CLP leader Mukesh Agnihotri. A large number of MLAs, former ministers and PCC office-bearers also attended the meet. “Our campaign Hisab de Sansad, making each sitting BJP MP accountable to public on his five-year term, has already caught up the public imagination. We are going to every single household to apprise them about the failures of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister and also of the NDA on every promise they made to the people during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls,” the PCC president said at the convention. CLP leader Mukesh Agnihotri called the NDA government at the Centre “jumlon ki Sarkar” and attacked it for its “inability” to tackle corruption and provide jobs. He also warned the state BJP government against any attempt to dilute section 118 of HP Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, which debars outsiders from buy agriculture land in the state. Bali, a former minister, however, said Jai Ram Thakur was a gentleman and his government should be given some time to perform before the Opposition took a hard stand against him. He pointed out some instances of mal-administration during the Congress rule which led to the party’s defeat. In one resolution, the party directly attacked the Prime Minister, accusing him of cheating the nation on his promise to bring back black money and end corruption. Second resolution related to “befooling” of the Himachal voters who were promised hike in import duty on apples from 50 to 150 per cent, special bailout package to Himachal and railway expansion projects. The Congress also criticised the BJP government on law and order situation in the state and adopted a resolution condemning incidents like caste discrimination at Kullu school and rise in cases of rape and murders.

90Min,"Dayot Upamecano is a name which has generated a lot of headlines this week, with widespread reports that Bayern Munich and Manchester United will go toe to toe for the RB Leipzig defender this summer.
Rated as one of the brightest young centre backs in European football, Upamecano has a release clause of 100m in his contract at the Red Bull Arena and will command a hefty fee.
For Manchester United, Upamecano is a source of regret. They were heavily linked with the French prodigy during his time at Valenciennes (between 2013 and 2015), and some sources even claimed that it was all but a done deal before he ended up joining Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg, via a season with their feeder club Liefering, instead.
It has always remained a mystery why the move fell through - until this week, when Upamecano's agent Thierry Martinez explained the situation to So Foot (via Sport Witness).
According to Martinez, United was 'the club that has made Upamecano dream since he was a kid', but his representatives pulled the plug on the deal when they learned of his living arrangements.
""An intermediary met with us, but between the project she presented us and what was actually going to happen,"" said Martinez. ""A flat was promised, but that changed to a host family with only six return trips for his parents.
""When you uproot a player at such a young age, that isnt enough. I wanted Dayot to have a stable emotional balance off the pitch.""
United would have paid a relative pittance for Upamecano had they signed him back in 2; now, they are looking at a potential world-record fee for a defender if they want to secure his services.
The Red Devils are known to be in want of a centre back, with Raphael Varane, Kalidou Koulibaly, Toby Alderweireld and Harry Maguire among a long list of others who have been linked.",News from around the web.,2019-02-07T20:00:01Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Si.com'}",Dayot Upamecano's Agent Explains Why Previous Man Utd Move Failed as Red Devils Renew Interest,https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/02/07/dayot-upamecanos-agent-explains-why-previous-man-utd-move-failed-red-devils-renew-interest,https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/images/rb-leipzig-v-fc-bayern-muenchen-bundesliga-5c5c86fcacb3521da5000012.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85,,Si.com,uproot,1
Maan News Agency,"JENIN (Ma’an) — Israeli bulldozers razed dozens of dunams and uprooted hundreds of Palestinian-owned trees, on Monday afternoon, on lands belonging to residents from the Bartaa village, southwest of the northern occupied West Bank district of Jenin.
According to local sources, Israeli forces along with bulldozers stormed the area and began to raze about 28 dunams (6.9 acres) of land. In addition, bulldozers uprooted 300 almond and olive trees.
Sources added that the razed land belonged to Jamal Sharif Amarneh.
According to Palestinians and rights groups, Israel’s main goal, both in its policies in Area C, in which more than 60% of Palestinian land is under full Israeli control, and Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise, is to depopulate the land of its Palestinian residents and to replace them with Jewish Israeli communities, in order to manipulate population demographics in all of historic Palestine.
The movement of Israeli settlers taking over Palestinian land, and further displacing the local Palestinian population has been a “stable” Israeli policy since the takeover of the West Bank and Jerusalem in 1967, B’Tselem said, underscoring that all “Israeli legislative, legal, planning, funding, and defense bodies” have played an active role in the dispossession of Palestinians from their lands.
BTselem also argued that under the guise of a “temporary military occupation,” Israel has been “using the land as its own: robbing land, exploiting the area’s natural resources for its own benefit and establishing permanent settlements,” estimating that Israel had dispossessed Palestinians from some 200,000 hectares (494,211 acres) of lands in the occupied Palestinian territory over the years.

Maan News Agency,"NABLUS (Ma’an) — A group of Israeli settlers uprooted dozens of Palestinian-owned olive trees, on Tuesday, in an agricultural area near the Burin village, south of the northern occupied West Bank.
Ghassan Daghlas, an official who monitors settlement activity in the northern West Bank, told Ma’an that Israeli settlers from the illegal Yitzhar settlement stormed an agricultural area near the main road of the settlement.
Daghlas pointed out that about 33 olive trees were uprooted by Israeli forces and belong to Palestinian resident, Castro Mahmoud Qadrous.
According to a report by Israeli NGO B’Tselem, Israeli settlers’ vandalism in the occupied West Bank is a daily routine and is fully backed by Israeli authorities.
B’Tselem reported that “In just over two months, from the beginning of May to 7 July 2018, B’Tselem documented 10 instances in which settlers destroyed a total of more than 2,000 trees and grapevines and burned down a barley field and bales of hay.”
B’Tselem also argued that under the guise of a “temporary military occupation,” Israel has been “using the land as its own: robbing land, exploiting the areas natural resources for its own benefit and establishing permanent settlements,” estimating that Israel had dispossessed Palestinians from some 200,000 hectares (494,211 acres) of lands in the occupied Palestinian territory over the years.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law, with recent announcements of settlement expansion provoking condemnation from the international community.

90Min,"Napoli have confirmed they will be prepared to walk off the pitch in reaction to any reported racist chants, despite the Italian government insisting that play should not be stopped.
FIFPro registered their complaint that play was not halted during Napoli's game with Inter last month, in which on three different occasions the referee had asked for a warning to be read out over the public announcement system about the racist abuse aimed at defender Kalidou Koulibaly.
However, in Tuesday's summit between the Italian government's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and the federation and representatives of clubs and it's ultras, it was re-affirmed that the referee does not have the authority to stop Serie A matches for racist abuse.
Salvini said (as quoted by ESPN): ""Suspending a game in the event of racist chants is very risky. You risk putting the destiny of many people in the hands of just a few. It's very hard to find objective criteria for such a decision.
""I shared the decision not to suspend Inter-Napoli, not because I approve [of] the whistles or the monkey chants, but because we risk there being greater problems outside the ground than those inside.""
He added: ""I remember I was at the stadium for AC Milan-Juve and the constant, continued boos in that game were for [Leonardo] Bonucci, who is very white, very good and very beautiful, and who had changed clubs two or three times -- so who decides whether that is discrimination?

90Min,"On-loan AC Milan striker Gonzalo Higuain has asked parent club Juventus for permission to join Chelsea, following an unsatisfactory spell with the Rossoneri. 
The marksman was sent to Milan as a makeweight in the deal for Leonardo Bonucci's return to Turin, and has struggled to make his usual goalscoring impact, netting just seven times across all competitions.
Though Higuain must shoulder some of the blame for his struggles, his teammates have not been able to fashion sufficient chances for him, and he's been starved of service throughout the season. This has led to their miserly Serie A scoring total of just 24 in 19 games. 
And, according to reports from Italian publication Sportmediaset, the Argentine forward has grown tired of his new surroundings already, and has duly asked Juventus if he can swap the steeples of Milan for Stamford Bridge. 
Ever since Maurizio Sarri's arrival in west London, the Chelsea manager has been keen on a reunion with Higuain, though the club did not share his enthusiasm in the summer, and a deal was not completed. 
However, Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud's struggles this season may have prompted new discourse within the Blues' hierarchy. 
As for Juve, it is understood that they've given the 31-year-old the go ahead to uproot, while Milan are equally happy to let the number nine leave. The possibility has been previously raised of a swap deal between Milan and Chelsea for Higuain and Morata, though it was not mooted in this latest report. 
The Spaniard has scored the same amount of goals this term as his Argentinian counterpart, but has recently suffered the indignity of being dropped for Eden Hazard to play as a false nine, and his future seems cloudy at best in the English capital.",News from around the web.,2018-12-28T11:15:01Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Si.com'}",Gonzalo Higuain Seeking Chelsea Switch With Juventus Happy to Accomodate Striker's Demands,https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/12/28/gonzalo-higuain-seeking-chelsea-switch-juventus-happy-accomodate-strikers-demands,https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/images/fbl-ita-seriea-milan-sampdoria-5c25ed0730305c6afb000001.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85,,Si.com,uproot,1
Mark Matousek,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday that New York City will not shut down the L train subway tunnel for 15 months. 
 The city had planned to close the tunnel, which runs between Brooklyn and Manhattan, for 15 months beginning in April to repair two tubes located beneath the East River. The tubes received serious damage during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

 New York City will instead adopt a new technology previously used for tunnel construction in Europe. The technology, which was recommended by teams from Columbia and Cornell Universities' engineering schools, has not been used in the US. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), New York City's transit agency, announced the planned L train tunnel closure in 2016. The MTA and other government agencies, like the Department of Transportation, had been working on a plan for the L line's 250,000 daily riders to use buses and other subway lines during the closure. Some Brooklyn residents had moved from the borough in anticipation of the closure as rents declined in neighborhoods that would have been affected by it. 
 Some Twitter users criticized Cuomo for taking over two years to introduce the alternative plan. Here's what Cuomo's critics are saying.","New York Gov.

Anand Mohan J,"Police claimed Aslam was wanted in a case of attempting to steal an ATM in Maurya Enclave in 2012, following which a city court declared him absconding.
On April Fools day, a seven-member police team dressed in a kurta and lungi managed to trick and catch a 45-year-old alleged ATM thief. The accused, Aslam, had managed to outsmart police on several occasions in the past, uprooting and taking away ATMs in different areas and then posing as a first-time offender so he would get bail easily.
Tired of being taken for a ride, the Special Staff of Dwarka Police, headed by inspector Naveen Malik, posed as members of a gang from Mewat, and carried out an operation they called April Fool. As soon as the accused approached an ATM in the area, he spotted the policemen dressed as gang members, who struck up a conversation.
He then bragged about his previous criminal involvements and asked them about their crime records. After extracting enough information, a head constable from the group shouted April Fool much to Aslams surprise.
He got scared and tried to run away, but was arrested, said DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse.
Police claimed Aslam was wanted in a case of attempting to steal an ATM in Maurya Enclave in 2012, following which a city court declared him absconding.
Police claimed he has uprooted ATMs in Rajasthan, Karnataka and Kanpur, and is part of a new wave of ATM thieves who operate out of Mewat.
Explaining how the gang exploited vulnerability of ATMs, an officer said, There are two types of installations. One in which an ATM is fixed to the ground with nuts and bolts, and another in which it is placed on the ground and stuck with a strong adhesive. Both are hard to uproot, but the second is relatively easier.”
The accused and his gang would spend three days conducting a recce of ATMs in isolated areas, which also had good access roads for a quick escape. The gang would use a Scorpio or a Fortuner car for their operation. Nobody expects the driver of a Fortuner car to uproot an ATM. The accused would tie a belt around the ATM and use a makeshift pulley tied around the car. When the car accelerated, the ATM would be uprooted, the officer said.
The accused persons would take the ATM to Mewat, and pry open the cash collection box using a gas cutter.","Tired of being taken for a ride, the Special Staff of Dwarka Police, headed by inspector Naveen Malik, posed as members of a gang from Mewat, and carried out an operation they called ‘April Fool’.",2019-04-03T19:59:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}",Cops posed as gangsters: Police pull April Fool prank to catch man who uprooted ATMs,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/cops-posed-as-gangsters-april-fool-prank-catch-man-who-uprooted-atms-5657425/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/04/atm.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,uproot,1
Elyse Wanshel,"Ive watched the trailer for My Brilliant Friend, the first installment of HBOs adaptation of Elena Ferrantes Neapolitan novels, about 30 times. Im not joking. Ive been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up. But the reason I get emotional doesnt have so much to do with the fact that its a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision and probably wont be able to watch the series. Ferrantes Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means itll be entirely in subtitles. Its a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as Rome and The Young Pope, had English dialogue. But I cant read subtitles. I cant even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someones help or a magnifier. I also cant read street signs, which caused me to lose my drivers license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. Its a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities. Many people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who cant see well what is happening on the screen. People with low vision dont use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as Im sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO wont be including audio description for My Brilliant Friend, though. With HBOs decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles. But this isnt anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as its been in existence. HBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions. Snyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the scripts action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue. A skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful, he told me. Though it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as House of Cards, BoJack Horseman, Dear White People and American Vandal, told me that isnt the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series Narcos, a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be a lot going on. But after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner. So, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldnt HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable Frankly, its insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without. Personally, Im new to being ostracized by HBO because My Brilliant Friend is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Yet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for 2009s Monica &amp; David, a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it. Could you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your Game of Thrones theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of The Sopranos or Sex and the City? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind ? The decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision. Theres a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired, Johnson told me. And theyll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like theyre socially inept. They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone? Frankly, its insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without. The network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO wont budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company. HBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA. A representative from the FCC told me that HBOs Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description. Interestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing. That, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people? Its a shame, its discriminatory and it needs to stop.",The show will not have a feature that allows people with visual disabilities to watch.

BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to counter terror is the highest among all global leaders and the government will do everything necessary to uproot terrorism. He also said that the Modi-led government will again bring the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which lapsed after it was passed by Lok Sabha but could not be tabled in Rajya Sabha.
Referring to the Pulwama attack while addressing a youth meet organised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in Lakhimpur district, he said, This cowardly attack has been carried out by Pakistan, Pak-backed terrorists. The sacrifice of the CRPF personnel wont go in vain because there is no Congress government at the Centre but the BJP government led by Narendra Modi. And the Narendra Modi government does not compromise in matters of terrorism.
Whether it is Northeast or Kashmir, we will uproot terrorism entirely. Narendra Modis political will to fight terrorism is the highest among all global leaders. Diplomatic steps, bullet for a bullet or going inside Pakistan to carry out surgical strikes BJP government has given every possible answer to terrorism.
Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and state BJP president Ranjeet Dass addressed the rally, among others.
On the citizenship Bill, Shah said the Modi-led government will bring the Bill again and said that unless it is passed, people of Assam would be in the danger of demographic change. People of Assam are also understanding this danger, he said, alleging that some people wanted to gain political mileage out of the issue.
Shah lashed out against parties like the AGP and the Congress for opposing the Bill.
We are implementing NRC and stopping infiltrators. We wont let Assam turn into another Kashmir. That is our commitment, Shah said.
He said the previous Congress and AGP governments had done nothing to implement Clause 6 of Assam Accord, but the BJP government has implemented a high-level committee and once the party is voted back to power, recommendations of the committee would be implemented.","He also said that the Modi-led government will “again bring” the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which lapsed after it was passed by Lok Sabha but could not be tabled in Rajya Sabha.",2019-02-17T22:52:39Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}","Won’t let Assam turn into another Kashmir, says Amit Shah",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/wont-let-assam-turn-into-another-kashmir-says-amit-shah-5588496/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/02/amit-shah-759.png?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,uproot,1

Geoffrey O’Brien,"When Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” emerged in 1968, after repeated delays (filming had begun in late 1965) and nearly doubling the original $6 million budget, it was greeted as something of a disaster. Kubrick had kept a tight lid on the project, and when MGM executives got a look in March, they were aghast. At the New York premiere, a sixth of the audience walked out. Critics described it as “somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring” ( Renata Adler ) and “a thoroughly uninteresting failure” ( Andrew Sarris ), with Pauline Kael concurring: “monumentally unimaginative... trash masquerading as art.” None of that meant a thing to the younger spectators who began lining up on opening day and continued to come back. By the time I belatedly caught up with “2001” some months after its opening, acquaintances had already favored me with elaborate exegeses—metaphysical, prophetic, psychedelic—of what seemed to them not so much a film as an unbroken flow of revelation. Yet although ensconced as a canonical milestone and cited as a formative influence by filmmakers who followed, “2001” remains singular even in Kubrick’s oeuvre: slow, elliptical, deliberately enigmatic, often wordless. Its most emotionally expressive character is a dysfunctional computer, its culminating episode a sustained burst of abstraction. It is doubtful whether such a film could gather a mass audience now, and even more unlikely that any filmmaker would get the chance to risk it. Kubrick’s risk-taking is the through-line of Michael Benson’s “Space Odyssey,” an omnivorously curious account of how the movie came to be, starting with Kubrick’s letter to the novelist and scientist Arthur C. Clarke about “the possibility of doing the proverbial ‘really good’ science fiction movie.” Mr. Benson, himself a filmmaker and artist whose projects have often been concerned with cosmological science, has put together an enlightening and entertaining narrative rich in both pointed anecdotes and lucid technical expositions. The book’s large cast of characters reflects the scale of a production so complex it seems a wonder it didn’t take even longer to complete—especially with the director still working out basic plot concepts and contemplating radically different endings almost until the wrap. Kubrick has been mythologized as the ultimate control freak, and the obsessiveness of his concentration is self-evident, but Mr. Benson emphasizes his capacity to improvise, to respond creatively to other people’s hints, and to make large gambles. “We never had a finished script,” production designer Tony Masters recalled. “We’d get together with Stanley in the evening and talk about what we were going to do the next day—and as a result, the whole thing would change. The production department was suicidal.” Mr. Masters was only one of a small army of recruits making crucial contributions. As Kubrick seized advantage of the ample means his earlier successes had earned him, “a big-budget Hollywood production,” in Mr. Benson’s words, “had been transformed into a giant research and development think tank.” If “2001” now seems a relic of an already unimaginable era, it is because every element of its analog simulation of a future digital age had to be imagined, invented and built by hand. Arguments over who did the imagining and inventing of any given element have simmered over the years, but Mr. Benson shows how widely diffused the creative energies were, with artisans devoting months or years to solving minute technical problems while often having scant idea of the film’s overall structure. To watch the film after reading Mr. Benson’s book is to see it as an assemblage of disparate pieces, and to marvel again at the enduring beauty of their assembling. The opening “Dawn of Man” sequence alone involved protracted trial and error to create costumes for the hominids who first encounter the inscrutable extraterrestrial monolith around which the film is centered. These outfits needed to be both flexible and believable enough not to look like B-movie apeman outfits, while the American mime Dan Richter, who would play the lead hominid, studied a gorilla at Regent’s Park Zoo and trained a troupe of dancers to imitate his movements and behavior. In the meantime, photographers flew to Namibia to gather landscape images that would be combined to remarkably seamless effect with the staged action. When they sent Kubrick pictures of a rare and protected species of Namibian trees, he went so far as to urge them to illegally uproot a few and ship them back for use by the art department. Kubrick allowed little to get in the way of anything he thought necessary for the film, and the set could be a dangerous place to work. The rotating 30-ton centrifuge set representing the living quarters of the central episode’s Jupiter-bound astronauts regularly overheated amid showers of glass from exploding lights. To provide convincing simulations of zero gravity, Kubrick encouraged high-risk wirework stunts above a concrete floor. Stuntman Bill Weston, who had a frightening near-miss realizing one such scene, remarked: “One of the great things about Stanley was he had an incredible, tremendous artistic integrity. I think morally he was a little bit weaker.” Kubrick’s drive to push collaborators beyond their usual boundaries was not so much about realizing a blueprint as about venturing into the unknown. Despite the visual power of his art, Mr. Benson writes, Kubrick was “nearly incapable of actually picturing visual concepts when they were described verbally.” He found what he wanted, where he was going, by trying things out. Before there was even a script, he spent long days in an abandoned brassiere factory in Manhattan, filming blobs of paint diffusing in a mix of ink and paint thinner: These turned out to be the preliminary ingredients of the hallucinatory “Star Gate” episode of the film’s final chapter, when the surviving astronaut played by Keir Dullea makes his final journey “beyond infinity.” In like fashion, the whole movie was built up piece by piece, the connections between the pieces known only to Kubrick. Even when completed “2001” remained opaque to many. Clarke, truly the film’s co-creator, found himself shut out from the final stages and was unhappy with the omission of the narration that had been intended to guide the spectator through all the leaps of time and space. Kubrick preferred to leave in the gaps and mysteries, perhaps realizing it was the rational explanation that would date most rapidly. As a result “2001” became a nexus for free-floating speculation. In Nathan Abrams’s “Stanley Kubrick: New York Jewish Intellectual,” a sometimes tortuous exploration of the contradictions of Kubrick’s relation to Jewish identity, the film is seen through the lens of Biblical allusion and Kabbalistic interpretation. Scribbled into Kubrick’s copy of a book by Kafka, Mr. Abrams finds his marginal note: “The tower of Babel was the start of the space age.” Like many Kubrick analysts, Mr. Abrams can go very far afield in tracking down parallels and resonances. Then again, given the director’s readiness to explore any intellectual path or aesthetic suggestion that presented itself, nothing can really be ruled out. His “Space Odyssey” continues to be gloriously open-ended. —Mr. O’Brien is the former editor-in-chief of the Library of America.",Kubrick found what he wanted by trying things out—an expensive habit.,2018-04-15T02:55:00Z,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",‘Space Odyssey’ and ‘Stanley Kubrick’ Review: Like Nothing Else on Earth,https://www.wsj.com/articles/space-odyssey-and-stanley-kubrick-review-like-nothing-else-on-earth-1523565411,https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-YE467_bkrvku_SOC_20180410144655.jpg,the-wall-street-journal,The Wall Street Journal,uproot,1
Saahil Desai,"What We’re Following For some, the bubble is real. In the American mythos, the United States is a hodgepodge of groups that blend together in a swirl of harmonious pluralism. Yet a new study conducted by The Atlantic and the Public Religion Research Institute pokes holes in that self-image. Democrats and Republicans, for example, have wildly different views on the values of multiculturalism and religious diversity, and a large percentage in both parties would object to a child marrying someone from the opposite political party. The divisions are also racial—blacks and Latinos tend to hold very different views than whites on a range of topics, such as whether they’ve experienced difficulties voting or whether speaking English is an important part of being American. President Donald Trump has repeatedly made the case for a border wall by invoking “vicious cartels” that smuggle migrants across the border. But under the current administration, the U.S.’s anti-smuggling efforts have grown significantly weaker: The number of smuggling cases brought by the investigative arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement plummeted by 60 percent between 2016 and 2017. As president, Trump made the decision to prosecute migrants caught crossing the border in civil, not criminal, court, which has drained ICE’s resources and l ed it to cut back on its efforts to go after human smuggling. Humanitarian efforts aren’t generally controversial, but that hasn’t been the case with American aid to Venezuela. The Latin American country has been consumed by a cascading economic and hunger crisis, leading millions of Venezuelans to flee to neighboring Colombia. The U.S. government has responded by sending supplies such as groceries, vitamin supplements, and hygiene products to the country, but the aid has another, thinly veiled purpose —helping lead to the ouster of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. That ulterior motive has some aid workers fretting that the politicization of humanitarian initiatives could have disastrous effects. — Saahil Desai Evening Reads (Jonathan Bartlett) New England moose can grow up to 1,700 pounds and can run as fast as 35 miles per hour, but as global warming leads to shorter winters, they’re succumbing to a tiny but deadly predator: blood-sucking ticks. “First, they weighed him. To the trunk of the big spruce they strapped a custom-made scale—a steel ell with three pulleys and a thick rope to which they hooked a spring scale. They wrestled the moose onto a heavy net, collected the net’s four corners, and with the triple-pulley system and considerable effort, hoisted him off the ground... The moose swung slowly just above the snow. I asked what this ten-month-old calf would have weighed if healthy: about 400 pounds... ‘Two-seventy. Lightest one yet.’ The ticks had taken a third of this animal’s weight.” → Read the rest (Leah Millis / Reuters) Why has YouTube become especially susceptible to fostering and spreading loony conspiracy theories? “YouTube offers infinite opportunities to create, a closed ecosystem, an opaque algorithm, and the chance for a very small number of people to make a very large amount of money.

"Mara Wilson, Annika Neklason","What We’re Following Peace May End an Alliance: Chung In Moon, a special advisor to the South Korean president, said that South Korea may eventually like to see its alliance with the U.S. dissolve in an exclusive interview with Uri Friedman. Moon said that if North Korea agrees to dismantle their nuclear weapons to secure a peace treaty with South Korea and the U.S., the alliance between the latter two is unnecessary; however, he still supports the continued presence of American forces in South Korea if such an accord is adopted. As the potential summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un approaches and the past dramas of Trump’s Korea policy loom large, David Frum writes that in order for the Trump administration to retain respect, they may just have pretend negotiations are still on track. Some Tentative Scientific Progress: In a press conference today, Trump’s NASA chief, Jim Bridenstine, supported the scientific consensus that humans are contributing to climate change, apparently marking a departure from his own past stance and the views of the majority of the Trump administration. Beyond earth, the FCC continues their investigation into the first known unauthorized launch of commercial satellites, known as “SpaceBees,” and new private enterprises in Los Angeles are working to reawaken Southern California’s long-dormant spaceport.

Evening Read In our June issue, Sophie Gilbert describes the timely female anger featured in the television producer Marti Noxon’s two new shows: If a singular thread runs through Noxon’s work, it’s the assertion that women can be just as complex as men—that they can make catastrophic decisions, put themselves in danger, damage others, and (more frequently) damage themselves. And that on-screen, these stories are no less compelling, no less illuminating, than tales of difficult men making meth or metaphorically tumbling from Madison Avenue skyscrapers. The past few years have seen more and more female creators bringing complex women to the small screen. Angry women are at a premium now, their darkest, most humiliating moments having been so publicly unearthed and exposed in one form or another. There’s just so much to be angry about. Keep reading, as Sophie explains how Noxon’s life and career prepared her for the present cultural moment. What Do You Know … About Global Affairs?

Reader Response In our April cover story, Michael Gerson reviewed the political contributions of evangelicals throughout American history and explored why many came to support President Donald Trump despite his frequent deviation from traditional religious values. Peter M. Leschak remembered another ignoble period for a segment of the American evangelical community: I appreciated Michael Gerson’s thoughtful and well-crafted essay about evangelicals and Trump. However, the history he sketched featured a glaring omission. It’s true that before the Civil War, Northern evangelicals created and sustained the abolitionist movement, but it is also true that Southern evangelicals employed the Bible and their pulpits to not only justify slavery, but also advocate for the spread of that evil to the newly acquired western territories. It seems to me that defending and excusing Trump is consistent with the behavior of the Southern antebellum evangelicals, and to label it hypocrisy—while certainly correct—is far too mild.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Anton Brugger stands in his cactus nursery in Almeria, southern Spain The iconic cactus plant is veering into trouble say researchers. The most serious problem is illegal smuggling. Despite the international ban on uncontrolled trade in cacti, policing the smuggling faces many problems and semi-professional hunters continue to uproot plants to order, stealing from National Parks, Indian Reservations, but more significantly from the wild. In southern Spain, the plants are being devastated by the cochineal beetle. But the picture there is mirrored across other regions of the world. As Anton Brugger strides purposefully around his plantation set on the side of a steep hill in Almeria, southern Spain, he casts his gaze over the more than 10,000 cacti artfully arranged in terraces over two hectares. ""When visitors come here and see the really huge cacti such as Madagascar's Alluaudia procera, which grows to about 10m (33 feet), they are inspired to buy small versions in the nursery,"" explains the Austrian cactus afficionado. ""We tell them about the plight of the cactus in many parts of the world and they are astonished."" Their astonishment stems from the perceived hardy nature of the cactus able to withstand heat, drought and poor soil. But the Iberian peninsula's emblematic prickly pear is absent from Brugger's nursery. Image copyright Spl Image caption The cochineal beetle has devastated cacti in southern Spain The plant that typifies the traditional Spanish landscape is nowhere to be seen in Andalucia, devastated, Anton Brugger says, by a pest - the cochineal beetle. Although cacti are native to the Americas (apart from one species that also grows in Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa from the Ivory Coast to Ethiopia) new plants can be grown from off-shoots. So while the localised loss of this species doesn't spell the end of this iconic cactus species, it is part of a more worrying trend, according to South African-born Paul Rees, who is in charge of the tropical nursery at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew. Image copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Cacti come in a wide variety of forms Image copyright Richard Duebel He says that many of the approximately 2,000 identified Cactaceae species have a very restricted range which make them vulnerable. ""Cactaceae are considered one of the most threatened plant groups in the world,"" he explains. ""Over 30% are considered critically endangered or vulnerable,"" he adds. To put this in perspective approximately 25% of mammals are endangered. But with rising temperatures cacti are forced to withstand ever longer periods of drought. ""Cacti are being subjected to ever hotter weather. Some species can handle longer periods of drought and higher temperatures better than others,"" he continues. ""And the drier habitats become and the less water there is available, the harder it becomes for plants, which are already surviving in extreme conditions, to survive."" The IUCN, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, has categorised Cacti as belonging to two groups. These are listed in the two Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), with the most threatened appearing in Appendix I. However hunters continue to seek them out, especially in wild settings. Image copyright Spl Image caption Peyote plants are feeding the market for psychotropic drugs According to wildlife conservationists in the United States, cacti are being dug up at an ever accelerating rate for zealous collectors looking for niche species. Additionally narco-tourists are mining desert regions for small, psychotropic peyote plants and so feeding the market for mind-altering drugs. Cacti now rank just below drugs and guns as the most popular goods smuggled out of Mexico, according to conservationists. Alex Monro, who is research leader in the America's team at Kew, says that with teams working with the Royal Botanic Garden in remote areas and identifying new cactus species are very cautious not to reveal the the geographic location of newly identified cacti species. ""If we have material only known from a particular locality we know that there will be interest in that species from collectors,"" he says. ""If you look on our website you'll see that for those cacti you won't get any geographical information as to where those specimens have come from.""

Wilson Thomas,"In an effort to revive forest patches with natives plant species, Forest Department is currently carrying out removal of invasive plant species in Sirumugai range in Coimbatore. Senior officials with the Forest Department told The Hindu that invasive plants like Prosopis juliflora (s eemai karuvelam ) and Lantana camara ( Unni chedi ) are removed from the backwater area of Bhavani dam in Sirumugai. The special drive is expected to improve the backwater area where large number of herbivorous animals graze. “Lantana camara is the single largest invasive plant species in the forests of Tamil Nadu. Invasive plants are removed from 50 to 100 hectares of forest land a year in Coimbatore. This has been conducted for the last five years and the special drive is held in Sirumugai range this year. The results have been good,” said S. Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle. According to Mr. Ramasubramanian, Lantana camara has been posing threat to native plants and shrubs as they area spreading fast in forests. As berries of the shrub are favourite feed for birds, their droppings also aids seed distribution in the forests. K. Kalidasan of Osai said that Lantana camara has occupied natural grass lands in forests that are ideal for elephants. The thick shrubs also block movement of herbivorous animals. “Grass accounts to nearly 60 % of the food consumed by an elephant. With Lantana camara increasingly occupying the grasslands, the natural fodder for elephants in forests will be a question in the future,” said Mr. Kalidasan. He said that a scientific study needs to be conducted on the invasive species in the forests of Tamil Nadu and a protocol set for the eradication of such species and revive native plants. Mr. Ramasubramanian said that the invasive plants were removed manually as well as with the help of earthmovers as even roots left in the ground may help it regrow. Prosopis juliflora, a good firewood, removed from the forests are later sold. Funding for the activity comes from Tamilnadu Bio-Diversity Conservation and Greening Project, Special Area Development Project and Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve. Golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) and Opuntia ficus-indica, a species of cactus, are also spreading fast in the forests of Tamil Nadu.

"Harry Cheadle, Eve Peyser","Welcome to Evesplaining, politics writer Eve Peyser's column about why everyone else is wrong and she's right. The easiest route to fast fame these days is creating controversy explosive enough to hold the attention of social media users and the press for more than 15 seconds. (See: Tomi Lahren, Logan Paul, Lil Tay, et al.) But what virality giveth, it can taketh away in a hurry, as Roseanne Barr found out when her online behavior—which has been erratic and loathsome for years— got too racist for ABC, which immediately canceled her hit sitcom reboot after Barr compared former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to a monkey. (Her talent agency also dumped her.) In part, ABC’s swift reaction to Barr’s tweet is a result of the increasing politicization of the entertainment industry in the Trump era. The chaos of Donald Trump's White House, along with the president’s willingness to say the quiet part loud, has turned any Twitter user to the left of Mike Pence into a part-time activist. A TV network that continued to give a platform to a star who repeatedly goes out of her way to remind the world how racist she is would have a lot of questions to answer. Even Roseanne ’s relatively high ratings probably weren’t worth that headache. But it wasn’t incidental that Barr’s fall happened on Twitter, a social network practically designed for people to render themselves a liability. We seldom hear about the “Facebook mob” or the “Instagram mob,” even though the former has 2.2 billion active users, and the latter has over 800 million active users, making Twitter’s 330 million active users seem paltry by comparison. The difference comes from how people interact with these sites. Facebook is set up as a social network people use to communicate with ""friends"" they already know, while Instagram is based on images as opposed to text, and the comments section isn’t highlighted in the same way as a user’s individual posts are. Twitter, where the majority of accounts are public, is designed so that a reply to a tweet visually appears to have the same weight as the tweet itself. Moreover, Twitter is the preferred social network of journalists, politicians, and many celebrities—it’s a place you go to communicate with people you don’t know personally. For a lot of users, even famous users, the temptation to type something extremely stupid into that text box and hit “send tweet” seems to be irresistible—and any questionable tweet travels around the internet at the speed of light. The Twitter mob has wielded power since “President Donald Trump” was a joke. During the Gamergate controversy of 2014, where sexist gamers targeted video game developer Zoë Quinn and other prominent women in the field under the guise of “ethics in gaming journalism,” the men leading the crusade successfully campaigned to get companies to pull their advertisements from Gawker after one of the site’s writers jokingly tweeted, “Bring back bullying.” (Full disclosure: I worked for Gawker Media prior to tech billionaire Peter Thiel successfully bankrupting the website, and Quinn has written for VICE.) Bullying, as it turns out, never went away. Twitter users, especially women, are routinely harassed. Gleeful outrage doesn't just target powerful people who use the platform to propagate hatred and bigotry like Barr, it can also be used to uproot the lives of ordinary bad tweeters (see: Justine Sacco ), to little if any positive effect. Few people are really defending Barr, whose political views were obviously unhinged even before her recent Twitter rants. But we should be thinking more broadly about the dynamics of a site that has come to occupy a weirdly powerful place in the culture. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Saturday Night Live writer Katie Rich tweeted a tasteless joke about Barron Trump that generated so much outrage—from people all across the political spectrum—that NBC suspended her from the show for six months. Around the same time, after the political journalist Julia Ioffe crudely joked that the then president-elect might be “fucking his daughter” on Twitter, the backlash was so swift that she was fired from her job at Politico (luckily for her, she was then hired by The Atlantic ). The problem is that on Twitter the worst, most incendiary opinions are often the ones that get amplified, usually because people of all political persuasions love dunking on and ratio-ing bad tweets. Scolding a bad tweeter for their social media sins is an easy way to score a couple retweets and let your audience know that you are smarter than whoever you’re lightly cyberbullying. This is why even Twitter’s most active users, like me, generally understand the website as a toxic cesspool that mostly functions as a place to stay updated on the latest news and scold random people and celebrities. I often question why I stay on the platform, but as a journalist it’s a useful career tool, and as a chronic oversharer, I’m always keen to share my most inane thoughts with a larger audience. But it's obvious that the site has been going downhill for a long time. Once upon a time Twitter was fun because it was a place where people could find out what famous people did in their spare time, where reporters dumped nuggets from their notebooks and networked with one another, where comedians workshopped jokes and the internet-savvy memed their hearts out, a forum where people thought out loud. Maybe it was inevitable that Twitter transformed into the place you go to condemn others and be condemned yourself, but in any case that's what it is now. The solution to this is arguably pretty simple: To quote Hillary Clinton, “delete your account.” For any person with a public persona (or not), the risks of tweeting far outweigh the benefits. If Barr knows what’s best for her, she will soon follow through on her promise to leave Twitter, but as I write this, she’s still tweeting away. Not that her leaving would solve the problems plaguing the Twitter ecosystem. I actually don't think there's much we can do to make Twitter better. I hope people will eventually tire themselves out, like a baby crying herself to sleep, and feel less inclined to participate in the viral outrage of the day. But the site's interface rewards exactly the opposite type of behavior. Vitriol, not nuance, is what people share and amplify. Barr lost her show for being racist online, but that doesn't demonstrate toxicity isn't welcome on Twitter—it just means she went a little too far.

Al Jazeera,"Israeli forces killed a Palestinian suspected of carrying out a deadly stabbing-and-shooting attack in the occupied West Bank two days earlier.
The assailant was killed after he opened fire at Israeli forces who had come to arrest him, the Israeli Shin Bet security service said on Tuesday. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed a person had been killed in the clash, but provided no further details.
In what appeared to be a separate incident, the Palestinian health ministry said two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers near the West Bank city of Nablus. An Israeli army spokeswoman said the report was being looked into.
On Sunday, a suspected Palestinian assailant fatally stabbed a soldier at an intersection on a busy West Bank highway and opened fire at the scene using the conscript's rifle, killing an Israeli rabbi and wounding a second soldier.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site of the attack on Monday and pledged tough action, including the demolition of the assailant's home. ""These terrorists will not uproot us from here,"" he said.
Palestinians - many without links to armed groups - carried out a wave of attacks in the West Bank in late 2015 and 2016 but the frequency of such incidents has since decreased.
Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians seek to establish a state there and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.
The Palestinian attacker was identified by Israeli authorities as Omar Amin Abu Laila from the West Bank town of Az-Zawiya.
Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported the army had arrested some of Abu Laila's relatives on Monday.
Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised the West Bank attack as a ""natural response to crimes committed by the Israeli occupation"".
The attack came after two Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces last week in separate West Bank incidents.
On Thursday, two rockets from Gaza were fired towards Tel Aviv in a rare attack into the heart of Israel that looked to set the sides into another round of escalation.
Hamas denied Israel's accusation it was behind the rocket fire. However, Israel went on to target several sites belonging to Hamas' military wing in Gaza with about 100 missiles.",Reports say two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers near the West Bank city of Nablus.,2019-03-20T03:48:03Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Israeli forces kill Palestinian suspect in deadly attack,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/israeli-forces-kill-palestinian-suspect-deadly-attack-190320033501610.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/3/20/82abab19bd6f42ceabbbd4002d360b3f_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,uproot,1
Brianna Sacks,"Several dozen Puerto Rican families displaced by Hurricane Maria and currently living in Connecticut hotels have been told they will no longer get federal assistance to pay for their lodgings, just days after being promised an extension to their temporary housing assistance. Though the housing assistance had originally been set to expire on Jan. 13, FEMA had agreed last week to put 36 Puerto Rican families living in Connecticut up for another month, granting a request from the state's governor, Dannel Malloy. But just three days after granting the relief, FEMA abruptly reversed its decision, and halted payments for the hotel rooms, sending state officials scrambling and leaving families unsure of whether or where they would have a place to sleep the next night. ""These people are experiencing a second-level of trauma because they are being told one day they are safe and eligible and 24 hours later they're out of luck,"" the governor's deputy communications director, Jason Novak, told BuzzFeed News. ""It's exacerbating an already painful, emotional situation."" By the time the state stepped in with funds, ""a number of families had already been removed from hotels,"" Novak said. ""We got the call hours later and had to then notify these families about what was happening and tell hotel owners not to kick them out."" Neither the families nor state officials were informed that FEMA had decided to revoke the assistance Thursday. Instead, the federal agency switched the status of the families in its system, signaling to the hotels that they needed to check out by 2 p.m. that day, the governor's office said. “This about-face is outrageous and unacceptable, and because of your agency’s abysmal management of this situation, 36 families — all of who are American citizens — are now, with no warning, being told by FEMA that they have no place to live,” Malloy wrote in a letter to FEMA Administrator Brock Long, demanding that the ""egregious error"" be fixed immediately. ""All things considered, it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that the federal government sees the United States citizens who inhabit Puerto Rico as second class,"" Malloy added. Explaining the reversal, FEMA public affairs director William Booher told BuzzFeed News that after initially granting the extension, the agency reviewed the families' files and realized that 24 of the families were no longer eligible. FEMA representatives in Puerto Rico, he explained, had determined that their homes were now ""livable,"" meaning that the families could no longer qualify for housing help. He did not elaborate as to why the families' files had not been reviewed before FEMA made its initial decision to extend the assistance. ""Upon review of their case files, we found that 24 were ineligible for the [Transitional Shelter Assistance] because after inspection of their dwellings, it was determined they had little or no damage and their utilities were on,"" he said. Connecticut officials have pushed back on that assessment, however, pointing out that FEMA has not provided evidence to back up its determination, and that noting the ""disconnect"" between the agency's assessment and what the families' themselves have said about the condition of their homes. “This cold-hearted and irrational decision will have disastrous consequences for these families from Puerto Rico,” Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said in a statement. “I saw the devastation in Puerto Rico with my own eyes when I visited the island last month – these families’ homes have been ruined, and they don’t have access to clean drinking water."" On Friday, the families packed into a conference room at the Red Roof Inn in downtown Hartford for a press conference to share their stories of trying to assimilate, find jobs, and secure permanent housing in the wake of the hurricane. ""I came here because I lost my entire home,"" said Yara Vasquez Rivera through a translator. “We’re living in a constant state of fear, a constant state of terror. A constant state of terror. I don’t know what will happen to myself. My children. Can we stay at the Red Roof Inn? Can we not? These questions come up every day.” Rivera said that though she has found a job, she has been unable to find permanent housing because she keeps getting turned down by apartments. ""We're here because we don't have anywhere to go back to,"" she said. ""Our homes are gone. We are here to start a new life. But that new life is almost impossible to reach."" The uncertainty can be found across the country, with victims of Hurricane Maria left similarly stranded after losing FEMA's temporary housing assistance, which puts disaster victims up in budget hotels until they can find longer-term housing or return to their homes. Since Oct. 30, more than 10,000 Puerto Ricans have checked into hotels across 40 states using these funds. As FEMA removes Maria victims from its aid rolls, families struggling to find new, affordable housing in states like Ohio, Florida, Georgia, and New York, are now grappling with whether to once again uproot their lives, and move back to old neighborhoods that still lack reliable access to power and water. ""It's horrifying,"" said Marcie Roth, a former FEMA employee who now leads Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, a national organization that provides assistance to disaster survivors with disabilities. ""We are hearing way too many of these stories."" ""A lot of the time,"" she added, ""there doesn't seem to be a logical explanation"" for why people are found ineligible. With federal housing aid, Pedro Garcia, 58, was able to relocate on Nov. 9 to New Jersey after suffering a leg injury during the hurricane. But on Jan. 13, FEMA informed him that he no longer qualified for the funding. ""They said I didn't suffer any major damages to my home,"" he told BuzzFeed News. But he said his landlord told him that his apartment, in Guaynabo, still lacked electricity. Panicked, Garcia has repeatedly applied for temporary housing and medical assistance, submitting a slew of documents, including a letter from his doctor requesting FEMA extend his temporary housing assistance. On Monday, FEMA ruled that he was ineligible for medical aid because the agency ""was unable to verify losses."" The agency also said he had failed to upload the necessary documents to qualify for additional housing assistance, though Garcia said he has faxed and uploaded the information multiple times. On a call with FEMA Tuesday morning, a representative told Garcia that she could not see his file ""because the system was down,"" but that the agency had already made its decision. He could appeal, she added, although he already had. ""The system is designed for you to fail,"" Garcia said after hanging up. Even in cases where FEMA has extended temporary housing assistance, the agency has not informed the victims, leaving them uncertain as to their status. ""They don't tell you anything. You never know what is going to happen,"" said Yahaira Vega, a 32-year-old from Caguas who relocated to Ohio using temporary assistance funds, which she was told would expire on Jan. 13. ""I didn't know that I could appeal or ask for another extension. I thought I was going to be out on the streets."" Unable to return to her home in Caguas — where her mother and sister are still living without electricity — Vega, who suffers from congestive heart failure, was able to find space in public housing with the help of volunteer aid groups. After signing the lease, however, she learned that FEMA had actually extended her hotel stay for another month. ""No one called to tell me, "" she said. ""It's like they don't want you to know what's going on."" Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

Jon Blistein,"British reggae outfit Steel Pulse unveiled the lead single, “Cry Cry Blood,” for their first album in 15 years, Mass Manipulation, out May 17th via Rootfire Cooperative and the band’s own imprint, Wiseman Doctrine.
“Cry Cry Blood” is a meditative rocker with deftly placed horns, guitars and strings bubbling up above the song’s thumping groove. Singer David Hinds’ lyrics touch on injustice and violence, but end with a revolutionary call as he sings, “The whole world’s taking advantage/While we stand aside and look/It was prophesied we’d rise again/Just take a second look.”
Mass Manipulation marks Steel Pulse’s first album since 2004’s African Holocaust. Hinds said of the new LP, “For when it comes to addressing the current issues of the world, we hope that this album will be able to sharpen the minds of man to uproot all negativity, and foster embracement; presenting each and every one of us a higher level of consciousness for a harmonious future.”
In the years since African Holocaust, Steel Pulse has released a handful of singles such as “Put Your Hoodies On (4 Trayvon),” in honor of Trayvon Martin, and “Paint it Black,” which was released in 2013 to mark what would have been the 100th birthday of Rosa Parks.
Steel Pulse will embark on a massive world tour this spring in support of Mass Manipulation. The group’s North American leg kicks off March 30th at the Warfield in San Francisco and wraps May 3rd at the Beach Life Festival in Redondo Beach, California. The group will play a few additional festivals over the course of the summer, while they plan to announce more tour dates soon.

Jason Schreier,"Yesterday, at the exact moment Activision Blizzard chief executive officer Bobby Kotick hopped on a quarterly earnings call to inform shareholders that his company had just gone through a record year, employees across the publisher of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and more were being brought into conference rooms and informed that they were losing their jobs.
Its a bloodbath here, one Blizzard employee told me last night. A lot more cuts than we were expecting.
As Kotick and other executives were telling investors that the next Call of Duty was shaping up to be the best one yet, employees across Activision Blizzards various divisions nervously sat at their desks, waiting to see who would be next to get the severance envelope. In Blizzards publishing department, management had booked a series of meetings from 1pm to 3pm Pacific. On the calendar, they were all blank. Everyone knew what that meant.
The look on peoples faces as theyre pulling in through the [campus] gates is just awful, said another Blizzard employee. This is the fucking worst.
Later on the call, Kotick delivered the grim news: Activision Blizzard, which employed around 9,600 employees last year, would reduce its workforce by 8%. That equated to around 800 people. Some were junior employees, having started at the company just recently; others had been with Activision Blizzard for 15 years or longer. Some were informed yesterday; others, particularly in Europe and other non-U.S. divisions, didnt find out their fates until this morning.
It was carnage. People were laid off at Activisions main office in Santa Monica, California, where an entire team of Destiny publishing staff had been coming to work with nothing to do. (Some of them were laid off; some were moved to Call of Duty or other teams. Some in other departments were also laid off.) People lost their jobs at King, the developer of Candy Crush, and at Activisions various development studios including Vicarious Visions (Albany, NY) and High Moon Studios (San Diego, CA), both of which had handled support on Destiny 2. Activision Blizzard staff in Europe, Latin America, and other regions across the world also lost their jobs. Some who were laid off wrote messages on social media to say goodbye, while developers all across the video game industry tried to help by posting job listings on Twitter and Facebook. Although the bulk of laid-off employees were support staff, some were in departments like art and design as well.
Over the past week Ive talked to around 20 people who were laid off or close to those being laid off, as well as others with knowledge as to whats happening at Activision Blizzard. If theres a consensus, its rage. Rage at Koticks comments, at the way Activision executives seemingly view their employees as numbers on a spreadsheet, at the callousness in which this layoff was handled. Theres rage at who was chosen to be laid offtwo people told me that it felt like a random, haphazard practiceand rage that some important employees were let go. Some who had been laid off told me they had felt safe, expecting their studios or departments to not be affected. Even those who felt layoffs were necessary or justifiable said they were shocked by the scale, scope, and coldness from executives.
At Blizzard, for example, rumors of big layoffs had been circulating as early as November. Back then, as I began to learn about the sweeping changes that had come to the legendary game studio in 2018, I heard from a former high-level employee that layoffs were coming in February. I heard the same from a source plugged into the investor community. Another Blizzard employee told me today that the layoffs had been an open secret for months.
Blizzard, founded in 1991, has developed critically and commercially successful games from Warcraft and StarCraft to Diablo and Overwatch. It has kept its game quality high even after Activision merged with the studio in 2008. It just hasnt produced many new games of late, increasing tensions with management in Santa Monica. Since the beginning of 2018, as Kotaku has reported previously, the mandate at Blizzard had been to cut costs and produce more games. 
To those who worked outside of Blizzards development teams, in departments like publishing, esports, QA, and IT, it felt last year like the axe was about to fall. After all, if Blizzard was looking to develop more games without spending more money, theyd need to lose headcount in non-game-development departments. But management said nothing. With no union or other method for collectively communicating with executives, employees were left with nothing but whispers. As November turned into December and the new year came, all they could do was wait.
Last week, as rumors began heating up and culminated in a Bloomberg story on Friday night reporting that hundreds of layoffs were coming, one Blizzard employee reached out to me to ask if I knew whether or not theyd get severance. The person said they werent expecting to be affected, but wanted to know if Id heard anything about how impacted employees would be treated. Just in case. On Tuesday night, I found out theyd been laid off. (Full-time employees who were laid off across Activision Blizzard did get severance, although contractors did not.)
I heard other stories, too. Some people supposedly learned their fate early, signing non-disclosure agreements last week in exchange for severance packages. Others took buyouts thanks to the Career Crossroads program that allowed QA, customer service, and IT employees to voluntarily leave, as we reported in December. Some were given hints from their managerswarnings to polish their résumés before Tuesday. One Blizzard employee told me theyd see the job networking website Linkedin open on computer screens as they walked around the office over the past week.
Some outside of Blizzard, at Activisions various development studios, thought they were safe but on Tuesday and Wednesday reached out to let me know that they or their colleagues had been unexpectedly laid off.
Last night, the picture at Blizzard became clearer. Support teams had been gutted. The layoffs were largest in non-development departments like IT and QA, according to those who were there. The esports department was hit hard, as many within Blizzard had expectedafter all, it had been led by Amy Morhaime, wife of Mike, the long-time Blizzard CEO who left the company last fall. She departed around the same time. The two Morhaimes were seen as big advocates for esports within Blizzard, even when it wasnt quite as lucrative as Activisions executives might have hoped, and with them gone, the department was in danger.
Blizzards publishing department, which is comprised of PR, marketing, community, and other game support divisions, was also hit hard. Around late 2015 or early 2016, Blizzard had split North American and global publishing into two departments, according to long-time employees. It was seen as a bad move by those who worked there, one that caused resentment, redundancy, and unnecessary bureaucracy. As part of this weeks layoffs, Blizzard reconsolidated those divisions, laying off dozens in the process. Executives like chief operating officer Armin Zerza and marketing boss Todd Harvey, both of whom are heavily connected to Activision, are running the show.
So what does this all mean for the future of Blizzard? Since the beginning of 2018, Activision has been exerting more influence on Blizzard, pushing the company to release more games and find more ways to make money. General consensus, even among rank-and-file employees, is that Blizzards lack of new game output over the past few years hasnt been healthy or sustainable. But Activisions influence has raised questions among Blizzard staff about whether the studio can retain its culture. Said one former Blizzard employee to me last December: Theres a real struggle now between developers and the business people Strategic decisions are being driven by the finance group. 
Blizzard has spent the year taking big measures to cut costs as it prepares for a lean 2019. Those

For decades, Activisions philosophy has revolved around annualized releases, most notably with the gargantuan Call of Duty series, which hasnt skipped a year since 2004. That sort of schedule is diametrically opposed to Blizzards release it when its ready philosophy, which has led to massively successful games like Overwatch and Hearthstone but has also led to periods like the present, in which Blizzard has gone three years without releasing a major game. The tension between annualized releases and games as a service that dont have to have new, boxed releases and sequels is one of the main reasons that the Activision and Bungie relationship never worked out. Last month, the two companies split, with Bungie buying the full rights to sell and publish Destiny on its own.
This year will likely be a slow one for Blizzard, as the company implements its new strategy across franchises like Diablo, Warcraft, and Overwatch (all of which have new games in development, many for smartphones). Then, well likely see more new Blizzard games come out more regularly than ever before. And well have to wait and see if they live up to the quality bar Blizzard has set for itself over the past three decades.
At the Yard House restaurant in the Irvine Spectrum mall in California last night, a group of current and now-former Blizzard employees met up to drink and commiserate. The mood was somber, according to one person who was there. There was plenty of sadness and blame to go around. There was anxiety expressed by those who now need to hunt for new jobs, and those who might be forced to uproot their families for new cities or countries. And among those who remain at the company, theres survivors guilt. The fallout of this layoff will linger for a long time. Work again tomorrow, said one Blizzard employee who remains at the company. I have a feeling no one will be doing much work the rest of the week.","Yesterday, at the exact moment Activision Blizzard chief executive officer Bobby Kotick hopped on a quarterly earnings call to inform shareholders that his company had just gone through a “record year,” employees across the publisher of Call of Duty, World of…",2019-02-13T19:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kotaku.com'}",The Fallout Of Activision Blizzard’s Massive Layoffs,https://kotaku.com/the-fallout-of-activision-blizzard-s-massive-layoffs-1832597892,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--T8Yy5O2w--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/j0wvfkle55dikdumywcr.jpg",,Kotaku.com,uproot,1
Anju Agnihotri Chaba,"Even as Punjab received mild to heavy rainfall coupled with hailstorm and cyclonic winds last night and wee hours Monday, however, no loss of ready-to-harvest wheat crop was reported from any part of the state. Awareness of farmers, timely advisories and online weather facilities helped farmers protect their crops. The danger, however, is not over yet. According to the Met department, Punjab may receive heavy showers coupled with strong winds till April 11. Experts have advised farmers to construct trenches and dig up some earth on the sides of the field in case there is rain. As per the Met department, Punjab’s districts have received 1.0 mm to 14.0 mm rainfall while the lodging of the crop was reported from Kapurthala and Mohali districts. “Due to continuous bad weather during the wheat harvesting season every year, the farmers now have become more cautious and they check the weather conditions online during the harvesting season,” said Dr JS Bains, Director Punjab Agriculture department. “We had advised them not to irrigate the crop now because the roots of irrigated crop gets weak due to softness of the earth and strong winds then uproot them,” the Director added. “This time we were getting regular SMSs from Agriculture department officials and also we were checking the weather conditions regularly online for the last two weeks because we needed to irrigate our crop,” said a farmer Amarjit Singh from Bhogpur in Jalandhar. Another farmer Jagdeep Singh from Sangrur’s Kanoi village said, “In our village around 5 per cent lodging was reported due to strong winds and hailstorm, but still this loss is recoverable if such winds don’t blow.” Experts from the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, when contacted, informed that though slow and normal rain during this season is not bad for the ‘standing crop’ but heavy rain and strong winds would damage them as crops get detached from the soil.

Danielle Tomasello,"We are fortunate to have numerous opportunities to pursue various careers in science. Yet when it comes to navigating the field, little is available to support people when choosing their path. Other professions have resources dedicated to staffing, such as external recruiting firms whose sole job it is to find quality candidates. We rely on job boards, word of mouth and cold calling.
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and my research is focused on studying the underlying biochemical changes that occur in complex mental health disorders. As a postdoc, I feel the need to constantly think about my career trajectory. I have attended numerous career and skill development events over the years where I am always reminded of the importance of networking. During my first few meet and greets, happy hours and social events as a postdoc, I felt immense pressure to network and develop advantageous relationships to propel my future career.
Needless to say, I felt my efforts fell short. I realized the key issue is the absence of an atmosphere where people actively want to provide help and guidance to others. The scientific field has a very exclusive nature, and fields are severely segregated. Many people uproot their lives to new cities and have trouble getting their foot in the door when they get started. Our field lacks a support network when pursuing a career in science or working through challenges in their current role.
I reflected upon my journey to where I am today, and how my friends and colleagues were my biggest support network. I realized if these science professionals can help me to navigate the scientific field, why can’t they provide advice for others? This is when I created The Social Scientist. I first reached out to my colleagues and friends, and found they were supportive of my initiative to provide career and life advice to others. From there, the initiative has steadily been growing.
We are a nonprofit networking and outreach community of scientific professionals. Our volunteers are dedicating their time to answer questions that will benefit your interests, including a view of their work, environment and what it took for them to get there. We want to provide an accessible and engaging atmosphere to help both scientists and science enthusiasts looking for guidance in an informal setting. From the high school student interested in science but unsure where to start, to the associate editor working towards editor in chief, we want to provide support for all those in the scientific community.
Our goal is to continue to grow our community of dedicated volunteers. We give back by helping both prospective and current science professionals. Currently, we have science professionals in the fields of academia, industry, writing and editing, and government, as well as an alternative careers section for those whom have transformed their science background onto a different path.
Tarjani Agrawal, a data scientist with a background in neuroscience, is not only a volunteer on The Social Scientist but additionally has contacted another volunteer via the site. “This community can help [our colleagues] overcome their inhibition of interaction by connecting them with successful volunteers who can guide them in their careers. This is a great initiative and I am glad to be part of it.”
An essential component for our initiative is to enlist the right kind of volunteers. We have found that the best advice comes from people who have a real passion for their field and work. We all have different backgrounds and experiences that have influenced our career path. Discussing both our struggles and achievements is invaluable when providing guidance for others.
We have responded to numerous inquirers who have contacted our volunteers seeking advice. The first inquirer that contacted our site was looking for advice in the industry setting. Now, Jacob Johnvedakumar is a volunteer on our site. We were ecstatic to have helped Jacob with his career pursuit and now are excited to have him on the team.
We are aiming for the initiative to continue to grow in both volunteers and inquirers. We want to provide a community for all STEM fields, and therefore to accommodate each field. I hope within the following years that The Social Scientist will grow into a large community that everyone can turn to for support. I picture a LinkedIn meets Life Coaching for STEM professionals.
In the scientific field, we pursue a degree because we want to understand more about the world. We need to support one another so we can continue to make great strides in scientific discovery.

Reuters Editorial,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will probe allegations that state attorneys defrauded government of billions of dollars by deliberately losing cases, the justice minister said on Tuesday, the latest crackdown on corruption under President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa, who replaced former president Jacob Zuma in February, has made the fight against corruption a key plank of his administration as he seeks to restore investor confidence after the scandal-plagued Zuma era. The Special Investigating Unit (SIU), a state entity which probes malpractice in government, will look into hundreds of cases where state attorneys are accused of colluding with private lawyers to agree the settlement of fictitious claims. “The investigation will help the Department of Justice to lay to rest concerns that have been raised,” Justice Minister Michael Masutha told reporters. “Where appropriate... disciplinary action as well as criminal investigations will be initiated against alleged perpetrators to ensure that firm action is taken to uproot corrupt activities.” In the health ministry, one of the departments worst affected by the alleged fraud, claims totaling 56 billion rand ($4 billion) will be investigated, Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi said at the same briefing.

Express News Service,"Baba Banda Singh Bahadur (File) More than 300 years after brave warrior Baba Banda Singh Bahadur declared Lohgarh zone of Yamunanangar district in Haryana as the capital of the Sikh state in 1710, the foundation stone for symbolic “Lohgarh Khalsa Rajdhani” was laid down on Sunday to promote “divine tourism”. This initiative was taken by Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Heritage Development Trust while the state government has also announced to develop this place as a tourist destination. The new project initiated by the trust includes construction of a gurdwara, an exhibition hall, a langar hall and multimedia classrooms. Nodal officer of the project and Yamunanagar’s District Development and Panchayat Officer (DDPO) Gagandeep Singh told The Indian Express that the foundation stone for revival of the “Lohgarh Khalsa Rajdhani” concept was laid down by a group of five Sikh community members. “Lohgarh Fort was constructed by common people of the country to uproot the then Mughal Empire and this Fort was not constructed by any monarch. In view of this, the trust decided that the foundation stone shall be laid down by commoners,” he added. Last year, after the state-level function for 300th martyrdom anniversary of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, a research was started on Lohgarh Fort in which many surprising facts pertaining to Sikh history came into light. “Bhai Lakhi Rai Vanjara was a main force behind the construction of Fort Lohgarh. Lohgarh was a important trading center and many manufacturing units were established by him for construction of the Fort Lohgarh,” said Singh. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had recently announced setting up of another trust named after Baba Banda Bahadur at Lohgarh to develop this area as a tourist destination, a magnificent memorial gate on the Kapal Mochan-Lohgarh road and ‘Badkhalsa Yatri Niwas’ and Pir Budh Shah Memorial Park at neighbouring village Sadhaura.

"Paul Sperry, RCInvestigations","By Paul Sperry, RealClearInvestigations, February 14, 2019
In what would be one of the Trump administration’s most far-reaching moves regarding race relations, top White House officials are planning a sharp pullback from federal efforts to correct imbalances in outcomes for minorities in everything from housing to hiring. On the table: a ban on the use of a controversial numbers-focused racial-bias theory known as “disparate impact.”
Federal regulators and lobbyists familiar with the change say the White House management and budget office is reviewing a proposed executive order, originally drafted by two conservative Washington think tanks, that would prohibit the use of “the disparate-impact approach in the enforcement or application of any civil-rights law.”
A catalyst for the move is White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who is currently also serving as interim White House chief of staff and who, while serving in Congress, was a longtime critic of disparate impact. It is not clear whether President Trump has decided to issue the executive order, which would repudiate the underlying rationale for scores of regulations and thousands of government lawsuits alleging racial discrimination, resulting in billions of dollars in fines. Doing away with it would engender fierce opposition from Democrats.
The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.
Championed by liberals and civil-rights activists, and aggressively enforced by the Obama administration, disparate-impact doctrine holds that policies or practices that are set forth and applied neutrally can be discriminatory if they have an unequal impact on specific groups. Aimed at rooting out subtle forms of bias, the theory asserts that statistical disparities can be proof of discrimination even when no intention is clear.
Although the Supreme Court first approved use of the approach in 1971 and reaffirmed its use most recently in 2015, conservative opponents of the doctrine believe the currently constituted high court would uphold an executive order doing away with it.
The Obama administration used disparate impact to sue hundreds of school districts for civil rights violations because they disciplined black students at higher rates than whites. It also used the theory to allege bias in consumer credit reporting, employee background checks, student loans, criminal court fines, traffic stops and arrests, and home and auto lending, among other things.
Conservative critics argue liberal politicians and bureaucrats have long misused the theory to find racial bias where it does not exist. They see it as a social-engineering weapon aimed at equalizing outcomes and extending the government’s power over the private sector.
""Cutting back on disparate-impact liability is an important and welcome development,” said University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Amy Wax. She argues that disparate effects are assumed to stem from racism when other factors better explain such racial gaps, including economic conditions, behavior and culture.
Presuming that racial disparities are signs of discrimination, as the federal government typically does, and forcing organizations to close them through policy changes ""imposes an expensive, inefficient and often counterproductive burden on private actors in our society,” Wax said.
The ultimate impact of the proposed executive order is not clear, but presumably it would require the government to meet a much higher standard of demonstrating that policies were intended to discriminate.  
Disparate-impact theory has long been a concern of conservatives, who were alarmed by the Obama administration's broad embrace of it. Constitutional scholars, both in academia and at think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and Center for Equal Opportunity, co-drafters of the proposed order, have been pushing the Trump administration since its earliest days to abandon the approach.
Some of these advocates were disappointed that the Department of Education stopped short of invalidating disparate-impact liability in December when it rescinded the Obama-era school discipline guidance that was anchored in the theory. The NAACP and other civil-rights advocates have long insisted disparate impact is a vital tool for ferreting out hidden racism. In a statement, the ACLU asserted that “the attack on disparate impact is the latest in a series of Trump administration assaults on civil rights.”
Liberal groups and many Democrats are marshaling a fierce pushback against efforts to dismantle the race regulations, including filing lawsuits and proposing legislation. Even critics of disparate impact say it is so deeply embedded in federal policies and regulations that it will be hard to uproot.
“Federal agencies are honey-combed with policies that adopt the disparate-impact approach, and the Trump administration needs to root them out,” said Roger Clegg, a former Justice Department attorney who now serves as general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity in Washington.
He and other conservatives say the president can banish disparate impact’s use by regulators since it is not overtly written in underlying civil-rights statutes; he can order that regulators police discrimination instead by using the higher bar of disparate “treatment,” which the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear means actions undertaken with racially discriminatory intent. Trump would be emboldened in making such a move by the recent addition of more conservative justices on the high bench, including Brett Kavanaugh, who is said to frown on the heavy-handed application of disparate-impact theory.   
President Obama argued that African-Americans are particularly harmed by traditional practices in housing, banking, employment and education. He ordered agencies to collect personal information by race and turn the data over for analysis. The administration used the statistical disparities to accuse bankers, educators, police, landlords and employers of racism, and ordered them to shrink gaps between blacks and Latinos and whites and Asians to achieve “racial equity.""
To satisfy disparate-impact claims involving minorities, police departments and courts across the country have curtailed traffic stops and arrests, forgiven court fines and fees, and eliminated cash bail requirements for arrestees. Employers have eased policies requiring clean criminal records for new hires, out of concern that arrests and convictions disproportionately disqualify minorities from employment.
Landlords have also backed off similar background checks – which they've done for decades as standard rental policy, without regard for race – because such inquiries could result in higher refusal rates for black applicants.
“To call this [tenant background check] policy discriminatory, let alone racist, is quite a stretch,” said Clegg, who is actively lobbying the White House to write disparate impact out of federal rules and regulations.
A number of mortgage lenders have returned to making risky, subprime-quality loans in inner cities to help settle federal disparate-impact lawsuits that claimed uniform underwriting standards adversely impacted blacks and Latinos with weak credit.
Critics say government pressure to close racial gaps has led to the erosion of safety and other important standards, spawning unintended harm to minorities and non-minorities alike.
Violence in urban school districts, for instance, spiked as administrators pulled back on punishments under “disparate impact” mandates issued in 2014 by the Obama administration to reduce racial disparities in suspensions and school-related arrests and to inoculate themselves from federal threats of investigation and defunding.
Recent school surveys show violence, including student-on-teacher assaults, exploded after districts adopted the new discipline reforms, including in cities such as New York, Buffalo, Syracuse, Baltimore, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis. In Parkland, Florida, confessed shooter Nikolas Cruz was able to legally purchase firearms because Broward County arrest-diversion programs designed to close discipline disparities meant that his name never showed up in government data bases despite repeated run-ins with law enforcement.
In December, the Trump administration rescinded the Obama discipline rule, but stopped short of removing the disparate-impact liability undergirding the directive, leaving schools uncertain about their exposure to investigation if they return to suspending violent or unruly students or referring them to law enforcement.
Critics of disparate impact argue that in most cases, socioeconomic factors largely explain racial disparities, not discrimination.
One example they point to is the oft-cited Obama administration statistic that black students are suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. From this raw data, the former administration concluded that prejudiced teachers and principals single out black kids for punishment while letting white kids off the hook for the same infractions.
But a comprehensive 2014 study on school discipline published in the Journal of Criminal Justice found that “the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the [minority] student.” It concluded that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators was usually not racially biased.
A national survey of students conducted in 2017 by the federal Centers for Disease Control found that African-American students are more than twice as likely to get into fights “on school property” than white students – according to black kids themselves. In a separate study, CDC attributed problem behavior among minority students to adverse childhood experiences, including single parenting, domestic abuse and poverty.
“More blacks being suspended than whites just reflected the fact that more blacks misbehaved,” said civil-rights attorney Hans Bader, who recently left the Education Department, where he worked in both its Office for Civil Rights and its Office of General Counsel.
The federal government has also assumed that racism is behind racial “disparities"" in police activities. Following the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri, the Justice Department forced that town’s police department to reform its policies after finding black motorists were “overrepresented” in traffic stops and citations. “These disparities are unexplainable on grounds other than race and evidence that racial bias has shaped law enforcement conduct,” the department’s Civil Rights Division declared in a 2015 report.
Yet data from Justice’s own research arm, the National Institute of Justice, show that African-Americans, on average, violate speeding and other traffic laws at much greater rates than whites. It attributes differences in traffic stops by race to ""differences in offending."" Most blacks don’t doubt this. NIJ notes that three out of four black drivers say “police had a legitimate reason for stopping them.”
Another federal agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, found that black motorists violate traffic laws at higher rates than whites in every offense category, including driving with an invalid license.
Damned if They Do, Damned if They Don’t
Federal regulators are now using the theory of disparate impact to accuse employers of racism in the normal vetting process of workers.
Through an Obama-era compliance directive and the threat of lawsuits, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission discourages employers from looking up the criminal records of job applicants, because they have a ""disparate impact"" on black men. But the imprisonment rate for black men is nearly seven times higher than that of white men. And, as a federal judge ruled in throwing out one of EEOC’s cases against a private business, such checks are a “rational” part of hiring processes designed to screen out people of all races who could steal from companies or commit fraud -- or even workplace violence. In court documents, U.S. District Judge Roger Titus scolded the agency for trying to “pump up” statistics and engaging in “scientific dishonesty” to make it look like employers were biased.
In granting almost $1 million in attorneys’ fees to defendant The Freeman Companies, Titus also pointed out the hypocrisy of claiming private employers are racist for doing exactly what the EEOC and all other federal agencies do: conduct criminal, as well as credit, background checks on more than 90 percent of their own employees.
Other defendants have been pressured into settling cases with the EEOC, including BMW Manufacturing in Spartanburg, S.C., which agreed to change its screening policies after denying jobs to contractors with serious drug convictions and other felonies. “BMW’s policy had a significant disparate impact on black employees and applicants,” the EEOC asserted in its complaint. In addition to paying $1.6 million in relief to 56 African-Americans with criminal records it turned down for jobs, BMW was forced by the government  to no longer decline to hire any job applicant because of criminal arrests or charges “of any type,” including violent felonies, according to the consent decree.
EEOC’s policy is a Catch-22 for employers: If they hire criminals, they risk litigation for their work-related misconduct; but if they deny them jobs, they could face a federal lawsuit. This double-bind of liability is especially severe for the banking industry, which has to satisfy regulators working at cross purposes.
“Financial institutions are definitely between a rock and a hard place,” a senior executive at Bank of America headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., told RealClearInvestigations. ""We have banking regulators from the FDIC and OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] insisting that we do background checks, while the employment regulators at EEOC are arguing against background checks.""
The disparate-impact policy has led financial regulators to claim that bank credit checks on loan applicants are also now discriminatory, because they, too, have a ""disparate impact"" on African-Americans and Latinos, who tend to have more credit problems than other groups.
Using the same stat-based disparate-impact analysis, industry experts say, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has charged dozens of auto lenders with violations of fair-lending laws, claiming that racial disparities in loan approval rates and finance charges amount to discrimination. Ally Financial, the industry’s largest lender, was fined a record $98 million after it refused to admit bias in lending and change its underwriting and financing policies.
The bank asserted that differences in creditworthiness explained differences in loan outcomes. CFPB later admitted under congressional grilling that it did not even factor the credit scores of denied minority applicants into its investigation of Ally -- even though Federal Reserve and other studies show credit scores are the most reliable predictor of a borrower’s risk of defaulting on a loan.
American Honda Finance Corp., an auto lender, did not fight similar charges, while still admitting no wrongdoing, and was ordered to pay a relatively smaller $24 million in relief to African-American and Hispanic borrowers who the CFPB claimed were overcharged. However, as part of the settlement terms, Honda had to agree to drastically change its financing policies by capping interest rates on loans.
After industry complaints of harassment reached a fever pitch, Trump signed a joint congressional resolution last year overriding CFPB’s policy cracking down on racial car-loan disparities under disparate impact.
The CFPB itself, meanwhile, is the target of a pending class-action lawsuit filed by black former employees who claim they were victims of pay and promotion “disparities"" at the agency. The allegations in their complaint stretch back to 2011, when the agency first opened.
Together with prosecutors at Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, CFPB has also used the stick of disparate-impact lawsuits to extract billions of dollars in fines and minority loan set-asides from mortgage lenders, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, claiming their underwriting policies also have a ""disparate impact"" on blacks and Hispanics. In the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama administration civil-rights lawyers compared bankers to Klansmen, claiming that disparities in outcomes for black loan applicants are “every bit as destructive as the cross burned in a neighborhood.""

In response, banking industry officials warn that the federal government is exerting exactly the kind of political pressure on financial institutions that helped cause the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Bankers argue that income and credit concerns accounted for the statistical gaps in loan approvals and loan costs for minorities that federal regulators cite as discriminatory. Nonetheless, many prefer settling their cases with the government, rather than contesting them, to avoid what industry lawyers call the ""reputational injury” that inevitably comes with a protracted battle over the combustible allegation of “racism.""
As with the auto-finance industry, applicants’ credit scores were largely ignored by federal investigators alleging racial bias in home lending, even though federal studies show that slightly more than half of African-Americans have bad credit. And the credit problem is not limited to lower-income blacks: Studies show even wealthier blacks are more likely than whites to miss payments or default on loans.
The Federal Reserve has found that the “[d]ifferences in credit scores among racial or ethnic groups … are particularly large,” with 53 percent of African-Americans scoring at the bottom of tier of creditworthiness compared with 16 percent of whites.
Under current rules and regulations, “differentials observed in data may prompt disparate-impact lawsuits or investigations — even though socioeconomic differences among different groups most often explain the disparities in outcome,” American Bankers Association counsel Paul Hancock argued in a recent document lobbying HUD to revise a 2013 rule using disparate impact to enforce the Fair Housing Act. The rule, he added, gave the government and civil-rights groups more authority to sue lenders based on “mere differences in denial rates in public loan data.”
Some worry that the credit industry’s gold standard for predicting repayment performance — FICO credit-scoring models — could itself be viewed as discriminatory next.
“Disparate-impact theory could be used to attack scoring models that approve members of protected classes proportionately less,” said Christopher Willis of Ballard Spahr LLP, a Washington-based law firm representing the banking industry.
""Virtually every lender in the United States could be sued for using non-discriminatory credit standards simply because variations in economic and credit characteristics produce different credit outcomes among racial and ethnic groups,” the Mortgage Bankers Association and Independent Community Bankers of America complained in a joint statement.
Under disparate impact, “all decisions are subject to second-guessing by the EEOC,” including basic job qualifications, since “all job qualifications have a disparate impact on some race, color, religion, sex or national origin group,” said University of San Diego law professor Gail Heriot, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
“This is a profound change in the American workplace — and indeed in American culture,” she added. ""There is nothing more contrary to the American spirit than the notion that everything is presumptively illegal.”
Heriot proposes the U.S. attorney general take inventory of every regulation and policy in the federal government imposing liability for disparate impact, in order to justify their legality and constitutionality. “The truth is that disparate-impact liability is an unbelievable mess,” she said. “The administration needs to get a handle on this issue."" 
President Trump has asked several federal agencies, including the CFPB, to reexamine disparate-impact policies, but department heads have moved in fits and starts, partly due to red tape and partly due to skittishness over being viewed as racist by civil-rights activists and the media.
“If you don’t favor using the disparate-impact approach in civil-rights enforcement to the nth degree, then you are a ‘racist,’ and the mainstream media can be counted on to accept this narrative uncritically,” said Clegg.
The slow unwinding of disparate-impact regulations has frustrated conservative lobbyists and many Trump appointees in regulatory positions. Although businesses, schools and other organizations are not operating under the constant threat of disparate-impact enforcement as they were under Obama, many of the rules are still on the books and being enforced by civil-rights examiners and prosecutors left over from the previous administration. 
Punching Back
The Trump administration’s efforts to root out disparate impact from racial-bias laws has alarmed civil-rights activists and Democrats, who have launched a resistance campaign. They fear minorities would lose a key legal tool for protecting themselves from discrimination, noting that civil-rights lawyers would have a much harder time bringing discrimination cases to court if disparate-impact liability is no longer available to them. They plan to fight back to preserve full use of the tool on two fronts: the courts and Congress.
Activists have already filed lawsuits against Housing Secretary Ben Carson, as well as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to block their efforts to defang disparate impact-based regulations and policies.
Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the new chairman of the House Education Committee, seeks to expand the Title VI statute to include disparate impact and authorize the filing of lawsuits over it. And he has the backing of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who recently vowed to “take decisive action” to “keep schools free from discrimination.” By discrimination, she means differences in racial suspension rates under race-neutral disciplinary codes.
""With or without the discipline guidance, the administration is legally responsible for ensuring school discipline policies do not have a disparate impact on historically disadvantaged students,” Scott asserted in a recent statement.
Likewise, new House Banking Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters has said she will bring “dishonest and criminal” banking officials  before her panel to grill them about not lending enough money in low-income urban areas. The California congresswoman says she wants bankers, along with their regulators, to make stronger commitments to “increasing homeownership rates among African-Americans.”
Waters also plans to create a new House subcommittee focusing on “diversity” in banking and ""financial inclusion.” She says she intends to ""expose and eliminate"" disparate-impact discrimination in financial services.
Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of the House Judiciary Committee has said she intends to put disparate impact front and center in the formation of a new panel she’s proposing to help compensate African-Americans for slavery: The Commission to Consider Reparations Proposals for African-Americans.
Although such legislation won’t get much traction as long as Republicans control the Senate and Trump is in the White House, rolling back disparate impact will be harder with Democrats controlling the House.
William Pendley , who recently stepped down as president of the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation, said that he is “thrilled” at the prospect of an executive order banning disparate impact, which he describes as a “dormant virus” that, if not written out of regulations, could “spread into every industry and segment of society where there are racial imbalances.”","In what would be one of the Trump administrations most far-reaching moves regarding race relations, top White House officials are planning a sharp pullback from federal efforts to correct...",2019-02-14T19:32:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Realclearinvestigations.com'}",Trump Looks to Uproot Numbers-Only Racial Bias Test,https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/02/14/trump_looks_to_end_numbers-only_bias_theory_governing_american_life.html,https://assets.realclear.com/images/47/471711_5_.jpg,,Realclearinvestigations.com,uproot,1

Chipotle Mexican Grill is piloting its points-based loyalty system (dubbed Chipotle Rewards) in three test markets: Phoenix, Kansas City (both in Kansas and Missouri) and Columbus, Ohio. In a statement that requires three or four readthroughs to properly digest, the chain’s Chief Digital and Information Officer Curt Garner had this to say: “Now, with Chipotle Rewards, the more you Chipotle, the more you earn points towards free Chipotle.” That’s a lot of Chipotle. Eligible customers in each of the three test markets can sign-up for Chipotle Rewards via the Chipotle app or on Chipotle.com. Those who enroll can earn 10 points for every $1 spent, with 1,250 points resulting in a free entrée. In what could be the boldest move of the year by a restaurant plagued with food safety and credit card security issues, Chipotle also throws shade at competing loyalty programs in the official release : “Offering a free entrée of choice allows customers to choose their favorite menu item without restrictions like other loyalty programs.” Shots fired. For a limited time, customers can earn 15 points for every $1 spent in the app and online, and customers in pilot markets can also earn free chips and guac after their first purchase using Chipotle Rewards.

Reuters Editorial,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has urged Egyptians to topple their government in the second message from Islamist militants this week calling for violence in Egypt where presidential elections are due in March. Egypt has stepped up its battle with Islamist militants ahead of the vote on March 26-28. Cairo launched the latest military offensive against an Islamic State branch in Sinai which has killed hundreds of police and soldiers and some civilians since it launched an insurgency in 2014. Islamic State, an enemy of al Qaeda, released a video on Sunday in which it warned Egyptians against taking part in the vote and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders. In an undated audio recording, the Egyptian-born Zawahiri did not issue any specific threat, and did not mention any election. “I call on everyone... to work to uproot this apostate, criminal and corrupt regime, and to jihad with weapons, money, word and actions, raids and ambushes, strikes and protests,” Zawahiri said in the recording. Al Qaeda first posted the recording in its Telegram channel on Wednesday. The group has not recently claimed attacks in Egypt, but a group linked to it claimed a deadly assault on police in Egypt’s western desert in October last year. Zawahiri has publicly criticized Islamic State for its brutal methods, which have included beheadings, drownings and immolation.

Police claimed to have got a lead on the accused, Musharraf, from a doctor who was arrested last month for allegedly supplying drugs and alcohol to prisons. On June 9, Amitava Chowdhury, the contractual doctor with Alipore jail, was arrested with 2 kg cannabis, four liquor bottles, 35 mobile phones, and Rs 1.45 lakh. “We got to know about Musharraf and the gang from Chowdhury during interrogation,” said a police official. “Our government is determined to uproot the racket that supply narcotics, alcohol and mobile phones to jail inmates. A thorough investigation is under way to go to the roots of this menace and I guarantee that nobody will be spared. All the existing loopholes responsible for this illegal activity will be identified and sealed,” said state Correctional Services Minister Ujjal Biswas. A huge amount of drugs and mobile phones have also been recovered from Musharraf, a police official said. “He used to supply these materials to his agents who would then take the same to the prisoners. Further interrogations will reveal the names of other operators in the field. We are not ruling out the involvement of a section of jail guards in the racket,” said a police officer.

Reuters,"TOLEDO, Ohio — General Motors built the final Chevrolet Cruze small car at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant on March 6, despite demands from President Donald Trump, Ohio political leaders and the United Auto Workers union not to close the plant and leave nearly 1,500 workers laid off.
Dina Mays, a 14-year veteran of Lordstown Assembly, was not at the plant for its last day. She had already moved on to her new workplace, GM's Toledo transmission plant, where the automaker builds 10-speed transmissions for popular pickup trucks. Lordstown and Toledo are 160 miles apart.
The U.S. auto industry is heading into a new cycle of plant closings and job cuts. Sales in the world's second-largest vehicle market are projected to fall. Consumers shifting away from traditional sedans such as the Cruze have left GM with more workers assigned to building cars than the market can support.
But GM has the reverse problem with trucks — for now, it cannot build them fast enough. That is helping GM find new jobs for displaced sedan plant workers, and blunting attacks from the UAW and politicians.
The automaker recently announced it will add 1,000 jobs at a plant in Flint, Michigan, to build a new generation of GM's largest pickups.
A GM spokeswoman said last week that 538 workers from a Detroit plant slated to close in 2020 and nearly 100 from Lordstown have already signed on in Flint to fill those jobs. Flint is nearly 270 miles from Lordstown.
That and other job opportunities could cushion the blow for most of the 1,450 workers currently laid off at Lordstown. The Ohio plant is one of five North American GM plants slated to close by January 2020.
GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said the automaker expects to have 2,700 job openings by early 2020 at other thriving plants, enough to absorb nearly all of those displaced in plants in Maryland, Ohio and Michigan willing or able to uproot for work hundreds of miles away. GM said another 1,200 affected hourly workers are eligible for early retirement.
Based on a plant-by-plant count provided by GM, if every worker displaced or soon to be displaced volunteers for or accepts a new job — and those eligible to retire do so — that would potentially leave up to 500 GM factory workers jobless, far fewer than the thousands decried by the UAW and Trump.
Ohio is a key state for Trump's 2020 re-election chances. In July 2017 he vowed in Youngstown, Ohio, near GM's Lordstown plant, that those auto jobs were ""all coming back.""
""Don't move,"" he told residents. ""Don't sell your house.""
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he had spoken with Barra to demand she ""do something quickly"" to keep the Lordstown plant running. GM responded, ""Our main focus remains on our employees and offering them jobs in our plants where we have growth opportunities. We have opportunities available for virtually all impacted employees."" The company said the ultimate fate of the plant will be decided in contract negotiations with the UAW this fall.
Nomadic workers
""I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING,"" Trump tweeted.Referring to his conversation with CEO Mary Barra, Trump added: ""I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW union — I don't care, I just want it open!"" 
Trump also tweeted on Saturday to urge GM to reopen the plant, saying: ""Toyota is investing 13.5 $Billion in U.S., others likewise. G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!""
Mays and other veteran GM factory workers have been pushed into nomadic lives before. Mays is on her third GM factory in 15 years. In 2005, she moved to Lordstown in northeastern Ohio after being laid off at a GM plant in Baltimore, Md., more than 300 miles away.
""I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's rough,"" Mays said. Her eldest son is at college, and a 12-year-old son remains with relatives near Lordstown. ""But I have to be able to support myself and my kids.""
After 25 years with GM, she has five years until retirement, so transferring ""was the best decision I could make.""
For those who move, GM offers a $30,000 cash package to offset costs. If the company has jobs for laid-off workers elsewhere and they refuse them, they lose their supplemental pay and are eligible to hire on again only at their ""home plant"" — in this case, Lordstown.
Scant options
For Joe Stanton, 55, transferring 160 miles to Toledo from Lordstown made sense.
With 25 years at GM, he also has five years to go before he can retire. He rents an apartment with Mays just outside Toledo to cut costs. He moved 75 miles from Pittsburgh to Lordstown in 2006 when his GM plant there closed. He owns two homes, one near Lordstown and one in Pennsylvania.
Stanton misses his adult son in Pittsburgh and girlfriend near Lordstown but said he is lucky not to have small children or sick parents to care for so he could move to Toledo.
If the UAW renegotiates a new product for Lordstown, retooling the plant would take years, Stanton said.
""That's a gamble I wasn't willing to take,"" he said.
For those left behind, the outlook is bleak.
Tod Porter, chair of Youngstown State University's economics department, estimated Lordstown's closure could cost more than 8,000 jobs including at auto suppliers and service providers, in an area still affected by steel mill closures decades ago.
Dave Green, president of UAW Local 1112, which represents workers at Lordstown, said he is fighting for the plant to reopen but added unemployed GM workers have scant options.
""If you don't want a job flipping burgers for minimum wage, you got to get the hell out of here,"" he said.","Filed under: Hirings/Firings/Layoffs, Plants/Manufacturing, GM Refugees from plant closures travel the landscape like nomads.

In MP, the Congress is seeking to oust the BJP which has been in power in for the last 15 years, while in Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla is seeking a third consecutive term as the BJP looks to uproot the Congress in its last bastion in the Northeast. The counting is scheduled for December 11. 4,363 service voters issued electronic ballots All preparations have been made and now we are ready to conduct free and fair elections, informed states Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ashish Kundra. CEO Kundra said, A total of 209 candidates are in fray.

Madhya Pradesh | 7.50 a.m. To the booths after a closely fought contest As campaigning for elections to the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly ended on Monday evening, the ruling BJP and the Congress sounded upbeat. The BJP is hoping for a straight fourth term in a State that has traditionally been a stronghold of the Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliates. But the Congress is banking on an anti-incumbency mood due to 15 years of uninterrupted BJP rule. Can Congress hold on to its last N-E bastion? Christian-majority State of Mizoram is voting to decide whether the Congress will hold on to its last bastion in the North-East or make way for a change of government. But for the first time since it attained statehood in 1986, Mizoram is unsure whether the Congresss traditional rival Mizo National Front (MNF) or another political entity would be that change. Much of this uncertainty is attributed to an aggressive Bharatiya Janata Party queering the poll pitch in a State where it had been content with a token presence in all past elections since 1993.","Polling began in Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram after closely-fought campaigns.

Reuters,"Hareth Najem fled the last ISIS enclave in eastern Syria wounded and alone. The Iraqi orphan's family had died two years earlier in airstrikes across the border in al-Qaim region.
Lying in a cattle truck beside another injured boy at a desert transit point for U.S.-backed forces, Hareth huddled under a blanket.
His face was covered in dirt and the side of his head wrapped with bandages covering wounds incurred days earlier.
Hareth was 11 years old when the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria carved out its ""caliphate"" in both Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of civilians and attracting an array of enemies that have fought from the air and on the ground to uproot the jihadists.
Now 16, he was among the children swept up this week in the civilian evacuation of Baghouz, the last shred of land under the jihadists' control where they are on the brink of defeat at the hands of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Around 20 children crossed the frontline on their own this week, including Iraqis, Syrians, Turks and Indonesians, said SDF commander Adnan Afrin.
The fathers of some were identified as ISIS fighters and arrested immediately.
""These children who are coming out have no parents or guardians,"" said Afrin, adding that some had gone hungry for a long time. The SDF plans to hand over the children to aid groups, he said.
The SDF began an operation on Friday to clear the last remaining pocket of ISIS fighters from the besieged village of Baghouz, and the operation resumed on Saturday.
The military campaign to uproot the militants from the eastern bank of the Euphrates River began in September, pushing them down toward Baghouz, near the Iraqi border. 
The operation was halted Feb. 12 after the Kurdish-led SDF said a large number of civilians and hostages were holed up in the territory,

cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi),"You technically can't skip these ads. But you wouldn't want to anyway. In 2016, at Sundance, YouTube unveiled a new ad format to brands : the unskippable, six second ""bumper"" ad. To prove it was possible to cram a compelling story into such a short window, they recruited a handful of creative agencies to test drive the format -- and the results were pretty convincing. After that, huge brands like Under Armour and Anheuser-Busch adopted the new six-second ad format to tell quick but gripping stories that actually stuck with audiences. In fact, according to Google, 90% of bumper ad campaigns boosted global ad recall by an average of 30%. That's pretty impressive for taking up only six seconds of someone's day. It might seem like you can't accomplish much in that amount of time, but with a little creativity, brands can use it to forge an emotional connection with their audience and implant a vivid memory of those feelings in their minds. Why Six-Second Bumper Ads Work Suffering through 15-, 30-, or even 60-second pre-roll ads prompted so many head shakes and back-button clicks that eventually, YouTube added a skip button to their ads in 2009. In theory, though, an ad’s first five seconds are enough to hook viewers and hold their attention for the rest of its duration. But we all know this rarely happens. Whenever a YouTube ad pops up and shields you from your favorite video, what do you usually do? You immediately glue your eyes to the skip button's countdown clock and wait … until those lingering seconds finally slug by. Fortunately, the six-second pre-roll ad engages viewers without testing their patience. When YouTube plays such a short ad for them, it's not as annoying as a full-length ad. And when brands craft these ads into fast, captivating stories, they can resonate well with audiences. This lets YouTube sustain their ad business while helping brands create a more enjoyable and memorable user experience for its viewers. So, if you're running a six-second pre-roll ad on YouTube right now, hats off to you. If not, here are 13 examples to help you brainstorm the best way to delight your YouTube viewers without getting in the way of their chosen video. 13 Exceptional Six-Second Pre-Roll Ads on YouTube 1. YouTube Campaign: YouTube Advertisers To further promote their new ad format's creative potential, YouTube challenged filmmakers and ad agencies to retell classic pieces of literature in just six seconds. These are some of the most complex novels ever written. So creatives needed to convey each story's core in a simple yet spellbinding way. Rethink, a Canadian agency, did just that. Their rendition of Hamlet is clear and concise (we all know that everyone dies when modern day Claudius spams the buy button). But it's also unexpected and funny because it gives us a glimpse of how Hamlet could've transpired in today's digital age. 2. Bounce Campaign: Dryer Sheets Billy's sneaky grin at the end of this bumper ad gets me every time. Bounce didn't reach for the stars with this short ad, but it's topical humor was perfect for the time allotted. And what it promotes is appropriate given how easily forgettable dryer sheets can be when doing laundry. You'll think about Bounce every time you fill the dryer (or get your son stuck on the back of your shirt) from now on. 3. Mom's Touch Campaign: Spicy Chicken Wings Mom's Touch is a chicken burger restaurant chain based in South Korea, and the language barrier in the YouTube ad above doesn't stop you from loving it. Google actually ranked this YouTube ad in the top 20 bumper ads in the world in 2017, and it's only five seconds long. The company didn't even take the additional second to squeeze more attention out of its customers. It featured just a sheep who shows you exactly how spicy their chicken wings really are. 4. Chipsmore Campaign: #takeiteasy I know you fell for it too. When I first saw the red face of doom, disappointment started spilling over me. But, luckily for us, the Chipsmore's Cookie Guy saved the day. The thing is, we just wanted to watch the ad. Imagine how someone who wanted to watch a video after it must've felt. They were probably frustrated at the initial sight of the ""broken"" video link, then surprised when the Cookie Guy appears, which grabbed their attention. And, finally, delighted when their favorite video starts. This ad takes its viewers on an emotional roller coaster. And, honestly, who doesn't have fun on those? 5. Road Lodge Campaign: Relaxing Hotel Rooms This is a prime example of insanely honest marketing. Road Lodge sets the expectation that their hotel is best suited for relaxation. And not so much for partying. You might think they're deterring potential customers from their hotel -- and you're right -- they are. But it's actually a good thing because these people would never stay at their hotel in the first place. And since their honesty signals confidence, builds trust, and shows that they value their customers' experience more than short-term profits, their target market becomes more attracted to them. Road Lodge knows that if you're brutally honest about your product or service, then you won't disappoint your customers. This makes it a lot easier to maintain their loyalty. 6. Under Armour Campaign: It Comes From Below When you play baseball, nothing matters more than your stats. They're a direct measurement of your performance and can even define your value as a person. Under Armour sought to uproot this belief. In six short seconds, Droga5, Under Armour’s agency, works with Washington Nationals right fielder, Bryce Harper, to inject purpose into ball players everywhere. The pre-roll ad motivates viewers to place their value in their character instead of their numbers. 7. PG Tips Campaign: Keep It Tea This ad from a popular English tea brand was designed to hold your attention one second at a time. The pre-roll ad opens to show cloth hands, making you wonder what exactly is holding this mug of tea. Oh, it's a puppet monkey. And it's adorable. The cuteness and simplicity behind this ad was intentional, as well. In its YouTube video's caption, PG Tips delivers a note of solidarity against the ""silly and ridiculous."" Sometimes the truest messages only need six seconds of your time. 8. Hefty Party Cups Campaign: Office Party Here's another member of YouTube's list of top 20 six-second ads in the world, and it comes to us from Hefty® -- not just a garbage bag brand, according to this energetic ad. Sometimes, you have to embrace the most extreme uses for your product to get your customers' attention. Hefty® Party Cups took that to heart with six shameless seconds you won't soon forget. And hey, maybe it's the perfect reminder to pick some of those red cups up before that raging shindig you have planned... 9. Mercedes-Benz Campaign: Mercedes-AMG GT S Mercedes-Benz targets the Singapore market in this bumper ad for a new two-door sports car. The video uses swift video cuts and a roaring engine to engage their viewers' senses. This way, its audience can actually see and hear the intensity of reaching 60 MPH in only 3.8 seconds. 10. Universal Pictures Campaign: Jason Bourne Universal Pictures used this pre-roll ad to promote the full Jason Bourne trailer, which garnered over 14 million views. And since the ad is chock full of non-stop action, it piqued viewers’ interest and generated tremendous hype around its trailer release. 11. Burn Campaign: Energy Drink Burn’s pre-roll ad is so effective because it’s snappy and visually engaging. And since you can process visuals 60,000 times faster than text, a flaming fist across the face will definitely catch your eye. The slow-mo effect also makes the ad seem longer, intensifying your viewing experience. 12. Airbnb Campaign: Leave Loving Home Made Family vacations are the best. You get to explore incredible places and create timeless memories with your loved ones. Is there any other way you would want to bond with your family? Airbnb agrees too. So their agency, TWBA, produced a charming ad that showcases the benefits of a family vacation: loads of fun and connection. 13. Geico Campaign: Unskippable Elevator The Martin Agency, Geico’s creative partner, deserves a lifetime supply of car insurance for this masterpiece. And although it isn't just six seconds long, it's a skippable ad you won't want to skip. “Unskippable” was so refreshingly original, it won AdAge’s 2016 Campaign of the Year. And for good reason too. It sympathizes with your annoyance of pre-roll ads, so it ends before you can skip it. But it's also so unique and witty that you'll actually watch the entire ad. Geico says this ad is impossible to skip because it's already over. But really, this ad is impossible to skip because it's so clever.","You technically can't skip these ads. But you wouldn't want to anyway. In 2016, at Sundance, YouTube unveiled a new ad format to brands : the unskippable, six second ""bumper"" ad.

Suresh Sharma,"MANALI: The invasive and poisonous weed congress grass (parthenium), which has propagated from North America to Maharashtra and then to many Indian states has now wreaked havoc in Kullu villages where it is spreading extremely fast. Locally known as congress grass or gajar ghas, parthenium causes respiratory and skin diseases among humans and even cattle maintain distance from the weed because of its poisonous properties. The weed was first sighted in Una, Bilaspur and some lower areas of the state and now it has started moving towards high altitude regions. In Kullu town, it is spreading fast in the Kharahal valley. Mostly, the weed can be seen by the roadsides in many villages. The weed, according to its nature, has started killing other species. Vimal Sharma, a resident of Talaiti village of Kharahal valley, said that the locals of his area have no idea of the grass. We had never seen this species until two years ago. Now its growing everywhere and spreading very fast. We have observed that the area where it grows, no other weed survives. Cattle stay away from them. It is thriving mostly close to the roads, he said. Experts say the weed can be eradicated manually by hands if invasion is in primary phase. Otherwise, it starts suffocating other flora in the region. Unfortunately, people are unaware about its adverse effect on health and environment. We dont know anything about this grass. This is new to the area and I dont think anybody in the area even know the name of this species, another resident Hemraj Sharma said. If this species is harmful for both humans and cattle, government should take effective steps to root out this menace and educate the people, he added. Forest conservator with Himachal forest department, Bhupinder Singh Rana, who had warned about possibility of congress grass menace in the state and had run campaigns to destroy this weed in 2013, said he had observed the presence of this poisonous weed in lower Kullu in 2011. Public awareness is the only solution to this problem. Best way to get rid of this weed is to uproot it by hands after wearing gloves and mask. It should be destroyed before it grows flowers and seeds, he said. According to experts, a plant of congress grass can produce over 20,000 seeds and propagate with the help of wind, animals and human. Once it spreads, its complete eradication will be very difficult.","Locally known as congress grass or gajar ghas, parthenium causes respiratory and skin diseases among humans and even cattle maintain distance from the weed because of its poisonous properties.

C.J.,"Everyone at Bravo cried into the lamé scraps of Mood Fabrics back in 2008 when The Weinstein Company decided to uproot Project Runway and send Heidi Klum, Tim Gunn &amp; Co. to Lifetime. It was definitely a blow to the network built upon a foundation of filming gays making over straights, over-serving middle-aged housewives, and attempts at fashion that would send Michael Kors into fits and shrieks of “ It’s too pageant! ” Welp, nearly ten years later, TWC is broke after the fall of Harvey Weinstein, and Project Runway is strutting back into the arms of Andy Cohen. Deadline reports Andy was at NBCUniversal’s upfront presentation in New York today and said, “ Project Runway is coming back where it all started, it’s coming home on Bravo. ” That has to come to the relief of executives over there who were honestly running out of places in the world they could film train wrecks on boats, planes, bars, big houses, little houses, and everything in between. Andy even tweeted a photo from 2006 of him and Tim Gunn…at least, I think that’s supposed to be Andy. It could also just be a Banana Republic employee. A + E Television Networks, which owns Lifetime, dropped TWC in April after all the accusations against Harvey came out. That left Project Runway without a home. It sounds like Harvey was as angelic as we might expect in dealing with the show. His company got sued by NBC when they first moved to leave the network for Lifetime. When A + E re-upped Project Runway for three more seasons in 2016, they had to also agree to buy a bunch of shitty TWC movies to air on Lifetime. I’m surprised they also weren’t legally obligated to make Marchesa the official uniform of the Lifetime workplace. Anyway, Bravo is coming back to Bravo, which hopefully will give it a bit of a classier edge than the perpetual shrieks of Vicki Gunvalson we’ve grown accustomed to. Now all they have to do is fill up the rest of the hours of the day with James Lipton interviewing Sharon Stone again for Inside The Actors Studio, and we might have the best network in all of TV!

PTI,"Referring to tribal Jharkhand, he said the ruling BJP there was working against the adivasis and “we must get rid of it.” (File)
JMM leader Hemant Soren on Saturday called for “uprooting” the BJP from the country and said the opposition parties to give a “fitting” reply to the “communal” party in the next Lok Sabha polls.
Speaking at the mammoth united opposition rally hosted by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Soren said the way BJP is running the country will create a “violent and disturbing time for the country.”
“We the opposition parties have to give a fitting reply to the communal reply to the communal forces … We will have to uproot BJP not only from the Centre but also from the states,” the former chief minister of Jharkhand said.
“You are seeing a lot of opposition leaders here … It is because of the present political situation in the country – how communal forces are gaining ground, how BJP is trying to run the country and the states. I feel this is a dangerous situation for the country,” he said.
Referring to tribal Jharkhand, he said the ruling BJP there was working against the Adivasis and “we must get rid of it. “The country, he claimed, is aware of the violence that is being perpetrated by the BJP in Jharkhand, Gujarat and in other states, including Bengal.
Soren urged the youth of the country to join in the efforts of the opposition parties to defeat BJP. “We have to give a fitting reply to the communal forces.”","Speaking at the mammoth united opposition rally hosted by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Soren said the way BJP is running the country will create a ""violent and disturbing time for the country.""",2019-01-19T10:14:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}",Hemant Soren calls for uprooting BJP from the Centre and the states,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/hemant-soren-bjp-mamata-banerjee-5546203/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/06/soren.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,uproot,1
PTI,"Senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot today lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making every Indian's life miserable. Delivering the inaugural address of the 'Mera Booth Mera Gaurav' campaign here, the former Rajasthan chief minister said Modi backed off from all his promises and has created a state of indecision in the country. ""The peasant community is in deep sorrow as none of the promises made by the BJP government has been fulfilled. They are losing and the insurance companies are minting money out of crop insurance,"" Gehlot said. ""The kind of atmosphere, that has been prevailing today is very disappointing and dangerous with trust among the people at stake. It never happened ever earlier. There is a state of indecision in the country today"", he added. The prime minister has made life miserable for the common man, traders, and all other classes, Gehlot said. The former Rajasthan chief minister called upon Congress workers to gear up with determination to uproot the ""anti-people"" BJP regime. ""This government has also muzzled the right of disagreement by not allowing agitation. In a democracy, it is the right of the people to agitate but by banning them, the government is crushing them"", he said. Earlier in the day, as Gehlot arrived at the Jodhpur Civil Airport here, an unidentified person allegedly misbehaved with him leaving the senior leader upset. As Gehlot came out of the airport, a huge crowd of party workers welcomed him. Someone in the crowd held his hand and pulled the 67-year-old leader making him lose his balance. Gehlot would have fallen down if not for some alert party workers who caught hold of the leader just in time. ""He lost his balance and was helped by the workers around otherwise he would have fallen down. He became quite irritated after that"", said a party leader who was present there. On Sunday, Gehlot is scheduled to address the party workers of his own constituency at Sardarpura.","Modi has made life miserable for all: Ashok GehlotThe peasant community is in deep sorrow as none of the promises made by the BJP government has been fulfilled.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | Vatican City | Published: August 20, 2018 4:51:27 pm Pope Francis speaks at the St. Nicholas Basilica in Bari, southern Italy, in this file photo. (Reuters photo) Pope Francis, facing simultaneous clergy sexual abuse crises in several countries, on Monday wrote an unprecedented letter to all the world’s Catholics asking each of them to help uproot “this culture of death”. In the letter, addressed to “the people of God,” he also promised that no effort will be spared to prevent abuse and its cover-up. “We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death,” he said. The letter also responded to a recent grand jury report in the US state of Pennsylvania. He said that while most cases in the report “belong to the past,” it was clear that abuse “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced”. A Vatican official said it was the first time a pope had written to all of the world’s some 1.2 billion Catholics about sexual abuse. Past letters on the scandal have been addressed to bishops and faithful in individual countries. The grand jury last week released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the US Catholic Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years. The letter was released as the Church is facing sexual abuse scandals in a number of countries, including the United States, Chile and Australia. It also comes days before he visits Ireland, which is still reeling from the effects of its own abuse crisis.

Express News Service,"If ATMs can be hacked, why can’t EVMs be hacked: PAAS leader Hardik Patel. Javed Raja As the chances of BJP’s victory looked brighter by noon, scores of mediapersons gathered outside the residence of Hardik Patel, seeking the reaction of the 23-year-old Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader. He finally appeared at 3.30 pm, after it was almost certain that the BJP would get the numbers to form the government again. Alleging that the BJP win was because of EVM tampering, Hardik said, “I will not congratulate the BJP for their victory because it is due to cheating. The people of Gujarat have been awakened but they will have to do more. EVMs have been tampered with and this is a reality,” he said. Expressing surprise at the defeat of the Congress in Patidar-dominated areas like Surat, Rajkot and Ahmedabad, he alleged it was due to EVM tampering. “Poora mahaul banaya gaya tha EVM tampering ke liye (an atmosphere was created for EVM tampering),” he said. He added that all opposition parties should take up the issue and start a movement against EVMs. “I urge all opposition parties to take this concern against EVMs forward. If ATMs can be hacked, why can’t EVMs? Why don’t other nations use machines for elections,” said Hardik. Asked if he would congratulate the BJP, he said, “I congratulate the BJP for winning elections by EVM tampering and playing dirty tricks. The people of Gujarat had taken a decision (to uproot the BJP), but the ruling party won through money power and EVM tampering.” He also alleged that an Ahmedabad-based firm was involved in hacking the source code of 5,000 EVMs with the help of 140 software engineers.

B. Tilak Chandar,"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday stayed lower court proceedings against Assistant Professor Nirmala Devi in the audio tape scandal case. Passing an interim order in the case, the court also ordered notice to the State. 
A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and S.S. Sundar observed, A woman is inside the prison for more than a year. What is the necessity for this? The investigation is over and a charge-sheet has been filed in the case. She is entitled to default bail. Even those accused of murder are out on bail. This is shameful. There should be reasonableness. Now, this raises serious questions. 
During the course of the hearing, senior counsel Veera Kathiravan said the call records of the accused were examined only after March 15, 2018, which was when the leaked audio tape first surfaced, and records prior to March 15 or the contacts were not examined at all. 
Taking the submissions into account, the court said an accused could not be kept in custody indefinitely It took cognisance of the fact that the other two accused in the case V. Murugan and S. Karuppasamy were out on bail. The court ordered a stay in the case and adjourned it for further hearing.
The court was hearing a PIL petition filed by P. Suganthi, general secretary, All India Democratic Womens Association (AIDWA). She had sought a direction to transfer the investigation from the CB-CID to the CBI. 
 The petitioner said the case involved a crime that was not ordinary in nature. 
A shocking reality was that human trafficking continued to generate business throughout the world despite numerous laws and conditions. The merchandise for this lucrative trade were women and children. Finding and punishing the tail of the network will not uproot this social evil. Unless the heads were caught, prosecuted and punished, the evils cannot be stopped, she said. 
The case had sent shock waves across the State. It was alleged that Ms. Devi tried to lure girl students of the Devanga Arts College into offering sexual favours in return for academic gain.","Questions why she’s still in prison, says she’s entitled to bail",2019-02-27T18:52:42Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",High Court stays proceedings against Nirmala Devi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-stays-proceedings-against-nirmala-devi/article26391552.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sj9x8r/article26391551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28NIRMALADEVI,the-hindu,The Hindu,uproot,1
Eshe Nelson,"In just three weeks, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, to which it has belonged for the past 46 years. At this late hour, no one knows what exactly will happen.
A series of votes in Parliament next week could provide clarity or, as has been the case since the 2016 Brexit referendum, convolution. The votes on the terms and timing of Britains exit could still lead to a number of scenarios. Among them: a softer version of Brexit with closer ties to the EU, a second referendum, a general election, and the dreaded no-deal Brexit in which the UK crashes out of the bloc with no transitional arrangements in place. The first vote on Tuesday is for prime minister Theresa Mays deal, which has already been rejected once. If it is rejected again, no one knows what will happen, May said Friday.
Whatever does happen, damage has already been done (membership). Many companies have decided they cant live with so much uncertainty, and have quit the UK to varying degrees. Bank of America is spending $400 million to transfer its European headquarters to Dublin. EasyJet, the UKs largest airline, has had to transfer its ownership to non-British Europeans. Smaller companies without deep pockets for legal adviceand staff devoted to Brexit contingency planningare more or less stuck. They are either running their businesses as usual and hoping for the best, or devoting time and money to stockpiling and other actions with the worst-case scenario in mind. Regardless, the votes impact on the economy hurts everyone. Even amid a global slowdown, the UK economy stands out for its sluggishness. Investment has plummeted since the referendum, and many European migrants who are key workers for low-wage sectors have already stopped coming.
Even if Brexit is softened, delayed, or canceled, the reputational damage the UK has inflicted upon itself wont be easily repaired. Businesses wont completely reverse their decisions to open offices abroad, uproot staff, or redirect investments away from Britain. The UK will be poorer for deciding to leave the EU, no matter how, when, or even whether it eventually quits the bloc.

IANS,"By: IANS | New Delhi | Published: December 4, 2017 4:05 pm Former finance minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram (Express Photo by Amit Mehra/Files) Former Finance Minister and Congress leader P.

"USA TODAY, Alia E. Dastagir, USA TODAY","The incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks where two black men were arrested while waiting for a white friend is novel in its coverage, but African Americans say this type of treatment isn't new. USA TODAY Rashon Nelson, left, and Donte Robinson, both 23, settled with the city of Philadelphia for a symbolic $1 each and a promise from city officials to set up a $200,000 program for young entrepreneurs. (Photo: Jacqueline Larma, AP) On Tuesday, Starbucks will close more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. to conduct employee training ""to address implicit bias"" and ""prevent discrimination"" after two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia store in April. Starbucks is not the first company to try to train away implicit bias, a term used to describe unconscious prejudice. From multinational corporations to police departments, organizations have tried to tackle the problem by hiring consultants to lead diversity or unconscious bias training. But the science behind the approach is debated. A 2016 meta-analysis of 494 studies on the topic found little evidence that reducing implicit bias affects behavior. White people are bad at admitting implicit bias and therefore good at denying the realities of racism, says Robin DiAngelo, who conducts workshops on race, including implicit bias, and recently provided Starbucks with feedback on training support and follow-up. ""I don’t believe it’s humanely possible to be free of bias,"" DiAngelo said. But she does believe we can work on it. Eight in 10 blacks say racism is a big problem in American society, and about half of whites say the same, according to the Pew Research Center. However, 55% of whites believe whites are discriminated against in America today, according to a poll from Harvard, NPR and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Addressing racism makes many white people feel anger, fear and guilt, which leads to denial, minimization and defensiveness, DiAngelo says, even though racism inevitably touches everyone. ""No one, no one can escape the messages of white superiority,"" she said, adding that the reflex to shut down conversations about racism helps keep it alive. USA TODAY spoke with DiAngelo about racism and her forthcoming book White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism : (Questions were edited for clarity, answers were edited for length.) Robin DiAngelo's book explores the roots of white defensiveness. (Photo: Beacon Press) You say the mainstream definition of racism is problematic. Why? ""[The mainstream definition of] a racist is always an individual who consciously (must be conscious) does not like people based on race, and intentionally (must be intentional) seeks to hurt them. As long as that is our definition of a racist, virtually every white person is exempt from the system we are in. I think that reductive definition is the root of virtually all white defensiveness on this topic, because if I think that’s what a racist is, and you suggest that anything I’ve said or done is racist, you’ve just put me in the category of immoral person. And now I’m going to have to defend my moral character."" How should we define racism? ""A group’s collective bias backed by legal authority and institutional control."" Is everyone racist? ""While everyone has racial bias, I reserve the word 'racist' to describe the bias that white people have — our collective bias is backed by institutional power."" 'White privilege' has become a commonly used term, but what about white people who've suffered hardships? ""It’s not that white people don’t face barriers. What I’m saying is you have not faced this one [racism]. And not facing this one has helped you navigate your other ones."" ""This was a struggle with my students [who said], 'Well, I’m queer. I’m Jewish. I have a disability. I’m not privileged.'... I think [they need to hear it] from somebody who shared their identity.... I have moved people forward who were raised poor or working class and could not own racial privilege by sharing how I came to understand mine. … I did it by sharing my own experience as someone who grew up in poverty. While I have struggled with a deep sense of class shame and the message that I was 'less than,' I still always knew that I was white and that made me 'better than' poor people of color. In fact, being white has helped me escape poverty. No one looks at me and assumes I don’t belong in academia, but my colleagues of color can’t say the same."" You say white progressives 'cause the most daily damage to people of color.' Why? ""White progressives create the daily climate that people of color must function within. We are the co-workers and friends who people of color so often cannot share their perspectives and experiences with, or talk to us about our problematic racial assumptions and patterns, because we are so confident that we don't have any problematic racial assumptions and patterns. We are the ones most likely to be in people of color's lives in some way, and yet most white progressives, despite our confidence that we are free of racism, do not understand how race shapes our own lives.... That obliviousness and ignorance is not benign or innocent, and when coupled with complacency, certitude and arrogance — 'I already know all this!' — creates a rather miserable daily experience for people of color."" How does a white person being defensive affect a person of color? ""I often ask people of color in my workshops the simple question: How often have you tried to give white people feedback on our inevitable and often unaware racism and have that go well for you? They laugh. They roll their eyes. Never. Rarely. We’re so difficult about this. And that, of course, functions beautifully to kind of police people of color into not giving us feedback, because they risk even more punishment with our defensiveness, our hurt feelings, our minimization, our explaining away. It’s like this loop that keeps everyone in their place, but of course, ultimately who does that benefit? Trust me, people of color bring home way more racism every single day than they bother talking to us about."" What do you think of the statement Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson released after the incident saying 'our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested'? ""Who does it serve to focus on intent rather than impact? That always serves the transgressor. And while it’s nice to know that the intentions were not to harm, it’s fairly irrelevant to the outcome. When we focus on our intentions we’re inadvertently saying... that I should be absolved of the impact because I didn’t mean to have that impact.... We live in a culture that promotes this idea that it’s all about intentions. I don’t know that you could have come up with a more effective way to protect racism."" After the Civil Rights Movement, you say people began to equate racism with 'bad people.' How does that play out now? ""The default of our society is the reproduction of racial inequality. I mean, that’s what it does, that’s what it’s been doing for hundreds of years.... By every measure, people of color and black and indigenous people, in particular, are at the bottom.... And all this system really requires to keep on keeping on is for white people to just be really nice. You know? Just be really nice, smile at your co-workers of color, go to lunch on occasion and do nothing else. And I’m not saying don’t be nice, but niceness is not courageous, it’s not strategic, it will not get racism on the table [to address it] and it won’t keep it on the table when everyone wants it off."" Where do we go from here? ""Nobody really knows what it would look like to have a society free of domination and bias.... I think the goal is to try to identify your biases, try to uproot them, challenge them, get new information, build relationships with people you’ve been socialized to see as not valuable to be in relationships with. These are not small tasks and our efforts need to be lifelong and ongoing.""

IANS,"NEW DELHI: In the face of BSP chief Mayawati ruling out an alliance with Congress for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan assembly polls, the Congress on Wednesday appeared hopeful of an understanding with her party saying ""creases can be ironed out"". Refusing to read much into Mayawati's allegations against the Congress, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the BSP supremo has expressed her confidence in Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, which was most important. ""Mayawati has expressed respect and confidence vis-a-vis Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi and that is the most important issue rather than looking for multiple meanings in her statements. ""At times, out of emotions, sweet and bitter things are said. Once the two leaders have an amicable, respectable and fruitful relationship with each other, all other creases can be ironed out. I don't think that alliances are discussed or announced in press conferences,"" Surrjewala told the media after Mayawati declared she was not aligning with the Congress for Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh polls. Asserting that the Congress' sole aim was to uproot the BJP from power in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, Surjewala said the party's alliance committee formed by Rahul Gandhi will decide and deliberate on stitching up alliances or understanding with state-specific parties. ""Our only aim is to free Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh from the misrule of BJP. In this journey, whoever is willing to walk with us is welcome and those who don't want, are free to tread their own path,"" he added.","Creases can be ironed out says Cong after Maya snubRefusing to read much into Mayawati's allegations against the Congress, party spokesperson said the BSP supremo has expressed her confidence in Rahul Gandhi, which was most important.",2018-10-03T13:59:14Z,"{'id': 'the-times-of-india', 'name': 'The Times of India'}",Creases can be ironed out says Cong after Maya snub,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/creases-can-be-ironed-out-says-congress-after-maya-snub/articleshow/66057289.cms,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-66057342,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-536424,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",the-times-of-india,The Times of India,uproot,1
PTI,"The Rashtriya Janata Dal has decided not to put up any candidate in the Gujarat Assembly elections next month and extend its support to the Congress, party chief Lalu Prasad said here today. Prasad appealed to minorities, backwards, Dalits, farmers and labourers, and Yadavs of Gujarat to vote against the BJP to ensure its defeat. ""The RJD will support the Congress party. We will not put up our own candidates in the Gujarat elections,"" Prasad told reporters here after the party's national executive meeting. Prasad said Patidar leader Hardik Patel has invited him to visit Gujarat and he would oblige him if he gets time. The RJD chief said the JD(U), headed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, is putting up candidates in the Gujarat Assembly elections. ""I don't know what Sharad Yadav would do. It has no meaning at the moment,"" Prasad told reporters here. The Election Commission on Friday recognised the group led by Kumar as the Janata Dal (United), rejecting the claim of the Sharad Yadav faction over the party's name and election symbol. Earlier, addressing the members of the national executive, Prasad said Kumar is putting up candidates to split 'Patel votes' in the Gujarat elections. Prasad said the RJD would hold a 'Parivartan Rally' three months before the Lok Sabha ""to uproot the BJP"". The BJP-led government's Union ministers have only one point agenda to criticise him, he said. He said not a single MP of the NDA, who had won from Bihar, would return to the Lok Sabha next time.

Uma Sharma and Abby Tang,"Going to the snowy mountains is not all fun. Amidst it all lies avalanches so strong they can uproot anything that blocks their path. But here are some ways you can survive the deadly grip of an avalanche. Following is a transcript of the video. An average of 27 people in the US die every year from avalanches. The saddest part is that the victims are actually the ones triggering the avalanches in the first place. Avalanches are one of the most powerful forces of nature humans ever come across. In seconds, they can sweep trains off their tracks, uproot trees, and collapse entire buildings. They can also bury unsuspecting backcountry travelers under feet of snow. But there are some tricks you can learn to make sure that slope won't be your last. The number one way to avoid getting caught in an avalanche? It's pretty obvious steer clear of places where avalanches happen, namely snow-capped mountains with steep slopes. Specifically, slopes between 30-45 degrees. But if you insist on climbing Everest or skiing in Aspen, then your first rule of thumb should always be to check the daily avalanche forecast. Most avalanches happen right after a heavy snowstorm especially a windy one. Winds can pack the snow in more tightly, creating a strong, dense layer of snow on top. But you can't predict an avalanche by this layer, alone. The real threat is what lies underneath. If the underlying layer of snow is weaker than the top, all it takes is the right amount of pressure and WHUMPF! That's the first thing you'll hear. It's the weak layer collapsing under your added weight, like a house of cards. You may even see cracks form in the slab of snow around you. If you can, try to get off the slab, since that's what will be tumbling downhill in a few milliseconds. But if you're unable to escape, try grabbing on to a nearby tree. No trees? Then you're going to go for a ride. But don't lose hope! Immediately cover your mouth to prevent snow from getting into it and hope you don't crash into anything. Being in avalanche is like being caught in a violent ocean wave. Over 70% of deaths occur because the person can't breathe. That's why it's imperative that you try to keep your head above the swelling cloud of snow around you. This moment, right here, could make the difference between life and death. Don't worry too much about form. Thrashing, kicking, breaststroke whatever keeps you near the surface. And contrary to popular belief, if you're wearing a backpack, hold on to it! The second-highest risk of death is trauma from hitting a tree, boulder, or another stationary object at a high speed. Keep your backpack on, and you have an extra cushion behind you for protection. After the snow settles, there's not much you can do but wait for rescue. This isn't like the snow you're used to once it stops, the consistency will feel like cement. It's nearly impossible to dig out of. Your biggest concern now is breathing which will not be easy, and could even backfire on you. While snow is often porous, your warm breath can temporarily melt the snow that's in front of your face. And under the cold conditions, that water will likely re-freeze into ice, which is not good. What you're left with is a layer of ice that basically seals you in with the CO2 you're exhaling. You might as well tape a plastic bag over your head. To avoid suffocating, try to punch your hand to the surface. This offers a clear signal to rescuers and if you can wiggle it around creates an air shaft for you to breathe. Statistics show that you have the best chance of survival if you're rescued within about 15 minutes. After 20 minutes, your chances drop to about 30%. Thanks to advanced technology, there are ways you can drastically improve your odds. Attach an avalanche beacon to yourself before you even go into the backcountry. Rescuers can use it to track you down.Also consider wearing an airbag pack, which can keep you buoyant in an avalanche. Even with these tools, safety isn't guaranteed. So, be smart about when and where you choose to climb.",Going to the snowy mountains is not all fun. Amidst it all lies avalanches so strong they can uproot anything that blocks their path.

Today numbering some 250 families, Vietnam began like many barrios in Puerto Rico. Labourers lured from the countryside during the islands postwar industrial boom established a squatters settlement. The harbour was a bustling site of factories, military bases and jobs, but nobody had supplied housing for workers. So the workers did it themselves.
They cleared a swath of mosquito-infested mangroves and cobbled together what were at first rickety shacks that sank time and again in the mud and rain. When the shacks didnt collapse on their own, the police would come and tear the houses down, hoping to force residents out. The pattern continued even as the houses became cinder block and concrete and the settlement grew into a neighbourhood.

By the 1970s, the quagmire of conflict gave rise to the name Vietnam.
For residents, it became a badge of honour.
Now, as the federal government prepares to spend an unprecedented $15bn (£11.5bn) to repair neighbourhoods across Puerto Rico that were ravaged by the Category 4 storm, the goal of finally replacing Vietnams besieged warren of cinder block houses with a flourishing community capable of weathering the hurricanes of the future seems at once more urgent and less likely than ever.
The reasons have to do with basic concepts such as home and safety  things that might seem straightforward, but are not so easily defined here.
Much of the islands population lives in areas, like this one, that are vulnerable to floods and landslides. Thanks to the historical patchwork of homes built and exchanged informally across generations, nearly half of all residents, according to studies, lack the clear titles to their properties that would allow them to take out housing reconstruction loans, sell their properties legally and move to safer neighbourhoods.
With crippling debt and a poverty rate that is double Mississippis, Puerto Rico has tried to resolve these problems on its own for years, without success.
The billions set to be spent by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development in the coming months for an island where more than 90,000 homes were destroyed represents the largest such grant in the history of federal disaster relief efforts. Hoping to make the most of it, Puerto Ricos governor has come up with the outlines of a proposal for new development across the 110-mile-long island.
The proposal promises nobody will be forced to move. But there is a catch. Because of federal regulations, those living in flood-prone areas wont be given any public money unless their homes comply with flood-protection standards.
Complying with regulations that require elevating houses, employing licensed contractors, providing wheelchair access and using only certain materials can be just too costly for many Puerto Ricans  more costly than the value of their homes. This means hundreds of thousands living in barrios like Vietnam will not get assistance.
As an alternative, they will be offered titles to free new apartments elsewhere.
If they are available. The plan is vague. It wagers that, provided with enough incentives, for-profit developers will build the necessary housing and infrastructure, bringing crucial jobs with them.
But thats a gamble. During the last century, Puerto Rico has produced landmark social housing projects such as El Falansterio in San Juan, an art deco-detailed waterfront complex from the 1930s that, all these years later, remains a thriving community and a model of elegant, humane design.

Unfortunately, anyone who knows about rising construction costs, the islands crippled bureaucracy and its legacy of failed projects, and the federal governments looming deadlines for spending reconstruction money also knows that the only things that may actually end up getting built are sprawling, quasi-suburban projects on cheap, shovel-ready agricultural land, uncoordinated with services and transit.
And also a bunch of luxury hotels and condo towers on the coast.
The system favours cheap and quick solutions, says Federico del Monte, president of the Puerto Rican Planning Society.
Omar Marrero, who runs Puerto Ricos Central Office of Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency, demurs while acknowledging the problems. We will try to keep communities intact, he says. But to the extent the legal requirements dont allow us to use federal dollars, families will have to decide whether they want to remain where they are.
Carmen Chévere Ortiz has decided already. She became accustomed over the years to floods in Villa Calma, an informal working-class community near the northern coast of the island that lies below sea level.
But Maria was different, she says. The area was swamped in minutes by what seemed to her like a tidal wave that suddenly swept away houses and cars. We lost everything, she adds. Now I just want to get out of here as fast as possible.
On the other hand, many islanders in similar predicaments, like Torres, dont want to leave, free apartment or not.
Thats because security  or what is also called resilience in the context of climate change and natural disasters  entails more than just high ground and a sturdy roof. In struggling places where people, feeling they cannot rely on the authorities, count on each other, safety comes down to community.
It is why many residents of the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans, where dozens drowned during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, fought tooth and nail to stay put, notwithstanding that the neighbourhood is a giant bathtub. Or why Indonesians in shanties crowding sewage-filled canals went to court in Jakarta to sue the authorities for moving them into new apartment towers miles away.
Dead is the only way they will ever get me to leave. Maybe not even then
Ricardo Álvarez-Díaz
People usually opt to preserve their communities and ties to the land, even if it means living in harms way, points out Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at NYU whose speciality is social resilience. They have seen enough projects go wrong to suspect that theyre better off risking the next big storm and staying home, where at least they have friends and family nearby.
Carmen Ayendez, who lived in Vietnam much of her life, says her father four years ago took up the governments offer of a new home in Sunset Harbour, one of three housing projects built by the municipality of Guaynabo  Vietnam straddles Guaynabo, a mostly prosperous district outside San Juan, and the adjacent municipality of Cataño  with the purpose of relocating Vietnams residents.
When her father died two days after signing the new lease, Ayendez took over the house. But shortly after moving, she started waking in the night, unable to breathe.
It turned out the new house was plagued by mould. Ayendez has not been able to get rid of it. When Maria hit, her roof cracked. She was supposed to be safer in Sunset Harbour.
I preferred living in Vietnam, she says. I built my own house there on a piece of land that my dad gave me when I was 19. It was a wooden house. It had bats and worms, but not mould. I had my friends and neighbours. The roof wasnt very secure, but it was home.
To protect its residents from evictions and gentrification, San Juans largest barrio, on the banks of the Martín Peña canal, has been operating as a community land trust for some years. It ensures everyone in the barrio has rights, a stake and a say. The trust has negotiated voluntary relocations where the clogged, polluted and frequently overflowing canal needs to be dredged or widened and homes get in the way.
Evelyn Quiñones, 63, one of the communitys leaders, shows me the house she agreed to move to a few years ago, on a street just outside the barrio. The decision to leave wasnt easy, she says. It made all the difference that the choice to move was hers, the new house was in good shape  and that her relocation improved conditions for people inside the barrio.
I return to the old neighborhood every day, she says. The new house is bigger and I feel safe there. But these are not my people.
Through the generations, the community of Vietnam has similarly bonded over its common enemies, meager resources and views of the harbour, which have also ensured that moneyed interests continue scheming. During the early 2000s, the mayor of Guaynabo, in league with developers, started expropriating properties to make way for luxury villas.

Just because you dont have a title to your property and you are poor doesnt mean the government shouldnt work with you to improve your neighbourhood, says Carmen Yulín Cruz, San Juans mayor. She worries about the current approach.
So does Ricardo Álvarez-Díaz, former president of the Puerto Rico Builders Association. My fear is we will build houses for the sake of building houses where people dont want to live, he says. People dont just need houses. They need communities. The hurricane proved this.
It was the communities, not Fema, he adds, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that saved most people.
After Hurricane Maria, Torres replaced the zinc roof that blew off his home in Vietnam. A stack of bamboo washed ashore during the storm and he used it to fashion a chair, now perched on his patio, facing the harbour.
He says he would gladly accept money from the federal government to fortify his house. But, with or without it, hes content just to sit in his chair and watch the sun set over the harbour. He is not moving.
Dead is the only way they will ever get me to leave, he says. Maybe not even then.

S. Murali,"Cashew nut industry has been thriving in Vetapalem since the British times as colonial rulers from Madras Presidency took special care to promote it in Prakasam district, thanks to the abundance of raw material in the coastal Chirala mandal. The fabled Vetapalem edible nuts used to get pride of place in dryfruit stalls in different parts of the country. Those were the hay days when the processed nuts from here would be sent to Madras (now Chennai) for use by British officials and some portion of it used to be exported. It is no longer so as the cashew processing units are crumbling due to alleged ‘unimaginative’ EXIM policy. “We are losing to our counterparts in Vietnam, a new entrant in processing of the raw cashew nuts for re-export,” say propreitors of cashew manufacturing units in the sleepy village. “The locally available raw material is not even enough to meet 5% of the demand of the processing units here, and as a result, the industry is in its death throes,” laments Vetapalem Cashew Manufacturers’ Association President Atmakuru Sudhakar. “Shortage of skilled labour is also adding to our woes,” adds its Secretary G.Naganjaneyulu. In the Southeast Asian country, the entire process including shelling, drying and grading is mechanised unlike in Vetapalem, where shelling alone is done with machines. The raw nut processing cost had gone up by 75% but the product cost had not increased even by 30%. “That’s why many units are folding up,” explains a nut processing unit owner M.V.Sagar. Fluctuating prices As the seeds are not available locally, we are forced to import it from African countries and give commitments to food processing companies to supply cashew for the following year at a specific price. But they were not able to meet their commitments for various reasons, including fluctuating nut price in the international market. In some cases, the overseas sellers had even sent empty containers, they complain. They want the Union and State governments to come to their rescue by providing subsidy for mechanisation, allow duty free import from countries such as Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria and grow cashew plantations from Ichapuram to Tada under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Moisture stress Meanwhile, a group of farmers in nearby Kadavakuthuru village explain that cashew nut plantations required little to no maintenance in reaching the fruit-bearing stage and some of them survived for nearly 100 years. They were also now facing severe moisture stress in view of severe drought prevailing in the district for the fourth consecutive year. The plantations in over 1000 acres belonging to the Forest department are the only ones to survive as it leases out the plantations to tenant farmers who take special care to get maximum returns. “But the crop condition is not at all encouraging this year. We will not be able to realise even the lease rent this year,” says a tenant farmer Ganta Venkatesh. The real estate boom also had forced a section of the farmers to uproot the trees, adds another farmer G.Ram Babu.",Processing units’ owners seek government intervention in subsidising mechanisation,2018-04-25T18:26:10Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Vetapalem cashew units crumbling,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vetapalem-cashew-units-crumbling/article23674783.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/article23674782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26VJOGCASHEW,the-hindu,The Hindu,uproot,1
RT,"Walmart employees in the city of Chico made the rounds of the fire refugees' tent city Tuesday night, putting up signs to let the campers know they are no longer welcome. Hundreds of survivors pitched tents in an informal encampment next to the Walmart in the aftermath of the fire, waiting for news of missing relatives or the lifting of evacuation orders that would allow them to return to homes that may no longer exist. Leaving the Camp Fire victims out in the cold for Thanksgiving seems heartless, but Walmart spokesperson Delia Garcia said the company has donated over $500,000 to "" relief organizations,"" adding that the campers were being asked to leave "" for their own good."" Garcia pointed to rain in the forecast as a cause for "" increased urgency,"" perhaps forgetting that the Wallywood residents have just escaped the most severe weather event in California's history. An added wrinkle in the resettlement plans is the outbreak of norovirus that has infected dozens of people in at least three of the officially-sanctioned shelters. Of about fifty families who remain in Wallywood, many expressed fear of getting sick as their reason for staying. "" I'd rather breathe the smoke,"" evacuee Carol Whiteburn told CBS. Others clung to the only familiar place they knew. "" We're not leaving because this is the area that we know everything,"" explained Jim Sampson, whose friend's home north of Paradise was destroyed in the fire. Walmart convinced Butte County officials and the Red Cross to help them evict the encampment, and the county has already removed toilet facilities and donation bins that were set up for the displaced families' benefit. Red Cross volunteers offered campers rides and gas cards as enticements to get them to official shelters, some of which are more than 30 miles from Wallywood, an impossible distance for those displaced residents without access to reliable transportation. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster recovery center is due to open in a former Sears store on Friday, and there are still no temporary housing options for second-time-displaced Wallywood residents, though some have reportedly received rental housing vouchers. Over 50,000 people were evacuated ahead of the Camp Fire, but only 1,000 of those are currently in sanctioned shelters. Housing was already scarce in Butte County before the fire, with a vacancy rate below 2 percent, and county officials say there is only room to place 800 to 1,000 families in existing housing stock. The town of Paradise was all but leveled in the Camp Fire, which began in the town of Pulga on November 8th and spread over 152,000 acres over the course of the last two weeks, destroying more than 13,000 homes. Touring the damage last week, FEMA administrator Brock Long admitted he wouldn't blame Paradise residents if they chose not to attempt to rebuild their town. As of Wednesday, the fire had claimed 83 lives, though the Butte County sheriff’s office was able to revise its missing persons list down to 563. Wallywood has not been without problems, attracting scavengers and long-time homeless, who the fire victims have pushed toward the road in a "" neighborhood "" they call "" Skid Row.""","California wildfire victims who lost everything in the blaze are being forced to uproot themselves yet again as Walmart begins dismantling the informal ""Wallywood"" encampment that sprung up in its parking lot.

Reuters Editorial,"SOFIA (Reuters) - The Bulgarian government on Thursday survived a parliamentary vote of no-confidence brought by the opposition Socialists over what they said was a lack of progress in fighting rampant corruption. Some 103 deputies in the 240-seat parliament voted in favor of the first no-confidence vote against the center-right coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, while 131 deputies opposed it. The vote was overcome easily as the Borissov’s ruling GERB party holds a majority, albeit it fragile, in the chamber with its nationalist partners and also enjoys the support of a small populist party. Bulgaria, currently holding the European Union’s rotating presidency, ranks as the bloc’s most corrupt member state according to Transparency International’s 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index. The Socialists accused the government of doing close to nothing since taking office last May to bring high level corrupt officials behind bars and for passing anti-graft legislation which they believe would not yield the needed results. The European Commission has repeatedly rebuked Bulgaria, an ex-communist nation of 7.1 million, for failing to uproot graft and for being too slow to overhaul its judiciary. Corruption has reduced much needed foreign investment in the country and is among the main reasons for some fellow European Union countries to oppose Bulgaria’s entry into the Schengen zone of passport-free travel and to the euro zone. The government says new legislation will give the tools the country needs to crack down on graft. Speaking to EU deputies last week, Borissov pledged to deliver tangible results in the fight against corruption in two to three years. Analysts say Borissov’s government is likely to withstand pressures in the near term but it would face difficult months ahead in trying to balance the interests within the ruling coalition and pressures coming from environmental protests.

Reuters Editorial,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahraini authorities have arrested four members of cell behind a bomb attack on an oil pipeline, the interior ministry said on Wednesday, adding two of the group had been trained in Iran, an adversary of the Gulf Arab state. Iran denies any role in Bahrain’s unrest. The explosion on November 10 caused a fire at Bahrain’s main pipeline near Buri village, 15 km (10 miles) from the capital Manama, forcing the evacuation of residents. A ministry statement said authorities had arrested four people, two of whom had received intensive training in Iran to carry out attacks to harm Bahrain’s economy and its oil pipeline. “Immediately after their return from Iran, they planned and got ready to blast the oil pipeline...in addition to committing a series of other terrorist acts. They checked out the location and remotely bombed the pipeline,” the ministry said. Authorities were searching for three others “involved in the financing, planning, and implementation” behind the attack, the statement said, two of which live in Iran. A key Western ally and host to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, Sunni Muslim-ruled Bahrain has for years grappled with protests mainly by members of its Shi‘ite Muslim majority who demand a bigger share in running the kingdom. Several Bahraini dissidents reside in Iran, calling for armed struggle to uproot Bahrain’s ruling Al Khalifa monarchy in a holy war. Iran has called accusations that it had any role in supporting violent acts in Bahrain “baseless and fabricated”, but it has allowed the exiled Bahrainis to promote their ideas on Iranian official media and hold mourning ceremonies for those involved in deadly attacks in the country.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Aerial footage shows spread of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano With its red-hot rivers of lava and clouds of ash, Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has captured the world's attention. But how dangerous are such eruptions? Every year about 60 volcanoes erupt. Some take us by surprise but others are regular offenders. Kilauea is one of the world's most active - its present eruption began 35 years ago, but there has been an increase in activity in recent weeks. Its lava flows have quite literally been erupting in people's backyards, but thankfully only one serious injury has been reported - a man hit by projectile molten rock as he sat on his balcony. This could appear to suggest that volcanoes aren't all that dangerous, but much of the world's population lives close to an active volcano - and many of these are much deadlier than Kilauea. Image copyright Getty Images Since the year 1500, about 280,000 people have been killed by volcanoes - 170,000 of those by just six eruptions. We have compiled these figures using media reports, public records and historical documents. About 2,000 people have been killed since the year 2000. Most of these deaths were caused by volcanic mudflows in the Philippines, pyroclastic flows in Indonesia, lava flows in the Democratic Republic of Congo and volcanic projectiles in Japan. Last year three tourists died in Italy when they fell into a pit in a volcanic crater. At present, about 800 million people live within 100 km of an active volcano - a distance well within reach of potentially lethal volcanic hazards. Of these, about 200 million are in Indonesia. As populations continue to grow, it is likely even more people will set up home close to one of the world's 1,500 active volcanoes, which are spread across 81 countries. ""Active"" does not mean that all of these volcanoes are erupting, but that we think they have been recently active and are capable of new eruptions. Image copyright Getty Images Volcanoes pose many different types of danger to those who live near them. In the case of Kilauea, the United States Geological Survey noticed a marked increase in seismic activity at the end of April, with the first fissures appearing at the start of May. Since then, lava flows have travelled about three miles (5km) to the ocean, destroying homes and leading to the evacuation of thousands of people. Such lava flows don't kill many people. While it burns and buries everything in its path, lava - molten rock that glows red-hot, with temperatures of about 1200C - moves slowly enough that people can normally just walk away. The danger arises when people fail to evacuate quickly. In Hawaii, several people were airlifted to safety after their escape routes were cut off. Lava can cause explosions, including the ignition of pockets of methane gas produced as it buries vegetation. And when it reaches the ocean it forms unstable new land and laze - plumes of steam, hydrochloric acid and glass shards. Another hazard in Hawaii is sulphur dioxide, one of several gases that can be released by volcanoes, even when they're not erupting. However, lava and gas combined account for less than 2% of recorded volcanic fatalities. The largest loss of life to volcanic gas was in Cameroon in 1986, when more than 1,500 people were killed as carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos flowed into surrounding villages. Most people killed by volcanoes are the victims of pyroclastic flows and lahars - volcanic mudflows, packed with debris - which have been responsible for about 120,000 deaths over the last 500 years. These are normally associated with large conical volcanoes found at tectonic boundaries, such as the ring of fire, unlike the gently sloping shield volcanoes, like Kilauea. Pyroclastic flows are very fast avalanches of rock, ash and gas, which can reach temperatures of 700C. They destroy everything in their path, and death is near certain for anyone caught in their way. It was pyroclastic flows that destroyed the Roman city of Pompeii in AD 79. And they claimed nearly 30,000 lives on the Caribbean island of Martinique in 1929. More stories like this : Lahars can contain rocks, trees and even houses. They form as rainfall, snow, or melting ice and wash ash deposits off the slopes of volcanoes and into surrounding valleys at high speeds. In 1985 about 25,000 people were killed by lahars at Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia. In large eruptions volcanic ash can travel hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. It can bury vast areas and disrupt transportation and critical services. Historically, famine and disease have followed such events, with crop failures, or ash and gas leading to temporary changes in the climate. Media caption The Kilauea volcano erupted after a series of earthquakes on the island. However, while unstoppable, volcanic eruptions do not need to result in death and disaster. That only one serious injury has been reported in Hawaii is testament to the work of observatory scientists and disaster management agencies, as well as excellent monitoring systems. Unfortunately, limited resources mean few volcanoes around the world are as well monitored as Kilauea. Satellite monitoring allows some observation of even the most remote volcanoes, but only about 20% of the world's volcanoes have any ground-based monitoring. And roughly every two years a volcano with no historical record erupts. These can be the most dangerous, as long periods of dormancy can end in more explosive eruptions and the people living near them can be the least prepared. Image copyright Getty Images Nevertheless, volcano observatories, researchers and international organisations work tirelessly to respond to emergencies and forecast events, with many tens of thousands of lives saved as a result. Of course, volcanoes don't need to kill people to have a significant impact. Evacuations uproot people from their homes, livelihoods are lost, agriculture devastated and economic loss can run into billions. Even when they appear to be sleeping, we'd be wise to keep watching the world's volcanoes.

Deepu Sebastian Edmond,"Even as Tamil Nadu wages a war on seemai karuvelam by attempting to banish the invasive tree species from the State, western Rajasthan has been trying to accept the reality that the mesquite is not going away anytime soon. To this end, the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) in Jodhpur has been running a project to use powdered Prosopis juliflora pods as a substitute for wheat bran in cattle feed mix. “The false impression of Prosopis juliflora till now has been that it is a horribly invasive and useless species in most parts of the world. This is perhaps due to the ignorance of its multiple uses,” says a 2013 paper authored by CAZRI scientists which calls the karuvelam a “miracle species.” The life of the karuvelam in Jodhpur — where it is called vilayati babul or baavlia — has been a tale of its fall from grace. After introducing the tree to the State by scattering its seeds from the air in 1913, the Maharaja of Jodhpur State declared karuvelam a Royal Plant in 1940. However, come 2006, the royal family itself had to uproot the tree from its backyard. “After trying several different methods without success, we employed Khandwaliya miners to use time-tested ways of manually chiselling into the hard, volcanic rock. We knew we had to go down at least 45 cm below ground-level to kill the baavlia,” says the website of the Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park, located next to the Mehrangarh Fort. Those at CAZRI also want to check the karuvelam’s spread. “By collecting the ripened pods for grinding, we are attempting to prevent the new trees from coming up,” said B.K. Mathur, Head of the Livestock Production System and Range Management at the CAZRI. His project, which ran from 2009-’14, tried to get residents of a village in Nagaur district and a tehsil in Barmer to collect and use karuvelam pods. “Animals find it difficult to chew and digest the pods, so using a grinder — even a traditional one made of stone suffices — was the solution,” said Mr. Mathur. Mr. Mathur’s study found that powdered karuvelam pods could constitute 20-30% of the cattle feed mix. “We studied the Tharparkar variety of cattle. It saved ₹137.50 per 50 kg for the farmer. Milk production increased 10-15% overall,” he said. The Principal Scientist said the popularity of his team’s innovation is on the rise — he was unable to give data on the number of sacks being used daily — but admitted that the project is yet to check the spread of the karuvelams. “There are too many pods; we cannot collect them all. A single tree produces about 30 kg a year,” he said. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has estimated that the karuvelam provided approximately 75% of the fuel wood requirements of the rural people in arid and semi-arid regions of India. It also said that India could produce up to 250% of its current annual production of fuel wood from forest resources if the country planted karuvelams in arid and semi-arid tracts. Despite contemporary infamy of the karuvelam, Mr. Mathur defended the actions of the Maharaja in 1913. “If he hadn’t introduced the tree, all the slow-growing indigenous varieties would have been cut down for fuel by now. It also helped control soil-shifting by keeping sand dunes in place,” he said.

Abdi Latif Dahir,"Perhaps nothing personifies the global refugee crisis more than the life jacket: a poignant symbol of floating to hope and a painful reminder of what’s been left behind. A startup in Minnesota is now capitalizing on that and is using the bright vests to make bracelets to help draw attention to the plight of refugees globally. Epimonia, which means persistence or perseverance in Greek, is retailing “embracelets” repurposed from vests collected on Lesbos in Greece by the non-profit Movement on the Ground. By marketing the wristband as its key product, the company wants people to “wear the difference” they make, and to keep the attention on the refugee issue beyond the first jolting news clips. “Building humanity—piece by piece” (Epimonia) Epimonia was launched in Dec. 2017 by Mohamed Maalim, himself a former Somali refugee who came to the United States when he was three years old. Maalim says he was always interested in fashion and immigrant issues and wanted to find a way to integrate both issues. Last year, he partnered with his uncle Omar Munie, a Dutch-Somali fashion designer to make the bracelets and bring them to the United States. “For many refugees, the life vests are the last thing they wear,” Maalim says. “It resembles perseverance against all these challenges and at the same time overcoming those challenges. It’s very meaningful.” Embracelets. (Epimonia) Globally, forced displacement is at its highest, with over 65 million people on the move, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The crisis is especially acute in Africa, home to the world’s largest migrant population. But as war and violence uproot more people and more people move for economic reasons, governments in Europe and the United States have built walls to keep them out, banned them from receiving visas or asylum, and increased deportations. Mohamed Maalim (right) donates $1,000 to an organization that offers immigration and refugee resettlement services (Epimonia) Yet more organizations and artists have responded, protesting how politicians are handling the refugee crisis. Many of them have also used the life jacket as an art installation : drawing refugees’ harrowing experiences on them, wearing them as performance art, placing them in front of legislative buildings, and in the case of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, draping them in the columns of a concert hall in Berlin. Maalim hopes the embracelets will change the narrative about refugees in the US and will spark not just a conversation but meaningful change. At least 50% of their proceeds will also be donated to non-profits and resettlement agencies in Minnesota to help immigrant communities with English classes and citizenship applications. “In this world, we need more empathy.” Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.",Perhaps nothing personifies the global refugee crisis more than the life jacket: a poignant symbol of floating to hope and a painful reminder of what’s…,2018-05-19T14:14:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Qz.com'}",This startup is repurposing life jackets to raise awareness about refugee crisis,https://qz.com/1282638/epimonia-makes-refugee-life-vests-into-bracelets/,https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rtsof2l-1-e1526725203147.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1600,,Qz.com,uproot,1
coprysko@politico.com (Caitlin Oprysko),"Roberta Jacobson's career has spanned placements including deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Peru and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico and NAFTA issues. | Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images A former U.S. ambassador to Mexico on Thursday ripped the Trump administrations approach to dealing with asylum-seeking migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border, calling Trumps handling of the issue a failure and urging the administration to increase its investments in Central America. In an op-ed published by The New York Times, Roberta Jacobson wrote that instead of deploying U.S. troops to the southwest border, the White House should instead work with Mexico and Central American governments to expedite the asylum process and address more of the issues that cause migrants to uproot their lives to begin with. Story Continued Below Trying to stop immigrants as the Trump administration is doing unilaterally, at the border and with tear gas and troops is a sign of only one thing: failure, wrote Jacobson, an appointee of President Barack Obama who served as U.S. ambassador in Mexico City from 2016 until early this year. The former ambassador co-authored the op-ed with Dan Restrepo, a special assistant for Western Hemisphere affairs under Obama. Restrepo and Jacobson, who also served under Obama as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, called for radically increasing the United States capacity to adjudicate asylum claims, in the short term, citing a backlog in processing the claims as increasing tension in the region.

But they said in the long term, the Trump administration must re-adjust its policies in Central America, expanding its refugee programs in the so-called Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and leveraging the interest in solving the migrant crisis expressed by Mexicos incoming president. Trump has threatened to cut off assistance to countries in Central America who dont sufficiently work to block asylum-seeking migrants on their way to the U.S. and has largely shrunk away from international organizations seeking to address the issue of mass migration. But Jacobson and Restrepo argued that more investment in refugee and economic development programs is necessary to stem the exodus of desperate migrants from the region. While Jacobson's most high profile positions came during her tenure in the Obama administration, her career has spanned White Houses controlled by both parties with placements including deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Peru and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico and NAFTA issues. By not working to address the migrant crisis at the source, and instead wastefully deploying troops to string concertina wire as cameras roll, ignoring our historical role as a haven for the persecuted or manufacturing a crisis for political purposes, the Trump administration only serves to compound the issue at the border, the op-ed's co-authors wrote.
