Louise Matsakis,"Just before Valentines Day last week, Belgian security researcher Inti De Ceukelaire noticed something strange on Facebook. He found the social networks search function treated pictures of men and women in dramatically different ways. Searching for photos of my female friends returned a hodgepodge of images, whereas a similar search for photos of my male friends yielded no results. Worse, Facebook assumed male was simply a typo for the word female.
Tech blogs picked up on De Ceukelaires tweets and, after replicating the results, published stories with headlines like ""Facebook lets you search for pictures of your female friends, but not your male ones."" Even more damning were the autocomplete predictions Facebook offered: When many users typed photos of my female friends, the platform suggested phrases like in bikinis or at the beach.
The discovery was creepyespecially given Facebooks recent cascade of privacy scandals. But those search results are not the product of sexist engineers. Facebook search is governed in part by an algorithm, which favors the most popular queries over those made less often. Algorithms can be biased, and they can mirrorprejudices that already exist in society. In this case, it turns out people are significantly more interested in using Facebook to find pictures of women in bathing suits than they are in finding pictures of menand the algorithm reflects that.
Like with Google and other search engines, theres a difference between Facebook search predictions and search results. The fact that in bikinis is a suggestion when searching for photos of female friends doesnt mean Facebook is training its algorithm to catalog your swimsuit pictures. (Thats not to say Facebooks AI is incapable of processing imagesit is. The company says, for instance, that it automatically detects and removes around 96 percent of adult and nude content that violates its rules. Skimpy speedo photos dont get caught in that dragnet for a reason.) When I searched for photos of my female friends in bikinis, Facebook returned a strange array of images that did indeed feature only women, but none of them were wearing bathing suits.
Facebook Search predictions represent what people may be searching for on Facebook, but are not necessarily reflective of actual content on Facebook, a spokesperson said in a statement. We know that just because something doesnt violate our Community Standards doesnt necessarily mean people want to see it, so were constantly working to improve search to make sure predictions are relevant to people.
Predictions are generated based on a number of elements, including the overall popularity of the search term. That means theyre essentially a window into what other users look for on Facebook, which can be illuminating. When I searched for female friends, for instance, some of the predictions included who are single, with benefits, and over 50. A search for dating brought up suggestions such as for 40s 50s 60s and beyond, as well as singles near me. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks like older people may often use Facebook search to try to find dates. (The percentage of Americans over 65 who say they use Facebook has doubled since 2012, according to Pew Research Center.)
For the same reason, Facebooks search predictions also reflect major news events. When I searched for Oakland teachers Friday, the top prediction was strike, since nearly all of the California citys 2,300 educators began protesting Thursday.
Facebook search predictions are also uniquely personalized for each user, based on the pages you have liked, the groups you have joined, the current city you provided, your connections, location data, and the News Feed posts and search results youve engaged with in the past. Facebook search is therefore much more personalized than Google Searchfor good reason. This tailoring is the reason why when you begin typing a name like Jeff, Facebook likely predicts you want to search for someone you know, rather than say, Jeff Bezos.
Search results are similarly personalized based on your social connections and your activity on Facebook. Again, if you searched for Jeff, Facebook would likely return people youre already friends with and those with whom you have friends in common. This function is what allows users to easily find someone they recently met and add them on Facebook. But that doesnt mean the social networks algorithmically generated search results arent sometimes bizarre. The photos of my female friends search produced a smattering of seemingly random photos of women I know, some of which were uploaded years ago. Its not necessarily clear why I was shown some images rather than others.
And in De Ceukelaires case, a search for photos of my male friends returned nothing at all. When I tried it, the search didnt produce photos of my friends, like searching for female friends did. Instead, I was shown a random assortment of memes. I got what are presumably male dogs and two male-themed cartoons, including one cautioning men against peeing outdoors in the polar vortex, Melissa Locker wrote in Fast Company. A Facebook spokesperson said this experience is a bug were working on fixing.
The problem was neglected because (at least until it was highlighted in news stories) the search term photos of my male friends was very unpopular. With limited resources, Facebook has an incentive to ensure the most common searches produce relevant content, before optimizing the results for rarer ones. This is true of Google as well. Popular queries like How old is Jeff Bezos? readily generate accurate answers on Google, while more unusual searches may not produce what youre looking for at all.
Facebooks search tool wasnt designed to be sexist, but that doesnt mean its free from issues. The algorithm that governs it remains a black box, and its impossible for users to know precisely why a certain prediction or result may be generated. Last month, New York Times writer John Herrman wrote that Facebook's lack of transparency encourages paranoia in its users, who are often left guessing about why things happen the way they do on the platform. Facebook's bikini search snafu, and the uneasy response it generated, is just the latest example.

Rhett Allain,"There was an art accident recently. A man fell into a black hole—OK, not that kind of black hole, but an art exhibit consisting of an 8-foot-deep circular hole painted black. The idea was to represent the feeling of a super deep, even endless hole. I guess the guy didn't realize it was a hole and fell. But this leads to some great physics ideas to discuss about vision and the color black. Let me start with one of my favorite party questions. It goes like this. Suppose you are in a room with absolutely no light. No windows, no cracks in the door, and no tiny LED lights on those power supplies. No lights. You open your eyes—what do you see? What if you wait 10 or 30 minutes? What do you see then? Go ahead and think about your answer. It will probably be something like one of the following: You see some stuff, but it is all very dark and you can just make out shapes. At first you see nothing—everything is black. After some time, maybe 10 minutes, you can see some shapes and stuff. Just black. Nothing but black. Eternal darkness. Black with flashes of light every once and while. Now for the experiment. If you can, go get in a dark room. No, not your bedroom: If you turn off everything in your bedroom, there will still be some light sneaking in through the cracks in your window blinds. Even at night, the moon and the stars provide some light. We live in a world of lights—even in our darkest hours. If you want total darkness, you either need a special room (called a dark room) or a cave. OK, super deep in the ocean works well too but it's hard to get there. In that kind of total darkness, you just see the color black. Everything is black. There are not shapes, just black. Your brain might get bored with blackness and start showing you some lights or something, but they aren't there. This color black has to do with how the human eye sees. We don't shoot beams out of our eyes to actively detect things; the eye is a passive receiver. It only ""sees"" stuff when light enters the eye. If you want to see a nearby apple, you need a source of light (like an actual light), which travels from the source and reflects off the apple. Some of this reflected light enters your eye, and your brain determines that it is an apple. The light reflected off the apple's surroundings is different than the apple light, so that you can distinguish the objects. There is another option: We can see some stuff not because of reflected light but because of emitted light. An LED bulb, your smartphone screen, a firefly—all produce light such that you can see them without another source. But still, without light you see ""nothing"" and the color black is what our brains interpret as no light. So, no light going to your eyes means that thing looks to be the color black. It can still have a color—like an apple in a dark room. But with no light reflecting off it, it might as well be a black apple (or a pink apple). If you can't find yourself a truly dark room, there is a way you can create pure blackness at home. It's a box that looks black inside, but it's not. Here, take a look. It's a plain cardboard box. I covered it in black construction paper just for fun. When you look through the tube, it looks black inside. This is because essentially no light gets in there to reflect off stuff. Without reflecting light, nothing gets to your eye and you see black. When I open a small door on the top of the box, there is now some light to reflect off the back surface (where I put a picture of my head). So you can see that the inside of the box is not black, it just looks black. Which brings us back to the black hole art. How does that work? If you make a hole and use really black paint—maybe even Vantablack, the darkest man-made material, then you can't really ""see"" the hole. You would just see ""blackness."" For a human looking at this hole, they could easily mistake it for a flat black circle and not a hole. Actually, if the artist wanted to make a representation of an infinite hole, a super-black circle would be easier to make and give the same result (except for the falling human part).

Fitz Tepper,"Yesterday, we wrote that Coinbase customers were being charged multiple times for past transactions. While some speculated that the erroneous withdraws were down to a Coinbase engineering issue, Coinbase issued a statement saying it wasn’t liable for the duplicate charges. The blame, instead, rested with Visa for the way it handled a migration of merchant categories for cryptocurrencies, Coinbase said. While you can read my post yesterday for an in-depth description of what happened, the basic gist is that Visa refunded and recharged (under a different merchant category) a month of old transactions. Many users saw the recharge come through before the refund processed, making it look like they were double charged. Honestly, the issue was likely exacerbated by existing payment rails — it’s normal for refunds to take multiple days to show up on credit and debit statements. But here’s where it gets weird — this morning Visa issued a statement to some publications shifting the blame back to Coinbase, telling TNW that “Visa has not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting.” We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue.” But now it seems that the payment giant has revised its stance, and clarified that it wasn’t Coinbase’s fault. The following is a joint statement from Visa and Worldpay, which is Coinbase’s payment processor partner. While Coinbase initially distributed the statement on its own blog, we’ve also received the statement directly from Visa. Over the last two days, some customers who used a credit or debit card at Coinbase may have seen duplicate transactions posted to their cardholder accounts. This issue was not caused by Coinbase. Worldpay and Coinbase have been working with Visa and Visa issuing banks to ensure that the duplicate transactions have been reversed and appropriate credits have been posted to cardholder accounts. All reversal transactions have now been issued, and should appear on customers’ credit card and debit card accounts within the next few days. We believe the majority of these reversals have already posted to accounts. If you continue to have problems with your credit or debit card account after this reversal period, including issues relating to card fees or charges, we encourage you to contact your card issuing bank. We deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused customers. While the statement doesn’t give a ton of clarity on the issue, it seems to absolve Coinbase of any blame, which is a win for the startup considering it’s been trying to prove to the world that its engineering and customer service teams can stand up to the challenge of maintaining a reliable financial platform. The startup — is valued at $1.6 billion after raising $100 million last year — has endured some challenging periods as it continues to scale its service to accommodate its 10 million-plus registered customers. Issues over the past year have included muddling prices on Overstock.com, a flash crash, and a general struggle to keep up as cryptocurrencies boomed in 2017. In December, Coinbase launched an internal investigation into suggestions that company insiders profited from knowledge of impending support for Bitcoin Cash.

Devin Coldewey,"A fault in a Soyuz rocket booster has resulted in an aborted crew mission to the International Space Station, but fortunately no loss of life. The astronauts in the capsule, Nick Hague (US) and Alexey Ovchinin (Russia) successfully detached upon recognizing the fault and made a safe, if bumpy, landing nearly 250 miles east of the launch site in Kazakhstan. This high-profile failure could bolster demand for U.S.-built crewed spacecraft. The launch proceeded normally for the first minute and a half, but at that point, when the first and second stages were meant to detach, there was an unspecified fault, possibly a failure of the first stage and its fuel tanks to detach. The astronauts recognized this issue and immediately initiated the emergency escape system. Hague and Ovchinin in the capsule before the fault occurred. The Soyuz capsule detached from the rocket and began a “ballistic descent” (read: falling), arrested by a parachute before landing approximately 34 minutes after the fault. Right now that’s about as much detail on the actual event as has been released by Roscosmos and NASA. Press conferences have been mainly about being thankful that the crew is okay, assuring people that they’ll get to the bottom of this, and kicking the can down the road on everything else. Although it will likely take weeks before we know exactly what happened, the repercussions for this failure are immediate. The crew on the ISS will not be reinforced, and as there are only 3 up there right now with a single Soyuz capsule with which to return to Earth, there’s a chance they’ll have to leave the ISS empty for a short time. The current crew was scheduled to return in December but NASA has said that the Soyuz is safe to take until January 4, so there’s a bit of leeway. That’s not to say they can necessarily put together another launch before then, but if the residents there need to stay a bit longer to safely park the station, as it were, they have a bit of extra time to do so. The Soyuz booster and capsule have been an extremely reliable system for shuttling crew to and from the ISS, and no Soyuz fault has ever led to loss of life, although there have been a few issues recently with DOA satellites and of course the recent hole found in one just in August. This was perhaps the closest a Soyuz has come to a life-threatening failure, and as such any Soyuz-based launches will be grounded until further notice. To be clear, this was a failure with the Soyuz-FG rocket, which is slated for replacement, not with the capsule or newer rocket of the same name. SpaceX and Boeing have been competing to create and certify their own crew capsules, which were scheduled for testing some time next year but while the Soyuz issues may nominally increase the demand for these U.S.-built alternatives, the testing process can’t be rushed. That said, grounding the Soyuz (if only for crewed flights) and conducting a full-scale fault investigation is no small matter, and if we’re not flying astronauts up to the ISS in one of them, we’re not doing it at all. So there is at least an incentive to perform testing of the new crew capsules in a timely manner and keep to as short a timeframe as is reasonable. You can watch the launch as it played out here:","A fault in a Soyuz rocket booster has resulted in an aborted crew mission to the International Space Station, but fortunately no loss of life.

Mariella Moon,"""We are very sorry for the family's loss,"" the statement sent to ABC 7 News reporter Dan Noyes started. ""According to the family, Mr. Huang was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he told them it was not reliable in that exact location, yet he nonetheless engaged Autopilot at that location. The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so."" (Emphasis ours.) The family's lawyer believes that the company is doubling down on putting the blame on Huang in order to distract from their concerns about his vehicle's Autopilot. Mike Fong, one of their attorneys, told ABC 7 that the sensors in Huang's car misread the road's lane lines and that its braking system failed to detect a stationary object on its way. Those are presumably the reasons why, on several occasions, his car veered towards the barrier where he crashed. While it sounds like the family is gearing up to sue, Fong said he doesn't expect to file a lawsuit until after the National Transportation Safety Board is fully done with its investigation. As for the rest of Tesla's statement, it stresses that Autopilot requires drivers to have their hands on the wheel: ""The fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and there was none here. Tesla is extremely clear that Autopilot requires the driver to be alert and have hands on the wheel. This reminder is made every single time Autopilot is engaged. If the system detects that hands are not on, it provides visual and auditory alerts. This happened several times on Mr. Huang's drive that day. We empathize with Mr. Huang's family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road. NHTSA found that even the early version of Tesla Autopilot resulted in 40% fewer crashes and it has improved substantially since then. The reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive."" The Autopilot section on Tesla's website does state that ""every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active... and must be prepared to take action at any time."" However, it also features a video showing a person in the driver's seat with their hands on their lap instead of the wheel, as Twitter product manager Patrick Traughber points out: ""Tesla is extremely clear that Autopilot requires the driver to be alert and have hands on the wheel.""

Tesla eyed its braking system instead of its self-driving tech for the 2016 incident wherein a Model S collided with a truck. The NTSB, however, blamed both the drivers in the incident and Autopilot itself. It cited previous findings that Autopilot's ability to monitor drivers' actions was extremely limited. The agency asked automakers to do more to ensure drivers are paying attention, and according to Bloomberg, Tesla told the NTSB it had already incorporated features to make that happen.","When Tesla revealed that Autopilot was engaged during the March 23rd fatal Model X crash, it only said that the vehicle's ""logs show[ed] that no action was taken"" even though the driver had time to react.

David Murphy,"Battery issues are one of the more headache-inducing problems you’ll ever deal with as an iPhone owner. Whether it’s Apple’s alleged planned obsolescence or just the simple physics of your iPhone’s battery— it won’t last forever —there will come a time when you can’t make it through the day on a single charge. But consider this: it might be an app’s fault instead. The “Battery Usage” feature in iOS isn’t anything new, but there’s a chance you’ve forgotten about it—resigned, as you are, to keeping your smartphone plugged more than ever before. If you’ve found that your iPhone doesn’t hold much of a charge anymore, you’ll first want to investigate the issue by tapping on your device’s Settings app, and then “Battery.” The Battery screen can clue you in to any errant apps that might be responsible for your battery issues. Just scroll down a bit and make a note of any apps that are using a significant chunk of your device’s battery, especially if you haven’t been using them much (or at all). As one Redditor recently desecribed, this screen helped them discover that a third-party Minesweeper app (of all things) was responsible for their device’s inability to hold as much of a charge as before. As they wrote in their post, “Was wondering why my phone dies so fast. Turns out the Minesweeper widget I use MAYBE once a month is using 46%. Needless to say I uninstalled it.” While you’re in that Battery screen, don’t forget to tap on “Battery Health (Beta)” if you’re running iOS 11.3 or later. Your iPhone will show you the maximum charge it can hold (compared to when it was brand new), and it will also warn you if the device is struggling to deliver power at any point. If you see a problem with either measurement, it might be time for an ( expensive ) trip to the Apple store for a replacement if you’re out of warranty. And if you want a fancier solution that shows you a bit more information about your battery than what Apple is willing to share—including your cycle count and charge capacity in mAh—check out Coconut Battery. Install the app to your Mac, connect your iPhone, and take a peek. (Don’t forget to save your analysis so you can compare it against future battery scans to see how well your battery has aged.)",Battery issues are one of the more headache-inducing problems you’ll ever deal with as an iPhone owner.

Dell Cameron,"Adriel Desautels was suddenly in a serious mess, and it was entirely his fault. Sitting in his college dorm room back in the mid-1990s, Desautels let his curiosity run rampant. He had a hunch that his school’s network was woefully insecure, so he took it upon himself to test it and find out. “My thoughts at the time were, ‘Hey, it’s university. I’m here to learn. How much harm can there really be in doing it?” Desautels says in a recent phone call, the hint of a tremor in his voice. It wasn’t long before he found himself in a dull faculty conference room, university officials hammering him with questions as a pair of ominous-looking men—Desautels says he still doesn’t know who they were, but it’s hard not to assume they had badges in their pockets—stood quietly listening on the sidelines. Penetrating the school’s network proved simple, he says, and thanks to Desautels’ affable arrogance, talking his way out of trouble was easier still. Forensically speaking, he argued to the school officials, there was no way to prove he did it. It could’ve just as easily been another student, at another computer, in a dorm room that wasn’t his. And he was right; they couldn’t prove shit, Desautels recalls. One of the mystery men smiled knowingly. The school ultimately dropped the case, and in what has become a tech-entrepreneur cliché, Desautels soon dropped out as well. He was making far too much money as a legitimate hacker-for-hire and decided to start his own company instead. Since the late ‘90s, he has been the CEO of his own security firm, some of which have come and gone. Since 2006, he’s been the head of Netragard, a penetration testing company that simulates what it calls “realistic threats.” Stamped on the company’s business cards, it reads: “We protect you from people like us.” Desautels has the nerdy look of any other computer security guy you might run into anywhere. But his textbook look hides a fierce contrarian in a security industry he believes is building its riches on the false promise that it can keep people safe. Where many see industry standard practices, he sees a long con. In his eyes, the marketing around most commercially available security tools are “snake oil.” Inflated egos, shoddy work ethics, and unachievable promises leave corporations and the wealth of confidential data they hold at risk. That includes, of course, the personal and private information of the world’s consumers, increasingly exposed by major security incidents—only a small percentage of which we ever hear about. Testing a Bulletproof Vest With a Squirt Gun When not restrained by their clients, who occasionally place annoying limits on how hard they can go to test a company’s security, Netragard’s team of about 35 hackers do everything they can to be unstoppable. The company shuns the use of commercial vulnerability scanners—the kinds of tools most companies rely on to test their security—and opt instead for aggressive penetration tests, both remotely and on site. The team crafts specialized tools to suit their needs on the fly, including zero-day malware developed in-house. Its social engineers manipulate employees by phone, email, and in person, capturing credentials and other information needed to breach networks. They forge documents, hack security keypads, and clone work badges that open doors concealing tightly controlled servers. If all else fails, they can always just bribe someone at the door. On one occasion, for instance, a Netragard engineer slipped an office maid $50 to get inside a building. He just needed to use the bathroom, he told her. But within minutes, he was leaping over a wall outside lugging a computer server under his arm. Of course, it doesn’t always go that easily. “There’s a major difference between the type of security tests companies are willing to pay for and what actual hackers are willing to do to get paid.” “During one on-site test, our engineer managed to break into an office, but we didn’t know the CEO had his own private security,” Desautels tells me, laughing. “They rushed in with guns and started sweeping the office. Then they hog-tie our guy and start dragging him out of there while he’s screaming, ‘I’ve got a get-out-of-jail-free card!’” During another engagement at a major bank, the name of which Desautels could not disclose, Netragard applied its dynamic testing methods and managed within minutes to seize control of the bank’s systems. The bank’s executives, having already had the networks scanned multiple times by other firms, was in complete shock. Time and again, those scans had overlooked a simple remote desktop protocol protected only by the username and password: “admin,” “admin.” The bank had sunk thousands of dollars into its security. Yet, a couple hackers were able to compromise its entire domain in roughly the time it takes to brew a pot of coffee. “People need to understand,” Desautels says, “there’s a major difference between the type of security tests companies are willing to pay for and what actual hackers are willing to do to get paid.” The bank’s people thought they had done their due diligence before Netragard’s team stepped in—gotten all of that “security stuff” taken care of. They could even produce paperwork saying the bank’s systems were secure, that its customers were safe. They weren’t, of course. The tests the bank had paid for were a joke, and the people who’d conducted them, while they may have worked in security, weren’t hackers. Whether they were conscious of it or not, what they really offered was a false sense of security and that only left their customers at greater risk. “They don’t understand, if you don’t test at the same level as the threat you’ll be facing, it’s like testing a bulletproof vest with a squirt gun,” Desautels says of companies that increasingly becoming targets while paying fortunes for “security solutions” that offer little in terms of defense. Worldwide security spending is estimated to reach $96 billion in 2018, up from $82 billion just two years ago and $89 billion one year ago. Yet, the number of data breaches and the amount of data stolen is also projected to increase. In the first half of 2017, more data was stolen than in all of 2016 combined. By 2021, estimates place the worldwide cost of cybercrime somewhere around $6 trillion—annually. By the time Desautels founded his company, the industry was becoming increasingly predatory and full of scammers. In 2008, for example, the Federal Trade Commission was forced to act after, it said, “more than one million consumers” were tricked into purchasing “security software” from companies that relied on false and misleading marketing schemes, known as “scareware.” Pop-ups and other ad-like modules on website shouted spurious claims of compromise at users: “Your PC is infected. Click here for a scan.” But the so-called scans, which could cost $40 or more, were fake. Legitimate security tools and snake oil are indistinguishable to the average user, like the difference between a Meegeren and a priceless Vermeer to someone who’s never set foot in a museum. Most corporate executives, unfortunately, are equally as blind, as are many IT professionals and the people who hire them, nearly all of whom rely heavily on outside vendors to tell them when and if they’re secure. Security companies love to brag about how their services are being utilized by billion-dollar corporations—up until the point those corporations get compromised. Famously, the security firm behind the Metasploit framework, Rapid7, once boasted about a major supermarket chain deploying its NeXpose “enterprise vulnerability management solution.” But after hackers breached the chain and made off with 4.2 million credit cards—considered one of the largest such thefts at the time—all of the promotional materials and testimonies related to the chain abruptly vanished from the security firm’s website. While many legitimized security firms today offer services that can, at the very least, detect known vulnerabilities and threats, their marketing departments are rarely realistic about the level of protection these services truly offer. Walking through a Dallas airport last week I spotted a sign that read: “Say Goodbye to Data Breaches.” Yeah, right. It had only been a few years since the company that put up that sign suffered its own humiliating breach. Claiming that you can stop data breaches is a lot like claiming you can stop employees from stealing office supplies. You can minimize, you can reduce, you can mitigate. But you can’t actually stop someone from walking out the front door with a box of paperclips. Even the National Security Agency, the nation’s largest employer of mathematicians, can’t solve this problem. Simply put, the best vulnerability scanner in the world can’t detect stupidity or the malicious intent of an employee. Just ask the CIA. Zero Doomsday In the first few years of business, Netragard’s team members built up their reputation by hacking major Las Vegas casinos, pharmaceutical companies, and nuclear research—with permission, of course. The penetration testing side of the business was booming, but the company was also pulling in millions from the sale of zero-day exploits—a practice that remains controversial to this day, particularly among privacy advocates concerned about government spies stockpiling “cyber weapons.” “We were making money doing offensive penetration testing,” Desautels says, “but we were also known throughout the zero-day world as being the go-to guys if you needed to break something.” Who was it buying up all these previously undiscovered exploits? Desautels just smiles. “People always ask me that and I always give them the same answer,” he says. “Public and private sector.” So in other words, defense contractors, private security firms, and three-letter agencies. To Desautels, the idea that the government is stockpiling zero days for the purpose of mass surveillance is prosperous. “These exploits cost millions of dollars a piece,” he says. “And they have a shelf life of basically three months.” After that, the odds of getting detected rapidly increases; so do the odds that the vulnerability will be fixed. For more than five years after the company was founded, the majority of Netragard’s zero-day customers were all based in America. But between 2013 and 2014, that changed. The company had received a special recommendation from a trusted buyer—which Desautels refers to only as “a very well known entity here in the US”—and so Netragard began dealing to a Milan-based firm known as Hacking Team, which had done business with the FBI, among other US agencies. The decision to work with these foreign hackers would ultimately threaten not only Netragard’s lucrative zero-day business but its reputation. Hacking Team, a major supplier of surveillance and intrusion software for governments worldwide, got hacked itself in 2015. Roughly 400GB of internal company emails and documents were dumped online, including invoices for zero-day purchases that traced back to Netragard. The emails were later vacuumed up by WikiLeaks, which tossed them into a searchable archive. The leak revealed that Hacking Team had been peddling spyware to authoritarian regimes with abysmal human rights records. For example, the firm had sold surveillance software to a Sudanese intelligence service notorious for the systematic torture of students, journalists, and activists. Human rights workers tied the armed forces that relied on that intelligence to incidents of mass sexual violence. That revelation heralded the end of Netragard’s exploit brokering business. Heavily reliant on Netragard’s assistance, several “programs” in the US were quietly shut down, he says. Bound by confidentiality agreements, the precise purpose of these programs, or to what end the use of malware was necessary, he won’t say. But, he says, “I was upset to hear about that because those programs countered things that were bad, things that really needed to be handled.” “I was disgusted,” Desautels says. “If we can’t trust the people who we’re selling to to keep these things within the right hands, we just don’t want to be apart of this.” Still, Desautels remains unapologetic about dealing in zero days “because a lot of good can come from this.” The wares brokered by Netragard had been deployed, he says, in operations tracking human traffickers, child pornography, and in various homeland security scenarios. “The public doesn’t understand that,” Desautels says. “It’s not like we can jump out and explain, ‘Hey everybody, we’re doing this because it protects you, it saves lives, and it’s necessary.’ It’s something somebody is going to do at some level, somewhere. And for the other countries that aren’t our friends, we need to have the same level of capability.” Hide Your Flaws As if the defense of covert sale of zero days to government agencies wasn’t controversial enough, Desautels also operates under the idea that publicly disclosing vulnerabilities—which is generally seen as a security industry best practice—actually imperils customers. His reasons are difficult to dispute. When a company discovers a vulnerability, it’s under increasing pressure to alert everyone it can—or else face accusations of putting people at risk in the interest of shareholders. Concealing a vulnerability is often painted as covering one’s own ass. The problem is that once bugs are disclosed, malicious hackers also become aware of their existence. Consumers and businesses, meanwhile, often fails to deploy a fix. Statistically, less than 1 percent of hacks involve the use of zero-day exploits. In fact, the exploits affecting most companies today date back several years. “I feel like if you find a bug, if you find out that something is dangerous, you find a flaw in the system, there should be a way to get that resolved without putting the world at risk,” Desautels says. “This is a serious failure on the part of the security industry.” Desautels believes “egos that exist in the industry” are to blame for the idea that disclosing vulnerabilities is in the public good. “You have researchers who want their name out there. They want to be talked about. It builds up your credibility, it builds up your portfolio,” he says. “But the bad almost always outweighs the good.” A number of major ransomware attacks in several countries last year, for example, took advantage of vulnerabilities that had long been public. For months and even years, companies had simply ignored the need to patch. And its consumers who often suffer. “I wish there was a way to guarantee that people would fix vulnerabilities when they are published,” he says. “But the reality is, there isn’t. It never happens that way and probably it never will.” Ultimately, the number one problem with security is that often there is no security. “The majority of people responsible for protecting networks know fuck-all about protecting networks,” Desautels says. “And even those who do aren’t always allowed to.” In his experience, the vast majority of enterprise customers just want a check in a box that says they’ve been tested, that claims they’re secure. They want a gold star to slap on their website. Even among the 20 percent who do care—those who actually want real fixes and real protection—most aren’t given the resources needed to actually get the job done. “The board or the executive management doesn’t fund it, doesn’t understand it, doesn’t see the value, won’t support it,” he says. And when they do, getting a vulnerability patched is “this huge bureaucratic process that sometimes never happens.” What inevitably follows is a data breach, or some other kind of huge data loss event, or a ransomware attack that cripples a hospital, or an airport, or a shipping company. Millions of people exposed, and what do they get? A subscription to a credit monitoring service; an identity theft insurance card. “People don’t patch or they can’t patch, the security technology that’s suppose to protect them does not work as nearly as well as advertised, and boom, you have critical failures left and right,” Desautels says, pausing for a moment. “You know what doesn’t help either...,” he adds with a sigh, “most people in the security industry couldn’t hack their way out of a wet paper bag with a lightsaber.” This story was produced with support from the Mozilla Foundation as part of its mission to educate individuals about their security and privacy on the internet.","Adriel Desautels was suddenly in a serious mess, and it was entirely his fault.

You see, hes not just the man overseeing the investigation into whether or not the President of the United States knew that Russia was meddling in our 2016 election, hes also a person.

Theres no guessing here, no opportunity to misinterpret. Its simple, elegant. On Queer Eye one of the quick tips is to serve coffee as a signal that its time to wrap it up, says Managing Editor Virginia Smith. This is more harsh, which I like. Harsh and to the point! Because as Video Editor Joel Kahns example makes clear, it takes the ambiguity out of the situation. I threw a dinner party this weekend [ Alicias note : Weird, I wasnt invited... ]. When I wanted everyone to leave, I started cleaning up and got into my pajamas, and NO ONE LEFT. They all stayed. They were like you look comfy and didnt leave. Now, had Joel invited me, Im fairly certain I would have caught on to what he was doing and been the first to exit, thus ensuring other guests would follow my lead and leave Joel to enjoy the rest of his evening. You can ask any of my friendsI love to leave a party early! But he didnt. And Im fine with that! Really. Im fine. But next time he should either 1) Invite me (Only if he wants to! No pressure!), or 2) Flick the lights on and off, like ol Mueller here. Anyway, Tech Editor David Murphy says hes tried the pajama trick and claims that it worked. So I suppose it is a possibility.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"Gretchen Dahlinger Means, the university official who oversaw the investigation in 2016, said that Dr. Tyndall often made inappropriate remarks to women he was examining, commenting, for example, on their “perky breasts,” “flawless skin” or “intact hymen,” according to nurses and other medical staff. Dr. Tyndall performed pelvic exams with women by initially using his fingers, rather than a speculum, as is regular medical practice now, according to medical staff interviewed in the investigation. Dr. Tyndall “vigorously defended his practices,” officials wrote. Investigators consulted with a gynecological expert “who stated that this could be considered an acceptable practice.” Another outside medical review firm said the “examination practice was outdated and not current standard of care.” “These comments and his behavior were completely unacceptable and a violation of our values,” Mr. Nikias wrote. Dr. Tyndall began working at the student health center in 1989 and was often the only full-time gynecologist on staff, seeing thousands of students. During their 2016 investigation, university investigators consulted two independent criminal law experts, Mr. Nikias wrote, who said that there was no criminal conduct to report to law enforcement. Last week, “in an abundance of caution” officials contacted the Los Angeles County district attorney and the Los Angeles Police Department. A spokesman for the department could not say whether there was an active investigation into the incident. “While we have no evidence of criminal conduct, we have no doubt that Dr. Tyndall’s behavior was completely unacceptable,” Mr. Nikias wrote. “It was a clear violation of our Principles of Community, and a shameful betrayal of our values.” Before the 2016 investigation, the former health center director primarily dealt with complaints on his own, rather than elevate them to an independent investigator. In 2013, that director, who has since died, did report allegations of Dr. Tyndall making racist comments, but an investigation did not find “conclusive evidence of a policy violation,” according to a summary from university officials. At the time, “interviews yielded mixed opinions,” with some staff members saying they “loved him” while others described him as “creepy.”","The University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"With the tsunami generated so close to Palu, there was little time for people to escape. A tsunami warning was issued by the government and was lifted about half an hour after the quake, apparently after the tsunami hit Palu. Indonesia currently uses only seismographs, global positioning system devices and tide gauges to detect tsunamis, which are of limited effectiveness, said Louise Comfort, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh graduate school. She has been involved in a project to bring new tsunami sensors to Indonesia. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a sophisticated network of 39 sensors on the ocean bottom that can detect extremely small pressure changes indicating the passage of a tsunami. The data are then relayed via satellite and analyzed, and an alert is issued if required. Dr. Comfort said that Indonesia had a similar network of 22 sensors but they are no longer in use because they were not being maintained or had been vandalized. The project she is working on would bring a new system to Indonesia that would use undersea communication to avoid the use of surface buoys that could be vandalized or hit by ships.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"By contrast, the fault that ruptured on Friday was a so-called strike-slip fault, in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami. But under certain circumstances it can, Dr. Patton said. A strike-slip fault might have some amount of vertical motion that could displace seawater. Or the faults rupture zone, which in this case was estimated to be about 70 miles long, may pass through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, so that when the fault moves during the quake, it pushes seawater in front of it. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly. The violent shaking during the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that would have displaced water and created waves. Such events are not uncommon; several occurred during the 1964 9.2-magnitude Alaska earthquake, for example. Dr. Patton said a combination of factors may have contributed to the tsunami. Studies of the seafloor will be crucial to understanding the event. We wont know what caused it until thats done, he said.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

Lucas Matney,"In turns out, SpaceX was indeed not responsible for the loss of a top secret government satellite that fell back to earth and was destroyed following a Falcon 9 rocket launch earlier this year, a report in the Wall Street Journal today states. The Zuma satellite’s purpose was highly classified, but the fate of the project which was rumored to cost $3.5 billion to develop was covered in a high profile fashion because it was intimately tied to a live-streamed SpaceX launch. Sources familiar with two separate federal and industry investigations tell the Journal that the blame for the failure rests with the failure of a payload adapter modified by top military contractor Northrop Grumman which also built the Zuma satellite itself. The payload adapter device struggled to operate in zero gravity conditions, the report details: The device, purchased from a subcontractor, was significantly modified and then successfully tested three times on the ground by Northrop Grumman, according to one person familiar with the process. But upon reaching orbit, this person said, the adapter didn’t uncouple the satellite from the rocket in zero-gravity conditions. Sensors on board failed to immediately report what happened, this person said, so officials tracking the launch weren’t aware of the major malfunction until the satellite was dragged back into the atmosphere by the returning second stage. The satellite ultimately broke free but by then had dropped to an altitude that was too low for a rescue. In the aftermath of the successful Falcon 9 launch, word emerged that the Zuma satellite separation had been far less successful, but because of the project’s classified nature there was no official word to be found. Given the often tenuous nature of SpaceX’s history with public perception of its rocket safety, the company did later publicly note that the Falcon 9 “did everything correctly,” insinuating that the fault did not lie with its tech. Reports soon emerged that the failure was likely not the fault of SpaceX, and it seems that after investigations, the government has concluded the same.","In turns out, SpaceX was indeed not responsible for the loss of a top secret government satellite that fell back to earth and was destroyed following a Falcon 9 rocket launch earlier this year, a report in the Wall Street Journal today states.

David Murphy,"Im not sure there are many people who like GoDaddy, but there are plenty who still use the web registrar and host because they dont know any better. I cant fault them. Im pretty sure I used GoDaddy to register my first domain name, either because I heard the companys name on a commercial and associated them with how to get a domain name in my head, or I saw some deal online. (Probably that.)
Theres plenty to not like about GoDaddyincluding its past stances on important things, how it treats potential customers, that whole SOPA thing, and its jacked-up pricing models. You can now add one more annoyance to the list. Recently, programmer Igor Kromin discovered that GoDaddy was injecting annoying Javascript into his website. The code is a part of the services Real User Metrics feature, which you would automatically opt into using if one of the companys U.S. data centers was hosting your site.
It would be one thing if GoDaddys code was silent and unobtrusivenot an ideal scenario, but not horrible. However, GoDaddy was quick to admit that Real User Metrics might cause some problems for its users, as the company blatantly notes on a support page: ...the javascript used may cause issues including slower site performance, or a broken/inoperable website.
Following Kromins report, GoDaddy decided to kill Real User Metrics until it can transform the feature into an actual opt-in programyou know, the kind of thing you have to check a box to accept. Now is as good a time as any to rethink your relationship with GoDaddy. Or, at the very least, to consider how you use the service.

Checking your sites settings is important
Whether youre sticking with GoDaddy or moving to a new host entirely, GoDaddys opt-in practice is a good reminder to regularly check your website for oddities. Craft up a sample page and look at your code. Is there anything in there that looks strange? You might not be able to escape code insertions from your host, but its important to know what they are, what theyre doing, and whether theyre impacting your sites functionality in any way.
Also, take some time to pore over your hosts settings for your site. You might not understand all of it, and you might really have to dig to uncover any other programs youve unknowingly opted into. Click all the menu buttons in the interface, open up all the contextual prompts, and root through every option your host offers so you arent missing annoying extras you could otherwise disable. As far as code injections go, you can also try looking into crafting a strong Content Security Policy for your website, but its not a panacea, as one commenter in Kromins post notes:
You can if you dont trust your host, CSP and stuff is great, but its a response header so the server provider can append any scripts into the CSP list before sending the header to the client, thus allowing what ever they want. They can also easily just back proxy their own script using NGINX or Apache so that yoursite(dot)com/inject.js loads their own script every time. Unless you trust your host no header will save against this problem.

Consider switching to a different web host
You can always drop GoDaddy like a bad Tinder date and sign up for a site that gives you premade templates to play withlike Squarespace or Wixand just point your domain to whatever address they create for you. This will limit your creativity and your bank account, but its an option if you just need a basic website that looks good and functions well.
As for picking a host that lets you fill space with whatever you want, you have roughly a million different options to pick from. Im not going to pretend as if I have a definitive list of the very best. However, I have seen a number of recommendations around the web for companies like iwantmyname, DigitalOcean, Cloudways, Gandi, Bluehost, Siteground, InMotion Hosting, Dreamhost, Namecheap, A Small Orange, Hostgator, Nodehost, Midphase, and Siteground... to name a few.
Above all else, make sure the host and plan you select aligns with your needs. If youre not quite sure how to set up a basic site, dont go with a host that gives you space on a server and sends you off to figure out what to do with it. A host that offers more hand-holding, or pre-configured content management systems, might be a better bet.

Dont go crazy, either. If youre building a small Wordpress site to host your résumé and some pictures, you probably dont need to spring for an expensive package that promises unlimited storage and bandwidth. You can probably get away with a more basic package.
Of course, it helps to know a bit about the technology behind a hosts offerings. Will your site sit on a shared server alongside a thousand others? Will your website live on a virtual private server? Do you think youll have enough traffic to warrant a dedicated server? Should you opt for a cloud server where youre only charged for bandwidth people use? How easy it is to switch between these setups if you get more (or less) than what you need?
If you find a host with a sweet promotional deal for service, make sure you read the fine print. The low rate you see for hosting your site might only apply for months, or the first year, and the real rate might be more than what youre willing to pay for a website. Dont pull a Lando Calrissian and get suckered in by a deal that turns bad.
Finally, go hunt down some reviews. Whether youre scanning Google. Reddit, Stack Exchange, or wherever, find actual, legitimate reviews based on users actual experiences, not just their cursory scans of a web hosts offerings. This might take a little digging, but its one of the best ways to get a feel for a web host, and it also helps ensure that youre on top any news you might need to know about your potential pick. If users start commenting that your top hosting choice started, say, injecting code into their websites that causes them to crash, you might want to investigate your second-choice selection.","I’m not sure there are many people who like GoDaddy, but there are plenty who still use the web registrar and host because they don’t know any better.

David Murphy,"Microsoft Windows can get messy. It’s not (always) the operating system’s fault. You download tons of apps and files, and create new content stuff of your own, until your “Downloads” directory looks like a landfill for old content. Your desktop is so full of icons, you can’t see your pretty wallpaper. Your Start Menu looks like an app buffet. In short, your operating system is a mess, but it’s not unfixable. We take spring cleaning very seriously at Lifehacker. Far be it from us to let an opportunity to refresh, reorganize, and declutter our homes lives pass us by. We’re also pretty psyched to hit the reset button on our tech usage, take a close look at our finances, and give the heave-ho to the day-to-day habits that have gotten a little musty. Welcome to Spring Cleaning Week, wherein we clear the cobwebs of winter and set the stage for sunny days ahead. Let’s clean things up, shall we? There are a few free apps you can use to add some much-needed organization to your Windows world. Here are a few of our favorites: We covered this app a long time ago, but it’s worth resurrecting. DropIt is a great utility that can help you stay organized if you’re the kind of person who dumps everything you download (or copy to your PC) into a single folder—one giant, sprawling hub that many files enter, but rarely leave. DropIt allows you to set up a ton of different rules that fire off whenever you drag files onto the utility’s little icon. For example, you can set the app to always move image files into your primary photos folder, video files into your videos folder, and Word documents into—you guessed it—your documents folder. That’s just the start. If you want to get more advanced, DropIt can automatically scan folders (like your Downloads folder) and apply more advanced filters to anything it finds, like automatically unzipping archives, renaming files based on your parameters, or compressing large batches of files that are otherwise taking up a bit more space than you want. Automation is a great way to help you stay organized in Windows, and DropIt practically gives you a virtual helper at your fingertips. If your sprawling photo library needs some serious organization but you don’t want to pay for something like Adobe Lightroom, the open-source app digiKam is a great alternative. Use this app to sort your photos and create (or edit) metadata so you can find exactly what you’re looking for in one easy-to-access library. If you’re also a bit of a photo perfectionist, you can use digiKam to edit your regular and RAW shots to make them picture-perfect. This app is a much better solution for organizing shots than just dumping them into arbitrary Windows folders. Your disorganized hard drive will thank you, and you’ll be much less likely to lose (or forget about) images going forward. We’re not going to ask why you have a bunch of emulators installed on your system, and we’re going to assume that all the ROMs spread across that nightmare of a folder structure in the “Games” portion of your hard drive are completely legal. Right? Regardless, if you just spent the last day getting your nostalgia kick by downloading archives of thousands of different retro games to play on your modern-day PC, keeping these games under control is going to feel overwhelming. We suggest grabbing LaunchBox, which is a great “game organizer” utility that allows you to quickly find and play titles in your giant library. You can tap into the app’s crowd-sourced database to pepper your titles with useful information, like release dates, genres, publishers, and images, and you can mark certain games as favorites to make theme easier to hunt down when you have a little time to kill. LaunchBox also makes it (somewhat) easy to import games from your favorite distribution services, like Steam, Battle.net, and GoG (to name a few). If you’re the world’s biggest gamer who plays everything you can download and always grabs new titles to try from all the major services, LaunchBox is a great way to organize your games under one digital roof. Everyone knows Windows’ Aero Snap shortcuts, right? Hit Windows Key + one of the arrow keys on your keyboard to send your active window flying all around your screen: minimizing, opening, shrinking to fill a quarter or half of your display, and bouncing off your primary display entirely (if you have a multi-monitor setup). AquaSnap takes this concept and supercharges it. You can snap your windows to different parts of your display, just like with Aero Snap, but you can also do so much more. For example, if you have three windows open in a lovely tiled configuration, you can resize all three on the fly just by dragging your mouse around—each expands and shrinks as needed. Your windows can now snap to each other, not just the corners of your display, and you can move connected apps around as one large chunk of a group. Double-clicking on the edge of a window allows it to expand in that direction to fill the entirety of your display, a handy trick. Grabbing a app’s window and shaking it around with your mouse—yes, shaking it—turns the window transparent and sets it to sit “always on top” of any other windows you have open. That’s a great little feature if you need to access something like a calculator, but don’t want it getting too much in the way when you aren’t using it. And if you want to get crazy, you can manage your Windows wizardry using AquaSnap’s keyboard hotkeys. Your coworkers and friends will be in awe of your mad window-moving skills. If you’re the kind of person who arranges your smartphone apps by color, you’re going to love TileIconifier. Though it’s going to demand a bit of your time if you’re crazy about how your Start Menu looks, this utility allows you to customize your apps’ tiles. For example, if you love a particular color (green), and are upset that the background color of your favorite app’s tile doesn’t align with your chromatic preferences, you can fix that. You can either upload your own custom image to use as a medium or small tile—sorry, large or wide tiles aren’t supported—or you can simply use the app’s existing icon (scaled to any size) with any background color you want. You can make both light and dark versions of the icon, too, in case you ever feel like switching Windows themes. Of course, most of your icons’ backgrounds should just switch to whatever color you select as an accent in Windows 10 (Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors). TileIconifier is a great way to bend the more stubborn icons to your will—or, worse, to replace every official icon on your tiles with a different image of a cute animal.

ELIZABETH DIAS,"At Mr. Trumps rally in Illinois, many people seemed altogether unaware of the synagogue shooting, until someone offered a prayer from the stage. Asked who was to blame for the countrys strife, Patricia Mitchell, who drove more than two hours from St. Louis to attend, cited the globalists, which she then defined as somebody who wont allow or doesnt like for our country to just be themselves. They want to mold everybody into one big melting pot, she said. Thats not how were designed. But the violence shows that the turmoil is starting very much at home. Many voters, in interviews with The Times in recent weeks, have been divided over national identity and who gets to define values in America, especially on issues of immigration and race. Mark Hetfield, who leads HIAS, a global Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees and that appears to have angered the synagogue shooting suspect, said his organization was in a state of shock. Ive never seen anything like this in my lifetime, he said in a phone interview. People have to stop saying hateful things about refugees, about Jews, about Latinos, about transgender people, about the other, he continued. It has to stop in the context of everything that we are doing, not just in the context of this election. But in the final weeks of the midterm election, which has become in part a nationwide referendum on Mr. Trumps leadership, the climate has intensified, and escalating violence and fear are exacerbating divergent viewpoints among voters. At the halfway mark of his term, Mr. Trump faces a reckoning at home related to some of the words he spoke from the inauguration dais: This American carnage stops right here and right now. Pipe bombs against public officials, African Americans killed in Kentucky, continued physical threats against the press, an all-out campaign of fear directed at immigrants signal that hate is on the march in America, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday. Were facing a battle for the soul of this nation, added Mr. Biden, who is considering a run for president in 2020. Words matter. And silence is complicity. For some, a parallel that comes to mind for the current moment is the summer of the presidential election of 1968, which saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy two months apart, said Randall Balmer, who chairs Dartmouth Colleges religion department. The difference, however, is that those shootings appeared to be directed against specific individuals, whereas this years violence is more tribal against Democrats generally or Jews generally, he said.","Nine days out from an already divisive midterm election, the campaign’s finale has come amid a cascade of horrors that reflected the country’s fault lines.",2018-10-28T14:09:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Voters Brace as Election Winds Down Amid Gun Violence and Pipe Bombs,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/elections-synagogue-shooting-bombs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/world/29midterm-mood01/29midterm-mood01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fault,1

Dell Cameron,"While not admitting to any fault, the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday settled a lawsuit for tens of thousands of dollars after unlawfully withholding records from a reporter under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
The FCC will pay over $43,000 in attorneys fees and costs to New York journalist Jason Prechtel over records he initially requested almost two years ago concerning its 2017 net neutrality proceeding. Represented by Chicago law firm Loevy &amp; Loevy, Prechtel sued the FCC in a Washington, D.C., federal court after it failed to respond to his request in the timeframe provided under the statute.
The data Prechtel ultimately obtained through the case formed the basis of a Gizmodo report last monthwhich he coauthoredthat revealed how investigators had linked various entities, including a prominent Washington, D.C., publication, to potentially millions of fraudulent comments submitted during the 2017 net neutrality rollback.
The same data was previously withheld from law enforcement investigators by the FCCs top lawyer citing jurisdictional and privacy concerns. Prechtel eventually obtained it under FOIA from a separate agency.
After a year and a half of litigation and a court order requiring production of requested records, FCC agreed to pay $43,077.80 to wrap up the case, said attorney Joshua Burday, who represent Prechtel in court. This is a good reminder that you dont need to be able to afford a lawyer to exercise your FOIA rights.
The settlement, which formally dismisses Prechtels case, includes a standard stipulation that the FCC does not admit any liability or fault as a result. The commission was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Johnny Walker.
The amount recouped by Loevy &amp; Loevy is far above average, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a research center at Syracuse University. For every 50 or so plaintiffs awarded less than $10,000, only about five are awarded fees ranging from $50,000 to $75,000. The fees, awarded at judges discretion, are not routine, TRAC says.
Judges are empowered under FOIA to assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonable incurred when, the statute says, the plaintiff has substantially prevailed. The fees enable FOIA attorneys to take on more pro bono cases from journalists, like Prechtel, who are not supported financially by large corporations.
Earlier this week, the FCC admitted in a separate but related FOIA lawsuit brought by the New York Times that its public comment system lacked the technical capacity to track fraudulent statements it receives as part of its notice-and-comment rulemaking.
As of October 2018, investigators in New Yorks Bureau of Internet and Technology believed that as many as half of the 23 million public comments related to the 2017 net neutrality proceedings used names and home addresses of Americans without their consent.","While not admitting to any fault, the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday settled a lawsuit for tens of thousands of dollars after unlawfully withholding records from a reporter under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov took to the encrypted messaging app today to explain why certain Telegram features aren’t working as expected on iOS 11.4, Apple’s most recent mobile OS update. In short, Durov says it’s Apple’s fault. According to Durov, the issues with Telegram are already resolved within the app, but Apple itself has been restricting updates to Telegram since April, according to Durov, when Russian officials called for a ban on the app in the country. Last month, Russian organization Roskomnadzor (Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) was granted approval by the Moscow Tagansky District Court to ban the use of Telegram in the country after the company refused to hand over encryption keys it claims it does not have. The organization is tasked with enforcing Russia’s recently adopted series of amendments requiring online services to store communication records, metadata, and encryption keys for reading securely transmitted messages. After Durov announced his plan to provide a workaround to Russia’s ban on Telegram, the government’s ISPs proceeded to block a few million IP addresses belonging to Amazon and Google, disrupting services around the country but doing little to prevent Telegram from working as expected. Russia has since asked Apple to remove Telegram from its App Store altogether. While Apple hasn’t provided a reason behind the lack of Telegram updates, Durov also notes that the delay makes it difficult to provide its users in the European Union with an app that fully complies with the EU’s sweeping new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","If youre a coffee aficionado, brace yourself because Ive got some bad news for you.
About 60 percent of the 124 wild coffee species worldwide are threatened with extinction, according to a new study published in Science Advances Wednesday. While the list only includes one of the roughly five coffee species used commercially around the globeArabicathe finding nevertheless bodes poorly for your morning cup o joe in the age of climate change.
Thats because the unique genetic makeup of wild coffee specieswhich are threatened by habitat loss, their isolation in a single geographic location, or the timber industrycould help researchers develop coffee crops that are resilient to a warmer or drier climate. The paper calls out one wild species, for instance, that was used to develop crops more resistant to leaf rust.
Weve gone back to the wild, so to speak, and used wild species and wild diversity to make the coffee production part of the coffee sector sustainable, said Aaron Davis, a co-author of the study and a senior research leader at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London. What were drinking is already influenced by wild coffee species.
The paper splits up wild coffee species into different categories based on how likely the species are to be used in developing newcrops. The first group, made up of the farmed and wild variants of coffee species we drink, has just one threatened species. The second group, which holds 38 species including all the African species scientists would likely turn to when the climate makes it harder for the coffee we grow now to thrive, sees 61 percent of its species threatened. Group No. 3 contains 82 species, including all those in Madagascar, Comoros Islands, and the Mascarene Islands. 62 percent of these are threatened.
The study relies on data that already exists to determine how coffees doing. That includes observations in the wild from the past two decades and dried samples that have been collected over the last 250 years, Davis explained. The researchers determined how likely a species was to go extinct using IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, which includes population trends, habitat suitability, and where the species lives.
Whats alarming about all this is that many coffee species dont live in wild protected areas (like national parks or forest reserves) or in living collections like at Kew. About 30 percent of these wild coffee species have no protections in the wild. And nearly half dont sit within any collections.
Current methods for preserving species so that they dont go extinct are inadequate, Davis told Earther. We need to really step up our efforts to preserve wild coffee species and indeed many other important plant species.
Coffee is tough because it cant be preserved in the giant freezers traditionally used to store seeds or specimens. They need ultra-cold temperatures, as Davis put it. That means liquid nitrogen to freeze them by cryopreservation.

JOHN KERRY,"Emissions are forecast to go up by 2.7 percent worldwide this year. Instead of reining them in, the Trump administration would unleash more by replacing the Clean Power Plan with a rule that could allow power plants to unload 12 times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Instead of controlling fuel emissions, the administration is rolling back fuel economy standards that the auto industry had embraced. Instead of keeping a lid on methane, its making it more likely that this potent greenhouse gas will leak into the atmosphere. Future generations will measure us by whether we acted on facts, not just debated or denied them. The verdict will hang on whether we put in place policies that will drive the development and deployment of clean technologies, re-energize our economies, and tackle global climate change. Every day that goes by that were paralyzed by the Luddite in the White House is a day in the future that our grandchildren will suffer. Thats not hyperbole thats science. Instead of tacitly accepting that inaction is preordained for the remaining two years of the Trump presidency, Congress should send Mr. Trump legislation addressing this crisis. It will force him to make choices the American people will long remember: Will he say no to deploying solar technology that would turn the American West into the Saudi Arabia of solar? No to turning the Midwest into the Middle East of wind power? No to a manufacturing revolution that could put West Virginia back to work in ways that his beloved coal never will? Make him choose and lets find out. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democrat from New York and Senate minority leader, is right to demand that infrastructure legislation actually hasten the transition to a clean energy economy and increase climate resilience. In soon-to-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi, he has a partner who wrangled the votes in the House in 2009 to pass a landmark cap-and-trade program to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases (though it never made it out of the Senate), and can join him in seeking investments in low carbon infrastructure. And if Mr. Trump says no, make climate change the galvanizing issue for 2020 for millennials who will vote as if their lives depend on it because they do. If we fail, future generations will judge us all as failures, not just this president. They will have no time for excuses. Facts matter. Act on them.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"All the officer has to say is, I thought you were going to hurt me, said Heather Hamel, a civil rights lawyer representing Mr. Zepeda, the blind man. That is how you twist the narrative. Every time there is a case of police brutality and the person lives, theyre going to get hit with an aggravated assault charge. Mr. Brown, the man the police shot in the back, was also charged with aggravated assault on an officer. Some politicians have taken up the Police Departments argument. When people get stopped, they think it is O.K. to approach the officer in a threatening way, City Councilman Sal DiCiccio said at a hearing in June. Of course theyre going to get shot at that point. In an interview, Mr. DiCiccio faulted the city for not hiring enough police. We have a more violent population, he said. By the numbers, Phoenix is about as dangerous as a typical large American city. At 7.6 violent crimes per thousand residents, Phoenixs violent crime rate was the same as the aggregate for cities with populations over 250,000, and slightly higher than that for cities with over a million, according to F.B.I. data for 2017. A police spokeswoman said the department did not intentionally withhold public information, but that processing requests could take time. The city does not post data on civilian complaints. One Phoenix police officer has been shot this year. He was wounded during a traffic stop in August. At the behest of Chief Williams, city officials have hired the National Police Foundation, a nonprofit research firm, to study the problem. The move displeased police union officials, who said it amounted to placating activists by second-guessing officers who have done nothing wrong.","Poder in Action, a nonprofit group in Phoenix, marks shootings by the city’s police officers on a wall map in its office.

Brian Heater,"There are no secrets in consumer electronics anymore. Sometimes it’s the fault of flubs and flaws and leakers. Sometimes it’s by design. In the case of the Galaxy Note 9, it’s a little bit of both. The Galaxy S9 wasn’t the blockbuster Samsung’s shareholders were expecting, so the company understandably primed the pump through a combination of teasers and leaks — some no doubt unintentional and others that seemed suspiciously less so. By the time yesterday’s big event at Brooklyn’s house that Jay-Z built rolled around, we knew just about everything we needed to know about the upcoming handset, and virtually every leaked spec proved accurate. Sure, the company amazingly managed to through in a surprise or two, but the event was all about the Note. And understandably so. The phablet, along with the Galaxy S line, forms the cornerstone of Samsung’s entire consumer approach. It’s a portfolio that expands with each event, to include wearables, productivity, the smart home, automotive, a smart assistant and now the long-awaited smart speaker. None of which would make a lick of sense without the handsets. If the Galaxy S is Samsung’s tentpole device, the Note represents what the company has deemed its “innovation brand,” the uber-premium device that allows the company to push the limits of its mobile hardware. In past generations, that’s meant the Edge display (curving screen), S-Pen, giant screen and dual-camera. That innovation, naturally, comes at a price. Here it’s $1,000. It’s a price that, until a year ago seemed impossibly steep for a smartphone. For the Galaxy Note 9, on the other hand, that’s just where things start. Any hopes that the new model might represent a move toward the mainstream for the line in the wake of an underwhelming S9 performance can be put to rest here. The Note is what it’s always been and will likely always continue to be: a device for the diehard. A very good device, mind, but one for those with an arm and or a leg to spare. Most of the good new features will trickle their way down the food chain to the company’s more mainstream device. At $720/$840, the S9 isn’t a budget phone by any stretch of the imagination, but at the very least, keeping it to three digits seems a little more palatable. A good rule of thumb for a hardware review is incorporating the product into one’s own life as much as possible. It’s a pretty easy ask with a device like the Note 9, which has the advantage of great hardware and software design built upon the learnings and missteps of several generations. It’s still not perfect by any means, and the company’s everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach to the line means there are plenty of features that never really made their may into my routine. And while, as the largely unchanged product design suggests — the Note 9 doesn’t represent a hugely significant milestone in the product line — there are enough tweaks throughout the product to maintain its place toward the top of the Android heap. All charged up Let’s address the gorilla in the room here. Two years ago, Galaxy Notes started exploding. Samsung recalled the devices, started selling them, more exploded and they recalled them again, ultimately discontinuing the product. Samsung apologized profusely and agreed to institute more rigorous safety checks. For the next few devices, the company didn’t rock the boat. Battery sizes on Galaxy products stayed mostly the same. It was a combination of pragmatism and optics. The company needed time to ensure that future products wouldn’t suffer the same fate, while demonstrating to the public and shareholders that it was doing due diligence. “What we want to do is a tempered approach to innovation any time,” Samsung’s director of Product Strategy and Marketing told me ahead of launch, “so this was the right time to increase the battery to meet consumer needs.” Given Samsung’s massive business as a component manufacturer, the whole fiasco ultimately didn’t dent the bottom line. In fact, in a strange way, it might ultimately be a net positive. Now it can boast about having one of the most rigorous battery testing processes in the business. Now it’s a feature, not a bug. At 4,000mAh, the Note 9 features a 700mAh increase above its predecessor. It’s not an unprecedented number — Huawei’s already hit the 4,000 mark — but it’s the largest ever on a Note device, putting the handset in the top percentile. As far as how that actually translates to real-world usage, Samsung’s not giving a number yet. The company simply says “all day and all night” in its release. I found that to be pretty close to the truth. I unplugged the handset at 100 percent yesterday afternoon. I texted, listened to Spotify, took photos, downloaded and just generally attempted to live my life on the damn thing. Just under 22 hours later, it gave up the ghost and after much notification-based consternation about a critically low battery, the screen went black. Like I said, it’s not crazy battery life, but going most of a full day and night without a charge is a nice little luxury — and the sort of thing all phone makers should strive to achieve on their flagship products. The company also, kindly, included the new Wireless Charging Duo. The charging pad is not quite as ambitious as the AirPower, but unlike that product, introduced nearly a year ago by Apple, I have this in my hands right now. So, point: Samsung. Charging the device from zero to 100 percent took three hours on the dot with the $120 “Fast Charge” pad. And it’s nice and toasty now. Memories Okay, about that price. Again, we’re talking $999.99 to start. There’s also a second SKU. That one will run you $1,295.99. Take a moment if you need to. That’s a silly amount of money if you’re not the starting point guard for the Golden State Warriors. So much for the rumors that the company would be working to make its devices more economically accessible. And while the premium hardware has always meant that the Galaxy line is going to remain on the pricey side, I can’t help but point out that a few key decisions could have kept the price down, while maintaining build quality. Storage is arguably the primary culprit. The aforementioned two SKUs give you either 6GB of RAM with 128GB or 8GB of RAM with 512GB. With cloud syncing and the rest, it’s hard to imagine I would come close to that limit in the two or so years until the time comes to upgrade my handset. I’m sure those sorts of crazy media-hoarding power users do, in fact, exist in the world, but they’re undoubtedly a rarity. Besides, as Samsung helpfully pointed out, 512GB SD cards already exist in the world. Sure, that’s another $350 tacked onto the bottom line, but it’s there, if you need it. For most users, it’s hard to see Samsung’s claim of having “the world’s first 1TB-ready smartphone” (512GB+512GB) exists for little more reason than racking up yet another flashy claim for the 1960s Batman utility belt of smartphones. Sure, Samsung no doubt gets a deal on Samsung-built hard drives, but the component has to be a key part in what’s driving costs up. For a company as driven by choice as Samsung, I’m honestly surprised we’re not getting more options up front here in the States. Remote control Confession: After testing many Galaxy Note models over the course of many years, I’ve never figured out a great use for the S-Pen. I mean, I’m happy that people like it, and obviously all of the early skepticism about the return of the stylus was quickly put to rest, as the company has continued to go back to the well, year after year. But all of the handwritten note taking and animated GIF drawing just isn’t for me, man. I also recently spoke to an artist friend who told me that the Note doesn’t really cut it for him on the drawing front, either. Again, if you like or love it, more power to you, but it’s just not for me. As silly as the idea of using the S-Pen as a remote control might appear at first glance, however, it’s clear to me that this is the first use of the built-in accessory I could honestly see using on a daily basis. It’s handy once you get beyond the silliness of holding a stylus in your hand while running, and serves as a handy surrogate for those who don’t own a compatible smartwatch. The S-Pen now sports Bluetooth Low Energy, allowing it to control different aspects of phone use. Low Energy or not, that tech requires power, so the stylus now contains a super conductor, which charges it when slotted inside the phone; 40 seconds of charging should get you a healthy 30 minutes of use. Even so, the phone will bug you to remind you that you really ought to dock the thing when not in use. The compatible apps are still fairly limited at launch, but it’s enough to demonstrate how this could be a handy little addition. Of the bunch, I got the most out of music control for Spotify. One click plays/pauses a song, and a double-click extends the track. Sure, it’s limited functionality, but it saved me from having to fiddle with the phone to change songs went I went for my run this morning. You’ll need to be a bit more creative when determining usefulness in some of the other apps. Using it as a shutter button in the camera app, for instance, could be a useful way to take a selfie without having to hold the phone at arms’ length. The entire time, I wondered what one might be able to accomplish with additional buttons (volume/rewind/gameplay)? What about a pedometer to track steps when you’re running on the treadmill without it in the pocket? Or even a beacon to help absent-minded folks like myself find it after we invariably drop it between couch cushions. But yeah, I understand why the company would choose to keep things simple for what remains a sort of secondary functionality. Or, heck, maybe the company just needs to hold some features for the Note 10 (Note X?). Oh, and the Blue and Lavender versions of the phone come in striking yellow and purple S-Pens, with lock-screen ink color to match. So that’s pretty fun. Hey man, nice shot Nowhere is the Note’s cumulative evolution better represented than the camera. Each subsequent Galaxy S and Note release seem to offer new hardware and/or software upgrades, giving the company two distinct opportunities per year to improve imaging for the line. The S9, announced back in February, notably brought improved low-light photography to the line. The dual aperture flips between f/1.5 and f/2.4, to let in more light. It’s a neat trick for a smartphone. Behold, a head to head between the Note 9 (left) and iPhone X (right): Here’s what we’re dealing with on the hardware front: Rear: Dual Camera with Dual OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) Wide-angle: Super Speed Dual Pixel 12MP AF, F1.5/F2.4, OIS Telephoto: 12MP AF, F2.4, OIS 2X optical zoom, up to 10X digital zoom Front: 8MP AF, F1.7 This time out, the improvements are mostly on the software side of things. Two features in particular stand out: Scene Optimizer and Flaw Detection. The first should prove familiar to those who’ve been paying attention to the smartphone game of late. LG is probably the most prominent example. Camera hardware is pretty great across the board of most modern smartphone flagships. As such, these new features are designed to eliminate the current weakest link: human error. Scene Optimizer saves amateur photographers from having to futz with more advanced settings like white balance and saturation. The feature uses AI to determine what the camera is seeing, and adjusts settings accordingly. There are 20 different settings, including: Food, Portraits, Flowers, Indoor scenes, Animals, Landscapes, Greenery, Trees, Sky, Mountains, Beaches, Sunrises and sunsets, Watersides, Street scenes, Night scenes, Waterfalls, Snow, Birds, Backlit and Text. Some are pretty general, others are weirdly specific, but it’s a good mix, and I suspect Samsung will continue to add to it through OTA updates. That said, the function itself doesn’t need a cloud connection, doing all of the processing on-board. The feature worked well with most of the flowers and food I threw at it (so to speak), popping up a small icon in the bottom of the screen to let me know that it knows what it’s looking at. It also did well with book text. The success rate of other things, like trees, were, unsurprisingly, dependent on context. Get just the top part and it identifies it as “Greenery.” Flip the phone to portrait mode and get the whole of the trunk and it pops up the “Tree” icon. I did get a few false positives along the way; the Note 9 thought my fingers were food, which is deeply disturbing for any number of reasons. [Without Scene Optimizer – left, With Scene Optimizer – right] Obviously, it’s not going to be perfect. I found, in the case of flowers that it has the tendency to oversaturate the colors. If you agree, you can disable the feature in settings. However, you have to do this before the shot is taken. There’s no way to manually override the feature to tell it what kind of object you’re shooting. That seems like a bit of a no-brainer addition. [Super slow-mo matcha under the flicking lights] Flaw Detection serves a similar role as Scene Optimizer, helping you avoid getting in your own way as an amateur photog. The feature is designed to alert you if a shot is blurry, if there’s a smudge on the screen, if the subject blinked or if backlighting is making everything look crappy. In the case of lens smudging and backlighting, it only bothers with a single alert every 24 hours. The blink detection worked well. Blur detection, on the other hand, was a bit more of a crap shoot for subjects in motion and those that were too close to the lens to get a good focus. The feature could use a bit of work, but I still think it’s one of the more compelling additions on the whole of the device and anticipate a lot of other companies introducing their own versions in the coming year. [gallery ids=""1689899,1689901,1689903,1689904,1689905""] Design Note The more the Note changes, the more it stays the same, I suppose. As expected, the design language hasn’t changed much, which is no doubt part of what made Samsung CEO DJ Koh think he could get away with using the device in public ahead of launch. The footprint is virtually the same in spite of the ever-so-slightly larger screen (6.3 &gt; 6.4-inches, same 2,960 x 1,440 resolution) — from 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6 mm on the 8, to 161.9 x 76.4 x 8.8 mm on the 9. That’s perfectly fine. Samsung’s done an impressive job cramming a lot of screen into a manageable footprint over the past several gens. The only major change (aside from the lovely new blue and purple paint jobs) is the migration of the fingerprint sensor from the side of the camera to underneath it. This was a clear instance of Samsung responding to feedback from users frustrated by all the times they mistook the camera for the fingerprint reader. The new placement helps a bit, though it’s still fairly close to the camera, and the fact that both are similar shapes doesn’t help matters. Thank goodness for that new smudge detector. Oh, and the headphone jack is still present, because of course it is. For Samsung, it’s an important way to distinguish the product and approach from a world gone dongle mad. Note on Notes Oh Bixby, you eternal bastion of unfulfilled potential. A full rundown of new features can be found here. Overall, the smart assistant promises to be more conversational, with better concierge features. That said, Samsung’s once again tweaking it until the last moment, so I can’t offer you a full review until closer to the phone’s August 24 street date. So stay tuned for that, I guess. I will say that the setup process can be a bit of a slog for a feature designed to make everything easier. Playing with Bixby voice required me to navigate several pages in order to connect the two. Thankfully, you should only have to deal with that the one time. Samsung’s continuing to tweak the internals to make its device more suitable for gaming. The water-carbon cooling system tweaks the liquid cooling system found on the device since the S7, to help diffuse heat more efficiently. The large, bright screen meanwhile, is well-suited to mobile gaming, and the 6GB model handled Fortnite fairly well. A final note The next smartphone revolution always seems to be a year away. The potential arrival of a Samsung device with a foldable display makes the notion of carrying a massive device around in one’s pocket almost quaint. For the time being, however, the Note remains one of the best methods for transporting a whole lot of screen around on your person. A lot has changed about the Note in the past seven years, but the core of the device is mostly the same: big screen and stylus coming together to walk the line between productivity and entertainment. It’s big, it’s bold, it’s too expensive for a lot of us. But it remains the phablet to beat.","There are no secrets in consumer electronics anymore.

Devin Coldewey,"The cause of the fatal crash of an Uber self-driving car appears to have been at the software level, specifically a function that determines which objects to ignore and which to attend to, The Information reported. This puts the fault squarely on Uber’s doorstep, though there was never much reason to think it belonged anywhere else. Given the multiplicity of vision systems and backups on board any given autonomous vehicle, it seemed impossible that any one of them failing could have prevented the car’s systems from perceiving Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street directly in front of the lidar and front-facing cameras. Yet the car didn’t even touch the brakes or sound an alarm. Combined with an inattentive safety driver, this failure resulted in Herzberg’s death. The only possibilities that made sense were: A : Fault in the object recognition system, which may have failed to classify Herzberg and her bike as a pedestrian. This seems unlikely since bikes and people are among the things the system should be most competent at identifying. B : Fault in the car’s higher logic, which makes decisions like which objects to pay attention to and what to do about them. No need to slow down for a parked bike at the side of the road, for instance, but one swerving into the lane in front of the car is cause for immediate action. This mimics human attention and decision making and prevents the car from panicking at every new object detected. The sources cited by The Information say that Uber has determined B was the problem. Specifically, it was that the system was set up to ignore objects that it should have attended to; Herzberg seems to have been detected but considered a false positive. This is not good. Autonomous vehicles have superhuman senses: lidar that stretches out hundreds of feet in pitch darkness, object recognition that tracks dozens of cars and pedestrians at once, radar and other systems to watch the road around it unblinkingly. But all these senses are subordinate, like our own, to a “brain” — a central processing unit that takes the information from the cameras and other sensors and combines it into a meaningful picture of the world around it, then makes decisions based on that picture in real time. This is by far the hardest part of the car to create, as Uber has shown. It doesn’t matter how good your eyes are if your brain doesn’t know what it’s looking at or how to respond properly. I’ve asked Uber for comment.","The cause of the fatal crash of an Uber self-driving car appears to have been at the software level, specifically a function that determines which objects to ignore and which to attend to, The Information reported.

msmash,"To that rare breed of person who carefully reads terms of service and keeps multiple, meticulous backups of important files, da Silva should have expected that his ability to access movies he thought he'd purchased might be cut off because he'd moved from one Commonwealth country to another. Just keep playing your original file! But DRM makes this an unreasonable demand. First, files with DRM are subject to break at any time. DRM systems are frequently updated, and often rely on phoning home to some server to verify that they can still be played. Some technological or business change may have turned the most carefully backed-up and preserved digital file into just a blob of unreadable encrypted bits. Second, even if they are still playable, files with DRM are not very portable, and they might not fit in with modern workflows. To stay with the Apple and iTunes example, the old-fashioned way to watch a movie purchased from the iTunes Store would be to download it in the iTunes desktop app, and then watch it there, sync it to a portable device, or keep iTunes running as a ""server"" in your home where it can be streamed to devices such as the Apple TV. But this is just not how things are done anymore. To watch an iTunes movie on an Apple TV, you stream or download it from Apple's servers. To watch an iTunes movie on an iPhone, same thing. (And because this is the closed-off ecosystem of DRM'd iTunes movies, if you want to watch your movie on a Roku or an Android phone, you're just out of luck.) [...] My takeaway is that, if a seller of DRM'd digital media uses words like ""purchase"" and ""buy,"" they have at a minimum an obligation to continue to provide additional downloads of that media, in perpetuity. Fine print aside, without that, people simply aren't getting what they think they're getting for their money, and words like ""rent"" and ""borrow"" are more appropriate. Of course, there is good reason to think that even then people are not likely to fully understand that ""buying"" something in the digital world is not the same as buying something in the physical world, and more ambitious measures may be required to ensure that people can still own personal property in the digital marketplace. See the excellent work of Aaron Perzanowski and Jason Schultz on this point. But the bare minimum of ""owning"" a movie would seem to be the continued ability to actually watch it.","A social media post from Anders G da Silva, who accused Apple of deleting movies he had purchased from iTunes went viral earlier this month.

Jon Evans,"It’s the Internet’s fault, we’re told. Brexiters and Remainers, Republicans and Democrats — every side of every political dispute now lives in its own separate reality, bellowing “fake news!” at every attempt to breach their borders of belief. The fragmentation of the media, coupled with the filter-bubble effect and the dominance of Facebook and Google, means that we no longer share any consensus view of reality. …But I saw The Post this week, and it struck me: we never did. We used to have an imposed view of reality, not a consensus one. As the movie makes clear, editors and Cabinet members palled around weekly, and implicitly agreed on what news would and wouldn’t be fed to the public. (See also Chomsky’s Manufacturing Consent.) The moral crisis of the time came from the realization that the government was lying to its pals in the media, and had been for a very long time. If that sounds like ancient history, remember that Iraq was not particularly different from Vietnam: in both cases, the White House (and, this time, Downing Street) lied through their teeth to the people; the media accepted and promoted those lies; and a war which consumed hundreds of thousand of lives, and trillions of dollars, ensued. Donald Trump may be the most personally vile President of all time, but his presidency has not (at least yet) been anywhere near as catastrophic as those of Richard Nixon or George W. Bush. However. The other assumption implicit in traditional journalism was that their job was to provide evidence to the American people, who would then judge it, adjust their views, and vote accordingly. It was assumed that people had an engineering mindset, where one’s worldview can and will be adjusted by new evidence. That mindset, that willingness to allow contrary evidence to adjust what you believe, is why science and engineering work. It is arguably why democracy works, too. And it would work in a world of fake news. Again, falsified evidence is not new. The US government falsified (by omission) the evidence about Vietnam for a very long time. Politicized “yellow journalism” dates to at least the nineteenth century. But the assumption was that people in general would try to see its falsehoods and inconsistencies, or at least grudgingly accept their existence when they were pointed out. Fake news is a problem that could and would be fixed by a genuine, widespread, good-faith desire for true news. The real problem isn’t fake news; it’s that people have given up on that search for truth. The real problem is that the engineer’s mindset, wherein one weighs the available evidence, and accept and incorporate new evidence even if it contradicts what you previously believed, has never been more rare. (I’m not pretending it was ever remotely universal; I’m just saying that there was enough of it, barely, for democracy to work more-or-less as intended.) No longer. The engineer’s mindset has been replaced by the lawyer’s mindset, wherein you pick a side in advance of getting any evidence, and then do absolutely everything you can to belittle, dismiss, and ignore any opposing data, while trumping up every scrap that might support your own side as if it were written on stone tables brought down from the mountain by Moses. I mean no disrespect to the legal profession: some of my favorite people are lawyers, including the one I married. The legal approach is an excellent means of getting to the truth of hard and confrontational matters — — assuming it is done in the court of some sort of thoughtful, knowledgeable, and relatively impartial judge. But that court doesn’t exist in a democracy, or, rather, the democracy is the court … and so, in order for democracy to work, it requires the engineer’s mindset. The UK, the USA, and other countries seem to have seen that way of thinking wither below a crucial critical mass, to their great and growing cost. So there’s a certain irony in blaming the tech industry for this, when tech is, for all its many flaws and blind spots, perhaps the last remaining bastion where the engineer’s mindset is (at least in theory) celebrated. Maybe we are in fact to blame; I’d certainly be interested in seeing evidence to that effect. Maybe it’s the lack of a post-Cold-War common enemy. Maybe it’s a natural evolution of a decadent empire, or a natural reaction to the increasing complexity and incomprehensibility of the world. Maybe it’s the 1% and the finance industry fomenting conflict to distract from their parasitical oligarchy. Regardless, let’s consider the distinct possibility that the so-called scourge of “fake news” is merely a symptom, not the problem.","It’s the Internet’s fault, we’re told.

Natasha Lomas,"The meme-laden Tumblr platform is the latest social media and blogging outlet to be unmasked as a distribution channel for Russian agents to rip at America’s societal fault lines and seek to influence citizens’ voting habits, according to a report by BuzzFeed News. Facebook and Twitter have been firmly in the spotlight on this issue since the shock result of the 2016 US presidential election. Google has also self-reported on Russian disinformation on its platforms. But the role of other social platforms in spreading Kremlin propaganda has faced less scrutiny thus far. BuzzFeed worked with researcher, Jonathan Albright, from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, to identify Russian-backed account activity on Tumblr. It says the analysis reveals “a powerful, largely unrevealed network of Russian trolls focused on black issues and activism” which dates back to early 2015. Some of the Russian-linked blogging activity on Tumblr was apparently aimed at boosting support for Bernie Sanders at the expense of eventual Democratic candidate nominee Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee process concluded in July 2016. While the US presidential election itself was held on November 8, 2016. “The evidence we’ve collected shows a highly engaged and far-reaching Tumblr propaganda-op targeting mostly teenage and twenty-something African Americans,” Albright is quoted as saying. “This appears to have been part of an ongoing campaign since early 2015,” he added. We’ve reached out to Tumblr owner Oath ‘s press office with questions about the research — at the time of writing the company has not replied. (For the record Tumblr owner Oath is also TechCrunch’s parent company.) Oath did not respond to BuzzFeed’s requests for comment on its research. The methodology it used for unmasking Russian agents on Tumblr appears to be a pretty simple one: The researchers cross-referenced Tumblr accounts that used “the same, or very similar” usernames from a list of known Internet Research Agency (IRA) accounts, previously submitted by Twitter to congressional investigators. (The IRA being one of the confirmed Russian trollfarms; others are also known to exist.) Incidentally, last month Twitter updated this Russian bot list — saying it had now identified an additional 13k Russian-linked bots that had made election-related tweets, pushing the total number to more than 50,000. (Of those it said about 3,800 were linked to the IRA.) In January Twitter also said it now thought that 1.4M people had engaged with Russian trolls during the US election. It’s not yet clear how impactful Kremlin agents’ Tumblr dis-ops were. The most successful of the Russian-linked Tumblr accounts identified by BuzzFeed’s analysis had apparently created multiple posts generating hundreds of thousands of “notes” on Tumblr (aka totaled likes, reblogs, replies etc). The research also found Russian-linked Tumblr accounts cross-posting content from other social platforms — including Twitter and Instagram. BuzzFeed says most of the accounts linked to the IRA are no longer active on Tumblr, although it specifies that two are still sharing content on the platform (though it describes the content as “completely unrelated”, and speculates it’s possible that account ownership has since changed). In terms of the types of socially divisive content being shared via these Russian-linked Tumblrs, BuzzFeed cites examples that sought to link Clinton to a former KKK leader; complained about unfair media coverage of a Sanders rally; and decried racial injustice and police violence in the US. After Clinton won the Democratic nomination, some of the Russian-linked Tumblrs that had been backing Sanders apparently started pushing pro-Trump content. The research also unearthed a network of links out from Tumblr to “thousands of still-remaining Twitter posts, black culture blogs, at least several hundred still-remaining Facebook posts, sign-ups for online petitions, and a number of Reddit threads related to pro-Bernie news, Hillary conspiracies, and in-classroom racial matters”, according to Albright. Given the cross-referencing method that was used to ID Russian activity it’s entirely possible other Russian-backed Tumblr accounts existed on the platform (and/or still exist) — but which have yet to be identified.","The meme-laden Tumblr platform is the latest social media and blogging outlet to be unmasked as a distribution channel for Russian agents to rip at America’s societal fault lines and seek to influence citizens’ voting habits, according to a report by BuzzFeed…",2018-02-07T15:57:02Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Tumblr also lousy with Russia-backed US election trolls: Report,http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/tumblr-also-lousy-with-russia-backed-us-election-trolls-report/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gettyimages-6096531021.jpg,techcrunch,TechCrunch,fault,1

Credit Ángel Franco/The New York Times Photo Mayor Dinkins addressing black and Jewish residents in Crown Heights. Credit John Sotomayor/The New York Times At the heart of David Dinkins’s story as mayor are four days in August 1991, after a car in a rabbi’s motorcade in Crown Heights ran a red light and killed a 7-year-old Guyanese boy named Gavin Cato. The neighborhood exploded. Angry black residents assailed the driver, who escaped via a volunteer Jewish ambulance crew. Two hours later, a crowd surrounded and stabbed a rabbinical student named Yankel Rosenbaum, who died of a wound not noticed at the hospital. Three days of mayhem followed, with bands of black residents taking over the streets, some chanting “Heil Hitler” or “Kill the Jews,” and Jewish residents accusing the black mayor of permitting a “pogrom,” or organized massacre of an ethnic group. Crowds hurled bricks and bottles at police patrols, forcing them to run for their lives; the mayor and police commissioner also came under attack. Network news reports showed buildings and police cars on fire, and a mayor who appeared powerless — some said unwilling — to restore order. Finally, the mayor and police department changed tactics, from negotiating to arresting the combatants. The fires and crowds dissipated. The news cameras went home. But the damage was done. In his office a quarter-century later, Mr. Dinkins dismissed a question about whether, had he changed tactics one night sooner, he might have won re-election. “You don’t know that until after the fact,” he said. “I said to the police brass, Whatever you guys are doing, it ain’t working. You need to get it together. But whether some police thought that I wanted them to be lenient on blacks attacking Jews — I can’t imagine how they would have thought that — but that was not the case. I got accused of that, and that’s painful.” Had he won, in turn, his place in history might have been different, said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The police cadets he had authorized would have hit the streets on his watch; crime might have really dropped, as it did under Mr. Giuliani, aided by the end of the crack epidemic; and the Walt Disney Company’s restoration of the New Amsterdam Theater in 1997, which began the transformation of 42nd Street (the deal was started by Mr. Dinkins and closed by Mr. Giuliani), would have lifted his mayoralty. Mr. Dinkins declined to speculate. “The action that one takes in a circumstance like that ought not be based on what will get me votes or lose me votes,” he said. “It ought to be based on what is the right thing to do. Everybody’s a whole lot smarter after the fact.” Photo Mayor Dinkins at City Hall with Rudolph W. Giuliani, after Mr. Giuliani successfully defeated the mayor in the 1993 election. Credit Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times New Yorkers do not always love their mayors. Mr. de Blasio, in a July poll by Quinnipiac University, had an approval rating of just 50 percent, with only 46 percent of respondents saying he deserved re-election. After three years in office, Mr. Bloomberg had an approval rating of just 43 percent. Neither met any real resistance to re-election. Mr. Giuliani finished his first term with a 62 percent approval rating, but sunk badly in his second, before he rebounded with his dynamism after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. de Blasio, who was a junior staffer under Mr. Dinkins, said Mr. Dinkins’s problem was an image created for him by the tabloids, which were still loud and powerful in the early ’90s. “Dinkins got a raw deal largely because of race,” Mr. de Blasio said in a telephone interview before his re-election. “And he got a raw deal because he was not a loud, showy personality and he wasn’t always trying to claim credit. But any normal assessment of history would say, wait a minute, he added cops, that’s why this turned around.” “The thing I learned from that is an audacity of how to deal with what appeared to be an intractable problem,” Mr. de Blasio added. “The fact that we’re the safest big city in America today directly links to his actions with getting resources from Albany to get us the size of the police force we needed. “None of his predecessors figured out how to do it. I’m not sure his successor, who took a lot of the credit for work done with resources Dinkins got — I’m not sure his successor could have pulled it off in Albany as a political reality.” Continue reading the main story","He was a historic figure, New York’s first black mayor.

Matt Novak,"Why are teens eating Tide pods? Or, at least, pretending to eat them in videos that they’re posting online? We have some theories. But the company that makes the brightly colored laundry pods would like you to know that, whatever the reason, it’s not their fault. Procter &amp; Gamble, the company that manufacturers Tide pods, is clearly in a tough spot. Kids are eating their poisonous laundry detergent as a kind of nihilistic joke (drinking bleach was all the rage this past summer ) and while the old saying is that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, this is pretty bad. The CEO of P&amp;G has written a blog post about the recent fad, explaining that they can’t stop kids from being absolutely fucking stupid. “Ensuring the safety of the people who use our products is fundamental to everything we do at P&amp;G,” David Taylor, the CEO of Procter and Gamble, wrote yesterday in a blog post simply called “ Keeping Us Safe.” “However, even the most stringent standards and protocols, labels and warnings can’t prevent intentional abuse fueled by poor judgment and the desire for popularity,” Taylor continued. Well, he’s got us there. Back in 1982, someone started tampering with Tylenol bottles in Chicagoland, lacing them with cyancide. Seven people died and the company that makes Tylenol, Johnson &amp; Johnson, responded by creating tamper-evident packaging. The Tide pod-eating fad seems to be the opposite of that. P&amp;G doesn’t want anyone to get poisoned, but the company’s younger consumers are practicing self-harm as a kind of comment on just how shitty the world is right now. “As P&amp;G’s CEO, I assure you we’re working with our partners to do what we can to stop this dangerous trend, including ensuring social media networks are removing videos that glorify this harmful behavior, partnering with advocacy and industry groups to help spread the word that this is dangerous behavior not to be copied, and releasing this public service announcement that is designed to reach teens and young adults – in addition to other steps we’ve taken.” True to its word, Tide released a video on YouTube about how stupid it is to ingest laundry detergent. But obviously teens already know just how dangerous it is. That’s why they’re doing it. “Let’s all take a moment to talk with the young people in our lives and let them know that their life and health matter more than clicks, views and likes,” Taylor wrote. “Please help them understand that this is no laughing matter.” Which brings us to precisely why this is happening: It is a laughing matter, because it’s something that pushes the boundaries of what’s deemed acceptable behavior online. And teens are always trying to test just how far you can go with a stupid joke. Companies flock to places like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, to market their wares and modern corporations adopt youth culture in the process, just as they have for decades. And teens today mostly play along. They’ve grown up in a marketing-obsessed world, just as the Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers did before them. And teens of 2018 really don’t seem to mind being awash in brands. Until they do. And that’s where the Tide pods come in. How can this youngest generation rebel? By creating memes that are unnerving for adults like David Taylor, the CEO of Procter and Gamble. We saw the same thing around Harambe, the gorilla that was shot at the Cleveland Zoo in March of 2016. Why did youth culture embrace Harambe and make endless jokes in poor taste about the gorilla’s death? Because it was one of the few things that brands like Tide weren’t going to touch. And literally eating poison is just another one of those boundary-pushing memes that teens have adopted in order to carve out something of their own, hoping that maybe it won’t be co-opted. People are indeed dying from eating Tide pods, but it’s mostly adults suffering from dementia. And yet again, that makes the joke even more risque and appealing for kids. In the end, everything about youth culture can and will be co-opted, of course, if there’s a buck to be made. In fact, a pizzeria in Brooklyn has made a Tide pod-inspired pie. And thus the marketing circle of life has been completed. Eating the Tide pod-looking pizza won’t kill you (they just die the cheese blue and orang), so don’t expect teens of the year 2018 to be interested. But you can expect the next nihilistic trend to be even more outrageous. What’s more outrageous than eating laundry detergent or jokes about beloved zoo animals that died horribly? I’m not a teen anymore so I’m out of ideas. But all we know for sure is that it’s coming soon to a YouTube near you.","Why are teens eating Tide pods?

Sidney Fussell,"Comcast is once again under fire for injecting JavaScript code into websites its customers visit. Last week, user bham3dman took to the Xfinity forum to complain about Comcast inserting hundreds of lines of code into their browsing session. The code surfaced a pop-up telling them to upgrade to a new modem. This is far from the first time Comcast has taken heat for secretly injecting code into devices on its network. In 2014, the company got called out for pounding wi-fi hotspot users with pop-ups, and the modem-upgrade pop-ups first surfaced early last year. But the company’s response this time around only added fuel to the simmering flames. “I just learned of this dispicable [sic] Comcast practice today and I am livid,” bham3dman wrote. Comcast’s solution? The user should have checked their email spam folder. A Comcast representative —who, it turns out, is Comcast’s vice president of policy and standards, Jason Livingood —confirmed the code injection, pointing bham3dman to a 2011 white paper outlining the practice. Titled “Comcast’s Web Notification System Design,” the document interestingly has a clause specifically saying injecting code is permissible but not for advertisements. R3.1.12. Advertising Replacement or Insertion Must Not Be Performed Under ANY Circumstances Additional Background: The system must not be used to replace any advertising provided by a website, or to insert advertising into websites. This therefore includes cases where a web page already has space for advertising, as well as cases where a web page does not have any advertising. This is a critical area of concern for end users, privacy advocates, and other members of the Internet community. Therefore, it must be made abundantly clear that this system will not be used for such purposes. Livingood, who confirmed to Gizmodo that he responded to bham3dman, insisted to the user that the pop-ups aren’t ads at all. He instead said they were notifications alerting users that their modems were “either end of life (EOL) or that you are about to get a speed upgrade that the model will be unable to deliver.” The specifics of the language is important: Simply notifying users they have a faulty modem isn’t the same as enticing them to upgrade to a new one for no reason. One could be considered a mere notification, while the other would be a forbidden ad. Motherboard surfaced one of the modem pop-ups when similar complaints came up last year. The message links to Comcast’s My Device page. Clicking through links to a list of modems you can purchase via Amazon. A Comcast spokesperson told Gizmodo that the company also offers customers the option to rent a modem from the company. On the question of whether this qualifies as an ad or not, bham3dman called bullshit. Livinsgood said the messages only show up if your modem is dead or dying, but bham3dman said they’d been assured by Comcast’s own support team that their modem was perfectly fine, neither end-of-life nor incapable of handling increased speeds. Further, when bham3dman reached out to customer service supervisors to complain, the user said, most had never heard of the practice of injecting code or, if they were aware, didn’t know how to turn it off. Incredibly, Livingood suggested it was all bham3dman’s own fault: “The notice is typically sent after a customer ignores several emails. Perhaps some of those ended up in your spam folder?” Creepily invasive code-injections aside, for a telecommunications giant to say, in 2017, that pop-up notifications are unavoidable is absurd. No one can stop the notices? If they’re triggered by ignoring emails, can’t the trigger be disabled? And why send emails in the first place, when the user has been assured they have a fully functioning modem? Livingood, who declined our request to further comment on the pop-ups, was careful in his replies not to debate whether it’s actually fair to users to send them messages this way, but that’s the real issue here. If this is meant to help customers, it’s as self-serving a way to do it as possible—and it could be dangerous. As Motherboard noted, using these types of pop-ups can train users to be less vigilant about pop-ups, which hackers can use for malicious purposes.

Jack Morse,"Who would have thought that, in the end, it would be the humble voicemail that would do us all in? Your Google, Microsoft, Apple, WhatsApp, and even Signal accounts all have an Achilles' heel — the same one, in fact. And it turns out that if you're not careful, a hacker could use that weakness to take over your online identity. Or so claims self-described ""security geek"" Martin Vigo. Speaking to an enthusiastic collection of hackers and security researchers at the annual DEF CON convention in Las Vegas, Vigo explained how he managed to reset passwords for a wide-ranging set of online accounts by taking advantage of the weakest link in the security chain: your voicemail. SEE ALSO: The hackers just arrived, and they're already breaking Vegas You see, he explained to the crowd, when requesting a password reset on services like WhatsApp, you have the option of requesting that you receive a call with the reset code. If you happen to miss the phone call, the automated service will leave a message with the code. But what if it wasn't you trying to reset your password, but a hacker? And what if that hacker also had access to your voicemail? Here's the thing: Vigo wrote an automated script that can almost effortlessly bruteforce most voicemail passwords without the phone's owner ever knowing. With that access, you could get an online account's password reset code and, consequently, control of the account itself. Vigo, letting us know we should probably all disable our voicemails. Image: Jack MOrse/mashable And no, your two-factor authentication won't stop a hacker from resetting your password. One of Vigo's slides laid out the basic structure of the attack: 1. Bruteforce voicemail system, ideally using backdoor numbers 2. Ensure calls go straight to voicemail (call flooding, OSINT, HLR) 3. Start password reset process using ""Call me"" feature 4. Listen to the recorded message containing the secret code 5. Profit! A recorded demo he played on stage showed a variation of this attack on a PayPal account. ""In three, two, one, boom — there it is,"" Vigo said to audience applause. ""We just compromised PayPal."" Vigo was careful to note that he responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the affected companies, but got a less than satisfactory response from many. He plans to post a modified version of his code to Github on Monday. Notably, he reassures us that he altered the code so that researchers can verify that it works, but also so that script kiddies won't be able to start resetting passwords left and right. So, now that we know this threat exists, what can we do to protect ourselves? Vigo, thankfully, has a few suggestions. First and foremost, disable your voicemail. If you can't do that for whatever reason, use the longest possible PIN code that is also random. Next, try not to provide your phone number to online services unless you absolutely have to for 2FA. In general, try to use authenticator apps over SMS-based 2FA. But, really, the most effective of those options is shutting your voicemail down completely. Which, and let's be honest here, you've likely been looking for a reason to do anyway. You can thank Vigo for providing you with the excuse.","Who would have thought that, in the end, it would be the humble voicemail that would do us all in?

MANNY FERNANDEZ and RICHARD FAUSSET,"Though Austin is widely seen as a liberal island in a deeply conservative state, the attacks have stoked the raw racial, economic, political and geographical divisions that continue to shape life here, 90 years after the city was segregated by decree. Austin and its suburbs remain sharply divided by class, race and even religion. Like Houston, it is an urban, diverse and Democratic hub surrounded by largely white, Republican suburbs, including Pflugerville, Mr. Conditt’s hometown. “Austin has gradually started to become aware and conversant about its race issues over the past five years, so the initial suggestion that these bombings could be race-related made people deeply nervous that the problem could be that bad,” said Cecilia Ballí, a writer and cultural anthropologist who lived in Austin from 2008 to 2014 and who now lives in Houston. “Whether or not the bomber’s motive ends up being race, this brought to the forefront one of the city’s challenges and worst fears.” The police have said that Mr. Conditt gave no indication in a 25-minute confession left on his phone that he was driven by racial hatred. News emerged Thursday that one of the explosive packages he sent at a FedEx store was addressed to a spa employee who is white. His past statements, including the views he expressed on a community college blog opposed to gay marriage, have added to speculation that he was anti-gay. In East Austin on Thursday, Daniel Arriaga, 51, a furniture mover, said he still believed the bomber had a hatred for blacks and Hispanics. He had harmed the two white victims, Mr. Arriaga theorized, “just to throw it off.” Alejandro Caceres, 30, an organizer for Grassroots Leadership, a prison reform and immigrant rights group, who lives and works in East Austin, said he believed the police were dismissing the concerns of black and Hispanic residents that the bombings were, at least in part, racially motivated. “We’re being told that all of our feelings and our realities are not true, that this person was not targeting black and brown people, that this person was not a terrorist,” Mr. Caceres said. Mr. Conditt’s world was, like the Austin region itself, multifaceted and defied easy categorization. In his hometown Pflugerville, about 20 miles northeast of Austin, the mayor, Victor Gonzales, is Hispanic. One of the candidates who ran against him was Philip Emiabata, who was born in Nigeria. One of Mr. Conditt’s roommates was black. And one of his friends was Sierra Davis, a transgender woman and Marine veteran who is part Hispanic. “Honestly, Mark was a lot like I was,” said Ms. Davis, 23, who got to know Mr. Conditt when they were teenagers. “He was a home schooler, Christian, and I was the same. I mean, we were all awkward at the time. Growing up, Pflugerville had a small-town feel to it. It was a lot more conservative than Austin, a lot more home-school friendly.” Photo A mural in East Austin depicting influential African-American and Latino icons. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Ms. Davis said that Mr. Conditt told her she was “going to hell” when she was transitioning. “But I wasn’t surprised by what he said,” she said. “We were raised like that and I was tied to those beliefs, too.” In Austin, I-35 has long been recognized as the dividing line separating most of the city’s minority residents from its white population, and much of its have-nots from the haves. That dividing line has an ugly, decades-old history. In an online examination of the city’s racial and economic divide by The Austin American-Statesman, a real estate ad circa 1915 reads: “Hyde Park is exclusively for white people.” Jesse E. Washington, 68, a retired city inspector who was born and raised in Austin, lives in a small ranch house his parents built in the 1960s in East Austin. He graduated from a segregated high school in 1967. “If you wanted to buy a home and own property in Austin, you could only get your utilities turned on if you were in East Austin,” Mr. Washington said. Now, of course, East Austin is far different. “If you walk up and down here you see the white kids walking their dogs and riding bicycles,” he said. Many of his black neighbors, he said, “have sold off.” Mr. Washington lives next door to the scene of one of the explosions, the one that killed Draylen Mason, 17, an African-American classical musician whose grandfather was a well-known dentist. The blast woke Mr. Washington around 6:45 a.m. that morning. At first he thought it was a falling tree limb. Mr. Washington listened with interest to the police chief’s description of Mr. Conditt’s confession. But he said he still wonders if race had something to do with it. “You know, the possibilities are endless,” he said. “These mental conditions that are in our minds growing up, the influences people have from the older generations.” Black leaders and residents have accused the police of failing to take the first bombing seriously because the victim was black, an accusation that police officials have denied. At the time of the first bombing on March 2, the authorities believed it was in retaliation for a drug raid the police had conducted on a similar-looking house on the same street three days beforehand. “We had a pretty strong working theory that day that led us to believe it was an isolated incident that day,” the Austin police chief, Brian Manley, told reporters recently. “It was very unique. We had no information to believe it was related to a larger plan at that time.” The bombings have come at a critical time for the city’s black population. A 2014 University of Texas report highlighted the drastic decline in the number of black residents in Austin, even as the city has boomed. Austin’s overall population growth rate was more than 20 percent between 2000 and 2010, making it the third-fastest growing city in the country. But the number of African-American residents declined by 5.4 percent — making it the only one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the United States to experience a loss in black population. It was the result, the researchers wrote, of “persistent structural inequalities.” The emerging tech industry was not hiring black and Latino residents. People of color were losing trust in the public schools on the traditionally black east side. Ms. Houston, the city councilwoman, said she now occasionally feels unwelcome in restaurants in the east side neighborhoods where she grew up, and which are becoming whiter. “As a black female they look at me like, ‘Why is she here?’” she said. Race has played out here in the backdrop of the case in other ways. KVUE, an ABC-affiliated TV station in Austin, issued an apology, after the words “this monkey” appeared in a sentence about Mr. Mason during its breaking-news coverage of the bombings. KVUE’s closed-captioning provider, VITAC, issued its own apology and said the error was “not intentional.” KVUE said it had severed ties with VITAC “due to the terrible mistake.” Reporting was contributed by Simon Romero from Pflugerville, Tex., Staci Semrad from Austin and Vivian Yee from New York.

JESSE McKINLEY and NICK CORASANITI,"The tax plan does harm high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, primarily by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes, or SALT, and capping the deduction for property taxes at $10,000. In New York, some 725,000 New York households would be subject to higher taxes under the proposed property tax cap, with 2.4 million also hit by increased income tax bills resulting from the SALT elimination, according to Mr. Cuomo’s office. But even in New York, the effects of the tax plan would not be felt evenly. The four Republican Congress members who voted for the plan — Chis Collins, John Katko, Claudia Tenney and Mr. Reed — represent districts in Central and Western New York with more low-income areas than their Republican colleagues closer to New York City. In the upstate districts, the tax plan would benefit those whose incomes are more moderate, they argue, and who take the standardized deduction, which would be nearly doubled under the plan. As such, the tax plan has also provided some upstate Republicans with a pure populist message: The tax bill helps as many working-class families as it hurts the upper stratus. Mr. Collins, a constant critic of Mr. Cuomo, said the notion that many well-to-do downstaters would have to “suck it up” and pay more taxes was fine by him. Photo Representative Chris Collins, a Republican and frequent critic of Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, has cast the battle over the tax plan as a choice between helping working-class taxpayers or wealthier residents. Credit Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, via Associated Press “We never said we were going to protect the top one or 2 percent,” Mr. Collins said in an interview on Thursday. “The juxtaposition is the governor is fighting for the millionaires and billionaires.” On Thursday, the governor once again tried to call attention to what he called the evils of the tax plan, suggesting that Mr. Collins and his fellow Republicans were being shortsighted and insincere, noting that high earners in Republican districts provided an outsize amount of state revenue via taxes. Mr. Cuomo warned against tax migration out of the state if high earners find their taxes increased, saying such a development would cause either future tax increases for the middle class or a gutting of social services which help the poor. “If you lose those taxpayers, you lose their revenue,” the governor said, adding that the tax plan was geared to pay for corporate tax reductions and pay for tax relief in more conservative parts of the country. “They need the money to cut taxes in other states.” The tax bill has already surfaced in some of the more competitive races around the state, including in Utica, where Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat, is the leading contender to take on Ms. Tenney, a Republican. Tim Edson, a spokesman for Ms. Tenney’s campaign, said, “When Anthony Brindisi complains about the Republican tax plan he is admitting guilt — that the high-tax policies he has rubber-stamped for Governor Cuomo are killing New York.” But Mr. Brindisi clearly sees political opportunity as well. “The more sunlight this tax plan gets, the more people hate it,” he said, noting that a Quinnipiac poll shows that more than half of Americans disapprove of the plan while only 29 percent approve. In Albany, Mr. Brindisi is also considering state legislation to address a specific area of concern: the tax plan’s elimination of a deduction for teachers who spend their own money on school supplies. Indeed, Mr. Brindisi says that beyond the property tax cap and the SALT elimination, a number of less-publicized cuts — including deductions for medical expenses and student debt — will also end up hurting the middle class. “Those are deductions that people use,” he said. In New Jersey, the political dynamics are less divided: Four of the five New Jersey Republican congress members voted against the initial House bill, and have signaled that, absent any major changes, they would remain against the bill. The sole Republican to vote for the bill, Representative Tom MacArthur, represents a Central New Jersey district where fewer than half of the households itemize state and local tax deductions, according to his office. And like his colleagues in New York, he argues that the tax bill will be a necessary challenge to a high-tax state like New Jersey to reform its policies that he says causes the high cost of living. “If cutting taxes at the federal level forces Democrats in Trenton to do the same, then this would be a welcome new direction for the state and an even bigger win for New Jersey taxpayers,” Mr. MacArthur said. “I’ll be glad to see them change the tax-and-spend policies that have made us the most overtaxed state in the nation, and I’m sure New Jersey taxpayers would agree.” Photo Representative Tom MacArthur, the sole Republican member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for the tax plan, said he hoped that the federal measure would compel Trenton to lower taxes. Credit Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters Even those Republicans who rejected the bills have been taking the debate as a ripe moment to attack their state’s taxes. “Our state and local tax deduction is as high as it is because our state and local taxes are as high as they are,” said Representative Lee Zeldin of Long Island, who has been punished by Republican leadership for voting no on the House bill. “All levels of government should be focused on tax relief.” Mr. Cuomo and his surrogates scoff at the suggestion that the governor is pro-tax, noting several state tax cuts during his nearly seven years in office as well as a cap on local property taxes. Nor do they concede any ground on spending — noting a spending cap during Mr. Cuomo’s time in office — as well as New York’s well-documented status as a “donor state,” sending billions more to Washington than it receives. Moreover, the governor seems proud to tout progressive policies paid for by the state’s $160 billion budget, larger than any state other than California. “Yes, California, New York are high-tax states,” Mr. Cuomo said on National Public Radio on Wednesday. “We have governments. We believe in providing social services and free college tuition, etc. And that’s a decision our states have made.” The governor’s allies were also railing against the plan, including the New York State AFL-CIO, which wrote a letter to the state’s congressional delegation denouncing it as “job-killing,” and arguing it “cuts taxes for the wealthy on the backs of hardworking New Yorkers.” Whether it costs Republicans at the ballot box is an open question. William F.B. O’Reilly, a Republican consultant in New York, called the tax bill “a calculated bet that the cuts, particularly the corporate tax cuts, will kick-start the manufacturing sector enough for working-class Americans to begin feeling optimistic again.” “The problem is that 2019 is too late for electoral considerations,” he said. “Republican members of Congress will be running in ’18 on a promise that may or may not come true.” Such prognostications are probably unsettling for Congress members like John Faso, who is facing a tough re-election fight in his Hudson Valley district. Mr. Faso said he voted no on the tax bill primarily because of worries about the impact of the SALT elimination, which he said he feared “will accelerate the exodus” of residents out of the state. As of now, Mr. Faso said he still would vote no, though he still hoped for changes in the final bill. But he said he wasn’t worried about Mr. Cuomo’s threats, political or otherwise. “There’s a lot of time between now and next November,” he said. “I’ll worry about the politics next year.” A version of this article appears in print on December 8, 2017, on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: New York Republicans Say, if Tax Plan Costs You, Don’t Blame Us.

Jon Evans,"Don’t worry; I’m not getting all moralistic on you here. When I talk about cultural decay I’m talking about something I think we need more of. We have too much culture to have a culture, you see, and that’s basically all tech’s fault — but it’s not necessarily a problem. No, stop, wait, listen, I can explain. Have you noticed that it’s a whole lot easier to make music and movies these days? Have you noticed that anyone can write a book, publish it, and make it available to the whole world, basically for free? And have you noticed that as these tools of cultural production have become democratized, their skills have, too? Colleges keep churning out people with degrees in the arts, who are collectively making more movies, recording more music, and writing more books than any generation before. (Not that you need a degree. My own degree is in electrical engineering and I’ve written five traditionally / mass-market published novels and a DC/Vertigo graphic novel.) When it comes to the art, any art, we are spoiled for choice. Which is great! Of course! But, curiously, at the same time, another thing is happening: art lasts longer. It’s not unusual to walk into a cafe or bar and hear songs from the 60s, 70s and 80s. I’m told that it was awfully weird to walk into a bar in the 70s and hear songs from the 20s, 30s and 40s. The biggest movie of this year will be a continuation of a 40-year-old franchise, whereas no 1937 franchises were still thriving in 1977. As for books, well, if you’re a literary type, you’re no less vaguely expected (with good reason!) to read Austen and Dostoevsky than you were forty years ago — even though the canon has grown considerably since. TV? By universal acclaim we live in the golden age of television — and yet, the ratings for even a smash hit TV show today are the same ratings that would probably have gotten a show cancelled in a matter of weeks thirty years ago. Isn’t that kind of weird? The reasons are the same, in all cases: technology has demolished the gatekeepers of consumption in the same way it annihilated the gatekeepers of production. Which, again, is obviously a great thing! But the net effect is that the rate of cultural accumulation in our society, the rate at which we generate lasting, important, canonical art, has exceeded the rate of cultural decay, i.e. the rate at which that art becomes irrelevant and no longer speaks to us. Vastly exceeded, I would argue. As a result we no longer really have a common cultural canon. There’s simply too much good, important stuff out there. Which is a very nice problem to have, but is still in fact a problem, or at least a complication. The net effect is that we don’t have near as many universally shared cultural references as we used to. If you wonder why our society seems to be fragmenting into so many different little fiefdoms, well, I’m not pretending that this is the only reason — but it’s a big one. Art is the cultural equivalent of a river carving its path; slow and subtle, but extraordinarily powerful over time, and capable of precipitating sudden and massive changes. Of late, though, our cultural river appears to have become a delta, and it’s anyone’s guess what kind of ocean it will open up into.","Don’t worry; I’m not getting all moralistic on you here.

Josh Constine,"I find it truly sad the way Facebook has led us to reduce wishing friends a happy birthday to a meaningless, generic chore. It’s not Facebook’s fault. It gives us an open-ended comment box. But our laziness and sense of social obligation unfurl as a pile of “Happy Birthday!” or even “HBD!” wall posts. I’ve been bashing this emergent behavior since 2011. It’s one of the reasons people feel like Facebook is destroying the meaning of friendship. Some go so far as to change the date of their birthday or close their wall to avoid the contentless notifications. That’s why I think the latest Facebook status update meme going around should be repurposed for birthdays. Dozens of friends recently posted “ If you’re reading this, even if we barely talk, comment a memory of us. After, make this your status because you’d be surprised the memories people hold of you.” It’s cute, no doubt, often inviting a flurry of touching stories, torrid tales, and silly photos. But it also feels a bit ‘extra’ (no offense). I’m sure plenty of people have declined to repost the call to action for fear of appearing needy or like they’re pandering for engagement. After all, Facebook recently told business Pages admins they’d be downranked in the News Feed for posting this kind of “engagement bait” because the comments trick the algorithm into thinking a post is more important than it is. So rather than making people coerce us into sharing our memories together, let’s give them freely. Next time you go to post on someone’s wall for their birthday, take that extra second to recall a moment you shared together or something specific you love about them.

Ed Cara,"Getting a stomach bug is bad enough. But a new outbreak of salmonella bacteria spread by raw turkey that has sickened nearly 100 people across several states has an troubling wrinkle to it: The germ at fault is likely also resistant to multiple antibiotics. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that between November and July 11, at least 90 people from 26 states have been infected with the same strain of Salmonella Reading. Forty were hospitalized, though none have died. Many of the people interviewed by the CDC reported they had eaten or exposed themselves to turkey products just before becoming sick. In two cases, the victims said they lived in a household where their pets ate raw turkey pet food. There doesn’t appear to be a single common source for the outbreak. The same strain was found in a variety of tested raw turkey pet foods, raw turkey products and live turkeys in different states, indicating it might be running wild throughout the turkey industry. Both the CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture have reached out to industry representatives and “asked about steps that they may be taking to reduce Salmonella contamination,” the agency said. The CDC is cautioning people to wash their hands and cooking areas after handling raw turkey, not to wash raw poultry before cooking it, and to throughly cook their birds. Generally, it recommends not feeding your precious pet any raw food at all. Most people who catch a nasty strain of Salmonella become sick within 12 to 72 hours of being exposed to it. They experience anywhere from four to seven days of gastrointestinal hell, developing diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. Though it usually doesn’t require urgent treatment like antibiotics, it can rarely become life-threatening if the germ finds its way into the bloodstream and reaches other parts of the body. Some, but not all, of the samples of the outbreak strain showed signs of resistance to as many as six different antibiotics at once. The antibiotics aren’t regularly used to treat Salmonella in people, so it likely won’t be any harder to fight off than usual. But superbugs can hurt us in other ways. Even harmless bacteria can loan other disease-causing bacteria their resistance genes through free-moving bits of DNA called plasmids. And there’s ample evidence that the spread of many dangerous resistance genes—including those that provide protection against the last resort antibiotics we have available for some infections—has been boosted by the use of antibiotics on farms. The outbreak is possibly also a sign that U.S. farmers are still routinely using antibiotics on livestock, despite a federal mandate that went into effect in 2017 trying to at least slow down the practice. On January 1 of last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued new rules that barred the use of antibiotics in livestock as growth promoters. But the rules still allowed farmers to use some antibiotics as a preventative treatment, so long as their use was approved by a veterinarian. A third of the antibiotics included on that list have no limits on how long they could be used, which prompted critics to worry that companies could exploit the loophole to maintain business as usual. There’s some evidence the rules led to real changes. A 2017 FDA report found that U.S. sales of animal antibiotics dropped 10 percent in 2016, when the rules were going through their final tweaks. It was the first drop seen since the FDA started collecting data on sales in 2009. Given this latest outbreak, though, it seems it’s too early to hope that farms won’t continue to be a breeding ground for superbugs.",Getting a stomach bug is bad enough.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Lets face it: 2018 sucked. Every day felt like a never-ending nightmare full of depressing reminders of how the world is going to end and how its all our fault. I get it, believe me. This is my world 24/7. However! Positive thingsmiraculous things even!did happen this year. So before we pop our champagne and wish for a year of fewer environmental failures and heartbreaking studies, hold onto the strides we made this year. Theyre worth remembering, even if just to lift your sorry, drunken spirits. Keystone XL pipeline hits pause As one of his first major actions as president, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to advance construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which former President Barack Obama vetoed in 2015. But last month, a U.S. district court judge vacated Trumps presidential permit. The analysis the State Department conducted to grant the 1,179-mile long crude oil pipeline didnt get into impacts the pipeline would have on climate change, so District Court Judge Brian Morris instructed the federal government to get on that. This was great news: Pipeline opponents, including indigenous environmental activists in the Midwest, have been fighting the energy project for 10 years now. Record renewables Trump has been trying really hard to take the world back to the dark ages of dirty energy, but that hasnt resulted in the death of renewables. This year set a record in the U.S. for corporate renewable energy procurements thanks to companies like Apple and Facebook investing in clean energy. In the European Union, renewables finally soared past coal as a source of electricity generation. Chinas on it, too. Solar and wind aint going nowhere, Trump. The downfall of Scott Pruitt This was probably the most satisfying news event to watch all year. Every day, the question loomed: What will it take for the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to resign? Pruitt didnt just deny climate change and repeal key environmental legislation, you see: He liked to spend exorbitant amounts of taxpayer money on his personal travel and around-the-clock security. Finally, after the scandals grew too scandalous, he peaced out in July. Toodles! New faces in Congress and a Green New Deal Thank the stars for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Shes not even a sitting Congressperson yet, and shes been campaigning tirelessly for a Green New Deal that would rapidly phase down U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. Specifically, she wants House Democrats to launch a committee to craft legislation around the idea. She joined protesters at a sit-in at Nacy Pelosis office in November, and shes only getting started. With growing support for an environmental revolution in the new Congress, her efforts may have a shot. The ozone hole is healing This is not a drill: The United Nations announced this year that the ozone hole could heal in our lifetimes. This felt impossible when the world first became aware of the problem in the 1980s, but it goes to show what strong environmental policy can do. Good job, world. New protected areas in Latin America Our world is full of beautiful and incredible natural places. And a lot of them remain unprotected, at risk of logging or poaching or whatever awful things people want to do. Luckily, both Peru and Chile stepped their game up this year by creating new national parks. Theyre no little parks, either: Chiles stretch over a million acres, and Perus covers more than two million. Hell yeah to protecting forests. And protection for environmental defenders, too Latin America is notorious as a dangerous place to be an outspoken steward of the planet. In fact, its downright deadly. This year, however, 12 Latin American countries came together to sign a landmark treaty to offer better protections for environmental defenders. This humans rights agreement seeks to give local people have a louder voice when it comes to development projects and recognizes the real threats they face when they decide to speak up. Pacific Islands leading on the environment The Pacific Islands have the most to lose in the face of a changing climate, rising sea levels, and warming world. Thats why Palau moved to ban sunscreens containing chemicals like oxybenzone, octocrylene, and parabens that harm coral in November. And Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has called upon the rest of the world to get its shit together to avoid a worst-case scenario of the future. The president of the Marshall Islands even chaired the worlds first virtual climate summit this year to avoid the conference air travel that results in a ton of greenhouse gas emissions. Talk about being the change. Oh yeah, new weather satellite Look, Im no weather nerd, yet even I can get excited about what a new weather satellite means. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched GOES-17 back in March, and this bad boy has already brought us marvelous images like these. More importantly, this satellite will help meteorologists better predict the weather, which ultimately saves lives in times of extreme events like hurricanes. Fine, the few times Trump did good Even I have to admit when Trump does something that isnt environmentally detrimental. There were two moments that stood out: When the president signed the Save Our Seas Act in October to help clean up marine garbage, and when the EPA announced in November a proposal to better regulate emissions from heavy-duty trucks. Neither of these balance out the rest of the destruction this guys caused and is planning (for instance, opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling) but gotta give credit where its due. Heres hoping that 2019 brings less devastation to our world and more wins like these.","Let’s face it: 2018 sucked.

Connie Loizos,"It’s hard to fault someone for being barely a billionaire — a self-made one at that, who happens to be just 27 years old. Still, owing to the performance of Snap’s performance since its March IPO, such is the position of Snap Inc. cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel. Spiegel was worth more than three times that amount just nine months ago, when the company made its splashy debut. Hailed initially as a triumph, Snap’s shares opened their first trading day at $24, soaring 41 percent out of the gate. Their price quickly began drifting south, however, and today trade at just less than $13, giving the company a market cap of $15.6 billion, down from a peak valuation of $31 billion. What does it really matter? Not much if Snap’s plans to reinvigorate its businesses can gain solid footing. As you may have read in TC earlier this month, the company is reversing its stance on a couple of key things. One of them will be to embrace social media influencers, rather than shun them, as was previously the case. Snap had also largely focused on first-world countries where high-bandwidth video is readily accessible, largely abandoned developing countries. But after missing revenue expectations by $30 million in the third quarter, Spiegel acknowledged on the company’s earnings call that “[Snap needs] to accelerate the adoption of our product among Android users... and users in the rest-of-the-world markets.” Not last the company says it’s prepared to work harder to attract users above the age of 34, a segment to which it was not catering earlier. Snap is also doing more to squeeze revenue out of its users, only 4.5 million who were new to the company in the last quarter. (That amounts to less than three percent user growth quarter over quarter.) As our colleague Josh Constine reported a couple of days ago, for example, Snapchat is looking to win over more businesses with immersive new ads formats. One, called Promoted Stories, strings together multiple Snaps into a longer-form slideshows that can be opened from a tile on the Stories page. A separate initiative, called Augmented Reality Trial ads, allow people to play with an AR version of a product overlaid on the scene surrounding them. Only time will tell if these initiatives make the kind of impact that Spiegel hopes they will. In the meantime, he may have to make do with less. Though he and cofounder Bobby Murphy reportedly sold shares worth $272 million apiece at the time of Snap’s IPO and he has continued to make regularly scheduled stock sales (he sold 1.65 million shares on November 9th at an average price of $12.42, for a total transaction of roughly $20.5 million), his remaining 86,657,812 shares are reportedly worth — eek — $1.07 billion at this point. On the day of Snap’s IPO, they were worth nearly $3.6 billion.","It’s hard to fault someone for being barely a billionaire — a self-made one at that, who happens to be just 27 years old.

Fitz Tepper,"While Coinbase has had its fair share of technical issues the last few months, it seems the latest one may not be their fault. Earlier today reports started coming in across social media and reddit that Coinbase users were seeing strange charges on their credit and debit cards. Many of these were users being double-charged for a past transaction, although there were also some (unconfirmed) reports of people being hit with as many as 50 duplicate charges. Understandably, users have been freaking out. It’s never fun to be charged more than you should have been, especially when it overdraws your bank account or maxes out your credit card. While it was initially unclear what was causing the issue (some were even alleging that Coinbase was withdrawing unauthorized money out of user’s bank accounts) we’ve now heard from Coinbase and have some clarity on what happened. According to Coinbase, the issue was a problem related to their credit card processing rails, and can be traced back to Visa. Specifically, it’s the result of Visa reversing and recharging past charges in wake of a decision to classify Coinbase transactions as “cash advances”. As background, last week most banks and card issuers changed the Merchant Category Code (MCC) for Coinbase, meaning all transactions would now be classified as cash advances (which typically means your bank charges a higher fee). None of these extra fees go to Coinbase, and it’s ultimately a negative for the startup since the higher fee will likely lead to a decline in users purchasing cryptocurrency with their credit cards. While one would assume that these changes would be applied only to future transactions, it seems that today without warning Visa (but not MasterCard or any other card network) reversed and recharged some transactions that occurred between January 22nd and February 11th, in order to classify them under the new MCC. All of these transactions were refunded at the same time they were re-charged, meaning theoretically users shouldn’t have noticed anything besides the increased fee attributed to the new MCC code. But as anyone familiar with the payments space knows, banking and credit card systems rarely update instantaneously – especially for refunds which can take multiple days to reflect. This delay means that some users may be seeing the second charge come through before the refund, which without clarification would just appear as duplicate charges. Ultimately, all users should be fully refunded soon. Coinbase has said they’re working with Visa to make sure this happens, and also will reach out to customers who were potentially affected urging them to check and make sure their transaction history is accurate. It’s still unclear how many people will be hit with overdraft fees related to the issue, but Coinbase has said they’ll ensure each customer is refunded in full for any erroneous charge. While Coinbase has certainly suffered from many technical glitches in the past few months, it seems this one may not have necessarily been caused by them. Of course this doesn’t mean that Coinbase users shouldn’t be upset. Regardless of who caused it no one should ever be erroneously charged (even if it’s temporary), especially if it led to users’ accounts being overdrawn or without funds. Coinbase needs to understand that they don’t operate in a bubble (no pun intended) – the crypto world is known for being rife with scams and fraudsters, and regardless of how legitimate the company is, people are going to assume the worst when their credit cards are charged without their consent. We’ve reached out to Visa for comment and will update this post when we hear back. Coinbase gave TechCrunch the below statement: “Based on an internal investigation into the issue, we determined the credit and debit card charges were a result of Visa reversing and recharging transactions. We are working closely with Visa to ensure affected customers are being refunded as soon as possible, as well as notifying all customers that made transaction during the past few weeks that they might be impacted. The issue stemmed from a recent decision by large banks and card issuers that card networks change the Merchant Category Code (MCC) for purchases of digital currency. Visa changed the MCC for digital currency purchases to a code that allows large banks and card issuers to charge consumers additional fees. Coinbase is actively working with major card networks to create a new MCC for digital currency purchases. For the benefit of consumers, we hope that this will not have additional “cash advance” fees as we believe that cards provide wider access to digital currency than just bank accounts. We take this very seriously and are taking all necessary steps to resolve this issue as soon as possible.” – Dan Romero, VP and GM of Coinbase Featured Image: jonrussell / Flickr","While Coinbase has had its fair share of technical issues the last few months, it seems the latest one may not be their fault.

Kate Conger,"In January, Uber settled claims by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it misled drivers about how much money they could make on the platform. But in a letter obtained by Gizmodo under the Freedom of Information Act, Uber argued that drivers were fundamentally at fault for earning less than the advertised rates because they were choosing not to drive enough. The FTC accused Uber of making “false, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims regarding driver earnings” on its website and in ads on Craigslist, in an investigation that began in spring 2015. The company had claimed, for example, that drivers in New York earned a median $90,000 annually and that drivers in San Francisco earned a median $74,000 per year. The FTC investigation found that less than ten percent of drivers in those cities earned the advertised rates, according to the agency’s complaint. In fact, New York drivers’ earnings were closer to $61,000 and San Francisco drivers’ earnings were closer to $53,000, the FTC found. The FTC also alleged that Uber was misleading about the financing options it could offer drivers. Uber ended up paying $20 million to the FTC to settle the matter, and the FTC said it would refund some of that money to drivers. In the defensive letter sent November 7th, 2016, about two months before the settlement was announced, the company’s lawyers disputed the FTC’s allegations by claiming that it was absolutely possible for drivers to make the advertised sums and that drivers who made less did so by choice. Uber requested that the letter be kept confidential, and it offers an inside look at the company’s perspectives. According to labor activists, the letter reveals Uber’s dismal view of its drivers. “On reflection we trust you will agree that no enforcement action is warranted,” wrote Andrew Smith and John Graubert, attorneys at Covington &amp; Burling who represented Uber during the FTC inquiry. “We see no basis for the central allegation that potential drivers were misled by earnings claims into taking on auto leases or purchases that were more expensive than originally advertised by Uber.” The letter argued that since Uber drivers are independent contractors rather than employees, the company couldn’t be held responsible for their earnings. If drivers weren’t earning the rates Uber had advertised, it was because the drivers weren’t working enough—not because Uber had misrepresented their earnings potential. “It bears emphasis that keeping prices low for riders requires a steady supply of drivers to meet their demand. Yet prohibiting Uber from advertising earnings that drivers can realistically expect to achieve—simply because those earnings exceed the earnings of drivers whose choices cause them to earn less—handicaps Uber in maintaining that supply,” Smith and Graubert wrote (emphasis theirs). Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a union that represents New York drivers and has sued Uber in an effort to get the company to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors, said the arguments laid out in the letter weren’t necessarily shocking—Uber has made similar public arguments in the past—but that they were still offensive to Uber’s drivers. “What’s really interesting is that the claim Uber usually makes is they’re independent contractors because they can be flexible. Here Uber’s claim is they are free to earn whatever they can. The only thing that separates a driver is the level of laziness,” Desai said. “When drivers face the consequences of the business model, they say it’s because the drivers are lazy or have wrong expectations.” Smith and Graubert argued that Uber shouldn’t face any financial penalties for misleading drivers because they hadn’t misled drivers at all. “It would make no sense to give additional compensation to those drivers who earned less, as there are myriad reasons all within the control of the driver why that may be the case. Many drivers intentionally limit their hours and acceptance of trips for personal reasons, and a further payment would be entirely a windfall,” they wrote. Uber is right that some drivers choose not to rely on the app for full-time work. The company advertises flexibility as one of the perks it offers drivers, and many drivers choose to work part-time with Uber for supplemental income. About 60 percent of U.S. drivers work fewer than ten hours per week, according to Uber. In cities with higher costs and more stringent regulation, drivers tend to work more—in New York City, for instance, 64 percent of drivers work more than 15 hours per week. Recent data released in the U.K. indicates that nearly a third of all drivers there are logged into the Uber app for more than 40 hours a week. Desai objected to the idea that compensation from the FTC investigation would be considered a windfall. “If Uber was required to compensate drivers who earned less than promised, the idea that Uber would call that compensation a windfall, that’s just outrageous. These are people who work long shifts and long weeks, with the expectation of pay the company has promised them,” she explained. In its complaint, the FTC objected that Uber claimed to offer “the best financing options available” for drivers who wanted to buy or lease a vehicle through the company’s Vehicle Solutions Program. Uber didn’t directly manage the program at the time and connected drivers to third-party lenders. The FTC argued that, since Uber didn’t control the rates and they were often subprime, the company shouldn’t claim they were the best available. (The rates were, in fact, bad, and the FTC found them to be worse than average for the industry.) But in their letter, Smith and Graubert said that Uber couldn’t be held accountable for using the word “best” in its marketing materials. “Leaving aside that descriptors such as ‘best’ are non-actionable puffery, Uber was justified in concluding that these were the best financing options available to the ‘[p]oor credit or no credit’ borrowers targeted by this ad,” they wrote. Again, Uber offloaded the blame onto its drivers. Discrepancy between advertised leasing rates and actual payments were due to drivers selecting more expensive cars or upgrades while not increasing their down payments, Smith and Graubert said. Uber brought some of its vehicle leasing programs in-house after problems with third-party lenders, but the program was ultimately deemed unsustainable and is being shut down. Even though the company ultimately settled for $20 million, Uber argued that the FTC had no reasonable formula for assessing damages. The agency had “identified no specific circumstance in which any individual has incurred specific, demonstrable injury,” Uber’s legal team argued, noting the FTC had not imposed financial penalties in other auto financing cases. The FTC countered that drivers who attempted to cancel vehicle lease agreements after not receiving the earnings promised by Uber suffered “significant monetary harm.” Uber’s $20 million settlement was approved by the FTC in a 2-1 vote. FTC Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen agreed with Uber’s lawyers in her dissenting opinion, writing that the settlement wasn’t tied to actual financial harm. After the settlement was announced in January, Uber launched a “180 Days of Change” initiative aimed at making amends to drivers. As part of that effort, Uber added tipping options to its app for the first time. Uber now has a policy of advertising median earnings and including disclosures that explain how it arrived at the advertised amount, a spokesperson confirmed. “We were pleased to have reached an agreement with the FTC earlier this year. Since then, we’ve made many improvements to the driver experience and will continue to focus on ensuring that Uber is the best option for anyone looking to earn money on their own schedule,” an Uber spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Covington &amp; Burling did not respond to a request for comment. Although the arguments in the letter may seem somewhat harsh on drivers, the claims made in the document aren’t entirely out of character for the company. In a video published by Bloomberg in February, then-CEO Travis Kalanick bickered with a driver who complained that rates had decreased, essentially arguing that the driver needed to work harder. “I lost $97,000 because of you,” the driver in the video told Kalanick. “I’m bankrupt because of you. Yes, yes, yes. You keep changing every day. You keep changing every day.” “Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!” Kalanick said. Desai said Uber’s attitude towards drivers was upsetting. “Any Uber driver that reads it would feel really betrayed by the company, that this is how they’re talked about behind their backs,” she said of the letter.","In January, Uber settled claims by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  that it misled drivers about how much money they could make on the platform.

Steve Dent,"The image above depicts a LiDAR relative elevation model (REM), showing current and previous channels carved out by the Sauk River in Washington State's Skagit and Snohomish counties. In the regular satellite image below, however, only the active, vegetation-free channels are clearly visible -- a striking display of what the technique can reveal. ""REMs are extremely useful in discerning where river channels have migrated in the past by vividly displaying fluvial features such as meander scars, terraces, and oxbow lakes,"" explains Washington State geologist Daniel E. Coe in a PDF. ""This type of information is very informative in channel migration and flood studies, as well as a host of other engineering and habitat assessments."" Carried on special aircraft, LiDAR produces visible-light laser beams. While much of it bounces off of trees and vegetation, enough make it through to the ground. By examining the raw data to see which beams travel the farthest, scientists can ""edit out"" trees, vegetation and man-made structures. That reveals hidden seismic faults, glacial landforms, landslides, lava flows and other features that are invisible on a regular satellite photo. Used in this way, the images also become a fantastic educational tool. Understanding things like drumlins, moraines and kettles can be pretty tough, but seeing a landform stripped to the bare ground brings the concepts to life. Suddenly, it becomes much easier to visualize how glaciers, lava flow (above), tsunamis and other natural phenomena have scarred (and will scar) our planet's surface over time. Considering that they're made by scientific instruments, the LiDAR images also happen to be beautiful (seriously, check them out ). You could even say that like other types of art, they strip away the surface to show things we may not want to see. A great example is the Toe Jam Hill fault scarp (part of the Seattle fault zone), first revealed by a LiDAR scan in the '90s. Subsequent trenching showed that it was the site of a single large earthquake 1,100 years ago, part of the great Seattle subduction quake at around 900 AD. That seismic event has become a part of the oral history and legend of Coast Salish Native Americans in the region, and is an ongoing concern to folks in Washington's Puget Sound area. LiDAR has become an important tool in confirming ancient stories, while helping us learn about future ones -- hopefully before they happen.","LiDAR is having a moment right now helping self-driving cars and robots not hit things, but don't forget about what else it can do.

Darrell Etherington,"Apple is adding another TV project to its upcoming slate: Are You Sleeping, a crime show based on America’s love affair with true crime podcasts (which are, ultimately, all Apple’s fault). The show has a lot of star power attached, as its executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and will star Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer (via THR ). The series is also created by Nichelle Tramble Spellman, a writer and producer for The Good Wife, and one half of the creative team behind HBO’s controversial Confederate series. Spellman will also write the series, and ‘Serial’ producer Sarah Koenig will consult to make sure the true crime podcast elements have that real, true crime feel. This marks the fourth series Apple is reportedly working on, including the Amazing Stories anthology series revival, the as-yet unnamed morning news TV show drama starring Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and the Ronald D. Moore-created space drama, all of which were picked up directly to series. Are You Sleeping is based on a novel written by Kathleen Barber, which was published last summer and focuses on what happens to a murder victim’s daughter when a hit podcast sheds new light on her father’s murder.

Timothy B. Lee,"Enlarge / Officials announcing the driverless shuttle program in Las Vegas January. reader comments 4 Wednesday was supposed to be the triumphant launch of a free, driverless shuttle in downtown Las Vegas. Designed by French company Navya, operated by another French company called Keolis, and sponsored by the city and American Automobile Association, the year-long pilot project was supposed to demonstrate the potential of slow-moving autonomous vehicles to change the transit industry. Instead, within hours, the project was greeted with the worst possible headline: "" Self-driving shuttle bus in crash on first day."" The headline, and lots of others like it, were technically accurate but a little misleading. Officials say the other vehicle—a semi truck that bumped into the shuttle while backing up—was at fault. And it was such a low-speed collision that no one was injured. The accident ""merely dented the plastic panels on the front of the shuttle,"" according to Jeff Zurschmeide of Digital Trends. So the implication of a lot of headlines—that the shuttle malfunctioned and caused a serious crash—is totally wrong. What's not clear is whether the shuttle could have done more to prevent the collision. Zurschmeide happened to be on the bus at the time the crash occurred, and explains just what happened: On the other side, the shuttle did exactly what it was programmed to do, and that’s a critical point. The self-driving program didn’t account for the vehicle in front unexpectedly backing up. We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked) and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss. The shuttle didn’t have those responses in its program. But Keolis, the company operating the self-driving shuttle, told reporter Pete Bigelow the opposite: 2. Shuttle is capable of reversing directions. It didn't in this case, because cars were stopped behind it. It was essentially boxed in, says Chris Barker, VP of new mobility at Keolis. — Pete Bigelow (@PeterCBigelow) November 9, 2017 The police report, due out next week, might help to clear things up. Either way, a clear lesson here is that self-driving vehicles need to be able to do more than just avoid causing accidents. They also need to be programmed to take the kind of common-sense steps human drivers would take to prevent accidents even when they're technically the fault of another driver. A 2015 study looking at the first 1.2 million miles of self-driving car data found the vehicles (which at the time mostly meant Google cars, though Audi and Delphi also had some cars on the road) seemed to actually get in accidents more often than human-driven cars. The accidents were mostly minor fender-benders, and all of them were the fault of the other vehicle. Even a rather dramatic accident that caused one of Uber's self-driving research vehicles to roll over earlier this year was caused by driver error in the other car. One possible explanation for those 2015 findings is that human drivers routinely fail to report minor accidents of this type. But another possibility is that these early self-driving cars drive in ways that human drivers can find confusing or unexpected—like slowing down at a stop light earlier than a human driver would. If self-driving cars are legally at fault in no accidents but still drive in a way that leads to other drivers hitting them at an elevated rate, that becomes a problem in its own right. The good news is that these kinds of accidents rarely if ever lead to human injuries. So while this is certainly something that Navya and other driverless vehicle companies should work on, it's not something to freak out about. It shouldn't be difficult to train a driverless car to notice an impending accident and take action—like backing up or moving forward—to prevent it. Someone at each driverless car company just needs to do the work.","The shuttle wasn't at fault, but it might have been able to avert the accident.",2017-11-10T15:40:33Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",The real lesson of that self-driving shuttle’s first-day accident,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/the-real-lesson-of-that-self-driving-shuttles-first-day-accident/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5P1-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,fault,1
Scott K. Johnson,"Enlarge / Map of shaking intensity around the epicenter of the September 8, 2017 magnitude 8.2 earthquake. reader comments 2 September 2017 saw a pair of weird earthquakes in Mexico. A magnitude 8.2 on September 8 just offshore the state of Chiapas was followed by a magnitude 7.1 on September 19this time much closer to Mexico City, causing considerable destruction there. While the two earthquakes were not connected, they were the same type of earthquake, which is unusual in the region. Mexicos western coast is a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific plate collides with and dives beneath the continent. That means that earthquakes along that boundary are typically the result of compressive force that squeezes rock to slide up the plane of the fault. Both September earthquakes were the result of stretching, however, which is almost as much of a head-scratcher as finding that part of your cars engine was pulled apart during a head-on crash. The explanation here is that as the oceanic plate disappears beneath the continent, it sinks downward into the mantle. First of all, the bending of the plate downward causes stretching, just as the skin over your elbow has to stretch. Second, the sinking plate pulls downward as it hangs from the part of the plate that is still up at the surfaceanother stretching force. Occasional earthquakes within this bending, sinking plate can reflect that stretching. A new study led by the University of Oregons Diego Malgar found something even weirder, though. Counter to what we thought possible, the fault seems to have broken clean through the entire tectonic plate. The tectonic plate boundary known as a subduction zone, where an oceanic plate dives down beneath another plate. The shaking recorded at seismometers can be used to pinpoint the location of an earthquake, but more detail can be extracted if you have things like GPS sensors in the area detecting ground movement. Seismologists can model the process backward from the measured surface movement and figure out how the fault moved underground. Thats what Malgar and his colleagues did here, producing estimates of the portion of the fault plane that slipped and how much it moved. The results show that a 150km-long section of the fault slipped three meters or so. Vertically, the portion of the fault that slipped starts at the top of the oceanic plateabout 15km below the Earths surfaceand continues all the way down to a depth of about 80km, which is roughly the bottom of the plate. The movement started at a spot about 46km down and spread outward along the plane of the fault from there. The equations for the physics of all this tell us that the fault movement should have been restricted to the upper half of the oceanic plate. This is partly because hotter temperatures at greater depths make the rock less brittle and partly because the inside of the bend in the plate should be feeling squeezing rather than stretching. Look around to make sure no ones watching, and then stare at your elbow. As you bend it, the skin stretches around the outside of your elbow, but relaxes on the inside as your forearm and bicep come together. Similarly, faults moving because theyre being pulled apart on the outside of the bend should be clamped together on the inside of the bend. So why did this earthquake break the rules? The researchers say a couple additional factors must be at play. First, seawater percolating down into the cracks that formed as the oceanic plate first bent to head beneath the continent could have cooled the rock and reacted with minerals, making the rock more brittle than it would be otherwise. And second, the sinking portion of the oceanic plate must be pulling downward pretty hard. Lets not pull on your wrist hard enough to stretch your elbow joint, but doing so would counteract the squeezing on the inside of your elbow as it bends. Explaining this little puzzle has practical implications. Not only do these earthquakes produce dangerous shaking, but if they occur close enough to the point on the seafloor where the two plates meet, they can push up seawater and create a tsunami wave. Understanding Mexicos hazards requires understanding what these oddball earthquakes are capable of. Since the plates there seem to break rules followed by plate boundaries elsewhere around the world, the local rules need to be better understood. Protecting people during earthquakes is all about minimizing surprises, so while they are always interesting, we want to limit the earthquakes that make you go ""Huh."" Nature Geoscience, 2018.

Rhett Jones,"World War III is going to be dumb. It only seems fitting that Bitcoin could get thrown into the mix of dumb reasons why it might get started. When South Korean cryptocurrency exchange YouBit was looted by hackers this week it seemed to be inevitable that North Korea would be at fault, and investigators believe that’s exactly what happened. Early on Tuesday, Youbit posted a message on its website informing customers that it will declare bankruptcy after 17 percent of its total assets were stolen by hackers. It indicated that customers would be able to withdraw their holdings at 75 percent of the value. Now, South Korean police and the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency have to figure out who’s responsible for this mess. According to the Wall Street Journal, the investigators have good reason to believe Kim Jong-un’s regime is the culprit. From the report: The people said there were telltale signs and historical evidence that North Korea was behind the Youbit attack. North Korean hackers in April targeted the same cryptocurrency exchange, operating under a different name, several of the people said. Yapian, the company that operates Youbit, suspended trading and filed for bankruptcy after Tuesday’s hack. The bitcoin heist follows similar suspected Pyongyang-directed offensives against other South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges—and an increasing number of attempts to steal from individual investors. The investigation is still in the early stages and analysis of the malware that was used is expected to take several weeks. North Korean hackers are gaining a lot of notoriety this week after the US government formally blamed them for carrying out the massive WannaCry ransomware attack that began in May. Experts tend to agree that North Korea’s hacking operations are financially motivated. In September, security researchers at FireEye published an analysis of North Korean operations against South Korea and found at least six major incidents in which it targeted cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin and other digital currencies offer anonymity that’s very beneficial to North Korea, as it’s under significant international sanctions, the country is open to going after old-fashioned fiat currency as well. FireEye’s report concludes: Consequently, it should be no surprise that cryptocurrencies, as an emerging asset class, are becoming a target of interest by a regime that operates in many ways like a criminal enterprise. While at present North Korea is somewhat distinctive in both their willingness to engage in financial crime and their possession of cyber espionage capabilities, the uniqueness of this combination will likely not last long-term as rising cyber powers may see similar potential. Cyber criminals may no longer be the only nefarious actors in this space. South Korea is a ripe target, not only because it’s North Korea’s long-time adversary, but because cryptocurrency is so wildly popular there. According to the market tracker Coinhills, the Korean Won is the third most exchanged currency for Bitcoin in the world. It trails behind the Japanese Yen and the US Dollar. The Wall Street Journal claims that North Korea has a cyber army comprised of 7,000 hackers, but it’s really difficult to say how anyone could be certain of that number. In addition to being one of the most impenetrable countries in the world for traditional espionage, it’s also one of the most protected nations for cyberespionage. Because it mostly uses a closed intranet and only has limited connection to the world wide web, even the best hackers from the US have a hard time getting in. In June, a NATO-sponsored think tank issued a statement that a state-sponsored malware attack could be considered an act of war and trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, meaning NATO members could engage in a military response. With reports that North Korea is testing anthrax loads on ICBMs in addition to its nuclear capabilities, and increasingly frequent joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, cryptocurrency’s just another dangerous ingredient in the hunt for a tipping point.",World War III is going to be dumb.

Matt Novak,"Erik Finman, a 19-year-old from Germany, got rich from cryptocurrencies after his grandmother gave him $1,245 to invest (1,000 Euro). He now has roughly $1.5 million in bitcoin, and he’s got some harsh words for the rest of us suckers. Finman says, “if you do not become a millionaire in the next 10 years, then it’s your own fault.” Finman made the comment during an interview with Business Insider. And while BI rightlys asks whether it’s possible for the average person to replicate his unusual success, the teen gives a rather bullshit answer. Business Insider: Technology also has its limits, and cryptocurrency today has a completely different status than a few years ago. Do you think you would be just as easy to win that bet today with your parents? Finman: If you are smart about cryptocurrency over the next 10 years, many people can build their fortunes even better than before. The area is still relatively small; the market capitalization is just over half a trillion dollars. I do not want to be misunderstood: This is, of course, a very high amount, but in comparison to other asset classes, it’s small. Therefore, I say if you do not become a millionaire in the next 10 years, then it’s your own fault.

Jennifer Taub,"Jennifer Taub is a professor at Vermont Law School. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) We both were raised with conservative politics and attended elite prep schools. We both are religious, with deep faith and a belief in God. We both attended Yale and in the mid-1980s. We both, aside from occasional binge drinking, worked hard in school and wrote for the student newspaper. We both studied at Cross Campus Library. We both managed to get into top-tier law schools. He Yale, me Harvard. Although we shared similarities, I do not recall ever meeting him at Yale. But there is one place where our similarities end, and that has made all of the difference in our lives. While Brett Kavanaugh appears to have moved fluidly from his beer-drinking prep school days into his beer-drinking college years, I was not as fortunate. In early fall of my freshman year at Yale, I was raped by an upperclassman. Until that moment, I had expected to maintain my virginity until I was married, or at least until I fell deeply in love. Some of the details are forever seared into my memory, like they were in Christine Blasey Ford's. Like Brett Kavanaugh, whose adolescent calendars have become an object of national attention, I have kept detailed records of my life. Instead of a calendar, I have a diary. In it, I kept sometimes daily recordings of my feelings, thoughts and what went on in my life from the age of around 14 until my early 40s. I now have several shelves of these mostly clothbound journals lined up in chronological order. Some are covered in floral prints, others with stripes, complex patterns and solids. Though on rare occasion, maybe once a year or so, I make an entry now, it seems that my daily Facebook posts are a substitute. This week, I did something very hard. The day before Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh went before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I climbed up on my swivel chair in my home office. Balancing precariously, I reached up to pull down a stack of diaries and searched until I found the one. I don't think I have ever reread this entry before. The date was in late September 1985. The early morning after. Some of those details set out in my scrawling script mirrored ones seared in my brain. My memory, after more than 30 years, was accurate. But there were additional details that I had not remembered. This included what and how much we were drinking that night. It also included how I got home. This was the hardest part to relive. After he was done, he told me, you need to leave. But he did not want to walk me home. It was very late, and by then the gates closest to my Old Campus dorm were locked. He knew that. So, he told me I should climb over the fence. Fortunately, I ran into some new friends (remember, I had just started as a freshman) as I left his dorm and they walked with me to the main gate where we could gain entrance. After this man raped me, I may have told a couple of friends. Maybe the ones who walked me home. I still am not sure. But I did not tell my family until several years later. I told them, I think, when I learned in my latter years at Yale that this guy had done the same thing to other freshmen (my memory here is vague, but if I recall correctly, he may have been reported to the school sexual assault grievance board). I felt incredibly guilty for not reporting him. I blamed myself. Again. I keep thinking this week about Congressman Eric Swalwell's response to President Donald Trump's criticism of Christine Blasey Ford. The Congressman tweeted : ""It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault. It's NOT her fault."" Reading that tweet, I began to cry. Because it was then that I really understood for the first time that what happened to me was not my fault. Watching Thursday's hearing reopened so much of that trauma. I managed to stay even-keeled, though, because I did what I know how to do best. I wrote. I live-tweeted and made 237 separate entries from gavel to gavel, covering the full hearing. What I believe now is that Brett Kavanaugh lied yesterday under oath. He lied about the drinking age in Maryland during his senior year in high school. He lied about the crass expressions on his yearbook page. And he also lied about having a perfect memory notwithstanding heavy drinking. I know the name of the boy who assaulted me. I looked him up the other day. He is working at a prominent law firm. It appears that he has had a successful career. I have no reason to disrupt his life, even though mine has been upended, even after all these years -- and my own successful career. But you had better believe if his name is put forward for a high-level government position, I will speak out. There is one caveat to this. If he sees this, and recognizes the story, it would be really healing for me, could change so much in my life, if he would reach out and just apologize.","We both were raised with conservative politics and attended elite prep schools.

Jon Fingas,"GM, not surprisingly, disagreed with the interpretation in a statement. It pointed to the San Francisco Police Department's collision report, which didn't lay blame but said that Nilsson merged into the Bolt's lane ""before it was safe to do so."" There have certainly been disputes over the involvement of self-driving technology in crashes -- just ask Tesla. Those incidents involved semi-autonomous cars where the human driver was always expected to share some responsibility, though, rather than fully autonomous vehicles where a human only serves as backup. And that makes cases like this problematic. If GM bears any responsibility at all, was it the fault of the developers (for not developing smart-enough collision avoidance), or the backup driver for not spotting the abrupt move?

NEIL GENZLINGER,"Meena Alexander, a poet and scholar whose writings reflected the search for identity that came with a peripatetic life, including time in India, Africa, Europe and the United States, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 67. Her husband, David Lelyveld, said the cause was endometrial serous cancer. In both prose and poetry Ms. Alexander, a longtime professor at Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center, explored themes of feminism, post-colonialism, dislocation, memory and more. She published numerous volumes of poetry, two novels and a memoir, Fault Lines (1993). Her writings were themselves the subject of a book, Passage to Manhattan: Critical Essays on Meena Alexander (2005). In their introduction, the editors of that volume, Lopamudra Basu and Cynthia Leenerts, credit Ms. Alexander with creating a new hybrid poetic form, which fuses the Western Romantic lyric tradition with non-Western ones of Bhakti and Sufi poetry, which came out of India. In one essay in the book, Jacqueline Wigfall describes Fault Lines as a production of sound, color and texture that exceeds the function of autobiography, social history and political memoir. Fault Lines, which was reissued in 2003, was indeed far more lyrical and exploratory than the average autobiography, a search for identity through the elusiveness of memory.","Born in India and later a resident of Africa, Europe and the United States, she explored themes of feminism, post-colonialism and the search for identity.",2018-11-26T23:53:31Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Meena Alexander, Poet Who Wrote of Dislocation, Dies at 67",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/obituaries/meena-alexander-dead.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/obituaries/27ALEXANDER-OBIT1/27alexander-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fault,1
Emily Price,"A canceled flight almost always means taking a later one, which can lead to missing your connection, shortening your vacation, and sometimes even missing the event you were taking the flight to attend in the first place. A lot of times, flights are canceled due to things like the weather, which is outside an airline’s control. In those cases, you’re pretty much SOL and have to accept what, if anything, the airline offers you. In most cases, that’s simply rebooking you on another flight. However, when the cancelation is the airline’s fault, you’re often entitled to a bit more. Here’s what you can expect from each U.S. airline, thanks to the folks at Flyertalk. American Airlines If your American Airlines flight gets canceled, they’ll rebook you on the next available flight, regardless of whether or not the cancellation was the airline’s fault. As a person who ran into this issue with American earlier this year due to a weather delay, that next flight might not actually be anytime soon. I was rebooked on a flight 24 hours later thanks to a storm, and had to handle my own hotel etc. for the time I was stranded. Read my account of that for some more tips. I’m spending this week in Scotland, a journey that started for me at 5am Tuesday and thanks to… Read more Read If your flight is canceled due to something within American’s control, and boarding to your final destination doesn’t start before 11:59pm, then AA will offer you hotel accommodations. If you’d rather not take the rebooked flight you can also get a refund. Alaska Beyond rebooking, Alaska will offer accommodations for anyone stranded more than 100 miles from home for a non-weather-related reason. Delta Delta automatically rebooks you on the next flight when yours is canceled and makes it easy for you to get a new boarding pass from its self-serve kiosks and apps. Even better you can also print hotel and meal vouchers from the machines if you’re entitled to them, allowing you to skip the angry mob at the desk at the gate. And yes, if your flight was delayed I assure you there will, in fact, be an angry mob and you don’t want to be anywhere near them. JetBlue JetBlue actually offers one of the best deals for passengers who have their flights canceled. In addition to booking you on the next flight, the airline will give you a $50 flight voucher for flights that were canceled within four hours of their scheduled departure, and a $100 voucher for flights canceled after their scheduled departure, provided that cancelation was something JetBlue could control. United United will automatically rebook you on the next available flight just like everyone else. If you hate that flight, you have the option to select any other flight you’d like that departs within 24 hours of your original ticket. You can also ask for a refund, or ask for a ticket from another airport. For instance, if your San Francisco flight gets canceled, you can opt to fly out of nearby Oakland instead. Just like everyone else, they’re only going to offer hotel accommodations when your overnight stay isn’t the airline’s fault. If you are entitled to a hotel and they run out of vouchers, they’ll also give you an approval letter so you can book your own and get paid back later on. Dear Lifehacker, I'll be traveling a lot for the holidays, but I've had some pretty bad… Read more Read Having a flight canceled, no matter the reason, sucks. In general, if you run into issues while you’re already traveling I always recommend contacting the airline via phone rather than queuing up at the desk. The phone reps can do most everything the desk agents can, and there are more of them. And like everything in life, be patient and be nice. People are much more likely to help you get to your destination quickly and comfortably when you’re being nice to them than if you’re causing a scene.","A canceled flight almost always means taking a later one, which can lead to missing your connection, shortening your vacation, and sometimes even missing the event you were taking the flight to attend in the first place.

Trump is still ticked off that Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.

New Mexico bus-truck crash At least seven people were killed yesterday when a tractor-trailer blew a tire, crossed into oncoming traffic and smashed head-on into a Greyhound bus. The horrific wreck occurred on Interstate 40 in northwestern New Mexico. After the crash, some of the 49 bus passengers tried to climb out windows as bystanders walked through debris carrying ladders. The truck driver had non-life-threatening injuries. The death toll is expected to rise, a police spokesman said. Did NBC try to kill one of the stories that led to Harvey Weinstein's downfall? An ex-NBC News producer makes that explosive claim in a New York Times interview. Rich McHugh, who worked for months on journalist Ronan Farrow's expose on the disgraced Hollywood mogul, said a call from ""the highest levels of NBC"" came that stopped work on the story. NBC News denies this, saying Farrow's story simply wasn't ready at the time. Farrow eventually took his work to The New Yorker, which last October published a more detailed version than NBC News says the journalist had wanted to air on its network. 4. Australia and the Catholic Church The Catholic Church in Australia, like in other countries, has been rocked by child sex abuse scandals. A government inquiry into abuse in Australia's religious institutions led to a list of almost 200 recommendations, including about 20 targeting the Catholic Church. Its leaders said they'll follow ""98%"" of the recommendations -- but won't compel priests to report child abuse revealed in confessions. That decision is a big stumbling block for the church as it tries to regain the public's trust. Catholic leaders also balked at the suggestion they end mandatory celibacy for priests. New rule: Kids should stay in rear-facing car seats until they hit the height or weight limit for the seat. This new guidance, part of updated recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, changes what we've all been previously told about young children and car seats: that kids should ride in rear-facing seats until at least age 2. That's being tweaked because car seat manufacturers are making seats that let kids stay rear-facing until they reach 40 pounds. Using the right car seat reduces the risk of death or injury by more than 70%. All kids younger than 13 years should be in a vehicle's back seat. Love to eat ice cream made with liquid nitrogen ?

SEE ALSO: Jennifer Lopez speaks out about her own sexual harassment #MeToo experience Oh the video is MUCH worse. His misogyny runs deep. To even repeat that story of his ‘friend’ who wouldn’t hire the ‘pretty woman’ as if it’s the MOVEMENT’s fault and not the sexist man’s fault is all you need to hear. It’s deplorable. But SO many folks misunderstand this work. — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) April 7, 2018 The condensed and edited clip shows bits of a talk the motivational speaker gave in San Jose on March 15 during which he argued with an audience member named Nanine McCool over his characterization of the #MeToo movement. According to Mercury News, a video of Robbins's full comments was removed from Facebook last month after his team asked for it be pulled. At the time of publishing this piece, another version of the video was available to view on YouTube. ""I'm not mocking the #MeToo movement, I'm mocking victimhood,"" he told McCool and the audience, according the longer video from the event. ""If you use the #MeToo movement to try to get significance and certainty by attacking and destroying someone else...all you've done is basically use a drug called significance to make yourself feel good."" McCool responded: ""I hear you mischaracterizing the #MeToo movement. Certainly there are people who are using it for their own personal devices, but there's also a significant number of people who are using it not to relive whatever may have happened to them, but to make it safe for the young women...And I think you do the whole movement a disservice by characterizing it the way you have."" Robbins said he didn't want to be misinterpreted, and invited McCool to join him at the center of the room. He then asked her to hold out her fist. When she did, he put his hand on her fist and pushed her backwards. ""So you're telling me the the harder I push, the more you're gonna comply, and I'm going to be safe,"" Robbins said as he pushed McCool backwards. After a little back and forth banter between Robbins and the woman, he stopped and said, ""When you push someone else, it doesn't make you more safe. It just makes them angry."" During the 11-minute exchange, he also brought up Hollywood. That's where, Robbins said, pressure from the #MeToo movement is ""the most intense,"" adding ""it breaks my heart for women and not for men."" He then shared the story of a ""very powerful man"" who told Robbins he'd passed over a highly qualified woman for a job because she was ""very attractive"" and therefore ""too big a risk."" (You can hear Robbins' comments in full on YouTube, here.) McCool has since given interviews about her exchange with Robbins. As she told The Good Men Project, she wishes he'd ""take the time to listen to women who don't agree with you because that's how you learn, that's how you grow."" She went on to note that while she doesn't believe he owes her an apology, she'd like to see him reassess his views of #MeToo. But on Saturday, in response to the condensed edit from Now This News, Burke jumped in to call Robbins out on Twitter, noting that his ""people"" had contacted her to ""do damage control"" and to provide ""context.""

Smith to Lifehacker","Salty Waitress is The Takeout ’s advice column from a real-life waitress that will teach you how not to behave like a garbage person while dining out—and maybe in real life. Dear Salty Waitress, Do I have any recourse if my food order is taking an unreasonably long time? Can I just cancel our order, pay for our drinks, and leave? This is something I would only consider if there was a time restriction on my end and waiting for the food was putting me in danger of being late. Thanks, Places To Be Dear Places To Be, There is nothing that grinds my gears more than being rushed during a dinner out. You know, when the appetizer arrives two seconds after you ordered (did they have the plate just sitting back there?), then the entree shows up 5 minutes later. But the opposite is even worse. You’re hangry, you’re on a schedule, and your food is totally AWOL. I’m going to assume you’re talking about a long delay at a sit-down restaurant, not a fast food or counter-order place. While your food won’t come out instantly, the lag shouldn’t be so long that you’re noticing the delay and busting out a book of crosswords. Of course it depends on the exact restaurant, but if you’ve been sitting for 30 to 45 minutes and haven’t heard an update-apology from your server, I’d say it’s fair to leave money on the table for the drinks you had and walk out. But I would suggest you first try to flag down your server, stop by the host station, or talk to a manager before that; it will let the restaurant know why you’re leaving, and hopefully the staff will be apologetic and offer to comp your drinks or offer you a discount on a future meal. Best-case scenario, they can take the criticism and use it to improve. I see how it might make you feel guilty if you find out your meal has already been “fired” by the server (meaning the kitchen is already cooking it). If you leave, the food might go to waste. But it’s not really your fault for not eating the food—look, I’m no ethicist, just a waitress who answers questions on the internet—it’s the restaurant’s fault for taking longer to serve your food than a normal person could reasonably expect. Delays happen, though: The kitchen gets backed up, or there was a large party whose order came in right before yours, or your meal got overcooked and the kitchen has to start it over. But a server should update you, being honest that there’s going to be a delay. If that happens, you can ask up front how much time it’s going to take, especially if you mention you have somewhere else to be in whatever amount of time. Giving them a time frame—“I have to leave in 20 minutes”—would hopefully encourage them to be straight with you about whether your food will be done by then. Oh, and if you sit down and a server doesn’t acknowledge you within five to 10 minutes, just go. I doubt the service is going to get any better from there. Got a question about dining out etiquette?

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Los Angeles locals are blaming navigation app Waze for hellish driving through a dangerously steep street in the area. But despite complaints, Waze isn’t changing its service just to accommodate drivers who can’t handle a freakin’ hill. Baxter Street is not the city’s steepest street, but the Echo Park stretch has reportedly seen an uptick in accidents, and residents want Waze to remove it from its service altogether. The street has a 30-percent grade, which makes it steeper than San Francisco’s Lombard Street, CBS reports. “They said they couldn’t do that because it involves changing the algorithm of the app in a weird way,” Baxter resident Robbie Adams told the Los Angeles Times. Adams and other residents sent a letter to Waze asking it to either remove the street as a suggested route or list it as hazardous when it’s raining. Waze spokeswoman Julie Mossler told Gizmodo in a statement that the service is “the best place to check for conditions you may consider hazardous,” and that the company allows users to inform each other of dangerous conditions, such as flooding or steepness. “We service several streets in San Francisco with a similar gradient to Baxter Street without complaint,” Mossler added. “Not only that, we’re expected to by local drivers. For this reason and others, it’s not possible for us to anticipate drivers’ reaction to a specific road and make a rule based on gradient, especially on public roads.” Mossler also stated that Waze maps accurately indicate conditions of the road, both in respect to the laws governing the area or through temporary issues, listing potholes and flooding as examples. “While Angelenos have questioned the gradient of the hill on Baxter Street, the city has placed a public road there, which means it should be considered usable within Waze to permit residents to navigate home, to assist in emergency response, and more,” she said. “Should local government choose to make a change, we will of course update our maps.” Waze’s statement doesn’t attribute its unwillingness to remove the steep street from its service to tricky algorithms. Rather, the company seemingly believes that, in comparison to similarly sloping streets, Baxter isn’t the worst one it sends users on. And San Franciscans don’t seem to be complaining.","Los Angeles locals are blaming navigation app Waze for hellish driving through a dangerously steep street in the area.

Sam Rutherford,"Ive been using Allo since the day it was released. At first, it was simple curiosity. Googles got another messaging app, so how is it going to screw this one up? But even with its flaws, the more I used it, I grew to appreciate its slick interface, baked in gif engine, and its general ease of use. But today, March 12th, Allo is getting killed off, and its almost entirely Googles fault.
Originally billed as a better texting app based on a streamlined sign up process cribbed from WhatsApp by only needing your phone number to get started, Allo was just one half of a Googles 2016 messaging push that was designed to work in tandem alongside its new video calling app Duo.
But now, nearly two and a half years after they were released, Allo is going away for good, while Duo lives on, and its a damn shame. So what the hell happened?
The first was a simple lack of support. For some reason, not long after its debut, Google decided to stop bundling Allo with Android, which meant people had to seek the app out for themselves, instead of having it pre-installed on many devices, like Duo was, and continues to be. This caused adoption to stagnate, preventing the number of Allo users from ever hitting a critical mass.
Another issue was the awkward messages people got any time you tried to text someone that didnt have Allo installed. Your message would still go through, but because your text was being bounced off a server somewhere and then redirected to your recipients device via regular SMS, messages appeared as if they came from a random number, instead of someone you might actually know.
You would also get a prompt saying this message was relayed using Allo, before being invited to download the app and try it for yourself. To some, this might seem like a good way to help increase adoption, but for most people (including many of my friends who just couldnt be bothered), it felt a lot more like spam.
And like a lot of other texting apps, Allo also suffered from annoying things like your account being tied to a single device and phone number, despite one of Googles other messaging apps Hangouts only requiring you to have a Google/Gmail account, something pretty much everyone has nowadays. (Yes, Google added desktop support for Allo in Chrome, but that came later, when Allo was already on a downward trajectory.)
But heres the real problem: I wouldnt really care about Allo dying if it had a worthy replacement. But it doesnt. Sure, Google has ported many of Allos best features to Messages (which, confusingly, used to be called Android Messages) including the ability to ask the Google Assistant questions in the middle of a chat, use smart replies, see preview snippets of web links, send GIFs using a built-in search tool, and more.
Unfortunately, because many of Messages core texting features rely on RCS, a messaging protocol that requires support from carriers in addition to app developers like Google or Samsung, the basic experience of texting can be wildy different and inconsistent depending on what device theyre using, and what cellular service provider they have.
RCS is a protocol thats meant to supercede basic SMS, and give people things they expect from modern messaging software like the ability to see read receipts, share high-quality photos and video, and more, all over data networks instead relying on a cell signal.
Right now, RCS isnt supported by Apple (iMessage), AT&amp;T, and Verizon, though Verizon has said its planning on adding RCS support sometime in early 2019. And for the carriers who do support RCS such as Sprint (which was the first carrier to do so) and T-Mobile, T-Mobiles implementation of RCS isnt based on Googles Universal Profile, which has led to fragmentation and trouble getting RCS features to work properly across different devices.
While my favorite Allo sticker lives on in Messages, with Allo gone, the saddest little penguin will forever be even more depressed.
Image: Google
Meanwhile, during Allos slow decline, Google removed Hangouts ability to send SMS, meaning that its not really a suitable replacement for Allo either. And even with Google reassuring people that Hangouts isnt going away, theres still a lot of confusion among users who still fear that their favorite group chat app will meet the same fate as Allo down the line.
In a world where Allo didnt get kicked to the curb, neglected, and then left for dead, Allo should have been the successor to Hangouts. It has better features (many of which Hangouts still hasnt gotten), a slicker UI and design, and would have made a better partner for Duo, which only really offers one thing (videocalling), and still relies on help from Messages or Hangouts to deliver a complete messaging experience.
And unlike Apple, since Google already has a long history of bringing its most important apps to both Android and iOS, it could have created a true alternative to iMessage, which remains one of the biggest factors preventing people from switching away from iPhones.
Sadly, Google doesnt seem interested in doing that, instead offering up Chat (which is based on the RCS Universal Profile) as a better alternative. But for all its promise, Chat and RCS still hasnt fully delivered, which makes the death of Allo seem even more tragic.","I’ve been using Allo since the day it was released.

Morgan Sung,"Aly Raisman is tired of victim-shaming over clothing choices. The U.S. Olympic gymnast tweeted on Sunday that ""Leotards r not the problem,"" calling out critics of the gymnastics uniform for victim-shaming and ""implying survivors should feel it's their fault."" SEE ALSO: Aly Raisman sues U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for how they dealt with Nassar abuse Raisman, an outspoken activist for survivors of sexual assault, also called out enablers of abuse against children and young people, saying, ""The real problem is the pedophiles out there and the adults who enable them."" I was recently asked if gymnasts should continue wearing leotards. Leotards r not the problem. The problem is the many pedophiles out there &amp; the adults who enable them. By saying clothing is part of the issue, u are victim shaming/implying survivors should feel it's their fault. — Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) March 25, 2018 Raisman has fiercely campaigned and continually spoken out against against systemic sexual abuse in the sport of gymnastics. The two-time Olympian testified against former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar, who abused Raisman and hundreds of other female gymnasts under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for sexual assault. After the sentencing, Raisman released a list of demands for the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics, calling for transparency during its investigation into how the abuse happened. On Sunday, she encouraged her Twitter followers to learn more about victim-shaming, posting links to Flip the Switch, an organization dedicated to preventing sexual abuse in sports. For those of you who do not understand what victim shaming is and why it's so dangerous I urge you to educate yourself. Adults can work together to prevent child sexual abuse. Please #FlipTheSwitch with Darkness to Light https://t.co/cZb5qZkY5U — Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) March 25, 2018 As one Twitter user pointed out, gymnasts wear leotards for safety, not just for aesthetic reasons during performance. Wearing leotards in gymnastics is essential to safety &amp; injury prevention; Tight fitting clothes allow instructors to gauge the alignment of athletes' hips &amp; spine w/ neck and knees. Misalignment = catastrophic injury (ex. ACL tear) — a doctor to be. (@tobemd99) March 25, 2018 Others on social media argued that some gymnasts may be more comfortable in less revealing clothing. One reminded them that although athletes should have a choice in attire, many people were missing the point of Raisman's tweet: Children should be able to train in a safe space where they're protected against abuse and encouraged to speak out against sexual predators. Choice for personal comfort is great! As long as the options are safe for performance. But its not what stops abuse. Creating a place where athletes feel safe to speak up, are treated like people and where adults don’t tolerate any bad behavior w/ kids is what stops it. — Abra Bacon (@abra_bacon) March 26, 2018 Sadly, it's not the first time Raisman has dealt with victim-shaming for clothing choices — she even battled it from her own teammates. In November, Raisman tweeted that women ""are allowed to feel sexy and comfortable in their own skin."" Fellow USA Gymnastics teammate Gabby Douglas received some heavy backlash when her response to Raisman appeared to victim-shame women for their clothing choices. In a now-deleted tweet, she said, ""It is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd."" shocks me that I’m seeing this but it doesn’t surprise me... honestly seeing this brings me to tears bc as your teammate I expected more from you &amp; to support her. I support you Aly 💕 &amp; all the other women out there! STAY STRONG pic.twitter.com/CccTzhyPcb — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) November 17, 2017 Olympic gold medalist and fellow Team USA gymnast Simone Biles posted a screenshot of the tweet, commenting that she wasn't surprised by her teammate's remarks. ""Honestly seeing this brings me to tears bc as your teammate I expected more from you &amp; to support her,"" Biles wrote. Douglas later apologized for her comment, and wrote that ""regardless of what you wear, abuse under any circumstance is never acceptable."" Since then, Raisman has been a staunch advocate for women wearing what they want — in February, she posed for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition with the words ""women do not have to be modest to be respected"" written down her body, and ""survivor"" written across her chest. ""The female body is beautiful and we should all be proud of who we are, inside and out,"" she wrote in a note.","Aly Raisman is tired of victim-shaming over clothing choices.

Keep in mind, I’m not a therapist or any other kind of health professional—just a guy who’s willing to tell it like it is. I simply want to give you the tools you need to enrich your damn lives. If for whatever reason you don’t like my advice, feel free to file a formal complaint here. Now then, let’s get on with it. Hey Patrick, My boyfriend and I live together now after being together for a pretty short period of time (1 year). Before we made it official, he would talk to other girls and I would talk to other guys; after we decided to make it official, we stopped the shenanigans. After a while, I started feeling paranoid—as if he was talking to someone else—and felt like he wasn’t giving me attention, so I started texting this other guy. My boyfriend found out and laid his hands on me. He apologized the same day, and we said we will never cheat or hurt each other again. Then he ended up texting other girls and I caught him twice. He let go of my mistake, but I can’t let go of his because he did it twice. It wasn’t just a mistake, it was a choice. We kept fighting about this and I decided I wanted to move out, which made him lay his hands on me again, but then he apologized right after. Should I forgive him? Is this all my fault? Should I continue to move out? I’m not sure what to do. I still want to be with him, but at the same time I don’t. Hurt Again Hey Hurt Again: You’ve got this all wrong. You think this is about not trusting each other and it’s not. You need to leave, Hurt Again. Not because he ignored you, or because he’s talking to other girls, but because he’s laid his hands on you—twice. That’s not okay! Ever! Apologies or not, it’s done, it’s over, it’s time to move on. Look, you probably shouldn’t have been texting another guy behind your boyfriend’s back. If you felt paranoid or that you weren’t getting enough attention, you should have talked to him about it. You could have told him how you felt instead of flirting with someone else, which undoubtedly made your whole situation worse. Still, what you did doesn’t give him the right to go behind your back too, but it was the wrong move for sure. Is this your fault? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s not about that, Hurt. Even if it was all your fault, that doesn’t justify his reaction of getting physical with you. Not even a little bit. Imagine what he might do to you in the future if you really messed up. Nobody likes to think about ending a relationship, but sometimes you have to face the hard truth:… Read more Read So, should you continue to move out? Hell yes! If you have somewhere safe to go, pack your bags and hit the bricks (and don’t tell him where you’re going). You might still have some feelings for this guy, but trust me, you don’t want to be with him. Check out the book Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft while you’re at it. It will help you better understand what’s going on in your hothead ex’s head, help you protect yourself, and hopefully help you avoid this kind of crap in the future. Lastly, should you forgive him? Sure, you can if you want. But here’s the thing, Hurt: you don’t need to stay with him to forgive him. They aren’t the same thing. Forgive the guy and move on with your life. Go find yourself someone that will give you attention without giving you bruises. Or better yet, take some time to recover and sort your life out. That’s it for this week, but I still have plenty of blunt, honest advice bottled up inside. Tell me, what’s troubling you? Is work getting you down? Are you having problems with a friend or a coworker? Is your love life going through a rough patch? Do you just feel lost in life, like you have no direction? Tell me, and maybe I can help.

Andrew Krok,"Slow your roll when the thaw hits. RJ Sangosti/Getty Images As a new Detroit resident, I'm used to (condescending) questions about how safe the city is. While I have never felt unsafe here, now I have to watch out for killer potholes, apparently. A 22-year-old man has died after a vehicle he was riding in contacted a pothole, the Detroit Free Press reports. His vehicle hit a pothole on the city's west side, which caused the vehicle to lose control and crash into an electrical pole. The vehicle's driver is listed as being in ""temporary serious condition,"" while the passenger ended up succumbing to his injuries after being taken to the emergency room. While you might be inclined to make an ""even the potholes in Detroit are dangerous"" joke, potholes in general are hardly a laughing matter. Potholes are created when water gets under the asphalt in liquid form. When it freezes, it expands, pushing the road surface upward. When it thaws again, there's now a hole under the asphalt, and the weight of road traffic pushes that asphalt back down into that hole. When your vehicle contacts a pothole, the rapid movement of the vehicle can cause all sorts of problems. Potholes can damage suspension components, bend wheels, and even slice tire sidewalls open. When any of that happens, there's a chance the vehicle could lose control, which could cause a problem like the ones seen here. My personal car hit a pothole a couple weeks ago, and it was enough to bend the brake dust shield into the rotor, causing a gnarly noise and briefly affecting handling. Some cities allow you to recoup the cost of fixing pothole-related vehicle damage, but the best thing you can do is keep an eye on the road surface and attempt to avoid some of the gnarlier ones by changing lanes. If your normal commute is littered with severe potholes, it might be best to consider alternate routes, as well. Above all, drive slowly and exercise caution.","Well, the ensuing crash is what killed him, but it's the pothole's fault.",2018-02-20T17:48:20Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Pothole kills man in Detroit - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/pothole-kills-man-in-detroit/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/J1dsVumrqODiFbH7E1NT19LH3MA=/2018/02/20/e35f9feb-cdb7-48a4-a009-01819a04bfea/potholes-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,fault,1
Rhett Jones,"A number of Facebook users discovered over the past few days that the social media company had collected a creepy level of information about their calls and texts. Many users claimed they never gave Facebook permission to gather this information. However, in response to the uproar, Facebook says the “feature” is opt-in only. Basically, the company’s saying it’s your own fault if you don’t like it. To understand what Facebook is defending requires a lot of explanation—and that’s the heart of the problem. In the last week, Facebook has been under fire as the public discovered how reckless the company has been with their data. Watchdogs have sounded this alarm for years, but Facebook has always made a tweak here or there when it gets called out—as if its previous sins would be automatically absolved. But as the company faces growing scrutiny over its data practices, a number of users began digging around in their archives. Spurred by a tweet from developer Dylan McKay, social media users complained this weekend that Facebook had records of their contacts, as well as call and text metadata. Facebook has let users export their data since 2010. Ars Technica spoke with numerous users who felt blindsided, and the publication’s staff did their own tests, finding SMS data and contacts data from an Android device they used in 2015 and 2106. From the report: Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn’t give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook’s mobile apps—because of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook’s installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. But Android applications could bypass this change if they were written to earlier versions of the API, so Facebook API could continue to gain access to call and SMS data by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Google deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API in October 2017—the point at which the latest call metadata in Facebook users’ data was found. Apple iOS has never allowed silent access to call data. To put all of that into plain English, Google’s Android OS has its own privacy issues, and coupled with Facebook’s apps, it could’ve made it possible for Facebook users to opt-into the company’s surveillance program without realizing it. Facebook responded on Sunday with a “Fact Check” blog post claiming that any assertion that “Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission” is false. As the unsigned blog reads, in part: Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only. It’s true that Facebook, as far as we know, has always made SMS metadata collection an opt-in part of the setup process. But take a look at the difference between today’s opt-in screen and one users saw back in 2016. Today, Messenger gives you the options to “turn on” metadata collection, opt-out, or learn more. But before it faced criticism in 2016, the only options were “OK” or “settings.” So, it’s likely many people gave Facebook permission at one time without realizing it. This is an excellent illustration of the web that Facebook weaves. In the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook allowed the personal data of 50 million users to get into the hands of a third-party app, in part because its policies gave up the data of users’ friends based on permission from a single user. When that third party transferred the information to a political data analysis firm, which was a violation of Facebook’s policies, Facebook did nothing when it found out in 2015 but issue a stern warning and make Cambridge Analytica sign a document promising that the data was deleted. Now, Facebook says that it no longer shotguns that data out to developers based on a single permission, so apparently everyone should feel okay going forward. Explaining what’s going on shouldn’t be so difficult or time-consuming. Facebook claims this is all designed to make things more convenient for you. But it doesn’t have to constantly track your text messages and the duration of your calls just to capture your contacts list. That could be a one-time thing that you do when you set the service up, and Facebook could periodically ask if you want to do another import a month later. However, Facebook has turned a convenience into an excuse for grabbing more information that it can combine with everything else to make a perfect psychological and social profile of you, the user. And it has demonstrated that it can’t be trusted to keep that data to itself. Mark Zuckerburg told CNN last week that he was open to more regulations being applied to his platform. “You know, I think in general technology is an increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more what’s the right regulation rather than ‘yes’ or ‘no’ should it be regulated,” he said. This is foolish because government regulations will undoubtedly get screwed up and lead to unintended consequences. But if Mark insists, the government could create strict terms of service requirements for what a company explains to a user before they sign up. Those regulations could require clear examples of how data might be used and even require users to complete a simple quiz to show they understand before finalizing the app’s setup. Of course, that kind of burdensome activity wouldn’t be necessary if Facebook would just make everything clear on its own. Unfortunately, with congressional hearings scheduled, and government agency investigations underway, it may be too late.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi spoke briefly of what’s been going in the world of Uber’s self-driving cars in light of the fatal accident in Tempe, Arizona in March. At Uber Elevate today in Los Angeles, Khosrowshahi said Uber will bring back its self-driving cars “within the next few months, I don’t know.” To be fair, Khosrowshahi didn’t sound the 100 percent confident in his answer. That’s just to say I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes Uber longer than a few months. He went on to say that when Uber does bring its cars back on the road, “it’s going to be in as safe of a way as possible.” Uber pulled its self-driving cars off the roads following the March fatal crash. Later that month, Uber decided not to reapply for a self-driving car testing permit in California. Uber’s previous permit expired March 31. If Uber wants to continue its tests in California, it will need to apply for a new permit, as well as “address any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona,” DMV Deputy Director/Chief Counsel Brian Soublet wrote in a letter to Uber in March. Uber may also need to set up a meeting with the DMV. In response to a question about how the investigation is going with the National Transportation Safety Board, Khosrowshahi said it’s ongoing. Unlike Tesla being quite vocal about the fatal crash involving its Autopilot system, and damaging its relationship with the NTSB, Khosrowshahi said, “We will not be tweeting ahead of their findings.” But that doesn’t mean there won’t be leaks. Earlier this week, The Information reported Uber’s software was at fault. Specifically, it was reportedly the fault of the software that determines which objects to ignore and which to attend to. Following the report, Uber said it’s actively cooperating with the NTSB and can’t comment on the specifics of the accident. “In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles program, and we have brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement at the time. “Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.”","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi spoke briefly of what’s been going in the world of Uber’s self-driving cars in light of the fatal accident in Tempe, Arizona in March.

Kristina Panos,"What if you didn’t have to risk your life to disconnect the power during a catastrophic storm? That’s a question many people in Houston were asking themselves as they watched water from Hurricane Harvey and other storms surge through the streets, swell in the gutters, and flood their homes. Among these Houstonians were engineering students [Jon] and [Cyrus Jyan]. They watched as homeowners fought to safely disconnect their homes from the power grid and said, it shouldn’t have to be this way. They designed the Flood Fault Circuit Interrupter to monitor target areas and disconnect the power automatically when a credible threat is detected. The FFCI is built on top of existing protection schemes like GFCIs and Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters. It isn’t meant to replace them, but instead tie them together and turn them off based on input from float switches. As floodwaters rise, an EEPROM does a lookup and compare to decide if the threat is enough to shut it down. If so, an alarm signal to a shunt trip breaker can either throw the whole system to OFF, or else switch over to an alternate power source. The system is built around a standard security panel and keypad interface that supports 12 V alarm output. We particularly like the float switch enclosures that allow water to enter while keeping out debris.","What if you didn’t have to risk your life to disconnect the power during a catastrophic storm?

Ryan spoke at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times David N. Bossie, Fox News : “It’s time for Republicans in the U.S. House to take decisive action without delay on the issues of immigration reform and government funding that will prevent a government shutdown Friday night.” Mr. Bossie, the president of Citizens United and a former deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump’s campaign, has a very prescriptive view of how to avert a government shutdown: “Republicans must move forward without” Democrats. Mr. Bossie suggests approving a two-year spending bill to avert confronting this situation again, and he would like to see the immigration bill known as the Securing America’s Future Act, introduced by Representative Bob Goodlatte, attached to the legislation.

Bonnie Burton,"After 17 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) finally brings us the kind of superhero film we've never seen before -- one where the hero doesn't constantly wisecrack. Black Panther is the focus of Honest Trailers -- a webseries on the Screen Junkies YouTube channel that delivers brutally honest but funny reviews of past movie trailers. This time around Honest Trailers highlights what works, and what doesn't work, in the hit superhero movie Black Panther. In the video posted Tuesday, Honest Trailers points out that the lead actor Chadwick Boseman who plays T'Challa, also known as the Black Panther, has portrayed almost every black icon on film. This includes the first African-American Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to play in Major League Baseball Jackie Robinson and legendary singer James Brown. The parody trailer also points out that what makes Black Panther different than Thor, Star-Lord, Deadpool, Iron Man, Spider-Man and all the other superheroes on the big screen, is that this character refuses to quip. Black Panther proves you don't have to act like a jackass to save the world. The harshest criticisms include the film's over-usage of the fictional powerful metal vibranium found in Black Panther's native homeland of Wakanda that was used to make his own suit as well as Captain America's shield. Honest Trailer also mentions that it's the women of Black Panther who do all the work, paying special homage to Okoye, Shuri, Nakia and Angela Bassett.","Black Panther is the best superhero who never quips, says Honest Trailers.",2018-05-16T10:44:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Honest Trailers has trouble finding fault with Black Panther - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/honest-trailers-has-trouble-finding-fault-with-marvel-black-panther/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/XGe0bZKP9mEJtJW-_SS5_eEwm-U=/670x503/2016/09/28/1af0a97f-a23d-4562-ae8e-7494130e6bc9/black-panther-2.jpg,,Cnet.com,fault,1
Elizabeth Yuko,"Every time a flight takes off on time, it seems like a little miracle. Despite airlines’ set schedules, there’s a lot working against getting to your destination on time. First, there’s the weather: it’s either too hot, too cold, too windy, too rainy or too foggy. Then there are the mechanical issues to contend with (recently I had a flight delayed for an hour and a half because the co-pilot’s seat belt wouldn’t click). And sometimes it’s not even the airline’s fault, but rather an unruly passenger – like the man on one of my flights who, upon hearing that the pilot and co-pilot were both women – demanded to be let off the plane because he felt unsafe. As a frequent flyer, at this stage, I just assume that every flight will be delayed —that way, if it actually takes off on time, it seems like a bonus. Flight delays are, of course, annoying. No one likes hanging out at the airport, so I use that extra time to get stuff done that I’d normally put off. It’s perfect, when you think about it: You don’t want to be at the airport, but you have no choice; and you don’t want to do those tasks, but you have no choice. Ergo, you should use your flight delay to knock out a few items on your to-do list because you literally have nothing better to do. Here’s how to make the most of your flight delay. Plan ahead Yes, I know it sounds very glass-half-empty, but when you’re getting ready for your trip—printing tickets, gathering passports, transferring your liquids into three-ounce containers—work under the assumption that your flight will be cancelled, and come up with a few tasks you can do at the airport. Lost or mishandled luggage, broken equipment, or overbooked flights are some examples of situations … Read more Read Think about what you’ve been putting off, and make sure you have what you need. For example, if you need to call the cable company to dispute a bill, you’re going to need your account number, so take a photo of your bill so you have all the information you need handy on your phone. Is there a book you’ve wanted to read but haven’t had time? Flight delays are the perfect opportunity. If you’re a teacher who needs to grade papers, either pop the assignments in your bag or scan them so they’re on your computer (if you don’t already have electronic versions). Get to work As soon as you find out that your flight has been delayed, take a look around the airport lounge and claim your spot. Ideally you’ll want somewhere with a chair and an outlet. If you’re planning on working on a laptop, try and find a workstation that operates as a standing desk, or with high stools, minimizing the chances of having a small, noisy child next to you. Once you’re settled in, get to work. You may not reach the coveted Inbox Zero, but you can definitely send off a few annoying email responses you’ve been ignoring. This is usually the first thing I do because really, there’s never a time when I don’t have a backlog and it feels good clearing the unread messages out, one by one. If the airport doesn’t have free Wi-Fi or you can’t face opening your computer, there’s plenty you can get done on your phone. Aside from calling credit card, cable and electric companies, you can also make a dentist appointment or check the balance on that Target gift card you got for your birthday and can’t remember if you’ve used yet. Next time you go to book a flight you might want to look at the early-morning options first.… Read more Read Flight delays are also the perfect time for making phone calls to friends or family members that you can never seem to fit into your schedule. Not only do you have the time, but you also have the perfect excuse to get off the phone: “Oh! I have to go—they just announced that my flight’s about to board.” (Even if that’s not the case, there will be so many overhead announcements, the person on the phone won’t know the difference.) Keep in mind If you’re lucky enough to be at an airport with free Wi-Fi, make sure you practice good internet hygiene like you would in any other public Wi-Fi situation. That means doing things like checking signs in the airport announcing the free Wi-Fi to make sure you’re using their official network and not a similar-sounding identity thief’s trap, and avoiding doing your online banking. You definitely don’t want to start your trip off with a delayed flight and a call from Chase saying they’ve spotted some suspicious activity on your credit card.","Every time a flight takes off on time, it seems like a little miracle.

Wes Kao,"September 28, 2018 7 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Have you ever shared bad news with coworkers, employees or partners? As much as we don't want to shoot the messenger, sometimes we associate negative feelings with the person who tells us bad news. Related: 4 Mistakes to Avoid When You Have to Deliver Bad News Work is hard enough as is. You don't need a negative halo effect associated with you, especially if a situation was out of your control. For example, maybe you and a partner organization submitted a proposal and were waiting to hear back from a Fortune 1000 client. The client tells you that another company out-bid you with a lower quote. Now, you have to tell your partner that they have to re-submit a bid. You feel terrible because they put a lot of work into the bid. Maybe you could have communicated more clearly upfront and set better expectations... So you're feeling a little guilty, too. This happened to one of my clients, and he made the mistake of sounding overly negative in the email to his colleague. We fixed it, but it's a valuable lesson for anyone who's had to share negative news at work (which is all of us at some point). If you have to deliver bad news that wasn't your fault, here are tips to keep in mind: 1. Avoid negative words, especially ""however."" Small changes in word choice can impact your audience's perception -- for the better or for the worse. According to George Lakoff, a professor in cognitive science and linguistics at University of California, Berkeley, you should use language that evokes imagery and strengthens your point. You should especially be careful about using negative words that could lead your audience to catastrophize. Andrew Newberg and Mark Robert Waldman, the co-authors of Words Can Change Your Brain, said, ""Angry words send alarm messages through the brain, and they partially shut down the logic-and-reasoning centers located in the frontal lobes."" ""However"" was great for high school essays, but there's rarely a need for it in your toolkit now. It makes everything sound heavier and more dramatic than it needs to be. The goal here is to minimize drama. If you really need to, use ""but."" Related: Here's the Research-Backed Best Way to Deliver Bad News 2. Avoid giving too many details -- save some information if they ask. When you feel guilty, you want to explain everything. You secretly hope that by explaining, the person will understand and absolve you of guilt. Don't give in to the temptation to explain everything in excruciating detail. First, it's selfish: you're only doing it to make yourself feel better. Second, it complicates the actual message. Recipients won't know when the facts end and your own narrative begins. Third, you owe it to them to be direct. Respect your recipients enough to give them the key information they need to make a smart decision. If they have additional questions, they'll ask. This opens up dialogue instead of overwhelming them with information. 3. Don't accidentally accept blame. I'm all for accepting blame -- if you're responsible for what happened. There's a difference between empathizing (""I acknowledge this is frustrating"") and accepting blame (""I should have done X and Y, but I didn't at the time.""). As the messenger, there's no point in inviting your audience's wrath for no reason. When you scan your email, ask yourself, ""Might they think I'm accidentally accepting blame because of my phrasing and word choice?"" Related: 6 Ways to Break Bad News to Your Team An upset colleague or boss might project anger onto you as a way to cope with negative feelings. The danger of accidentally accepting blame is it legitimizes your audience's negative perceptions, even if they were inaccurate and misplaced to begin with. You're essentially inviting them to project onto you. This erodes trust in your working relationships and tarnishes your credibility. If it happens too many times, it could stall your career because you're associated with failed projects. 4. Get to your point quickly. ""We only give a couple of instructions to people when they go to work for us: One is to think like an owner. And the second is to tell us bad news immediately -- because good news takes care of itself. We can take bad news, but we don't like it late,"" Warren Buffett once told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Contrary to what you might think, adding too much preface makes things sound worse. The tension builds and the person is imaging the worst thing that could possibly happen. Cognitive psychologist Dr. Albert Ellis describes why we mentally escalate scenarios to the most extreme and negative conclusion. When your audience finally hears the bad news, they might think, ""Oh, that wasn't so bad."" But, even though that's a pleasant surprise, relatively speaking, your colleagues just spent several minutes letting their imaginations wander. That's cruel of you to do. Preface as little as you can, so you can share the meat of what they need to know. Related: A Manager's Guide to Delivering Bad News (Infographic) 5. Remind the person of their own agency. In a famous speech at USC Business School in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger said, ""If people tell you what you really don't want to hear -- what's unpleasant -- there's an almost automatic reaction of antipathy."" When people get bad news, they'll want to blame someone for their frustration -- don't let that someone be you. Our natural reaction is to shoot the messenger, but you can combat this by reminding your audience that they were involved in the situation, too. Chances are, they had a role to play in what happened. Reminding people of their agency can be useful here. Behavioral scientist and bestselling author Nir Eyal wrote about how the freedom to choose encourages people to behave more generously. Applied here, you want to remind your colleague that you were both aware of the risks -- and jointly decided to proceed anyway. This will put your colleague in a more collaborative and understanding mood. For example: You both knew the result might not work. You're on the same team and working toward the same goal. You're going out of your way to help them because you'd rather work with them than someone else. Of course, put a soft wrapper around your message. Don't just say, ""We both knew this might not work. Don't act so surprised now."" A sarcastic remark sounds like you're blaming them, which isn't what you want to do. Instead, try saying the following: ""Last month, we talked about how we had a one in 10 chance of winning this bid. We decided to pursue it given the high payoff. At this point, if we choose to continue in the process, we could submit another proposal. I know it takes a lot of effort on your part, so it might or might not be worth the time. I can discuss with my team, too. Thanks for working on this together. Let's circle back mid next week -- let me know what you prefer to do."" Accepting responsibility is important. If there's any doubt that you are responsible, you should proactively address that. These tips are for times when you're simply a messenger -- and just as surprised by the news as your recipient is. In situations like these, use the tips above to protect yourself and help your recipient understand the situation with minimal drama.","People tend to shoot the message, but there are ways to avoid the negative halo of bad news.",2018-09-28T15:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How to Deliver Bad News When It's Not Your Fault,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/319842,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20180926182943-GettyImages-675872935.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,fault,1
Bud Robertson,"The new Canada’s Food Guide doesn’t take into account people’s history or their ability to afford the food they are expected to eat, says a noted food researcher.
What Canadians have historically put on their tables does matter, Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, who is based out of Dalhousie University, said following a presentation at Manitoba Beef Producers’ 40th annual general meeting in Brandon Thursday morning.
Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, a food researcher from Dalhousie University, speaks during the Manitoba Beef Producers' 40th annual general meeting in Brandon on Thursday. (Bud Robertson/The Brandon Sun)
""At the end of the day, it is food. Food is about culture,"" he said. ""I think it matters to a lot of Canadians.
""Think about recipes, traditions, Grandma’s recipes,"" he said. ""It matters to a lot of people.
""If Grandma’s recipe of a meat pie, all of a sudden we’ll have to put chickpeas in there?
""It becomes an attack, an affront on people’s culinary cultures.""
The cost of food is also a big issue for many, and the Food Guide doesn’t take that into account, Charlebois said.
Food security is a big issue in many parts of Canada, he said, adding a new hunger report shows more than 800,000 Canadians regularly rely on food banks.
Canada’s Food Guide, which first came out in 1942, was updated and released to the public in January.
Half a dinner plate under Canada’s Food Guide consists of vegetables and fruits, Charlebois said, adding the cost of lettuce has grown 40 per cent year over year, while tomatoes are up 20 per cent.
""So how do you cope with that?""
The updated version of the Food Guide contains an ""ideal plate"" image suggesting a healthy diet consists of 50 per cent fruits and vegetables, 25 per cent proteins (such as meat and eggs) and 25 per cent grains.
Charlebois said he doesn’t consider the Food Guide to be flawed. Rather, he said, it’s the process that put it together that was flawed.
During his presentation to producers gathered at the Victoria Inn, Charlebois said 11 of the 13 people involved in putting together the new Food Guide were nutritionists and dieticians.
""These people are highly competent, but their view on food is very, very narrow,"" he said in his presentation.
Charlebois said he would have included economists, sociologists and historians in the consultation process ""to better understand, or better appreciate all our traditions ... and the impact on families from a cost perspective.""
The new Food Guide ""is clearly a departure from what we’ve seen in the past,"" he told the audience.
Charlebois also spoke to beef producers about the industry’s inability to be heard over the voices of those who promote veganism.
""We’ve been struggling to get our message out for years and years,"" he said. ""And for many years, you’ve been told to go on social media and send the message and advocate as much as possible, but it’s not working.""
In 2014, the retail price of meat skyrocketed 25 per cent in three months. Before that, no one really checked the price of meat, he said.
""For the first time in history, people started to look at that price,"" he said, and people began to look at beef as a premium product.
""That when veganism showed up.""
A survey on meat consumption showed nearly half of Canadians, 48.5 per cent, eat meat daily and 82.5 per cent have no dietary preferences.
These so-called flexitarians are the market people are after, he said.
""But the plant-based narrative is overpowering a lot of discussions we’re having right now.""
Meanwhile, 6.4 million Canadians are considering reducing their meat consumption or eliminating it altogether, Charlebois said.
Another 32.2 per cent said they are willing to reduce their meat consumption in the next six months.
While partnering with other commodities, such as pork and chicken, to get their message out is not natural for producers, it’s something they need to consider in order to grow their business, he said.

SEE ALSO: Harvey Weinstein reportedly hired private investigators to discredit accusers One of the most damning parts of the piece is that Bob Weinstein, who previously claimed to be unaware of his brother's history of sexual misconduct, paid off two women from his personal bank account as if to absolve Miramax of any involvement. And as many people have said since this first started, Bob Weinstein was complicit and any interview he gave stating otherwise was the same garbage lies his brother spewed. https://t.co/TE8PkRha7P — Carrie 🎃 🍁 (@VampVixyn) November 21, 2017 Bob Weinstein confirmed to the New Yorker that he made the payments, but that he wasn't fully aware of the circumstances; he thought his brother was having affairs, consensual ones, but a Miramax executive said that isn't believable; the harassment allegations were reported to the company. Where the recent deluge of public accusations have finally shattered Weinstein's professional persona, the years of accusations behind closed doors seemingly did nothing to curtail his behavior. On the contrary, paying off his victims made it possible for Weinstein to continue his awful behavior. Weinstein's lawyers repeated his current statement: He never engaged in any non-consensual sexual behavior and that any such accusations are untrue ( over 100 women have accused Weinstein of unwanted sexual advances). “Repeat offenders are able to operate under a cloak of silence with the help of nondisclosure agreements,” NYU law professor Samuel Estreicher told the New Yorker. Weinstein's former assistant Zelda Perkins, one of the women paid by Bob Weinstein, said she spent years trying to curtail his advances and attempt to rectify his behavior. ""Ultimately, the reason Harvey Weinstein followed the route he did is because he was allowed to, and that’s our fault. As a culture, that’s our fault."" ""What I want to talk about at this point is not what Harvey did,” she said in the article. “It’s more about the system that protected him and that enabled him, because that’s the only thing that we can change. Money and power enabled, and the legal system has enabled. Ultimately, the reason Harvey Weinstein followed the route he did is because he was allowed to, and that’s our fault. As a culture, that’s our fault.” Many of Weinstein's employees and victims were subject to lifetime nondisclosure agreements that prohibited them from literally ever speaking about what they had witnessed and worked with. “People should not be made to live with that,"" said former employee Irwin Reiter. ""He’s created so many victims that have been burdened for so many years, and it’s just not right.” The New Yorker has previous reported on the complex and convoluted network Weinstein had in place to protect his sexual misconduct while racking up accolades and reputability for Miramax in the film industry. Many who were part of this have issued statements or resigned since Weinstein's public exposure.

"Craig Fehrman, Craig Fehrman","The NBA has been bad for two years, and it’s Kevin Durant’s fault. If the Warriors beat the Cavaliers on Friday night, they’ll clinch a second straight title, compiling a playoff record of 32–6 along the way. This team has erased two seasons of potentially exciting basketball as thoroughly as Ted Williams’ military service erased several years of his prime. The Warriors aren’t the ’96 Bulls. The Warriors were the ’96 Bulls—a 70-plus-win team with a superstar and a championship-level supporting cast. Then they added the second-best player in the league. It’s as if David Robinson decided to join Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in Chicago and coast his way to some mid-’90s titles. Despite the NBA’s current monotony—and despite the clarity about the one guy who made it so—most sports writers and serious fans have declined to say much about it. I think there are three reasons why. The first is simple. ESPN needs to keep viewers invested in a sport it pays $1.4 billion per year to broadcast, and that same dynamic applies to other media outlets. Consider the stories ESPN.com ran in the buildup to the Finals. Two days before Game 1, we were lectured : “Why Round 4 of Warriors-Cavs Deserves Our Appreciation.” One day before, we were listicled : “Here are 25 reasons Cavs-Warriors is a rivalry unlike any we’ve seen in sports.” When the media tired of talking about Durant’s messy defection—Draymond Green’s sales pitch, Russell Westbrook’s cupcakes —they moved on. But the Warriors’ season-ending dominance is a story no one can escape. While pro-player sports writing has created a better sports world and better sports writing, it shouldn’t ignore the fan experience. The second reason is NBA Twitter, the boosterish and perpetually logged-on community that helps shape the sport’s narratives. The hoops writers and junkies who reside there consume and celebrate the NBA in its League Pass entirety, and at their best, they produce a delightful mess of GIFs and memes and exuberant in-jokes. But NBA Twitter rarely criticizes the league’s top-heavy predictability or the preposterous foul baiting of its stars. These might be the sport’s most nationalized fans, but they exhibit a small-town parochialism, where everything is wonderful so long as it’s happening in their league. There’s one last reason Durant has gotten a pass, and it’s the most important but also the most subtle. In the past decade, sports writers (especially younger, online sports writers) have become more pro-labor—meaning more pro-player. I’m one of those younger, online sports writers, and I agree with this necessary shift. If you want to induce some eye-rolls, don’t queue up film of a Durant iso—read some old sports columns, like this Sports Illustrated back-pager by Rick Reilly, written during the NBA’s 1998 lockout. Reilly sarcastically parallels the demands of NBA players with the demands of workers at a Peterbilt truck factory who are also on strike. “NBA players want the minimum salary for veterans raised to around $1 million,” he writes. “The Peterbilt workers have outrageous demands, too. They’re asking for … the chance to retire at a livable wage before 65.” Reilly loves cracking jokes about players like Patrick Ewing and Kenny Anderson. Yet he has little to say regarding the wealth or greed of NBA owners. Today, this tendency has flipped. The sports writer’s instinct is to criticize the owner and defend the star, and that makes sense for all kinds of reasons, not least of which is that we tune in to the NBA Finals to watch not Dan Gilbert but LeBron James. But we also tune in to watch a good game. While pro-player sports writing has created a better sports world and better sports writing, it shouldn’t ignore the fan experience. But too often it does. The reaction to Durant jumping to the Warriors is the best example of this in recent memory. Thanks to an explosion of broadcast money from ESPN et al., the NBA saw its salary cap spike in the summer of 2016. That gave everyone extra cap room, even the Warriors, and they spent wisely, adding Durant to a 73-win team that had just eliminated him from the playoffs. It was instantly clear that the Warriors were a supersquad without precedent, a team with four of the league’s best 15 players (and two of its best five). The reaction, especially among young sports writers, wasn’t to lament this decision. It was to justify it. Durant was, according to Deadspin, “an employee making an employment decision.” A few months later, after the new-look Warriors had waltzed to the finals, SB Nation was still sounding this theme: “Most of us inherently know that people should have a right to determine where and for whom they work.” That’s true, as far as it goes. But think about this from the perspective of the fan. The recent Western Conference finals was the first competitive series Golden State has faced in two full years. Why was it competitive? Because the Rockets were talented and played hard, sure. But far more it was because the Warriors struggled—because Andre Iguodala got hurt, because Kevin Durant loafed after rebounds, because the Warriors never quite clicked. As basketball fans, we should hope that each of the league’s stars does what LeBron’s been doing in these playoffs: grow, flourish, transcend. But if the Warriors’ stars did that in every game, they’d beat even the Rockets by 40 points. So instead we had to root for some of the game’s most gorgeous players to keep playing sludgy basketball. There’s been a ton of chatter this postseason about LeBron’s legacy, about the rise of the 76ers, about the wizardry of Brad Stevens. But each of these stories always felt like a distraction—the joke the dentist tells you as he’s warming up the drill. The Warriors were going to win, unless they managed to beat themselves. This inevitability is what Kevin Durant chose, and that choice has drained the drama from an entire professional sport. Sports writers (and sports fans) can admit this while still being broadly pro-player. They can also condemn Durant’s decision without calling for the abolishment of free agency or the burning of the nearest Thunder jersey. So far, at least, most of them haven’t. But here’s a free angle for any hack trapped in tonight’s press box, trying to find a new way to describe Golden State’s stale superiority: The Warriors used to be fun to hate. Now they’re boring to watch.",We now have to root for the game’s most gorgeous players to keep playing sludgy basketball.,2018-06-08T14:51:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",It’s KD’s Fault,https://slate.com/culture/2018/06/kevin-durant-signing-with-the-warriors-made-the-nba-boring-why-dont-we-talk-about-it.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/cd28d96e-ca74-47bb-9895-fb72b56559cc.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,fault,1
Nicholas Pearce,"baranozdemir/Getty Images Having a great boss is a potentially life-changing gift. On the other hand, many of us know firsthand that having a bad boss can cause a lot of drama, headaches, and stress. While it’s easy to love the great bosses and flee the bad ones, there’s one kind of boss that’s much less straightforward to navigate: the boss who doesn’t advocate for you. You might not even know that you have one. Most advocacy happens behind the scenes and in conversations to which you yourself are not privy. As the adage goes, 80% of what’s said about you is said when you’re not in the room. Non-advocating bosses can refuse to bring up your name favorably in the promotion conversation. They can withhold critical developmental feedback and stunt your growth. And they can even overtly undermine you and attempt to sabotage your long-term career prospects. When you discover you have a boss who isn’t advocating for you, the knee-jerk reaction is often to advocate for yourself and become your own PR machine. That’s often a mistake. Too much blatant self-promotion in the workplace can backfire and signal that you are narcissistic, egotistical, and ultimately unconcerned about the greater good. You ideally want others tooting your horn for you. Before taking action to close this critical advocacy gap, you’ll want to understand why your boss isn’t advocating for you. First, consider the possibility that you are actually the problem. In other words, you may not have a bad boss — you just might not have developed enough or demonstrated the skill necessary for the boss to advocate for your advancement yet. Observe the characteristics and accomplishments of the rising stars around you to see where you might improve. Proactively solicit the gift of your boss’s feedback and ask what it would take to earn their advocacy. And perhaps consider getting a coach to help you make the improvements necessary to earn your manager’s advocacy. Seeking and applying your boss’s advice could potentially move them to advocate on your behalf. You and Your Team Series Office Politics Make Your Enemies Your Allies Brian Uzzi and Shannon Dunlap Why We Fight at Work Annie McKee How to Manage a Toxic Employee Amy Gallo When I first started teaching at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, I met with the dean to find out her expectations. I wanted to understand her perspective on what excellence looks like in my role so I could be intentional about my professional growth. Having these conversations early on with your boss can guide your goal-setting and position you to advance. Without this type of feedback, you might be falling short of your boss’s expectations for promotability and not even know it. Assuming your performance is strong — and ideally, exceeds expectations — if your boss isn’t advocating for you, the issue likely lies with your boss. While it may not necessarily be your fault, it is your problem. You owe it to yourself to find a workable strategy to advance your career. Here are three steps you can take to navigate the advocacy gap. Release your boss from your unmet expectations for advocacy. As unfair and frustrating as it seems when your boss doesn’t advocate for you, it’s in your best interest not to take it personally. There are countless possible reasons why your boss isn’t advocating for you. Your boss might be insecure and see you as competition. Your boss may suffer from deep unconscious biases that lead to unfair evaluations of your performance and suitability for bigger roles. Perhaps your boss is trying to advocate for you but lacks the social capital and credibility to successfully advocate for anyone. Or, perhaps your boss may simply not want to be your champion. Whatever the reason may be for the advocacy gap, forcing, manipulating, or shaming someone into being your advocate won’t work. Let go of whatever anger or hurt you have developed because of your boss. Find another advocate. Ideally, you would have a direct supervisor going to bat for you from the get-go, but your boss isn’t the only person in the organization who can advocate for you. There are other influencers who can give you the boost you need. To navigate your advocacy gap, you want to identify and win the support of executive sponsors. The ideal sponsor is a powerful, high-ranking ally within your organization who will bring up your name with the right people at the right time so that you gain access to opportunity. Your sponsor is your champion in the organization — and sometimes even beyond it. Many people confuse mentors with sponsors. In short, mentors counsel you, sponsors accelerate you. You don’t want to be over-mentored and under-sponsored. This is particularly important for women and people of color for whom, research shows, hard work alone is usually not enough to get noticed. Sponsors typically choose their protégés. So, you’ll want to strategically increase your visibility to gain their interest instead of explicitly soliciting their advocacy. For one, produce consistently excellent work. Raise your hand to participate in organization-wide task forces and cross-functional teams. By adding value to important strategic projects for the organization, you’ll build your skillset, add to your experiences, and interact with new people. That way you can develop a reputation for being a reliable, growth-minded leader who is focused on the organization’s objectives. Make it clear that it’s in the organization’s best interest to retain and advance you. Build your network inside and outside of the organization. The plain truth is that the best leaders have what I call 360° advocacy — that is, advocacy from those above them, those beside them (peers), and their direct reports. Don’t underestimate the value of your peers and your direct reports in bringing your name up and speaking well of you. Being good to people and doing the right thing by people — especially those who may lack formal power in your organization — can cause them to want to advocate on your behalf. Finally, being an engaged citizen beyond your workplace in your industry or your community can help as well. You never know who is connected to whom and how. Sometimes, generating positive buzz beyond the workplace can prompt your organization to take stock of how great an asset you are. We all need champions who are willing to advocate for us when we cannot speak for ourselves. And when your boss doesn’t do it, it can be downright challenging. But it doesn’t have to stop your progress and career advancement. You could be just one project, one committee, or one conversation away from getting noticed for who you are, what you do, and your potential to achieve even more.","It may not be your fault, but it is your problem.",2018-06-15T16:00:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",What to Do When Your Boss Won’t Advocate for You,https://hbr.org/2018/06/what-to-do-when-your-boss-wont-advocate-for-you,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/06/jun18-15-157674121-baranozdemir.jpg,,Hbr.org,fault,1

The quake also prompted tsunami alerts along the West Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii, but those were canceled after data showed damaging waves were not expected. Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale.

Carlos Gil,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Facebook is not going away, and any marketing professional or small business owner would be foolish to stop using it in spite of the fact that marketing on Facebook today is not easy. Related: Facebook Might Be Shrinking Your Audience but There's Lots You Can Do About It In fact, for as much industry chatter that Facebook’s decision to tweak the algorithm to favor people and not brand pages has created, a recent poll in the Social Media Masterminds Group on Facebook indicated that marketers don’t foresee another emerging social network rivaling Facebook anytime in the near future. As seen in the above video, regardless if you’re a content creator or a Fortune 500 company, marketing on Facebook shouldn’t be centered on how you can reach the masses but rather how you can identify and retain the attention of your most engaged fans, as only 1 percent or less of page fans are currently seeing your content. While marketing on Facebook is more complex than posting status updates and memes, the first step is to understand how the algorithm works. To be candid, Facebook is a business and isn’t in business to help you grow yours for free. With over 2 billion daily active users, it’s safe to proclaim that Facebook is one of the best mediums to advertise online and it knows it. Despite Facebook being free to use, ad budget is required in order to get the maximum return on Facebook as a brand. Related: With Entrepreneurs Freaking Out After Facebook's Drastic Newsfeed Change, Here Are 4 Things You Can Do Right Now to Survive Besides paying to play, other key factors go into Facebook determining the type of content that it shares, such as posts that are written with a call-to-action to click through to a website are penalized, as are posts that contain “engagement bait” (e.g., ""like this post,"" ""comment below,"" ""share this post,"" etc.). However, if you can strategically find a way to get your brand front and center in the newsfeed while keeping users on the platform, you’ve cracked the code. Below are five strategies to implement right away to help you hack the Facebook algorithm. 1. Comment farming Think of the Facebook algorithm similar to word of mouth marketing. Facebook will feature what the algorithm thinks is relevant to you based on what others in your network are speaking about digitally. Posts that contain a significant number of likes, comments and shares will typically get higher visibility in the newsfeed for at least 24 hours provided that the post continues to get engagement. Tip: The next time you post on Facebook, ask a question or make a statement that will elicit comments from your network or page followers. Then, reply to each comment that is made on your post to trick Facebook into thinking it has higher organic engagement. Related: Why You Need to Stop Worrying About Facebook 'Likes' in 2018 2. Short posts The next tactic isn’t so much to trick the Facebook algorithm as it is to trick the eyes of fellow Facebook users to see your post in the newsfeed while scrolling through. If you want your post copy to stand out, post a text-only status update at 85 characters or less. By doing so, your text font will appear to be larger than the standard Facebook font size. However, your post has to be text-only so use this tactic whenever you post a one-sentence comment or question. 3. Facebook ads Advertising on Facebook doesn’t need to be expensive. In fact, I recommend that Facebook page managers ""boost"" their content with as little as $10 daily or $300 per month. By tapping into Facebook ads, even with a small budget, you can use the custom audiences feature to ensure that your content is seen by the right audience. Remember, while a lot of brands and businesses are aiming for the masses blindly, you should be strategic with getting your content in front of your target buyers and most engaged fans. Related: How to Make Money With Facebook Ads 4. Groups While Facebook groups have not yet been adopted widely by brands, industry groups like Social Media Masterminds and others that bring together influencers, creators and marketers alike have become the new wave of sharing content and insights off of the traditional newsfeed that’s dominated by brand pages and profiles. Facebook has yet to cut off the organic reach that groups provide, which is why every brand should be finding a way to create a group of its most engaged fans. 5. Messenger As is the case with groups, Facebook Messenger is an untapped resource for brands to organically build tribes with their most engaged fans and creators. Provided that you have a community manager who's paying attention to who’s actively commenting on your Facebook page, start forming conversations directly in Messenger with your “super fans.” As described in the video above, how much would 20 to 30 engaged fans mean to your business? With Messenger, you can still keep your loyal fans engaged, albeit through 1:1 conversation. The next time that you have a campaign or promotion running, let your fans in on the launch before the masses. Better yet, use this newfound 1:1 access to get your fans to do the marketing for you altogether.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Customers were refused phone repairs in breach of Australian law An Australian court has fined Apple A$9m (£5m;$6.5m) for refusing to fix iPhones and iPads that had been serviced by third parties. The nation's consumer watchdog took the tech giant to court last year following complaints from users about faulty devices. Apple admitted that it misled 275 people about their rights to remedies such as repairs and replacements. The Federal Court of Australia found those actions breached consumer law. The investigation followed complaints about Apple's so-called ""error 53"". The fault rendered iPhones and iPads inoperable, after users downloaded a software update. But when customers sought repairs, Apple denied some of them assistance because their devices had previously been fixed by a third party, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. In many cases, Apple refused remedies even when the third-party repair was for something like a cracked screen and not related to the fault, the ACCC said. ""The court declared the mere fact that an iPhone or iPad had been repaired by someone other than Apple did not, and could not, result in the consumer guarantees ceasing to apply,"" Commissioner Sarah Court said on Tuesday. The watchdog said Apple had contacted about 5,000 customers to compensate them for the error.

Nathan Ingraham,"Chandra also clearly walks users through how their cameras could be compromised without it being Nest's fault:
For context, even though Nest was not breached, customers may be vulnerable because their email addresses and passwords are freely available on the internet. If a website is compromised, it's possible for someone to gain access to user email addresses and passwords, and from there, gain access to any accounts that use the same login credentials. For example, if you use your Nest password for a shopping site account and the site is breached, your login information could end up in the wrong hands. From there, people with access to your credentials can cause the kind of issues we've seen recently.
His message also suggests setting up family accounts, rather than sharing an email and password with multiple members of the family who might need access to Nest. Similarly, he also says users should keep their routers secure and up-to-date and to keep eyes peeled for phishing email schemes.
These are all reasonable tips, and one all users should take heed of, but the fact that it was necessary for Nest to send this email in the first place suggests the company let this story get away from it to some extent.

Mark Kaufman,"At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999. The 7.6-magnitude quake collapsed entire apartment buildings on top of unsuspecting people, killing at least 20,000. Known as the Izmit quake, in 2011 scientists said they found convincing evidence of a precursor to the tragic temblor: A series of often small, unnoticeable quakes — known as foreshocks — occurred in the same area for around 44 minutes before the major quake struck. This, the scientists argued, was evidence of something unique happening before the massive earthquake. And if this foreshock activity could somehow be reliably detected, perhaps we could predict future earthquakes with plenty of notice for people in any given area — an ability that has completely eluded scientists. SEE ALSO: Can Your iPhone Double as a Cutting-Edge Earthquake Detector? But seven years later, earthquake researchers have put a damper on this optimism. In a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience, scientists found that these series of small quakes were not a unique sign of a looming earthquake, but instead a domino-effect of tremors that happened to have ultimately triggered a far bigger one. ""They’re knocking down the idea that something happens before earthquakes,"" Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview. Foreshocks are earthquakes, emphasizes Angew, but they only earn the title “foreshock” when they happen before a big one. A leveled apartment building in Istanbul in November 1999. Image: Anja Niedringhaus/EPA/REX/Shutterstock “They are something you can only see in retrospect,” Angew, who had no role in the study, said. “There’s absolutely no way to tell them apart otherwise. That’s like trying to predict the weather, except you can’t see anything.” ""For decades, people have been thinking about how we can distinguish foreshocks from ordinary earthquakes,"" William Ellsworth, a Stanford University geologist and lead author of the study, said in an interview. ""They [2011 researchers] made this rather bold suggestion that the foreshocks were different — we just came up with the opposite result."" By analyzing additional measurements from the 1999 quake, Ellsworth and coauthor Fatih Bulut, a geologist at Turkey's Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute, found that a series of foreshocks before the quake did not all happen in one place, as previously suggested. Instead, “we found that none of them were at the same spot,” said Ellsworth, adding that more than two dozen imperceptible quakes “popped off all over the place.” From this, the study's authors conclude that nothing special was happening, but a “cascade-like” effect of small earthquakes rippled around the area, until one happened to have triggered massive underground movement — and, ultimately, a tragedy. The fault comparison between the infamous San Andreas fault in California, and the fault in Turkey. Image: USGS However, perhaps there's something else still happening before earthquakes that geologists haven’t yet discovered, or been able to measure. “It’s possible there are clues out there that we don’t know yet,” John Vidale, Director of the Southern California Earthquake Center who had no role in the study,” said in an interview. “We don’t know what we don’t know.” Or, there could be no clues at all — no true, precursor of a coming quake. “It may not be there — that’s the thing we don’t know,” said Ellsworth. But even so, we do have a solid grasp of areas that are earthquake prone, and when a region is overdue for a large quake. Digging into the ground along fault lines — cracks in the Earths’ crust where pressure builds and eventually slips — gives scientists a good understanding of how often big quakes have happened in the past, and whether or not we’re due for another one. “If it’s been a long time since the last one, the odds are somewhat higher now,” said Vidale. Though, “somewhat” is the key word here. Geologists know we can’t predict quakes, but are well aware they can hit at any time — sometimes with small foreshocks, and sometimes without. “If it happens in the next 20 minutes I won’t be surprised,” said Angew, of the next big rupture of the San Andreas fault in California. “If it doesn’t happen in my lifetime, I won’t be surprised.” A boy stands in front of his destroyed home in Adapazari, Turkey, in 1999. Image: Kerim Oekten/EPA/REX/Shutterstock In the end, while earthquake prediction is a much-desired ability, perhaps it doesn’t matter as much as we think it does. “It really doesn’t matter when they happen if we’re prepared,” said Ellsworth. “We’ll get through them.” For those that live in quake country, this means heeding the advice of the U.S. Geologic Survey. And on a larger scale, it also means building structures that are safe during earthquakes. In the case of Turkey two decades ago, many buildings simply weren’t built to withstand a big quake. “Turkey has very good building codes,” said Ellsworth. “The problem is buildings were not being built to the code.” “Earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings kill people,” he added. Scientists will still keep searching for the elusive clues that might foreshadow a looming quake, perhaps giving people 10 or 20 minutes to prepare. Today, the best we have are early warning systems, like that being tested in California and in use in Mexico City. These don’t predict earthquakes, but can give people perhaps 30 seconds notice that a big quake has happened, and that seismic waves will soon hit their area. For now, preparation isn’t just the smart option — it remains the only option. There’s much that isn’t known about what happens before earthquakes, and that isn’t likely to change soon. “What we want to know about is buried under miles of solid rock,” said Ellsworth.","At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999.

Mariella Moon,"Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer Jonathan McDowell noted that space situational awareness service Space-Track catalogued Zuma. Space-Track adding something to its catalog means that object made it to orbit. However, Navy Captain Brook DeWalt told Bloomberg that the military division has ""nothing to add to the satellite catalog at this time."" It's all conflicting reports all around, and unfortunately, both SpaceX and Northrop Grumman, which built the satellite, refuse to talk. ""We do not comment on missions of this nature; but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally,"" the space corporation told Engadget. If the payload truly crashed or disappeared, then this incident came at a bad time for SpaceX. The company is hoping to start ferrying astronauts to the ISS this year and to win more contracts from the Pentagon. Although what happened to Zuma remains shrouded in mystery, McDowell said Northrop Grumman provided its own adapter used to attach the payload to the rocket's final stage. If the adapter was the one that failed to pop off when it was time for Zuma to detach itself, then the incident might not be SpaceX's fault at all. To recap: Normally when you buy a rocket launch, you've paid for ""the payload adapter on the rocket final stage pops the satellite off at the end"".

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Mars before (left) and during (right) the dust storm GIF: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Nearly all of Mars has been under the assault of a planet-wide dust storm since June. The nerve-wracking question: Is the Opportunity rover okay? The 15-year-old rover has been incommunicado since June 10, according to a NASA release, as the dust storm cut it off from solar power. NASA scientists are confident that the rover will weather the storm, so they’re just waiting for the wakeup call. First, here’s the background. A small dust storm appeared on Mars at the end of May. It soon spiraled into a planet-wide event. Storms like this occur once or twice a decade. The nuclear-powered Curiosity rover is fine, but the solar-powered Opportunity rover went into hibernation in early June. Scientists worry about what the lack of power and low temperatures will do to the rover but are optimistic it will survive. So, how will researchers know when it’s back? The NASA press release explains that dust storms are measured with a number called “tau,” with higher tau indicating a more opaque atmosphere. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite that circles the planet, can estimate the tau by observing the surface. The rover needs a tau no higher than 2 in order to charge its batteries. Normally its environment’s tau is 0.5, and during the storm, it was as high as 10.8. At present, the tau is somewhere between 2.1 and 2.5, according to the Opportunity team —so they don’t expect to hear from the rover just yet. Meanwhile, NASA engineers are pinging Opportunity, hoping to hear a response back. After that first response, it will take a few weeks to gather information about the rover’s current state and determine what kinds of damage it might have suffered. To protect itself in the event of an error, the Opportunity has automatic safe-mode type behaviors, called fault conditions. NASA scientists expect that the rover has gone through low-power, mission clock, and possibly uploss fault conditions, according to the newest Opportunity update. Low-power faults make the rover hibernate, clock faults tell the rover to rely on things other than its internal clock to make decisions, and uploss faults tell it that its normal communication systems aren’t properly functioning. NASA has put together a playlist of songs it has used to try to rouse the rover. It’s a boring playlist without any hip-hop or dance music that I, too, would try to sleep through. Maybe I’d wake up for Queen or Bowie. Hope to hear from you soon, Oppy! [ NASA JPL ]",Nearly all of Mars has been under the assault of a planet-wide dust storm since June.

Bob Baddeley,"The common belief is that big companies are out to get the little people by making products that break after a short period, or with substantially new features or accessories that make previous models obsolete, requiring the user to purchase a new model. This conspiracy theory isn’t true; there’s a perfectly good explanation for this phenomenon, and it was caused by the consumers, not the manufacturers. When we buy the hottest, shiniest, smallest, and cheapest new thing we join the wave of consumer demand that is the cause of what often gets labelled as “Planned Obsolescence”. In truth, we’re all to blame for the signals our buying habits send to manufacturers. Dig in and get your flamewar fingers fired up. The idea makes sense; some bigwigs in marketing realized that if they sell a product that will expire, break, or become unserviceable after a certain period of time (long enough that people won’t complain), then the consumer will return and buy a newer, better product. Why build a product that lasts a long time and only get one sale when you can build a product that breaks after a few years and get a few repeat sales? We can point to microwaves that are older than we are that still function fine and say “see, back then they built gadgets that last, why don’t they do that anymore?” There are lots of manifestations of this phenomenon. You see products that break after a period of time. You see products that don’t have user-serviceable or replaceable parts. You see parts or consumables that are discontinued, rendering the product useless. And especially (I’m looking at you, Samsung and Apple) you see products that are upgraded every year or two with fancy new features and operating systems that make the current version look like a potato. So how is this NOT planned obsolescence? It’s Consumer Demand The entire conspiracy is explained away when you consider that manufacturers are giving consumers exactly what they’re asking for, which is often compromising the product in different ways. It’s always a tradeoff, and the things that make a product more robust are the things that consumers aren’t considering when they make a purchase, so they are the first to go when a company designs a new product. Price The biggest, baddest, most important aspect of this is price, and Harbor Freight is the poster child for this concept. If consumers valued quality products that don’t break more than they do price, then Harbor Freight wouldn’t exist. After all, it’s easy to get the feeling that Harbor Freight is a store composed entirely of shelves that scream “we know this is a crappy product that will break if you look at it wrong, but it’s cheap.” So product developers make cuts everywhere they can to reduce the cost of the product. They replace metal parts with plastic parts, screws with snaps, and everything they can do to shave pennies off the cost. All of this is just so that you’ll begin to consider their product. This isn’t a game of increasing their own margin by keeping prices the same and reducing the quality of the product, this is a game of adding features while reducing the cost so that you’ll see that this product costs $.57 less than the competitor and buy it on price difference alone. The Harbor Freights are the obvious ones, but every company does this. Sure you can find good companies that make quality products, but you’ll pay dearly for it. Size Next is size, and here the cell phone industry is our best example. When cellphones first hit the scene, batteries were replaceable by users. This was great, except that it added bulk, and it turned out that people weren’t keeping their phone long enough for the battery replacement to be necessary. Cell phone technology was advancing so fast that people didn’t want to keep their phone running for years; they wanted the latest and greatest and smallest. So the easily replaceable battery was compromised so that we could have skinnier smaller phones. You could still unscrew the case and replace it, but it wasn’t as easy. But that wasn’t skinny or small enough, and in the effort to reduce costs even further, the screws were removed so that we could have smooth glass on both sides, requiring even more difficult methods for replacing the battery. It wasn’t a conspiracy to make phones obsolete more quickly; it was a direct response to different demands that made compromises necessary. Accessory Compatibility Then we have to consider the compatibility of accessories. Here again the cell phone is a great example. Consider the monstrosity that is the old iPhone cable. It had so many pins it could be mistaken for a DIMM memory connector. An industry of accessories sprouted up around this connector, with chargers and audio receivers and all kinds of things having this docking connector. Then Apple announced a new connector, the lightning connector, and immediately all these products were obsolete and a whole industry had to redesign and retool. So many USB options, including B, A, Mini B, Micro B, and C. The same thing happened with USB (Mini-&gt;Micro-&gt;C), so the Android fanbois can’t point fingers. With both lightning and USB-C, the committees tried to make a connector that was tiny (consumer demand), reversible (consumer demand), cheap (consumer demand), and forward thinking, with lots of flexibility for the future. These connectors aren’t designed to be short lived. Manufacturers don’t want to have to spend a lot of time and energy re-engineering stuff when they could design it once and sell it forever. They’re forced into these types of redesign by consumer demand for improved features and reduced cost. User Training Don’t eat, in many languages, and a picture. It’s not even toxic; they just don’t want you choking on it. It’s hard to put this delicately, but it seems users are less patient and willing to learn than they used to be. Manuals are tossed directly in the garbage without consultation, but users don’t hesitate to write a bad review and complain that it doesn’t work because they didn’t charge it first. Manufacturers are marching steadily towards products that are easier and easier to use, with fewer serviceable parts, less friction on the first use, and simpler interfaces. As an example, a product I helped develop has a non-user replaceable coin cell battery because. The reasons that drove this decision are pretty eye-opening: We couldn’t get the users to be interested in keeping the device running longer than the battery lifetime. Even if they were, we couldn’t get them to order the right battery (CR2032). Even if they did, we couldn’t rely on them to have the dexterity to remove the battery tray and replace the battery. They complained that the battery door made the product look cheap and flimsy. They complained that water and dust ingress was more likely. Sadly, all this complaining was only possible among the users that understood that their wirelessly communicating device had a battery in the first place. How Do We Fix It? Manufacturers need to be given feedback on what to prioritize when designing new products. When the only feedback they receive is that it will be purchased in higher volumes if they reduce the price, then the only conclusion to be drawn is that the consumer cares about price more than any other aspect. The way to fix it is to support companies that develop high quality products that are more expensive but designed to last. Another important bit of feedback is to use open standards so that integrations between products are easier, and interfacing with a product past its expected lifetime is still possible. Even publishing schematics or repair manuals after a product is considered obsolete and no longer available for sale would be helpful, and builds good will among a certain demographic. We write countless articles about the challenges of hacking older gadgets to extend their useful life or find new purposes, but the world would be a better place if that hacking was assisted by documentation from the manufacturer. Finally, and I know I’m preaching to the choir in this community, but we need to educate people more about how stuff works, and get people interested in understanding the products they use on a daily basis, and to believe that the stuff inside the plastic box is not just magic pixies.","The common belief is that big companies are out to get the little people by making products that break after a short period, or with substantially new features or accessories that make previous models obsolete, requiring the user to purchase a new model.

Alessandra Potenza,"Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning that forced people to flee to higher grounds in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the tsunami waves were less than a foot high, and the advisories were canceled a little after 4AM local time. So why was Alaska so lucky? Powerful quakes that happen out at sea are known to cause destructive tsunamis. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in northeastern Japan triggered waves as high as 126 feet, killing nearly 20,000 people. In 2004, a similarly strong quake off the coast of Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. Alaska also has a history of strong earthquakes: in 1964, the state experienced the most powerful quake ever recorded in the US, a 9.2 magnitude tremor followed by a tsunami that killed over 100 people. “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes,” says Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Just south of Alaska, the Pacific plate is sliding underneath the North American plate, an area called the subduction zone. That’s why the state is highly seismic, Blakeman tells The Verge. Last night’s earthquake generated because of all the strain building up on the subduction zone, but it did not occur exactly on a fault where the Pacific Ocean seafloor is sliding under the North American plate, Blakeman says. Instead, the quake occurred a little farther out, in a place where the fault is moving horizontally. This type of quake, called a strike-slip earthquake, is less likely to trigger large tsunamis, and this is probably why Alaska only saw waves of less than a foot, according to Blakeman. When earthquakes happen on the subduction zone itself, where one plate is pushing down while the other is going up, then high waves form. “To get a tsunami, you have to have substantial vertical movement on the seabed,” Blakeman says. Those types of earthquakes were responsible for the massive tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia. Aftershocks in Alaska could continue for weeks or months, Blakeman says. If the quakes generate from the same zone as last night, then large tsunamis should not be expected. But because the state sits by the Pacific-North America plate boundary, it’s normal that new earthquakes will happen in the future. When and where, exactly? That’s impossible to say. Earthquakes are so complicated that scientists aren’t able to predict them — at least not yet. “Since we can’t predict them, all we can do is be prepared,” Blakeman says.","Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska.",2018-01-23T16:15:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A powerful earthquake in Alaska didn’t trigger a big tsunami — here’s why,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922914/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-pacific-north-america-plate-boundary,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQqh3BMKCmEiuTLq3ign4Cnb9ag=/0x97:704x466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082687/earthquake.png,the-verge,The Verge,fault,1
Alex Cranz,"The Dell XPS 13 has been so dangerously close to perfect for so long that the latest iteration left me a little surprised. I was turning it this way and that to find something I could fault it for, not because I wanted to unfairly ding the product, its just that nothing is perfect. But Dell has so refined this version of its best 13-inch laptop that the issues with it are all minute and deeply personal. This is a near perfect laptop.
Dell XPS 13 (2019)

Some people might find the two-tone design unattractive.
We talk a lot about the 13-inch MacBook Pro because, for many people, this is what comes to mind when you say good laptop. It doesnt matter if youre a macOS or a Windows 10 fan, everyone can agree that the Apple lineup is wonderfully engineered and great for the majority of people. Recently, Huaweis MateBook laptops are the rare Windows 10 laptops that come close to that kind of universal appeal (and largely because their design is so clearly inspired by Apple). The XPS 13 used to ape Apple, too, but it has since moved on to its own design language thats just as pretty.
As with previous versions of the XPS 13, which are still available for sale on Dells difficult to navigate website, the 2019 version can be had for as little as $900. That gets you a 1080p non-touch display, an Intel i3-8145U CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSDthough a computer with 4GB of RAM and an i3 CPU is a bad deal. Going up to $1,210 gets you the same 1080p non-touch display, but an i5-8265U, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD, which is a far better config. We reviewed the $1,660 version with an i7-8565U CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Besides being the most powerful iteration, its also the only one with a 4K touch display.
All the iterations of the new XPS 13 look the same, and most people will find the hardware attractive, even though Dell has abandoned the aluminum unibody look popularized by Apple. While I quite like it, reactions from colleagues were sometimes less enthusiastic. Some felt it looked cheap. In part, I think people dont like how the device uses multiple materials, giving it a cobbled together look. With the device closed, all you see is aluminum, with a finish that picks up marks easily. Flip it open, and the insides are glass and carbon fiber. From afar, the white carbon fiber of the device I tested can look bland, but the experience of using that material is exceptional. The carbon fiber palm rest distributes heat differently than a metal palm rest does. Its pleasantly warm when I open it up after commuting through a New York winter storm, while staying cool when the computers guts are cranking and the fans have kicked in.
Everything about the part of the computer you spend most of your time looking at is elegant. The display and bezels appear as one seamless piece beneath the glass. The XPS 13 still has some of the slimmest bezels you can find on any laptop, a craze it helped start years ago. Constantly shrinking bezels led to an unfortunate flaw in recent years. With no bezel left to contain a webcam, Dell engineers opted to stick one below the display, giving people on the other end of your Skype call an unflattering look up your nose.
A low webcam is kind of tolerable in Huaweis MateBook X, which at least hides the webcam behind a clever mechanism in the keyboard. Sure the shots are unflattering, but the webcam disappears when not in use. On previous versions of the XPS 13, its just been this ugly little mole on the bottom bezel. Now, its right back up top where it belongs. Dell accomplished the feat by using a much smaller than average webcam (its still 1080p resolution). It works surprisingly well for being such a physically smaller camera apparatus. Its good enough for a Skype or teleconference callthough it wouldnt be my first choice for a Twitch stream.
Heck the Dell XPS 13 wouldnt be my first choice for video game streaming period. While its plenty fast, with the i7 I reviewed pulling off scores right in line with the similarly configured MateBook 13, the Dell XPS 13 lacks the discrete graphics card option the MateBook lineup and the faster (but similarly priced) Razer Blade Stealth offer. Instead, it has the Intel 620 integrated GPU. That means it will be fine for most work, but will never compete, performance-wise, with the MateBook 13 or Razer Blade Stealth when it comes to games.
The Dell XPS 13 does manage some decent battery life though. The device I reviewed has a battery-sucking 4K display, and still managed 9 hours and 26 minutes in our test. The 2,160 by 1,440 MateBook 13 lasted just 8 hours and 9 minutes on a charge. The Razer Blade Stealth lasted 10 hours and 11 minutes, though, the one we tested, with the same i7 processor as the XPS 13, also has a less demanding 1080p display. Id expect 1080p versions of the Dell XPS 13 to perform similarly, if not better than, the Razer Blade Stealth.
1 / 3
I found myself thinking about the Stealth a lot as I reviewed the XPS 13. Theyre similarly configured devices that are priced about the same, and both have a nice sharp design thats refreshingly different than what Apple has been throwing at us for a decade. But the Razer Blade Stealth is a little bigger and heavier. Its .58 inches thick, while the Dell XPS 13 is .3 inches at its thinnest point and .46 inches at its thickest. The XPS 13 starts at 2.7 pounds while the Razer Blade Stealth starts at 2.82. With loud fans, a USB-C port, a Thunderbolt 3 port, and two USB-A 3.1 ports, the Razer Blade Stealth doesnt feel quite as flexible as the Dell XPS 13 with its three Thunderbolt 3 ports and that single MicroSD card slot. 
But though they are similar, theyre intended for very different purposes. The Razer Blade Stealth, which comes in black or pink, is intended more for gamers, while the Dell XPS 13, which comes in Alpine White, Rose Gold, or Platinum Silver, is intended to be for anyone, and for most people its the better, smaller, and cheaper laptop. If youre out to buy a very good laptop and you dont require a Mac, then the new Dell XPS 13 should be one of the first devices you look at. Its taken a while, but Dell damn near perfected the 13-inch laptop.

Alex Cranz,"If you’re not on a laptop or a phone look down at your keyboard. It’s probably the one that came with your PC. Maybe IT handed it over as they explained the no porn policy at the big company you work for. However you acquired it (and you almost certainly didn’t pay for it), there’s a very good chance it’s a hot piece of garbage. That isn’t your fault! The keyboards that ship with most towers and all-in-ones these days are not great. The same goes for the cheap $10 specials you pick up on Amazon. You need something better. You need a good keyboard. The problem is when you talk to someone in-the-know about keyboards they tend to point you towards...expensive ones. I know this because I have definitely suggested friends spend more than $200 on a keyboard before. But it doesn’t have to—it shouldn’t—be that way. There’s a middle-ground between the luxury models that keyboard nerds like myself adore and the absolute garbage that came with your computer or you spent the equivalent of two coffees on. So let’s go over what you should know when buying a decent keyboard. First: You don’t have to drop a whole pile of money on one, but you should plan to spend more than $50. Keyboards that cost less, as a rule, are lower quality devices with inferior key switches. The switch is the mechanism you press down on when typing ( you can read more about specific key switches here ). In many senses, it’s the heart of the keyboard and as you spend more money that’s the first thing to improve. Despite all the extraordinary advances in technology—particularly computing technology—there is one … Read more Read Supremely budget keyboards (think $50 and under) tend to have mushy membrane keys or super shallow and unreliable mechanical keys. They’re usually not pleasant to type on, they’re not durable, and the keyboards themselves tend to be wobbly and poorly made. Once you go above the $50 mark you’ll find a leap in quality, especially if you choose mechanical keyboards, which can be louder to type on but tend to be much more durable. At this price range, avoid big box stores and Amazon. Instead check out Massdrop or look into Mechanical Keyboards. The latter is a great place to find an inexpensive, but quality boards. It also sells key switch testers for as little as $10. These testers have a wide variety of switches on them so you can check out each kind of switch and figure out your favorite type. If you’re willing to spend a little more money—think $70 to $100—you can go back over to Amazon or your local Best Buy. There you’ll find solid keyboards from people like Razer and Logitech. They may not be as attractive (they’ll almost certainly be black and have a plethora of LEDs), but they’ll still feel great to type on, they’ll be fairly customizable via apps on your computer, and they should last a while. Once you go past the $70-to-$100 range, your best bet is to return to Massdrop, Mechanical Keyboards, or seek out smaller keyboard makers on Amazon and eBay (Leopold, Filco, and Vortex are nice choices). These keyboards are a much higher quality with a wider range of options as far as key switches go. Should you splurge? But should you really go past that $100 price-range for the nicer keyboards. For most people? Nah. Dropping $50 to $100 will get you a perfectly fine mechanical keyboard (or higher quality membrane keyboard) that feels good to type on, has a stable base, and will last a good, long while. Spending more than that is necessary only if you have the money and really, really care about key switches or appearance.",If you’re not on a laptop or a phone look down at your keyboard.

"Alex Cranz on Field Guide, shared by Rhett Jones to Gizmodo","It’s not your fault, but it is very likely that you’re using the wrong HDMI cord to plug that 4K Apple TV or PS4 Pro into your new TV. While you might have assumed that all HDMI cords are equal they are, unfortunately, not. And if you have the wrong cable, you could be missing out on the best features of your TV—or whatever you’re trying to plug into it. No HDR, no wide color gamut, no high frame rate for your sports and games. But don’t worry. If you know what to look for, it’s actually pretty easy to find the right cable. Cables have standards The first thing to understand is that the HDMI cable is not like the component, composite, or S-video cables you might have plugged into your TV in years past. All that mattered with those cables is that they were well made and had the right plugs. HDMI cables are more like USB or ethernet cables, however. There are different versions that look identical on the outside, but can grossly affect how much data you’re moving from point A to point B. You know how that old USB 2.0 cord slows down your external hard drive compared to a USB 3.0? HDMI is subject to the same kind of limitation—specifically, bandwidth. There are, to date, seven different HDMI versions, starting with 1.0, which was introduced back in 2002, and currently ending with 2.1, which was only announced back in November of 2017. The amount of bandwidth each each version is capable of supporting, as well as any additional cool features a version may possess, is decided upon by the HDMI licensing group, which is made of a collection of companies, including Toshiba, Technicolor, Panasonic and Sony. HDMI Version 1.4, which was introduced back in 2009, is the current de facto standard HDMI cable. It supports up to 10Gbps and a 1080p resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate (which means the screen can display 120 frames per second—great for sports and games), but it can only do 4K at 60Hz, and it can’t handle new features like HDR and wide color gamut. That means it’s worthless if you’re trying to hook up the latest set-top box or game console with most TVs made in the last two to three years. Well, it’s not worthless, but it’s not ideal, either! You’re essentially losing out on the cool features you paid for in that TV and HDMI-connected device. HDMI 1.4 also has to sub versions: 1.4a and 1.4b. The former allows the cable to work with 3D televisions in 1080p 24Hz, and the latter allows it to also handle 3D 1080p at 120Hz. Neither provides any noticeable improvement if you’re using one with a 2D television. As 3D TVs aren’t especially popular anymore, and there’s not a lot of content available, you don’t really need to think too much about these two—they’ll still work just like a vanilla version 1.4 cable. What does provide an improvement is moving to Version 2.0. With this upgrade, the maximum bandwidth of the cable nearly doubles, from 10Gbps to 18Gbps. This means the cable can theoretically transmit a lot more data—like all the data needed to properly render a wider color gamut or HDR. Unfortunately, you’re still capped at 4K and 60Hz. So if you head into the big box store and they try to sell you on a fancy 4K TV capable of 120Hz, don’t necessarily feel like you need to spend the money. You will not be able to get a 4K 120Hz picture transmitted over HDMI with version 2.0 or earlier. This might be where you point to Version 2.1, which was announced back in November 2017. It doesn’t just double the bandwidth. At a theoretical max of 48Gbps, it’s almost three times faster than 2.0 and nearly five times faster than 1.4 or earlier. It can actually do 4K and 120Hz and wide color gamut and HDR all at the same time. However, because it was announced in November 2017, there are very, very few TVs with ports that support the standard, or cables made to the standard. HDMI cable standards are hidden, because the world is terrible At this point, you might think you cracked the code, as if you could just go out, find an HDMI 2.0 or 2.1 cable, plug it in, and you’re good to go. Unfortunately, in 2012 HDMI pulled a truly bonehead move and essentially forbid anyone from actually saying what standards their cables support. You can’t just go to Monoprice or Amazon and choose a nice-looking 2.0 cable and call it a day. But thankfully this guide exists, so you also don’t have to pour over every single number that chases after an HDMI cable when you do a search on Monoprice or Amazon. The key thing isn’t to look for 4K, or 60Hz, or HDR, or more complex stats like YUV 4:4:4. All you actually need to pay attention to is the bandwidth of the cable. You want to find cables that say they are capable of 18Gbps or higher. You also want to make sure that those cables are certified, as uncertified cables can make any kind of bandwidth claim they please and not actually deliver. A certified cable will be a little more expensive, but that means a dollar or two more. It’s a small price to pay to make sure your $1,000 TV is showing the picture it was designed to show. Knowing when to trash a cable So how do you know if the cables you already have are worthless? There typically aren’t any markers on the cable you can trust to accurately tell you. So if you don’t want to chuck all the cables you currently own and go buy all new ones, you’ll need to check a few things. First, look at the manual for you TV and see what version of HDMI each port supports. Many TVs, especially cheaper ones, might only have Version 2.0 or higher on one port! That means there’s only one port that can handle 4K and HDR and all the stuff the TV bragged about having when you bought it. So locate a Version 2.0 port on your TV and plug in a device that supports 4K and HDR. Now, confirm that HDR is enabled on the TV. You’ll need to check you manual as every TV confirms HDR differently. If HDR is enabled then you’re probably good to go! But if it is enabled and you notice the picture is pixelating or stuttering, then it means the cable can’t handle all the data and should be replaced. This is especially common with cables over 6 feet that are attempting to transmit 4K 60Hz picture with wide color gamut and HDR. For that reason, it’s rarely a good idea to buy a cable that is longer than 6 feet. As good certified cables can be found at places like Amazon and Monoprice for under $10, there’s really no reason not to double-check and replace your cables if needed. You spent all that money on a good picture, so why waste it because of a cheap cable?","It’s not your fault, but it is very likely that you’re using the wrong HDMI cord to plug that 4K Apple TV or PS4 Pro into your new TV.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images How many plumbers does it take to fix the toilets on a Norwegian Airlines flight? The answer, it would seem, is more than the 85 who were flying from Oslo to Munich on Saturday. Twenty minutes after take-off the aircraft was forced to return to the tarmac after a fault with the toilets was discovered. And because the problem had to be fixed from the outside there was little the plumbers onboard could do to help. The majority of the professionals onboard work for plumbing company Rorkjop, whose Chief Executive Frank Olsen told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that his employees ""would have liked to fix the restrooms"". ""Unfortunately it had to be done from the outside and we did not take the opportunity to send a plumber at 10,000 metres,"" he said. 'We'll just use a bucket' The news has seen some social media users share their own stories of lavatorial anguish. One social media user recalled an unusual response to waiting for a plane loo to be fixed. ""I'll never forget spending two hours on the tarmac,"" he wrote.

Nick Douglas,"My wife and I have about the same number of Twitter followers16k and 14k respectivelybut her tweets consistently outperform mine. In fact, according to the SparkScore tool from the Twitter marketing service SparkToro, an average tweet from her gets three times as many retweets and ten times as many faves. How could this happen? Could her tweets be objectively better than mine? What if my ego refuses to accept this? What if its my followers fault? SparkToro has another tool, Fake Followers Audit, to check how much of any Twitter users audience is even real. That does seem to explain it: Ive got a bad infestation of bots, abandoned accounts, and various other dead weight. My wife, on the other hand, has extremely real followers. So I sit on a throne of lies. And yet I have enough real followers that I should be getting more faves and retweets. I must be an inferior tweeter, or misunderstood in my time. To make myself feel better, I looked up Cher to see how many of her 3.5 million followers are bots. This was a terrible idea. Cher has 22% fake followers to my 24%, but SparkToro gives her way more credit, since huge accounts like hers tend to have a very high average of fakes. She is literally off SparkScores chart.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fault,1
Timothy B. Lee,"reader comments 0 The chief of the Tempe Police has told the San Francisco Chronicle that Uber is likely not responsible for the Sunday evening crash that killed 49-year-old pedestrian Elaine Herzberg. “I suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident,"" said chief Sylvia Moir. Herzberg was ""pushing a bicycle laden with plastic shopping bags,"" according to the Chronicle 's Carolyn Said, when she ""abruptly walked from a center median into a lane of traffic."" After viewing video captured by the Uber vehicle, Moir concluded that “it’s very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway."" Moir added that ""it is dangerous to cross roadways in the evening hour when well-illuminated, managed crosswalks are available."" The police said that the vehicle was traveling 38 miles per hour in a 35 mile-per-hour zone—though a Google Street View shot of the roadway taken last July shows a speed limit of 45 miles per hour along that stretch of road. At a Monday afternoon press conference, Tempe Sgt. Ronald Elcock said that there were no signs that the vehicle slowed down before striking Herzberg. Moir's comments are obviously a promising sign for Uber, but they are not the final word on the tragedy. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have been dispatched to the scene to collect evidence and make an independent assessment. And even if Uber is not legally at fault, critics may ask whether the vehicle could have done more to anticipate the possibility that the woman might step in front of the Uber vehicle and take appropriate defensive measures—perhaps slowing down or changing lanes to give her a wider berth.","Tempe police chief says victim ""came from the shadows right into the roadway.""",2018-03-20T06:02:04Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Police chief: Uber self-driving car “likely” not at fault in fatal crash,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/police-chief-uber-self-driving-car-likely-not-at-fault-in-fatal-crash/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PHX4-1-2-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,fault,1
Frederic Lardinois,"Google Cloud today announced the launch of preemptible GPUs. Like Google’s preemptible VMs (and AWS’s comparable spot instances), these GPUs come at a significant discount — in this case, 50 percent. But in return, Google may shut them down at any point if it needs these resources. All you get is a thirty-second warning. You can also only use any given preemptible GPU for up to 24 hours. This new feature applies to both the NVIDIA K80 and NVIDIA P100 GPUs that are currently available on the Google Cloud platform. Google will charge $0.22 per GPU hour for the K80 and $0.73 for the P100. In addition, you will also need to pay for a VM. Google will only charge you preemptible VM prices for these, but you don’t have to worry about Google shutting down your VM before your GPU workload is done (or before you get your thirty-second warning for the GPU shutdown). Google notes that these preemptible GPUs should be a good fit for any fault-tolerant machine learning workloads and other computation-heavy workloads that run in batches. Using Google’s managed instance group feature, you can also automatically re-create your preemptible instance after it goes down.

This app has been out for nearly 15 years, and it’s one of the most helpful tools you can use to clean up your hard drive. WinDirStat is completely free; it shouldn’t be, given how great it is, but it is. To make it work its magic, you just download a single file—that’s it. Though we wish there was a portable version of WinDirStat, the installation process doesn’t take very long (and barely any space). When you close out of the installation routine, WinDirStat loads by default. When the app opens, you select a location you want WinDirStat to scan. This could be your entire primary hard drive, a secondary hard drive you use that has been mysteriously filling up with storage, or just the contents of your Windows user folder (or Pictures, or Downloads, etc.) The program then begins to work its magic, rooting through every folder, subfolder, and file within the area you selected. WinDirStat displays the contents of what it finds as a large, unruly graphic at the bottom of the app. It also shows your folders in ascending order by size and continues to do so as you click through them to go deeper and deeper into your drive’s contents. This makes it incredibly easy to find mysterious folders that are eating up gigabytes of space (or worse), which might very well be the result of an accidental copy-and-paste of a large movie, some crazy thing going on with your Temporary files in Windows, or a huge stash of porn Linux distributions you forgot about. Whatever your file poison, WinDirStat is the antidote for a hard drive that’s running out of space—which I’d wager is user error seven times out of ten, and Windows’ fault the other three. While you can use WinDirStat to even create special routines for cleaning your drives and folders, like deleting every.BAK or.TMP file it can find, you’re better off using WinDirStat’s helpful information as the guiding light for a big deletion spree through File Explorer.

Nasser Karimi and Mohammad Nasiri / AP,"(SARPOL-E-ZAHAB) — Rescuers on Tuesday used backhoes and heavy equipment to dig through the debris of buildings toppled by a powerful earthquake on the border between Iran and Iraq, with weeping women crying out to God as aid workers found new bodies. The grim work began in earnest again at dawn in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e-Zahab in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, which appears to be the hardest hit in the magnitude 7.3 earthquake that struck Sunday night. Both rescuers and local residents alike stood atop the remains of apartment complexes, looking through the rubble. They used heavy blankets to carry away corpses. The hospital in Sarpol-e-Zahab was heavily damaged, and the army set up field hospitals, although many of the injured were moved to other cities, including Tehran. The quake also damaged an army garrison and buildings in the border city and killed an unspecified number of soldiers, according to reports. President Hassan Rouhani arrived in Kermanshah province on Tuesday to see the damage for himself and offer his support to those affected. “This was a pain for all Iranians,” Rouhani said, according to a statement on the presidency’s website. “Representing the nation of Iran, I offer my condolences to the people of Kermanshah, and tell them that all of us are behind Kermanshah.” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered his thanks to foreign countries offering to help but wrote on Twitter: “For now, we are able to manage with our own resources.” Cleric Abdolhossein Moezi, a representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who also is touring the area, said there was a need for more relief material and “security.” Many of the heavily damaged complexes in Sarpol-e-Zahab were part of construction projects under former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The newly homeless slept outside in cold, huddled around makeshift fires for warmth. The quake killed 430 people in Iran and injured 7,460, state media reported Tuesday. Most of the injuries were minor with fewer than 1,000 still hospitalized, Iran’s crisis management headquarters spokesman Behnam Saeedi told state TV. The official death toll came from provincial forensic authorities based on death certificates issued. Some reports said unauthorized burials without certification could mean the death toll was actually higher. The quake was centered about 19 miles (31 kilometers) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and struck 14.4 miles (23.2 kilometers) below the surface, a somewhat shallow depth that can cause broader damage. The quake caused Dubai’s skyscrapers to sway and could be felt 1,060 kilometers (660 miles) away on the Mediterranean coast. Seven deaths occurred in Iraq and 535 people were injured, all in the country’s northern, semiautonomous Kurdish region, according to its Interior Ministry. The disparity in casualty tolls immediately drew questions from Iranians, especially because so much of the town was new. Sarpol-e-Zahab fell to the troops of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980 invasion of Iran, which sparked the eight-year war between the two countries that killed 1 million people. Though clawed back by Iran seven months later, the area remained a war zone that suffered through Saddam’s missile attacks and chemical weapons. After the war, Iran began rebuilding the town. It also was part of Ahmadinejad’s low-income housing project, which aided the Holocaust-questioning hard-liner’s populist credentials but also saw cheap construction. Under the plan dubbed as Mehr or “kindness” in Farsi, some 2 million units were built in Iran, including hundreds in Sarpol-e Zahab. Many criticized the plan, warning that the low-quality construction could lead to a disaster.— “Before its 10-year anniversary, Mehr buildings have turned into coffins for its inhabitants,” the reformist Fararu news website wrote Monday. Iran sits on many major fault lines and is prone to near-daily quakes. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. In 2012, a major casualty earthquake killed over 300. ___ Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

Nick Douglas,"The lemon wedge in your drink has a bad reputation, and the evidence for it seems obvious: No one at a restaurant washes the outside of a lemon, but then they throw that wedge onto your glass, sometimes letting the rind soak right in the drink. And according to HuffPost, several studies found all kinds of germs on lemon wedges from bars and restaurants. So should your drink order always include “No lemon, please”? Only if you’re really worried, microbiologist Philip Tierno told HuffPost. These studies also found germs on everything else in restaurants, including the menus, the condiment bottles, and the tables. So skipping the lemon isn’t an especially effective way to avoid getting sick. Of course, there’s still the ick factor. So I asked a few friends with food service experience whether they’ve seen “gross” garnishes that don’t belong in a drink. Several agreed that the cut fruit is often left out overnight. “Fruit is expensive, so many won’t throw away the unused cut citrus at the end of the night, just store it in the fridge until morning,” said Derrick Winger. “The trays they sit in don’t get cleaned very often, which can lead to an interesting combo of juices sitting in the bottom.” He recommends tipping well and asking the bartender for a fresh-cut wedge. Portland bartender (and Lifehacker contributor ) Daniel Casto says that staff can be careless with the fruit, and not just at dive bars: If lemons have been cut on say, a Monday, refrigerated overnight, and put to use the next day, it’s on the bar staff to remember to flip the container before adding fresh (Tuesday) lemons to the Monday pile. Ideally, you don’t combine dates; but when you do, you gotta make sure the older stuff goes out first. Lemons also get dirty when the bartender touches them with bare hands, but as Casto points out, pretty much every time you eat out, someone has touched your food with their hands. And if you’re rude, some of those dirty lemons are your fault, says Casto: Frankly, the dirtiest I see lemons get is from clueless customers reaching for their own garnishes out of my station. This happens all too frequently, and these people should be put in stocks in the town square.","The lemon wedge in your drink has a bad reputation, and the evidence for it seems obvious: No one at a restaurant washes the outside of a lemon, but then they throw that wedge onto your glass, sometimes letting the rind soak right in the drink.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. She saw me coming. I arrived at London's Heathrow Airport after an arduous trip and a woman with a kindly face was holding a sign that read: ""Ask Me About Upgrades."" How did she know that I and my girlfriend were tired and desperate for peace, quiet and, perhaps, a touch of pampering? And this Virgin Atlantic employee was so pleasant, without being gushing. Before I knew it, I'd taken her up on her two-for-one offer and we were in what Virgin calls Upper Class. If you've never ventured into this part of the plane, the seats are pods, placed at 45 degrees to the fuselage. Romantic, it isn't. Comfortable, it is. The comfort was only enhanced by the attitude of the staff. Throughout this journey from San Francisco to London and back, the Virgin staff had been uncannily wonderful. When we checked in at San Francisco, the agent volunteered to find us a better seat in Premium Economy. She even got a colleague to help. Some minutes later, the first check-in agent saw us walking through the airport, wandered over and asked whether her colleague had found us something better. She had, and this was a proactive customer service I wasn't quite used to with most airlines. Anyway, back to Upper Class. The quite stellar customer service continued. The art lay in a relaxed manner that belied a careful anticipation of a passenger's needs. Water glasses were topped up without fuss. Wine glasses were poured without needing to be topped up. Even the food, which I never imagine will be too wonderful, was remarkably good. My chicken, mushroom and potato dish was restaurant quality. Frankly, we'd been given the same level of service -- if not the same florid array of food and wine -- on the outward Premium Economy journey. What, therefore, could possibly got wrong? AND THEN THE ATMOSPHERE CHANGED. It was the word f*** that alerted me. This was followed quite closely by two f*** ing s and a b****. No, this wasn't some deranged passenger throwing a fit for perhaps medical reasons. This was a bunch of British business types getting drunk at the bar. One feature of the Virgin Atlantic experience, you see, is the Upper Class bar. There's one on every plane. It offers several stools around a semi-circular shape, there for anyone to come, sit and, oh, socialize. We happened to be sitting close to it. We soon wished that we weren't. The more these men -- it's so often men, isn't it? -- drank, the more I wished I was back in Premium Economy. It's usually quite peaceful there, perhaps because there's no bar. After a while, it all became a little much. The voices got louder, the language got even coarser, and I won't even try to describe the ignorance of the opinions on offer. No, there's nothing redeeming about the word f***ing, even if it's followed by the word Tesla. I asked a Flight Attendant whether there was anything they could do. ""I'll go and have a word,"" they said. (Yes, I'm hiding the Flight Attendant's gender, for reasons that will hopefully soon become clear.) The Flight Attendant returned. ""I've told them to quiet down. If they don't, I'll send them back to their seats."" ""Does this happen a lot?"" I asked. ""Yes, it does. All the time. And the staff all hate it,"" said the Flight Attendant. Apparently, the people who least like the bar are the people who have to police the behavior at it. ""Every time the staff ask for the bars to be removed, Richard says no,"" I was told. The Richard is Richard Branson, Virgin's founder, who clearly believes that the bar adds some sort of flavor to his brand. DEAR VIRGIN ATLANTIC, WHY DO YOU HAVE A BAR? I know that Virgin isn't alone in having a bar, but I thought I'd ask its HQ why the airline has one at all. Please, it's not as if I don't like a drink. It's just that encouraging noise and perhaps inebriation in your high-falutin' First Class seems like a strange step toward the serenity you're always seeing in ads for First Class. So, from my seat, I emailed Virgin. ""We always welcome feedback from our customers and their current opinion is that they love the bar as a social space onboard our aircraft. Customers use it for many reasons, to enjoy a pre-dinner drink, sit and dine with their friends, chat to our cabin crew or even have a business meeting,"" an airline spokeswoman told me. Yes, but why would I want to pay a lot of money to listen to someone else's business meeting? (Unless, I suppose, I was inclined towards insider trading.) Wouldn't you imagine that if a group of friends is going to have dinner at the bar, the noise level will tend to increase? And who are these people who get on a plane, desperate to talk to other passengers? It's not them, it's me, isn't it? I have the wrong attitude. I simply don't understand why listening to a group of men discussing f***ing Tesla, f***ing Steve Jobs and f***ing great beer, while throwing down seemingly copious amounts of alcohol, isn't the apogee of civilization. This was a noon flight. These men filled the bar with their raucous racket for several hours. The cabin crew tried very hard to quieten them down and they began to disperse just as one of my gaskets began to signal it was at overload levels. Yes, the fine headphones the airline gives you to watch movies were a blessing. But just think what Virgin could do with the space instead. If Branson insists that a bar is necessary, why not launch an entirely new concept? The Whisper Bar. Wouldn't that be rather alluring?",This was all Richard Branson's fault.,2018-02-24T11:34:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",I Just Flew Virgin Atlantic Upper Class and 1 Thing Made Me Want to Scream,https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/i-just-flew-virgin-atlantic-upper-class-1-thing-made-me-want-to-scream.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_697885090_2000134920009280307_346702.jpg,,Inc.com,fault,1

Oh, but what do I see, if not View From The Wing presenting a United ad for the new fee that reads: "" Get onboard and to the overhead bins faster.""

Sitting down in your seat and being able to watch others strain to get to theirs? So here is United realizing that there's one more thing that passengers used to take for granted and can now be charged for. Partly, of course, this fee has been created by passengers themselves. They insist on dragging too many bags that are too large onto the plane. They have no care for their fellow humans. But there's an even more haunting aspect to United's new Overhead Bin, I mean Priority Boarding, fee. United describes the price in its ad as "" from $9 per traveler."" From $9.

Lee Moran,"President Donald Trump may hype himself as a master dealmaker.
But that’s not how former longtime Trump Organization executive Barbara Res or Trump’s The Art of the Deal co-author Tony Schwartz see it. They told MSNBC’s Ari Melber on Thursday that Trump’s dealmaking skills aren’t what the president brags them to be.
“I never thought he was a great dealmaker, to be honest with you,” said Res, who was the organization’s vice president in charge of construction. “In terms of taking the responsibility for the buck, he just would never do it. It’s not in his DNA. He’s never responsible. It is always someone else’s fault.”
Schwartz, meanwhile, said he recently looked back on Trump’s business deals that he “unfortunately described 30 years ago” and realized that “most of the deals in that book were failures.”
“And the number of deals he’s made over the years since then have overwhelmingly been failures,” Schwartz added. He said Trump was “really one of the worst” dealmakers he’s ever come across.

Steve Dent,"The exploit involves kicking the Switch into USB recovery mode by shorting a pin on the right-hand Joy-Con connector. A payload is then sent at a crucial point during a USB check, forcing the system to ""request up to 65,535 bytes per control request,"" much more than it can handle. That causes a DMA buffer overflow in the bootROM, giving hackers access to the normally-protected application stack. From there, they can run whatever code they want. Unfortunately, unlike the one in your PC, the Tegra X1 bootROM on the Switch is hardcoded and can't be changed once it leaves the factory. That would be fine if it were secure, but unfortunately, it has the bad length error built in, so there's nothing that NVIDIA or Nintendo can do to fix the 14.8 million Switch systems already shipped, according to ReSwitched.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Voyage, the self-driving car spinout from Udacity, is open-sourcing its approach to autonomous driving safety. This comes at a time when autonomous driving programs are under intense scrutiny following two fatal crashes — one involving Tesla’s Autopilot and the other one involving one of Uber’s self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona. Meanwhile, Voyage has already successfully deployed five Level 4 self-driving vehicles in retirement communities in California and Florida. Dubbed Open Autonomous Safety, the initiative aims to help autonomous driving startups implement better safety testing practices. Companies looking to access the documents, safety procedures and test code can do so via a GitHub repository. “Each and every autonomous vehicle startup today has to define their own safety programs, and we think that is dangerous,” Voyage CEO Oliver Cameron tweeted earlier today. Version one includes scenario testing, functional safety, autonomy assessment and a testing toolkit. Later this year, OAS will release driver training material, additional scenarios and fault injection code and tests. Here’s a quick breakdown of what the above currently entails: Scenario testing : Looks at fundamental questions, like how self-driving cars behave around pedestrians and when cars back out of driveways. Functional safety : Helps to ensure safety without a driver present. Autonomy assessment : Validates whether or not car is moving in the right direction “and how we know that we are solving the right problems,” Cameron wrote in a blog post. Testing toolkit : A library of traffic, roadway and vehicle assets. “When it comes to safety, we believe open is better. At Voyage, we welcome contributions to improve OAS, like any other open source project,” Cameron wrote in a blog post. “The purpose of this effort is to promote an elevated standard of safety in the autonomous vehicle industry, increasing public trust through transparency.”","Voyage, the self-driving car spinout from Udacity, is open-sourcing its approach to autonomous driving safety.

Julia Alexander,"YouTube’s CEO wants to tackle the platform’s conspiracy theory problem by relying on Wikipedia in an effort to keep viewers informed. The idea is simple enough: YouTube will identify videos about known conspiracy theories, and include a Wikipedia description that provides more information on the main topic that the conspiracy is concerned with. “When there are videos that are focused around something that’s a conspiracy — and we’re using a list of well-known internet conspiracies from Wikipedia — then we will show a companion unit of information from Wikipedia showing that here is information about the event,” Wojcicki said at a South by Southwest talk yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Wojcicki pointed to flat-earthers, people who believe that the Earth isn’t spherical — even though the ancient Greeks figured out the truth, and explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano proved it centuries ago. It’s not up to YouTube to tell people what they can and can’t believe, Wojcicki said. But with small boxes sourced from Wikipedia, the video service will make an effort to keep people informed about what they’re watching. You can see examples below. Wikipedia information cues as they appear on YouTube videos. YouTube Additional information from Wikipedia on YouTube videos. YouTube YouTube’s solution is plainly ridiculous. It’s also indicative of the company’s refusal to take a stand on political matters. YouTube is offloading its responsibility to curb the distribution of dangerous content onto Wikipedia. The company’s executives don’t want to define YouTube as a media platform, so they can relieve themselves of the ownership they have over the content that appears there — even though they also want YouTube to be viewed as a go-to place for news. “If there is an important news event, we want to be delivering the right information,” Wojcicki said, as reported by BuzzFeed, before reiterating that “we are not a news organization.” Even Wikipedia officials take issue with YouTube’s decision to source the site. Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, tweeted her own concerns regarding Wikipedia’s speed with real-time news and with putting complete faith in Wikipedia — or any information source. Nor, the foundation stated, is it a formal partnership. “We don’t want you to blindly trust us,” Maher said. “Sure, we’re mostly accurate — but not always! We want you to read @Wikipedia with a critical eye. Check citations! Edit and correct inaccurate information! You can’t do that in a simple search result.” YouTube’s answer to angry creators bemoaning an alleged content “purge,” and to criticism from academics and the media, is to display information from Wikipedia — a free encyclopedia whose articles can easily, instantly be edited by anyone in the world. That’s not a good solution. YouTube is still incentivizing falsehoods YouTube is owned by Google — whose parent company, Alphabet, is currently valued at just under $800 billion, making it one of the wealthiest companies in the world — and the video platform has pledged to hire a team of more 10,000 people to deal with persistent content moderation problems. It’s also a company that doesn’t want to take the next steps in correcting systemic issues. That’s why people like Alex Jones, the despicable media personality who published conspiracy theory videos claiming that the Sandy Hook school shooting didn’t happen, can game the system for his own benefit. Jones, like many other conspiracy theorists and propagandists on YouTube, learned how to take advantage of Google’s algorithm to ensure that their content is seen and shared. The trick is simple: Take a popular news topic — a school shooting, for example — then add a term like “crisis actor” to it, and publish content about it. Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at the Columbia Journalism School, wrote about this growing trend in late February, just after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. “Mass shooting, false flag, and crisis actor conspiracy videos on YouTube are a well-established, if not flourishing genre,” said Albright. That’s how a video about one Parkland high school shooting survivor, David Hogg, accusing him of being a crisis actor ended up on the top of YouTube’s trending page. Albright told BuzzFeed that YouTube is “algorithmically and financially incentivizing the creation of this type of content at the expense of truth.” It’s what makes human moderation — not just machine-learning algorithms, which can be easily gamed — so necessary. “Journalists and affected parties (parents, survivors, first responders, etc.) are not only fighting the content on YouTube, they are fighting its algorithms — first at the ‘trending’ level and then again at the search and recommendation levels,” Albright said. On one side of the problem is YouTube’s algorithm, which the company admits is flawed. On the other side is the YouTube’s refusal to take a stance on the dangerous content being spread around its platform. The company still permits monetization on videos published by Jones’ InfoWars media company. One of them, “Must See Video! UK Gov’t Coddles Terrorists,” has two ads running: one at the beginning, and another at the end. YouTube executives aren’t taking a position on the content being watched by billions of people on their platform because they don’t have to. They want to appear unbiased, which is understandable when political conversations get involved. Robert Kyncl, YouTube’s chief business officer, expressed this exact sentiment in an earlier interview. “We have four freedoms under which YouTube operates: freedom of expression, freedom of opportunity, freedom to belong and freedom of information,” Kyncl said, reiterating comments he made to YouTuber Casey Neistat in February. “They truly become our North Star during difficult times. [...] Our message is that we absolutely are leaning in to freedom of information and freedom of expression, subject to our community guidelines. “We don’t intend to be on one side or another.” There’s a difference, however, between someone talking about their conservative beliefs and someone spreading malignant lies under the pretense of news. This is where the company now finds itself: not wanting to take a stance and relying on user-edited Wikipedia articles to try and outweigh its riskiest content. It’s a YouTube problem, not a Wikipedia problem People are quick to point to Wikipedia’s notorious “edit wars” as a reason that the online encyclopedia shouldn’t be trusted. I disagree. I don’t think that Wikipedia articles about Sandy Hook or the Sept. 11 attacks are suddenly going to become a breeding ground for conspiracy theorists. Subjects like the moon landing and President John F. Kennedy’s assassination will probably have pretty concise and reliable information, but that doesn’t matter to conspiracy theorists on YouTube — or the people watching the videos. Note how the descriptions will appear on the video pages. An excerpt of the Wikipedia article will appear directly under the video, just above the title. It looks like it can’t be minimized or closed, but Polygon has reached out to YouTube for more information. It doesn’t matter that a Wikipedia article detailing how the moon landing is real appears underneath a video, because by the act of watching the videos, viewers are still incentivizing those creators to produce such misleading content. Max Read, an editor at New York magazine’s Select All, tweeted about this after Wojcicki’s panel. Read doesn’t think people will engage in edit wars as a way of telling off YouTube executives, but does believe creators won’t think twice about continuing to make harmful content when YouTube continues to put ads on it and share it through its recommendation algorithm. “YouTube is has a problem with misinformation (and propaganda, and unwashed guys yelling about atheism, and videos of spider-man operating on elsa) because there are specific platform (and consequently financial) incentives for that content,” said Read. YouTube executives aren’t trying to fix their problem with conspiracy videos, or the disturbing trend of hateful content, because it translates to easy views and monetization. They’re stalling discussions about how to handle content, looking to put the responsibility on anyone else but their own company. YouTube is quickly becoming a dangerous platform that’s too big to handle, too big to moderate and increasingly looking too big to fix. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke at SXSW about the issues that platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit and Facebook face regarding dangerous content made for the sole purpose of monetization and spreading lies. Warner said that if companies don’t start dealing with these issues, they’ll see changes to the Communications Decency Act, according to BuzzFeed reporter Ryan Mac. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act says, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” That’s why Wojcicki repeatedly says YouTube is not a media company. To an extent, it isn’t. That doesn’t excuse YouTube from letting dangerous content thrive on its platform, however, just because the company doesn’t want to ruffle the feathers of prominent figures. YouTube’s executives keep feeding us excuses and apologies, and it’s exhausting.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. We're living in a period characterized by corporations that seem never to have enough. Oh, yes, they come over all socially-conscious on occasion for PR's sake. But when it comes to, say, tax matters, they lobby to get more. They're only human, after all. It's quaint, then, that the University of Texas has just released a study that says corporations are suffering greatly. They're paying employees more than $100 billion a year for doing nothing. What is the cause of this cataclysm? Why, idle workers. Yes, shameless, shifty employees are, it seems, costing their bosses a fortune. Their greatest crime appears to be that they're human. Here's some science-speak from the research: "" The goal of having employees available during idle time may be counteracted by work-stretching: workers' natural tendency is to stretch out their work unproductively, without a noticeable improvement in error rates, when they anticipate empty idle time after task completion. Moreover, these studies suggest that the deadtime effect is driven by time discounting: as idle time draws closer, it exerts a non- linear, accelerating negative impact on worker task completion speed. "" Gosh. Workers ""stretch out their work unproductively."" Apparently, when they know there is idle time coming after the task at hand, they slow down. I pause for your mouth to open wide and allow a fly a happy home. Yes, human beings don't like having nothing to do at work. Worse, they don't like the idea that their bosses think they have nothing to do, as they might, you know, fire them. But here's how the boffins' Practical Implications section begins. "" This research provides evidence for a frequently experienced, yet largely ignored, phenomenon that commonly occurs in the work place: employees don't always have enough work to do. "" Please forgive me if the following sentences have typos. I'm banging my head against my computer as I write. The researchers did offer one cheery conclusion. They said that their research shows that if bosses allow employees some leisure time -- such as online shopping, web surfing or some other leisure activity -- this might actually speed up their productivity. They worry, though, that the thought of some pleasure on the horizon will also allow workers to become distracted and slow down their work. You will, I hope, adore the researchers' suggestions as much as I do. "" Another way to prevent secondary activities from interfering with primary tasks is to make engaging in leisure activities permissible during free time in a public space -- for example, by providing access to games in a break room. Increased visibility of employees engaging in leisure activities could discourage the use of such activities when there are primary work tasks available."" Yes, make sure you can spy on their extracurricular activities, so that they're not ""getting away with anything."" Please forgive me if I sound a tad exasperated. Corporations are making record profits. Some are better managed than others. Employees of some are happier than those of others. Yet how much of the alleged lack of productivity on the part of workers is due to their bosses' behavior? How much money is lost when bosses act only in their personal self-interest, rather than that of the business as a whole? How much is lost when CEOs ""manage"" only to increase the worth of their stock holdings, rather than the longer-term future of the enterprise? How much, indeed, is lost because bosses believe workers are mere machines, tasked to perform certain duties ""productively,"" rather than human beings with, you know, foibles and feelings? The best bosses have an intuitive feeling for how work gets done and who does it. They understand their businesses intimately, because they bother to understand them. Some, though, prefer to listen to management consultants, who sell them on some fine strategy that optimizes performance. Of course, a lot of it involves some very lazy thinking.",But whose fault is it?,2017-12-21T20:08:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Science Says This is How Much Idle Workers Cost Businesses (It's a Big Number),https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/science-says-this-is-how-much-idle-workers-cost-businesses-its-a-big-number.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_475633885_337683.jpg,,Inc.com,fault,1
Kelsey Snell,"The U.S. Capitol is shown during a partial shutdown of the federal government on Monday in Washington, D.C.
Win McNamee/Getty Images
Six days into a partial government shutdown, congressional Democrats and President Trump are showing no signs of reaching a deal to reopen the government. Instead, it appears the shutdown could last until 2019.
The president has only a few more days to advance any spending agreement with the help of full GOP control in Washington. Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3, giving them significant new leverage over future spending talks. 
But, Thursday afternoon Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House Majority Whip, advised members that no votes were expected in the House this week. Scalise also told lawmakers that while the House awaits Senate action on a spending bill, he will aim to provide members with 24 hours' notice before any expected votes in the House.
The House and Senate briefly opened for business Thursday afternoon, but the momentary sessions were hardly a sign of behind-the-scenes negotiation. The halls of Congress have been nearly empty in recent days, save for a skeleton crew of staff and lawmakers. Democrats say they are all waiting for Trump to abandon his demand for $5 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico.
Trump is showing no signs of backing down. Instead, he is taking to Twitter to blame Democrats for the shutdown.
The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting &amp; expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a U.S. record!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2018
Trump has refused to sign any spending bill that does not include money for the border wall. Senate leaders have repeatedly said that money for the wall cannot be approved in the Senate, where Democrats have sufficient votes to block the legislation.
So far, neither side has been willing to negotiate, leaving roughly 25 percent of the government without funding. Democrats say they have been willing to negotiate with the White House on more money for border security, but they do not trust that Trump will accept any agreement.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., say they are getting conflicting guidance from White House aides.
""Different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment,"" Schumer and Pelosi said in a statement released on Christmas Eve. ""The president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.""
Trump insists Democrats are to blame, despite an earlier statement that he would personally take credit for a shutdown if one were to occur. He went on to claim without evidence that most of the workers who are being harmed by loss of wages in the shutdown vote for Democrats.
Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members &amp; Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?

SOPAN DEB,"To mark the 50th anniversary of the premiere, PBS will present a special on Tuesday called “It’s You I Like,” featuring celebrities like Michael Keaton, Sarah Silverman and others discussing Rogers’s legacy and influence. The anniversary and special come at a time that finds Rogers, who died in 2003, re-emerging as a pop culture figure. “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” a documentary about his life, made its debut earlier this year at Sundance, and an coming biopic, titled “You Are My Friend,” will star Tom Hanks as the genial host. This month the United States Postal Service will release a stamp bearing Fred Rogers’s portrait. The key themes of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” were kindness, civility and empathy, Margy Whitmer, a longtime producer, said. Another message: It’s O.K. to make mistakes. “Fred thought it was important that kids understood that you’ve got to make mistakes so you get better and that making mistakes helps you grow,” she said in a phone interview. Ms. Whitmer, discussed some of the show’s most memorable moments. Jeffrey Erlanger Visits the Neighborhood A scene from ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."" PBS A 10-year-old visitor in an episode that aired on Feb. 18, 1981, led to one of the show’s most famous segments. The child, Jeffrey Erlanger, a quadriplegic, described his treatment for a tumor discovered when he was 7 months old, and Rogers asked him to demonstrate how his electric wheelchair worked. “Fred was so intrigued with the fact that he was comfortable talking about what was going on with his body,” Ms. Whitmer said. “He really wanted the audience to see that.” Many years later, Mr. Erlanger surprised Rogers by appearing onstage at Rogers’s Television Hall of Fame induction in 1999. Rogers jumped out of his seat, in a mixture of joy and shock, and ran onstage to greet him. “When you tell people that ‘It’s You I Like,’ we know that you really mean it,” Mr. Erlanger said to Rogers, who knelt next to his wheelchair. “And tonight, I want to let you know that, on behalf of millions of children and grown-ups, it is you that I like.” Erlanger died in 2007 at 36. Rogers Meets Koko Mr. Rogers met Koko the gorilla in a 1998 segment. kokoflix One of Rogers’s biggest fans wasn’t actually human. Koko, the celebrity gorilla known for her ability to communicate using sign language, watched his show regularly, and the Gorilla Foundation approached Rogers about doing a segment. The piece aired July 28, 1998, as part of a weeklong series called “You and I Together.” “We had all these rules we had to follow,” Ms. Whitmer said of the shoot. “‘Koko likes kittens, so bring stuff of kittens.’ And ‘She loves red. You can’t look her in the eye.’” Typically, only Koko’s trainers were allowed into her environment. But Koko recognized Rogers when he walked in and almost immediately warmed to him, unzipping his sweater and blowing on a harmonica that Rogers brought as a gift. The most memorable moment from the visit was when Koko told Rogers that she loved him. “He just accepted Koko and was very relaxed with her and really showed no fear,” Ms. Whitmer said. It was after this visit that Rogers met the writer Tom Junod for a now famous Esquire magazine profile. The article is the basis for the biopic. Exploring Space With an Astronaut Fred Rogers did multiple segments with the astronaut Al Worden. PBS Al Worden, the command module pilot for Apollo 15, the fourth moon-landing mission, appeared on the show both before and after his visit to the moon. It was Mr. Worden who proposed the segments to Rogers, the thinking being that reaching children was essential to maintaining public support for the NASA. “I explained my idea, and he replied that it fit perfectly with a series he was filming about parents going away,” Mr. Worden wrote in his book, “Falling t o Earth.” The first meeting was a 1971 field piece at Cape Canaveral, where Rogers interviewed Mr. Worden a few days before his prelaunch quarantine period. Mr. Worden displayed the inner workings of a spacesuit as “Fred worked through a long list of kids’ questions about astronaut experiences,” Mr. Worden wrote. “I would answer many of them, but I had to confess that I couldn’t answer others until after the flight. I asked Fred to let me take the list into space,” he wrote. “I would think about them during the flight, I promised, and then answer when I returned.” In follow-up segments Mr. Worden also shared space food and described flying for three days by himself in orbit while the rest of his team was on the moon’s surface. “Fred was doing this when the space program was very new,” Ms. Whitmer said. Yo-Yo Ma Stops By A scene from one of Yo-Yo Ma's several appearances on ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."" PBS Yo-Yo Ma made several appearances on “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” the first of which was in 1985, when he played a duet with Joe Negri in Negri’s Music Shop. Mr. Ma was not yet a household name, but Rogers had read a profile of him in The New Yorker and loved classical music, so Ms. Whitmer wrote Mr. Ma and asked him to appear on the show. “Fred was a musician, so he understood how hard Yo-Yo Ma had to practice,” Ms. Whitmer said. “He understood the brilliant craftsmanship and the music.” Other appearances by Mr. Ma would include a sweet Father’s Day segment, when he played a duet with his son in 1990. Rogers Takes On Divorce Rogers devoted multiple episodes in the 1981 to discussing divorce. PBS In 1981, Rogers devoted several episodes to an unusual topic for a children’s show: divorce. His staff convinced him that parental separations had become common enough that children needed to understand how to deal with the potentially traumatic experience. During an episode that aired Feb. 16, Mr. McFeely — the postman from the Speedy Delivery Service played by David Newell — becomes visibly uncomfortable in discussing divorce and hurries out of Rogers’s house. At this point, Rogers, in his genial, friendly manner, explained the concept to children, a soft piano tinkling in the background. “I know a little girl and a little boy whose mother and father got a divorce,” he said. “And those children cried and cried. You know why? Well, one reason was that they thought it was their fault. But of course, it wasn’t their fault. Things like weddings and having babies and buying houses and cars and getting divorces are all grown-up things.” Ms. Whitmer said, “For him, that was one of the really important things: People get married. They think it’s going to work, and it just doesn’t. Sometimes it just doesn’t work out and it’s nobody’s fault, and it’s especially not your fault.” She added: “That was important for a lot of adults to hear, as well as kids.” A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2018, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Much More Than That Cardigan.

Mariella Moon,"In a tweet elaborating on the results of its investigation, Coinbase said that Visa payments on its website glitched, because the credit card network has changed the Merchant Category Code (MCC) for digital currency purchases. The new code apparently allows credit card providers to treat cryptocurrency buys as ""cash advance"" in order to charge additional fees. A Coinbase staff member revealed the code change in a Reddit post in early February, shortly before a bunch of banks decided to ban digital coin purchases using credit cards. The banks cited cryptocurrency's volatile nature and the risks associated with it as the reason behind the ban. Visa, however, denied that it's to blame for the incidents. Its official statement published by CNET reads: ""Visa has not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions that are being reported. We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue.

"Staff writer, AFP","The family of John Chau, the American missionary and explorer who was killed last week on a remote island in the Indian Ocean, do not want authorities to seek justice for his death. Chau, 27, was killed on North Sentinel Island as he attempted to make contact with the Sentinelese, an isolated Stone Age tribe. Chau approached the island in a kayak with the intention of bringing the word of God to the world’s oldest tribe. He was killed with a bow and arrow and his body is believed to be still on the island, buried in sand. The Sentinelese are thought to have lived on the island for 30,000 years but have had very little contact with outsiders. North Sentinel island is part of the far flung Andaman Islands in the vast Bay of Bengal. The region is home to five Stone Age tribes — which anthropologists believe to be the last of their kind and are dwindling in numbers. The family of Chau posted a statement to his Instagram account saying that they forgave the tribe reportedly responsible for his death. RELATED: Slain missionary’s crazy plan to convert world’s most reclusive tribe RELATED: Traumatic history of isolated tribe who killed American missionary While the Sentinelese have been cut off from the rest of the world for decades they are a protected group under the government of India, which lies to the West of the island. Chau seems to have been aware of the risks he was taking by visiting the tribe. He had made several attempts to reach the Sentinelese to preach Christianity — knowing it was illegal to go within five kilometres of the island. He wrote to his family and told them not to blame the Sentinelese if he did not return safely. Indian police are trying to launch a murder investigation against the people who assisted Chau get to the prohibited island, and possibly against those on the island who killed him — if they can themselves set foot ashore safely. But John and Lynda Chau, who lived in Washington State on the West Coast of the United States, do not seek retribution for the life of their son. “He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.” “We forgive those reportedly responsible for his death. We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands,” the family said in their Instagram statement. BODY COULD BE LOST IN BATTLE TO PRESERVE TRIBE The body of John Chau may never be recovered from the lost island where he fell in a volley of arrows fired by a reclusive tribe whose existence is threatened by the modern world, say experts. The menace to the Sentinelese from Chau’s one-man invasion is such that tribal rights specialists say no murder charges will ever be laid and Chau’s body will have to stay hidden to protect what is probably the world’s last pre-neolithic tribe. Indian authorities — who do not dare enforce their rule over North Sentinel island — have not even tried to send police ashore to question the tribe who have been greeting outsiders with hostility for centuries. Police sent a boat near North Sentinel for the second time since the killing on Friday. “Due precautions were taken by the team to ensure that this particularly vulnerable tribal group are not disturbed and distressed during this exercise,” said a police statement. Fears that 21st century diseases as mild as the common cold could kill off the tribe, or that experiencing electricity and the internet would devastate their lifestyle, has left them in a guarded bubble that Chau sought to burst with his “Jesus loves you” message. Pankaj Sekhsaria, a tribal rights expert and author on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said it would be “a futile exercise” to try to retrieve Chau’s body. “I don’t think it is a good idea to go anywhere near (North Sentinel) because it will create conflict with the community there,” he told AFP. “I don’t believe there is any safe way to retrieve the body without putting both the Sentinelese and those attempting it at risk,” added Sophie Grig, senior researcher for Survival International which campaigns for such isolated groups. ‘LET THEM BE THE WAY THEY ARE’ Anup Kapoor, an anthropology professor at the University of Delhi, said that anyone wanting to open a dialogue with the Sentinelese had to show they were “on the same level.” “Don’t wear anything,” he recommended. “Only then you can hope to have some sort of interaction.” Mr Kapoor once had contacts with the Onge, another Andamans tribe, adding: “It was only after I took off my clothes, except my underwear.” The lack of knowledge of the Sentinelese, believed to be the last surviving descendants of the first humans to arrive in Asia — and who 13th century adventurer Marco Polo called “brutish and savage” — is the main handicap. “We have no clue about their communication systems, their history and culture, how can we go anywhere near them,” said Mr Kapoor. “What we know is that they have been killed and persecuted historically by the British and the Japanese. They hate anyone in uniform. If they see someone in uniform, they will kill him on the spot. “Let them be the way they are. Leave them in peace in the ecosystem they are in. Do not disturb them because that will only make them more aggressive,” says Mr Kapoor. DOUBLE DILEMMA Police in the Indian Ocean paradise are now wrestling with a double dilemma: how to answer the prayers of Chau’s family and maintain the privacy around North Sentinel that is essential for the tribe’s survival. Andamans police chief Dependra Pathak has said no timeline can be given for finding a body. And Sekhsaria warned Indian authorities may now have to strengthen surveillance around North Sentinel to prevent a Chau copycat. “The administration is seized of the matter, they are already thinking about the surveillance,” he said without giving detail. Indian outsiders have had a rough reception when going to North Sentinel. Arrows were fired at a helicopter that checked on the tribe after the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Two fishermen who strayed too close in 2006 were killed. Police are talking with anthropologists and tribal welfare experts about the best way to establish contact. The Anthropological Survey of India has had previous rudimentary contact. “When we went there, nothing happened,” said the survey’s Andaman chief C. Raghu. “Our seniors visited the island and they came back. It is because we are experts and know the pulse of the people. “It’s not just the risk of disease. You also have to think of how to handle yourself, what to say and what to share with them. To them, whoever gets there is from the outside, new world.”","Missionary's one man invasion resulting in his death was his own fault, says family NEWS.com.au The family of John Chau, the American missionary and explorer who was killed last week on a remote island in the Indian Ocean, do not want authorities to seek just…",2018-11-24T13:47:12Z,"{'id': 'news-com-au', 'name': 'News.com.au'}","Missionary's one man invasion resulting in his death was his own fault, says family - NEWS.com.au",https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/missionarys-one-man-invasion-resulting-in-his-death-was-his-own-fault-says-family/news-story/dd58a160f75a5b240c33f3bf074f0fc6,https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c85fafea568b965e1e9be4a12659a84e?width=650,news-com-au,News.com.au,fault,1
Bill Bradley,"What just happened? “ The Walking Dead ” aired one of its best Season 8 episodes, “The Key,” on Sunday, but there’s one lingering question — and I’m not even talking about that mysterious new group that showed up. Uh, did the show just kill Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)? In the episode, the Saviors ― led, of course, by Negan ― drive over to Hilltop to stage an attack against their rivals with zombie-blood-tainted weapons. The idea is that even a nick will cause victims to fall ill with the zombie virus. In fact, a good bit of time is dedicated to showing us that Negan has undeniably covered his barbed-wire-wrapped baseball bat, Lucille, with zombie blood. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) has other plans. He sniffs out the specific vehicle with Negan onboard and rams into him, leading to a car chase. In the process, Rick causes Negan’s car to wreck, and the two end up pursuing each other on foot through an abandoned building with walkers inside. That’s pretty baller. But this is where it gets weird. Rick ends up procuring Lucille, and while struggling with Negan, pretty clearly hits him in the arm with the bat. Sure, Negan is wearing a leather jacket, so the barbs would’ve had to penetrate the sturdy material ― and Rick did light the bat on fire before he hit him. But that bat had been sitting in a bucket of zombie blood, basically just marinating, prior to the fight. I’m not familiar with the rules of sterilizing a zombie blood-infused baseball bat, but even if it was lit afire, I’d advise against getting slammed in the arm with one. The show moves past this moment pretty quickly, though. We’d probably ignore the hit entirely if not for the death of Carl (Chandler Riggs) earlier in Season 8. Carl died as a result of a zombie bite obtained in Episode 6, “The King, the Widow, and Rick.” Fans didn’t even notice the bite had occurred until a couple episodes later. Back to Sunday’s episode: Negan eventually escapes Rick and wakes up in a car, having been kidnapped by Jadis ( Pollyanna McIntosh ), former leader of the Scavengers. She soon knocks him out, but why was he unconscious in the first place? Could he have perhaps been feeling the effects of the zombie virus? Listen, anything is possible. After all, in “The Walking Dead” comics, Negan and Carl had a lot of storyline that wasn’t included in the show. Following Carl’s death, Negan actor Morgan posted a tribute to Riggs, citing the Carl-and-Negan dynamic as a big reason he joined the show, adding that he’ll “forever be disappointed” that the two couldn’t play out that relationship more. Now that there’s no Carl, could Negan be a goner, too? A new villain may have already replaced him. After Negan didn’t return to the Saviors, Simon (Steven Ogg), one of Negan’s top guys, stepped up and told the group to basically eliminate the Hilltop. Negan originally just wanted to hurt some of the rivals, turning them into zombies to scare others into submission. Simon is an even more malevolent presence than Negan right now. Beyond all this, a new group showed up and gave Maggie (Lauren Cohan) food and infrastructure information in exchange for music records. (They could be a teaser for the Commonwealth, an elitist group in the “Walking Dead” comics.) Oh, there was also a naked zombie. Who cares, though? If the show kills off Negan this soon, what the crap is even going on? In all likelihood, Negan will live. Why wouldn’t he live? But if you asked me before Season 8, I’d probably have said the same thing about Carl. What a trip. Carl, seriously, why’d you have to trip? me @ carl when he died from tripping over a tree root after proving numerous times that he’s great at at surviving pic.twitter.com/cGwq14WfK0 — chandler riggs (@chandlerriggs) March 12, 2018","Carl, this is all your fault.",2018-03-19T02:07:57Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Did A Major Negan Twist Slyly Happen On ‘Walking Dead’?,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/did-a-major-negan-twist-slyly-happen-on-walking-dead_us_5aac1b34e4b0c33361b05a81,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac20911f00002d0016aa34.jpeg?cache=uxroxyxywl&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,fault,1
News18.com,"""This is one of New Zealand's darkest days,"" said the country's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern hours after a man dressed in a military-style, camouflage outfit, and carrying an automatic rifle shot and killed 40 people at two mosques in Christchurch. The gunman believed to be a 28-year old Australian Brenton Tarrant live streamed the episode on Facebook. Moments before the shooting occurred, the gunman is heard saying, Remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie. 
The attacks began at about 1:40 p.m., not long after the midday Friday prayer, when the mosques would be most busy. The 17-minute video, which appeared to be recorded on a helmet camera, shows him driving to the mosque as he says ""let's get this party started"". This is followed by visuals of him firing on the worshipers in one of the mosques. He then flees the building, runs back to his car and brings out another weapon. Soon after he is seen re-entering the mosque and again begins shooting. 
 Hours later, PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, 29-year-old YouTuber and comedian with 89 million subscribers, tweeted, ""I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person. My heart and thoughts go out to the victims, families and everyone affected by this tragedy.""Just heard news of the devastating reports from New Zealand Christchurch.

Soon after the world heard the gunman utter 'PewDiePie', hate had begun on the Internet. 
But thankfully, there are sane people too in this world. And on the Internet. At the time of writing this, #PewdiPie is trending on Twitter and lots of them have come out to show support to the YouTuber.

Jayson MacLean,"Measles, a highly contagious disease once thought all but eradicated in the developed world, is making a comeback, and its all thanks to anti-immunization efforts in recent years, says a recent report from the World Health Organization which says a record number of measles cases were reported in Europe in 2018, due in part to growing pockets of the population where parents are refusing to immunize their children.
“Progress has been uneven between and within countries, leaving increasing clusters of susceptible individuals unprotected, and resulting in a record number of people affected by the virus in 2018,” the report states.
The report comes as both Canada and the United States face another year of measles outbreaks such as one currently underway in Washington State and Oregon, where support for anti-vaccination has been notable. In Canada, a Vancouver man was diagnosed this past Thursday with the virus but is said to have passed the period during which it is considered infectious.
In Toronto, public health authorities last week warned that some travellers through Pearson International Airport on January 27 may have been exposed to measles.
Below: ‘This is ridiculous’: Measles outbreak in Europe
The WHO report on measles in Europe found that the virus killed 72 children and adults in the European Region in 2018, while 82,596 people in 47 of 53 countries contracted measles, a number which is the highest it has been this decade.
At the same time, 2018 followed a year in which Europe achieved its highest-ever coverage for the second dose of measles vaccination at the national level, showing that gaps at subnational levels are to blame for the diseases resurfacing.

The picture for 2018 makes it clear that the current pace of progress in raising immunization rates will be insufficient to stop measles circulation. While data indicate exceptionally high immunization coverage at regional level, they also reflect a record number affected and killed by the disease. This means that gaps at local level still offer an open door to the virus, says Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, Director of the WHOs Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen.
Since 2010, immunization coverage has dropped in 12 European Union countries, while seven out of the ten countries with the lowest vaccine confidence in the world are in Europe. In Italy, where the current governing coalition had pledged to drop a law banning children without vaccination from starting pre-school (the coalition has since reversed its position), health officials have declared a measles emergency, as almost one quarter of all measles cases in Europe in 2017 were reported in Italy.","Measles, a highly contagious disease once thought all but eradicated in the developed world, is making a comeback, and it’s all thanks to anti-immunization efforts in recent years, says a recent report from the World Health Organization which says a record nu…",2019-02-10T23:18:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cantechletter.com'}","Measles outbreaks are the fault of anti-vaxxers, says World Health Organization - Cantech Letter",https://www.cantechletter.com/2019/02/measles-outbreaks-are-the-fault-of-anti-vaxxers-says-world-health-organization/,https://www.cantechletter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/measles.jpg,,Cantechletter.com,fault,1

https://www.facebook.com/anne.gearan,"At the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Riyadh agents allegedly kidnapped, killed and dismembered a dissident journalist who was writing for The Washington Post in exile. In China, the head of Interpol was abducted and imprisoned by authorities in Beijing while his wife was reportedly threatened with death back home in France. And in the Netherlands, Dutch authorities last week expelled four Russians who were caught with espionage equipment as part of an alleged hacking operation at an Amsterdam hotel. These and other brazen operations in recent months illustrate the hands-off posture taken by President Trump toward many authoritarian leaders particularly those he views as allies or potential allies who have treated him kindly. Even as the Trump administration issues harsh condemnations and vows of retaliation, the president has appeared hesitant and at times even reluctant to forcefully challenge the leaders of such countries accused of abuses. He has praised Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin as partners, dropped his previous criticism of North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns human rights violations and has spoken approvingly of the harsh law enforcement tactics employed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. In the disappearance of Post Opinons contributor Kamal Khashoggi, Trump pledged Wednesday to seek answers from Saudi Arabia, but stopped short of threatening consequences if the prominent government critic has been harmed. The presidents remarks were his strongest to date about the Khashoggi case, which has become a test of whether his approach has encouraged some dictators to commit audacious acts without fear of U.S. reprisals. We want to see whats going on there, Trump said when asked about Khashoggi, who went missing in Turkey on Oct. 2. Thats a bad situation. Frankly, because its a reporter, you could say in many respects, it brings it to a level. Its a very serious situation for us. The government of Turkey and members of Congress from both parties are demanding a full accounting of whether Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, was lured to the Saudi consulate in Isanbul to be killed. They are also calling on the Trump administration to impose consequences for Riyadhs actions. U.S. officials said Trump prefers quiet inquiries and pressure, when necessary, in dealing with partners and leaders he respects. He has said that he avoided public confrontation with Putin over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the aim of helping Trump. The president resisted and delayed punitive sanctions against Russia in what his critics said was, at best, a naive attempt to forge better relations. After threatening to totally destroy North Korea last year, Trump now refrains from using even the mild diplomatic term for his sanctions campaign, maximum pressure, in hopes of fostering talks with Kim. Past presidents have also accommodated dictators and adjusted their rhetoric to serve what they judge to be U.S. interests. In the case of Saudi Arabia, both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of coddling the nation with the worlds largest oil reserves. But Trumps apparent willingness to look the other way at recent Saudi overreach in its war in Yemen while also siding with the kingdom in its dispute with fellow U.S. ally Qatar may have emboldened the kingdom to think that Trump would ignore a move against Khashoggi, human rights advocates and others said. President Trumps response that, I dont really know much about it, is anemic, said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who helped lead a bipartisan letter urging Trump to demand immediate answers from both Saudi Arabia and Turkey. You get a daily intelligence briefing, and surely you have been briefed on the details, Connolly said in an interview. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said a state-sanctioned murder would cross every line of normality in the international community and there would be hell to pay. The United States has limited authority to hold Saudi Arabia or other nations accountable for actions taken on foreign soil or against non-Americans. But Trump, like other U.S. presidents, holds great potential power over friendly nations by encouraging or discouraging certain behavior. Trump told reporters Wednesday that he has spoken with Saudi Arabia at the highest level, although he did not give details. The White House and State Department later said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have addressed the case with senior Saudi leaders. Im not happy about it, Trump said, adding that we are demanding everything. It matters whether Trump himself does the asking or the shaming, said Sarah Sewall, who served as a top State Department official for human rights issues in the Obama administration. Whats so dispiriting is to see the president throwing away 70 years of accrued commitment, bipartisan commitment, to America promoting human rights and freedom in the world, said Sewall, now a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Weve always done it imperfectly, but under this administration there is... a reductionist view of the world where they either like you or not as a government, and if they like you the administration ignores or even praises what you do in contravention of international human rights standards. Trumps approach does not treat all authoritarians the same. He is critical of the leaders of Iran, Venezuela and Cuba on human rights grounds, and has sought to impose sanctions and withdraw diplomatic engagement with each. His administration has been especially critical of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, an anti-American leftist. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a harsh condemnation of the death of an opposition politician in that country. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Washington is seeking answers in both that case and Khashoggis. That alarming detention does call for a thoroughly independent investigation free of the regimes interference, and that tragedy highlights a continuing pattern of human rights abuses in that country, repression, and excessive use of force, Palladino said of the arrest and death of Fernando Alban in Venezuela. In the case of what were talking about in Turkey, were calling for a full and transparent investigation to understand whats transpired. We are trying to get to the bottom of it and were looking for answers. So far, the Trump administration seems to be asking Saudi Arabia to investigate itself, while not threatening consequences for the U.S. relationship, Connolly said. Every day that goes by where we just tsk, tsk, is another day we say to the crown prince, Don't worry about us, and that is exactly the wrong signal and the wrong response, Connolly said.","Washington Post 'Don't worry about us': Critics fault Trump's hands-off response to autocrat abuses Washington Post At the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Riyadh agents allegedly kidnapped, killed and dismembered a dissident journalist who was writing for The Wa…",2018-10-10T23:13:13Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",'Don't worry about us': Critics fault Trump's hands-off response to autocrat abuses - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dont-worry-about-us-critics-fault-trumps-hands-off-response-to-autocrat-abuses/2018/10/10/d977fcce-cc9a-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5wSf00FBZMgZYOuYv-wQNs1TRsM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X5CBKGGM4AI6RI7GITNKHU263Y.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,fault,1

Sinéad Baker,"Researchers have found unexpected movements six miles underground near the San Andreas Fault as scientists reiterate warnings about an inevitable ""big one"" — a powerful earthquake that could devastate California. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studied thousands of small earthquakes near the fault and found that they ""move in a different way than expected."" This movement, which they called a ""deep creep,"" could help them understand the process leading up to a large and damaging earthquake, the university said. While these earthquakes move differently to how a big earthquake along the San Andreas Fault would, the new findings come as scientists repeat longstanding warnings about the huge earthquake that is overdue to hit California. The data cannot be used to predict when this big earthquake will hit, the researchers warned, but they hope to keep staying smaller earthquakes to learn how the fault is loaded. ""If we can understand how they are being loaded maybe we can understand better when these faults may be going to rupture,"" researchers said. John Vidale, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, told Newsweek on Saturday that this huge earthquake is ""an inevitability"" as energy has been building up along the fault for more than a century. ""We just don't know if it's going to be now or 200 years from now."" Layers of earthquake-twisted ground at the San Andreas Fault. David McNew/Getty Images San Franciso and Los Angeles are at risk. The impact of a northern earthquake, which would run through San Francisco, would be ""tremendous,"" Vidale said. ""Downtown San Francisco is vulnerable — some of the oldest buildings survived the shaking back in 1906, but that doesn't mean they'd be safe in the next earthquake by any means. Many of the buildings are built close to the fault and on kind of soft ground that might liquify."" The biggest concern in the US after an earthquake, he said, is the cost of repairs and the damage to the economy. ""It's certainly in the realm of possibility that the earthquake causes something that cripples the economy for a long time."" The large number of smaller earthquakes, like those the researchers have been studying, do little to release that energy, Vidale said. ""Those little earthquakes let out only a tiny amount of energy compared to the big ones. It would take 10 magnitude seven earthquakes to let out the strain of a magnitude eight.

Aimée Lutkin,"When you make a mistake, admitting it and making amends is generally the best course of actionbut sometimes its not really your responsibility.
Some people may not even realize that theyre taking responsibility for stuff, but consider how often you apologize when someone else bumps into you, or say, Im sorry, in response to somebodys complaint about traffic. The Savvy Psychologist, Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, wrote about the ways taking responsibility can go overboard for Quick Dirty Tips, but surprisingly she starts out with how it can be good.
It makes people like you
Hendriksen shares a study from the Harvard Business School and Wharton in which people asked to borrow someones cell phone on a rainy day. In some cases, they would first apologize for the weather, then ask to borrow the phone; in others they just asked to borrow the phone. When starting with an apology for something entirely not their fault (rain), they were able to borrow a phone 47 percent of the time. If they just asked for the phone, there was only a 9 percent phone borrowing success rate:
Why? Taking responsibility is a show of empathy. The apology isnt necessarily remorseful; instead, its recognition of and concern for someone elses experience.
Id also venture that in this weather case, its indicating that youre all experiencing something togetherterrible weather. It creates a bond in just a few simple words, though that could be achieved without the actual apology, by saying, Terrible weather today!
You can use taking too much responsibility as a way to get people to like you, neutralize bad feelings, and set folks at ease. But thats about all the good it does.
It can cause excessive guilt
The previous example indicates that the person apologizing has some larger motive and understanding of what theyre doing. However, constant apologizing can become compulsive. Youre not in control of it, you just feel chronic guilt for things that are legitimately out of your control. Guilt is only appropriate when youve actually done something wrong. 
Hendriksen says she treats some clients with OCD who take responsibility for everything to the detriment of their lives. As an example, Hendriksen mentions a patient who was having difficulty driving because they felt responsible for every bump in the road. If feelings of guilt are interfering with your ability to function on a daily basis, it might be time to assess where these feelings are coming from, perhaps with a mental health professional.

When an apology is a means of avoiding conflict
This is sort of on the fence; sometimes avoiding conflict is not only necessary, but less emotionally taxing than apologizing when you did nothing wrong. It might make sense for you to apologize to your boss for a mess up so you can move forward with your meeting or say sorry to someone fuming over you bumping into them at the grocery store.
Sometimes, though, avoiding conflict with an apology becomes a pattern, because youre too scared to say how you really feel. This can become a problem, especially within close relationships:
In trying to keep the peace, wed rather shoulder more than our fair share of burden than risk a difficult conversation, or worse, a confrontation involving anger or rejection. Its easier to expand the scope of our responsibilities than to risk upsetting or disappointing people we care about.
Sometimes an honest conversation will benefit a situation far more than an apology, if you are brave enough to admit that it wasnt your fault.
Taking responsibility makes you feel important
Admit ittheres something pretty narcissistic about taking responsibility for everything. Are you omniscient? All powerful? You must be if everything happening on earth has to do with you. Maybe you need this sense of power in your life, but keep in mind how it might be diminishing the people around you and their agency. A parent who never lets their kid responsibility for their actions isnt allowing them to grow. A partner mired in guilt over accidentally choosing a lousy restaurant isnt a good date. You cant be in control of everything and probably no one you know wants you to be.
How to break the habit
If you can see where taking too much responsibility is harming you, here are some ways to start breaking the habit. Hendriksen recommends three strategies for learning to healthily step away and respond to situations more realistically:
Relinquish responsibility
Look at the things in your life you dont need to be in charge of and hand over the reins. The best way to do this is through communicationan example Hendriksen gives is letting a teen kid know theyre now responsible for getting themselves up in time for school, not just letting them sleep in with no notice:
Finally, when you relinquish, fully relinquish. Its tempting to be a safety net or to manage from the sidelines, but trust that your loved one is capable and creative, even if he racks up a few tardies before all the kinks are worked out of the system.
Accept help
Help can be defined as delegating tasks to people who offer to pitch in, but also learning to accept a compliment, accept tomatoes from your neighbors garden without worrying that now you have to give her a cucumber. Think of it as sharing that feeling of competence and importance of responsibility rather than as placing a burden on another.
Shift your thinking to helping others
That shift in thinking is key. Youre helping someone by allowing them to take responsibility for their own life and behavior. And if you consider sharing responsibility as helping others, you still get to feel important.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","The Nixon Ridge Pipeline in West Virginia exploded spectacularly Thursday, creating a fireball visible for miles. While TransCanada is still investigating why exactly this brand new, “ best-in-class ” pipeline blew up, we can offer some informed speculation. After all, this is not the first natural gas pipeline to explode. All it takes for a pipeline to go boom is fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source. Lucky for TransCanada, this recent explosion happened in a remote part of Moundsville, hurting no one. In 2010, a Pacific Gas &amp; Energy-owned pipeline in San Bruno, California, exploded, killing eight people and destroying an entire neighborhood. The pipeline system in which the Nixon Ridge line sits, Leach Xpress, runs 160 miles through Ohio and northwestern West Virginia. It can move 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day. While we don’t quite know yet what went happened that caused part of the line to explode, it’s not hard to guess. The common factor in just about any gas pipeline explosion is a leak, explained Najmedin Meshkati, an environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California who’s investigated previous pipeline explosions. “The leak and the gas provide the fuel for you that should not have been there if the pipeline integrity was there,” Meshkati told Earther. With a little lightning or even static electricity from the pipeline rubbing on soil, a leak can become an explosion. Sometimes, the leak can result from pipeline corrosion, which can occur due to old age or a chemical reaction inside the pipeline. “The corrosion eats the body of a pipeline... and when it gets eaten, the pipeline metal gets thinner and thinner, so it gets weaker,” Meshtaki said. That’s one way a pipeline may explode. But this TransCanada line is just six months old, so it’s unclear how likely corrosion’s at fault. In fact, it might not have been entirely the company’s fault at all. During any type of construction, people could be unknowingly digging or drilling where there’s pipeline underneath. This could also create a leak. The thing is, though, these leaks become explosions when they go undetected. A company’s safety culture is really what’s key, Meshkati said. Did the company create a risk assessment for the project? How often was the company checking the line for corrosion? What’re the consequences for a pipeline operator who wrongly suspects a leak and shuts down a pipeline in response? Earther has asked TransCanada these very questions and will update this post if we hear back. In the case of the San Bruno explosion, the California Public Utility Commission concluded in 2015 that the company’s culture prioritized “profits over safety,” putting people’s lives at risk. We’ll have to wait and what lessons come out of this TransCanada explosion.","The Nixon Ridge Pipeline in West Virginia exploded spectacularly Thursday, creating a fireball visible for miles.

THOMAS ERDBRINK,"Iranian officials put the epicenter of the quake inside Iran, near the border town of Ezgeleh. The region is a patchwork of farms and is home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran. Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, some 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage. The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Kerbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake occurred. Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When ordinary Iranians learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts, some started organizing aid groups themselves. In 2003, more than 20,000 people were killed and an ancient citadel was destroyed in the southern city of Bam. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.

Kevin Loria,"Stokkete/Shutterstock Being a night owl comes with a 10% higher risk of death than being a morning person, according to a new study. The study also found that night owls have a higher risk for a variety of physical and mental ailments. But being a night owl or morning person is largely a biological fact, not just a preference. Because of that, researchers think that allowing people to have more flexible schedules that fit their internal body clocks could improve their health. Being a night owl is a fact of biology, not a choice. But unfortunately, it comes with a range of health risks. These include cardiovascular disease, higher rates of obesity and smoking, psychiatric disorders, and an overall 10% increased risk for death, according to a study newly published in the journal Chronobiology International. We all have an internal body clock, known as a chronotype or circadian rhythm, that determines when we feel most awake or sleepy. This is what defines night owls, larks — morning people — and those who fall in between, and this rhythm has a significant effect on how our bodies function. This new study is one of the most extensive to see how much of a role chronotype has on risk for death and other health conditions. The researchers behind the study took a look at 504,642 people aged between 37 and 73 from the UK Biobank cohort. They initially assessed study participants between 2006 and 2010 and followed up on those people in an average of 6.5 years. To figure out whether participants identified as a morning person or night owl, the study authors asked people if they were more of or definitely a morning person or if they were more of or definitely an evening person — and gave them a ""don't know"" option as well. Asking people about their chronotype is a great way of assessing a person's body clock, with a very strong correlation to the major questionnaire or quiz researchers use to tell what a person's body clock is. (Most people know whether they are a morning person, night owl, or somewhere in between.) Out of the 433,268 people that answered the chronotype question and provided sufficient health data, 27% were definite morning types, 35% moderate morning types, 28% moderate evening types, and 9% definite evening types. Along with the 10% increased risk of death compared to definite morning types, the more people identified as evening people, the greater their risk for a variety of medical conditions. Definitive night owls had almost double the risk of suffering from psychological disorders, about a 30% increased risk for diabetes, a 25% increased risk for neurological conditions, 23% increased risk for gastrointestinal disorders, and a 22% increased risk for respiratory disorders. Young people tend to naturally be night owls, something that can shift throughout life. Theo Wargo/Getty Images This is an incredibly large group of people to study and this is the first time a population has been studied with the intention of assessing how chronotype affects mortality from the start. The big question to ask is why having a preference for sleeping in takes such a toll on health. Most researchers agree that a large part of what defines your chronotype is genetic — both whether you are more of a morning person or night person and how much you have the ability to shift that ""preference."" In the study, the researchers say that estimates are that between 21% and 52% of what determines chronotype has genetic roots. Most people can change their chronotype to at least some extent, especially if they are careful about light exposure, otherwise we'd never be able to adjust to a new time zone. But overall, the tendency to feel more alert and alive in the morning or evening remains, no matter how much people try to change it. One of the main reasons researchers think evening people tend to have these health conditions is that their body clocks aren't properly aligned with society. There's probably a variety of evolutionary reasons for a preference for night to exist, but many of these needs may not correspond with the demands of the modern industrial world. Everything from work time to meal time occurs at a time that doesn't feel right for night owls, a state that researchers call ""social jetlag."" Generally, if people prefer to go to bed later and wake up later on days they don't have to work, they're probably suffering from at least some degree of social jetlag. Since it's only possible to shift body clocks so much, the authors of the study suggest that flexible work schedules that accommodate different body clocks could improve health — and probably productivity as well. Teenagers tend to naturally have later chronotypes (body clocks shift throughout life and most teens are night owls), and a growing body of research has shown that shifting school start times later improves school performance. That's been shown in the US and also recently demonstrated in a new study out of Singapore. Getting some rest when your body wants it can improve your health — and probably your life, too.","Being a night owl comes with a 10% higher risk of death than being a morning person, according to a new study.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

Harrison Weber,"When Hawaii accidentally terrified residents earlier this month with a push notification about an imminent “ BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT,” the Internet seemed to cry out in unison: Okay, who pushed the wrong button? An employee at Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency was apparently responsible for the error. Intending only to test the state’s missile alert system internally, the employee clicked a wrong button or link by mistake and sounded a very real alarm, leaving people uncertain about whether their very lives were at stake. The agency only recently restarted internal drills for the Cold War-era system. Yet when the Honolulu Civil Beat published an alleged photo of the alarm system’s interface, it seemed clear—at least to many designers—that the employee was not entirely at fault. As many outlets have pointed out, it was a design problem, because the interface looked like it had been made to deliberately confuse whoever had the sorry responsibility of actually using it. This image drove UX designers into a state of rage and sent commentators into action, who explored the usability of warfare and compared the design to Mailchimp’s far more ominous-looking deletion alert. And now there is even an independently run contest on design crowdsourcing site Freelancer, which is seeking entries for a better design. The site itself is funding the contest and will reward $150 to the winner. There are 146 submissions to date, many of which are hideous and none of which will probably wind up changing how HEMA thinks about design. But to be fair, this also isn’t a competition over aesthetics. It’s possible to create a very ugly design that’s simultaneously easy to use, just as it’s possible to create something attractive and trendy that’s a confusing nightmare. Here’s a handful of the entries: The story surrounding the graphic, it turns out, is more complicated than it originally seemed. The Civil Beat later reported that the photo it published did not actually depict the interface that was used to trigger the alarm. The distributed image was apparently just a mockup. “[The] State of Hawaii is saying the original screenshot shared with the media is merely an example and has shared a second image saying it is another example of the user interface. Neither screenshot shows the actual interface used by the operator,” reported the Civil Beat. The agency apparently “can’t publicize the actual screen because of security concerns.” Right. So let’s see the agency’s best approximation of the interface. Neither HEMA graphics conjure up, say, the sort of image you might have imaged would be present in a missile alert system—like, say, some sort of big red or green button? Simply because there are fewer options present, this interface is a lot easier to read. But could better design really have prevented the error, and going forward, prevent future false alarms? At this point, it may not be possible to reach a verdict without seeing the actual design, and the missing context surrounding these options further muddies the situation. What designs proceed the interface above? What do other, comparable alert interfaces look like? This information isn’t readily available. An entirely different kind of solution may come to fruition. Yesterday Senator Brian Schatz called for a law that would ban state and local governments from issuing missile alerts, Reuters reported. Both the House of Representatives and Senate have additional hearings planned on the matter. The FCC is also investigating the matter. The employee responsible for the alert is apparently “refusing to cooperate” with the FCC’s investigation, according to the agency’s public safety head, Lisa M. Fowlkes. It’s not clear why this anonymous government employee is allegedly avoiding the FCC, but at least they can rest easy at night knowing that designers on the internet genuinely don’t believe they are entirely at fault.

Abhishyant Kidangoor,"In a recently released trailer for PM Narendra Modi, a biopic of the Indian prime minister, actor Vivek Oberoi, playing the Indian leader, stares angrily into the camera and declares: “I am a warning Pakistan: if you dare raise your hand against us again, we will chop it off.” 
That would be inflammatory at the best of times, but this comes just weeks after tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors escalated to alarming levels, following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir on Feb. 14 that killed 40 Indian military personnel. It was purportedly carried out by the same Pakistan-based terrorist outfit responsible for a 2016 attack on an Indian Army brigade that killed 17.
The 2016 attack (and a subsequent retaliatory operation by India) was the subject of its own Bollywood release on Jan. 11, Uri: The Surgical Strike, which also featured a fictionalized portrayal of Modi. Such films, coming so soon before India’s general election begins on Apr. 11, have drawn fire from opposition politicians, who say they are little more than propaganda. While PM Narendra Modi, which releases on Apr. 5, has no reported financial ties to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Oberoi is a staunch Modi supporter, and BJP leaders also attended promotional events for the film.
“They are doing hagiographical portrayals of real-life characters without looking at the subtler nuances of politics,” Namrata Joshi, a film critic with Indian newspaper The Hindu, tells TIME.
Uri, the highest grossing Bollywood film so far in 2019, certainly sparked a wave of jingoism across the country. “How’s the josh?”—a popular exhortation from the film (josh means passion or zeal)—went viral on social media and has been uttered by Modi and other senior ministers at public events. References to the film were also made in the wake of the Kashmir attack, when the cinematic image of Modi as a strong patriarch, able to take on India’s enemies, found resonance among the many who called for stern action against Pakistan.
There have been films attacking Modi’s political enemies as well. The Accidental Prime Minister, released on the same day as Uri, was a damning depiction of the 2004 to 2014 tenure of India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh of the Indian National Congress. It also took a dig at Modi’s primary political rival, current Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was portrayed as confused and lacking confidence. Unsurprisingly, the film was enthusiastically talked-up by the BJP.
Experts say such films can play a role in changing public perception among India’s large numbers of illiterate adults, who are voracious consumers of television and movies.
Not to be outdone, supporters of opposition leader Gandhi will be flocking to his biopic, My Name is RaGa, which is expected to release sometime in April. The trailer shows the fictionalized Gandhi invoking the memories of his father and grandmother, both former prime ministers and both assassinated, calling them martyrs who gave their lives for the country.
“Bollywood is not just a form of entertainment but also a parallel form of information which serves as a form of visual literacy for people from the lower and lower-middle class,” Rajinder Dudrah, professor of cultural studies at Birmingham University in the U.K., tells TIME.
The movie industry plays such a central role in popular Indian culture that several prominent actors have even found a place in temples, where they are literally idolized and worshiped. Many actors have also parlayed their on-screen reputations into successful, real-life political careers. Some call this a form of exploitation.
“It is all about working the optics and colonizing the minds of the audience,” Shubhra Gupta, a film critic with The Indian Express, tells TIME. “A narrative is being built clearly, smartly and very insidiously.”

Chris Kohler,"If the president of Koei Tecmo had his way, the next couple of Warriors games would be Star Wars and Mario. You can’t fault the man’s taste. Koei Tecmo occupies a uniquely strong position in the Japanese video game market, thanks in large part to the evolution of its Dynasty Warriors series into a sort of one-size-fits-all template that seems to be able to magically turn any popular media franchise or game series into a hack-and-slash button-mashing good time. Over the last decade, it’s created well-received spin-off games in a variety of popular series from other publishers: Zelda, Fire Emblem, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and more. In January of this year, Kotaku spoke with Koei Tecmo’s president Hisashi Koinuma about the future of the series. On the eve of the release of the latest crossover game— Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition for the Nintendo Switch—we thought we’d go back to this conversation to find out a bit more about what the future might hold in store, in Koinuma’s wildest dreams. “I’ve been saying this since a long time ago, but Star Wars would be a really good fit” in the Warriors series, Koinuma said. “If we could do it, I think it would be amazing.” If you’ve played any Warriors game at all, you can picture it in your mind. Luke Skywalker, mowing down a hundred Stormtroopers with an exaggeratedly powerful lightsaber? Unlocking the ability to play as prequel-era Yoda? Conceptually, it’s a perfect match. While Koinuma said that he could particularly envision Star Wars as an entry in the Warriors series, he doesn’t want to limit his options. “We are not really fanatical about having the game on the Warriors series,” he said. “As long as it is fun and enjoyable, that is the most important thing. Whether it fits the Warriors system or not.” The thing that may keep Koinuma’s dreams in a galaxy far, far away is the fact that Electronic Arts and Disney inked a deal back in 2013 that gave the game publisher the exclusive rights to create Star Wars games for the “ core gaming audience.” One would imagine that Electronic Arts would consider a Warriors game to indeed be for core gamers. Still, EA’s deal isn’t forever, and stranger things have happened. It’s clear that Koinuma isn’t giving up hope. “It’s not just about me,” he said. “If users demand or desire to have a game like that, I think that would be great. Considering the circumstances, Koinuma’s desire to do a Mario game is much more likely to bear fruit. (And yes, it’s odd to consider any scenario in which “make a Mario game” is the more likely of two choices.) Of all the partnerships Koei Tecmo has established, its relationship with Nintendo seems the strongest. Its horror series Fatal Frame is now developed jointly with Nintendo, and it’s also created entries in numerous Nintendo franchises like Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors, and Metroid: Other M. Mario seems more like a when than an if. “I’d like to have an opportunity to work on Nintendo’s Mario, ” Koinuma said. “Basically, he’s a character I’ve been playing with ever since I was a kid, so if I could do something with him, I’d be really happy.” Besides being young enough (he is 46) to have grown up with video games, Koinuma is a lifelong gaming nerd. He studied programming in college and joined Koei in 1994, before it merged with Tecmo. His first task was porting the PC action RPG game Brandish 2 to the Super Famicom. He moved into game direction and production, and to this day splits his duties between the business and creative sides. (He gave up on programming some time around 2006, though.) Much like with Star Wars, Koinuma said he’d pretty much like to work on any game featuring Mario, whether it’s a Warriors or not. “I think anything would be great,” he said. “Even a simulation would be good.” War sims like Nobunaga’s Ambition were Koei’s bread and butter before the lucrative Warriors games came along, and it still produces them today. Simulation games are how the company was able to produce other major franchise tie-ups such as Pokémon Conquest and the Japan-only Yo-Kai Watch Romance Of The Three Kingdoms. Then again, if the company were to go that route, it would probably have to pitch something significantly different than Ubisoft’s Mario and Rabbids strategy RPG. Whether Koei Tecmo ever gets its hands on Star Wars or Mario, it’s clear that Koinuma wants to continue the successful path of collaborating with companies that might otherwise be considered its rivals. “I think it’s a balance,” he said. “It’s necessary to have healthy competition in the marketplace or in the industry, but at the same time, if it’s necessary, it’s better to have a very favorable collaborative relationship as well, and nurture that.”","If the president of Koei Tecmo had his way, the next couple of Warriors games would be Star Wars and Mario.

Natalie Degraffinried,"I consider myself a veteran Etrian Odyssey player. Ive hand-drawn dozens of maps across the role-playing game series, meticulously crawled floors for every treasure chest and scripted event, and gotten hundreds of monsters in my codexconditional drops and all. So I came to the latest title in the series, Etrian Odyssey Nexus, pretty prepared for how these things gomake a guild, crawl some dungeons, maybe die once or twice or a dozen times. I was not prepared to find myself in a losing battle with my own ego as a result of refusing to lower the games difficulty, despite desperately wanting to.
My guild, which I am physically incapable of giving even a remotely serious name, is called Club 69 of RuPauls Drag Race All Stars fame. Each of my characters is named after a queen from the show, including a Gunner named Gia (Gunn) and an Arcanist named Naomi (Smalls), who has long, absurdly skinny legs like her namesake. Rounding out the team are Sovereign Bebe (Zahara Benet), Nightseeker Bianca (Del Rio), and Hero Asia (OHara)basically, my team is built around inflicting status ailments on bosses and dealing big dick damage while they flail around unable to do much.
Then theres a roster of random utility characters for gathering items and for healing my characters when I cheaply dont want to use the Inn yet, lovingly named 1 through 8. I thought about renaming them as Bidoof and Skarmory in honor of former Pokémon HM dumps but found the number method more helpful. All this to say, I have a system, and my system generally works.
Newly ready for some serious gaming with my Bad Bitch Squad (a censor-thwarted moniker which would have been my guild name if the developers at Atlus had stopped playing games with the character limit and thus my feelings), I set out into the wonderful world of Etrian Odyssey Nexus tutorial, which is in some ways meant to teach you basic mechanics but mostly meant to teach you that you can die at any goddamn moment. Yes, you, too, you dungeon-crawling scrub. 
Since I consider myself an experienced EO player and a skilled motherfucker, I decided to play the game on Heroic mode, the hardest difficulty. THIS IS WHERE I MESSED UP.
OK, so here is the thing: It wasnt actually a mistake. I am what they call a prideful jackass, and I very intentionally decided to play the game on its hardest possible difficulty for no reason other than a little voice in my head telling me that I am a Bad Bitch and do not mess around when it comes to Atlus games. (This is falseI absolutely do mess around with Atlus games and will never be caught dead playing a Shin Megami Tensei game on its hardest difficulty. Or even beating a Shin Megami Tensei game, probably, but never say never!)
Every player on every forum will very quickly tell you a harder difficulty is the proper way to play the gamemasochism is a necessary trait for most Atlus games, so Im not inclined to argue. Because I like to play my games with a healthy dose of hubris, I figured Id also try my first-ever run without a Medic or a Protector; classic jobs meant to heal and reduce party damage, respectively, so that you die less and are less helpless when you do die.
The difficulty of the new Etrian Odyssey is fine. It doesnt feel unfair and provides a reasonable challenge for anyone familiar with the series. Its even balanced for some of the moments designed to capitalize on and subvert the expectations of those experienced with the series. Where I messed up was thinking that I am even remotely in control of my own gaming impulses, especially as they relate to titles where min-maxing is optimal and maybe even necessary for success.
Here is an example: There is a point where your party ends up under a sudden shower of rancid meat water. You then see what is a text version of a slapstick Im nauseous, Now Im nauseous because youre nauseous, scene during which all of your partys HP continues to drop. Youre then prompted to either keep going with the rancid meat smell or take off all your armor and wash it. 
You will probably get attacked while this happens, the game all but outright warns you of your potential smelly nude shenanigans. Of course, I couldnt not know what happens if you take all your armor off, so I choked down the anxiety of doing something silly and stripped down in the middle of a monster-infested magical ruin. I was summarily attacked by monsters without my equipment. Surprise!
I managed to survive, but I found myself constantly lured by the siren call of knowing what some shit does in Etrian Odyssey Nexus, in much the same way that a gamer might jump off a cliff to see if itll kill them or wade into water to see if they can swim. Will these fruit heal me, or become sentient and blindside my party? Can I kill this wildly aggressive kangaroo with a cheap-ass strategy and some luck, or will it annihilate my squad? Do I squeeze out my remaining resources and keep going until I activate a new shortcut or trek back to the Inn and play it safe like a goddamn loser?
I didnt realize quite how out of control I was until I found myself moving more slowly through the game than I wanted. The pacing is fine and even feels faster at times than other games, as Nexus includes smaller snippets of dungeons from previous titles as kind of a love letter to itself. But there were other titles I wanted to play, and on top of that, I get into a very nasty completionist loop when I play EO games.
It was like a Bandersnatch moment as the hours went by and I realized that, as much as I wanted to, I could not lower my difficulty. I physically could, of courseall it took was a little foray into the menu and I could change my difficulty, just like that. Once you are in Heroic, you can switch to a lower difficultybut you cannot switch back to Heroic. You also cant start a New Game+ in Heroic if you completed the game in another difficulty, and since Heroic seems to be exactly the same as Expert, it is literally for bragging rights and nothing else, really, as far as I can tell.
Friends, I am still playing on Heroic and moving at a snails pace, and I am kind of OK with that but also feeling a little trapped!
I could keep a Heroic save and continue on a different difficulty, but the finality of moving forward and first seeing the games new content on a lower difficultyand the idea of having to play the exact same mode again outside of a NG+ setting if I wanted the bragging rights of beating the game on Heroicstopped me in my tracks. I already had to rip one bandaid offone of my characters had died on the last goddamn turn of a boss battle and thus didnt get any of the juicy boss experience everyone else got. Where past Natalie would have begrudgingly reset for a better run, I realized I was already moving more slowly than I wanted and pressed forward, my poor Gunner now lagging behind in a game where each level already felt hard-won. It took a while to feel normal again.
Standard mode has never been so easy that its boring, and Picnic is honestly fun if youre literally just trying to get more of the games story, but no one is really trying to do thatin past titles, the game got so easy that my non-damage-dealers were landing haymakers on newly squishy enemies. Yikes.
I might have finally met my match as I decided to switch up my gameplay style and be a little more reckless as a form of motivation. Theres something in basketball called a heat checkbasically, you take harder and harder shots, some of them relatively silly choices, to see how hot you are.
Around the third major dungeon, I tried to do another of several heat checks in Nexustaking on a difficult quest fight at half TP without savingand the random number generator laughed right in my face. You are cold, scrub, the game snickered as my party got wiped. Do you want to save your maps though, so that you can be less bad at Etrian Odyssey Nexus next time you play? Im paraphrasingits the feeling Im capturing here.
And honestly? It sort of helped. I might have to challenge run myself into changing my difficulty, or just decide to play a little more recklesslyand make the move to an easier difficulty level to do it.
Well see. In the meantime, the Bad Bitch Squad prevailson Heroic.","I consider myself a veteran Etrian Odyssey player.

Kevin Loria,"USGS expects this sort of damage to occur when the Hayward Fault earthquake hits. USGS/Public Domain On this day 112 years ago, the San Andreas Fault under San Francisco rumbled apart, causing the devastating 1906 earthquake that swallowed city blocks, broke water mains, and triggered massive fires that burned for days. The threat of another major quake for the Bay Area is ""real and could happen at any time,"" according to researchers for the US Geological Survey. But the scariest scenario for the next major earthquake may not be from the San Andreas Fault (though that one still threatens ), but from the Hayward Fault that runs along the east side of the San Francisco Bay. The Hayward Fault is a ""tectonic time bomb, due anytime for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake,"" according to a 2008 USGS report. Since then, research has indicated that the likelihood of a Hayward quake is greater and more threatening to the 7 million Bay Area residents than a San Andreas quake would be. ""It's just waiting to go off,"" USGS earthquake geologist emeritus David Schwartz told the Los Angeles Times. The Hayward Fault USGS/Public Domain The HayWired Earthquake Scenario To better understand what might happen in the case of a quake on the Hayward Fault, researchers from the USGS partnered with a group called the HayWired Coalition. They modeled a hypothetical 7.0 magnitude quake with an epicenter beneath Oakland — a hypothetical event they call the HayWired Scenario. The projections are sobering. According to that model, the violent shaking from the earthquake could cause the two sides of the fault to split six feet apart in some places. Some aftershocks could continue for several months. Cities in the East Bay would be hit hard, including Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward. More than 300 buildings sit atop the Hayward Fault, including the stadium at the University of California Berkeley. Property damage in the HayWired Scenario is estimated by USGS to be more than $82 billion. The human toll from such an event could be greater. The quake would displace 77,000 households, a number that could rise to 152,000 if fires and utility outages were counted. That means nearly half a million people would be forced from their homes. A major earthquake in 1989 rocked the San Francisco Bay area and damaged parts of the Bay Bridge. AP Photo The scientists think such an event would kill around 800 people and cause 18,000 nonfatal injuries. More than 2,500 people might need to be pulled from collapsed buildings, and around 22,000 could be trapped in elevators. Most counties in the area would have full water service restored within 30 days, the researchers estimate, but it might take up to 210 days before the hardest hit counties would see full service restored. More than 400 gas- and electric-related fires would likely ignite because of the main shock of the quake, and experts think those blazes could burn an area big enough to consume 52,000 homes, kill hundreds, and do another $30 billion in damage. The 72 percent probability of a magnitude (M) 6.7 or greater earthquake in the region includes well-known major plate-boundary faults, lesser-known faults, and unknown faults. The percentage shown within each colored circle is the probability that a M 6.7 or greater earthquake will occur somewhere on that fault system by the year 2043. The dark, thick lines outlined in various colors represent major plate boundary faults; the thinner, yellow lines mark lesser-know, smaller faults. USGS/Public Domain Another quake is coming The last time a major quake hit the Hayward Fault was in 1868, when a 6.8-magnitude tremor raced through the region and leveled several towns. The region was sparsely populated then, but 30 people died and the impact was powerful enough that the 1868 quake is considered one of the most destructive in California history. People felt the shakes as far north as Nevada. The devastation from the next quake will be worse given the current density of the East Bay. The idea behind the HayWired Scenario is to present a realistic model of something experts think is likely to happen — and inspire more investment in earthquake safety. There are steps that experts think could improve the situation. An early warning system could prevent at least 1,500 injuries if people followed alerts. If water utilities replace brittle pipes, acquire emergency generators, and create a fuel-management plan, water service could be restored more quickly. Retrofitting buildings could also reduce the number of fires. But the researchers behind the analysis want people to understand that this scenario is just one of many possibilities. There are seven significant fault lines running through the Bay Area. The risk from a Hayward quake might be highest, but there are worse scenarios that would involve multiple faults rupturing simultaneously. Overall, researchers think there's about a 76% chance the region could get hit by a 7.2 magnitude quake within the next 30 years. As Schwartz told the LA Times, ""You can't hide — there's really going to be very little places in the greater Bay Area that won't be affected.""","There's about a 76% chance that the San Francisco Bay Area could experience a 7.2 magnitude earthquake within the next 30 years, according to some recent reports.

Hayley Miller,"Dave Chappelle denied that division in the United States is more acute than ever before, noting in a wide-ranging interview with CNN that the country has been grappling with systemic racism since before President Donald Trump took office. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, in an interview that aired Tuesday, asked Chappelle and fellow comedian Jon Stewart a series of questions about Trump’s rise to power and his impact on the world. “Even when they say that Russia influenced the election, it’s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who’s doing it?” Chappelle joked. “Oh oh, thank goodness, I thought it was us.” “If [Russia] killed the country that way then we’re the murder weapon,” he added. When asked whether the “Trump era” provided good fodder for comedians, Chappelle said he would “not even name the era after him.” “He’s getting too much credit. He’s not making the wave; he’s surfing it,” he said. “All he does is sing those people’s greatest hits build a wall, all those things we’ve heard before. He just sings all the songs. He’s the only one that’s been brash enough to do it.” Chappelle drew mixed reactions when, while hosting “Saturday Night Live” shortly after the 2016 election, he said he planned to give Trump “a chance.” “I’m going to give him a chance,” Chappelle said at the time. “And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.” When asked to revisit those comments in his interview with CNN, Chappelle said he believes he said “the right thing at the right time,” before reflecting that Trump’s presidency has been “very difficult to watch the last couple years.” Watch the full interview below.","Chappelle, along with Jon Stewart, discussed Trump's rise to power in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.",2018-10-30T21:01:04Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Dave Chappelle: It’s Not The Russians’ Fault Americans Are Racist,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dave-chappelle-russians-racist_us_5bd870d4e4b07427610b9898,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bd8c2fb240000a602579b18.png?cache=MUXgUwAFPa&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,fault,1

For those desperately in need of, say, an Echo Look, this is a once-in-a-year opportunity to put a camera in your bedroom at a discounted price. But Prime Day is more than that. So much more. Indeed, the holiday finally (if only temporarily) addresses a problem of Amazon's own making: That seemingly more and more goods on the retail site are knock-off pieces of trash. SEE ALSO: Amazon Prime is filled with Alex Jones conspiracy theory videos it calls 'documentaries' The good folks at Reply All summed this phenomenon up in a July 11 episode entitled "" The Magic Store."" Essentially, their argument goes, in an effort to truly become the so-called everything store and compete with the likes of Alibaba, Amazon permitted a host of foreign third-party sellers to list directly on its site. This, we are told, led to a flooding of the retailer with inferior products and a downgrading of the Amazon shopping experience in general. Perish the thought. And while this is very much Amazon's fault, Jeff Bezos has gifted us a one-day solution in the form of Prime Day. The highlighted goods, you see, are likely to be vetted by the folks at Amazon.

Despite Amazon's efforts, reviews on products are often fake. What's more, scammers have developed elaborate strategies to capitalize on the shopping frenzy. Last year, review site Consumer Affairs notes, spam emails purporting to be from Amazon offered Prime Day shoppers a $50 gift card for logging into to their Amazon accounts and leaving reviews. The emails linked to a fake Amazon login page. When the shoppers clicked through and entered account details, scammers gained access to victims' accounts and placed fraudulent orders. @AmazonHelp how can customers report amazon third party sellers selling obviously fake knockoff products? — mind as well (@mind_as_well) July 12, 2018 But still. If you are inclined to shop on Amazon, and don't mind crossing a picket line, today's the day to do it. You are much more likely to get what you actually intended to order, and less likely to end up with some sketchy imitation. A few easy-to-follow Prime Day steps should keep your shopping (mostly) scam-free. First, check your favorite website to see if it has a recommended list of deals (Mashable has one ). See anything you like? Cool, click the link. Next, look at the product's reviews. Are they marked ""Amazon Verified Purchase""? That's not a foolproof way of knowing if a review is legitimate or not, as people often buy their own product to leave positive reviews, but it helps. OK, so you see a bunch of positive, verified reviews on your dongle of choice. When were the reviews left? If they are all super recent, it could suggest a retailer attempting to stuff his or her page right before Prime Day. That's a warning sign. If they span a decent length of time, they might actually be from real customers. Maybe. In the end, the only way to 100 percent know what you're ordering is the thing advertised is perhaps to go to a physical store and hold it in your hands.

"Will Oremus, Will Oremus","Voters wait in line at the polls to cast their ballot in the national election on Nov. 8, 2016 in Milwaukee. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. For all the hand-wringing about fake news, Russian trolls, Infowars, and Cambridge Analytica, the internet may not have helped elect Donald Trump after all. That, at least, is the strong suggestion of a new study from economists at Stanford and Brown universities. Trump performed worse than previous Republican candidates among internet users and people who got campaign news online, the authors find in a paper published July 18 in the journal PLOS One. And he outperformed his predecessors among the demographic groups least likely to be online. In other words, Mitt Romney and John McCain got more support from internet users than Trump did. The paper, from Stanford economists Levi Boxell and Matthew Gentzkow and Brown economist Jesse Shapiro, adds to a growing body of research indicating that the internet’s effects on U.S. political opinion may be overstated. The same authors found in 2017 that the country’s polarization has been most intense among the oldest Americans, who also spend the least time online. Cable news has been a more significant driver of partisan divisions, research suggests. In November 2016, just weeks after Trump’s election, media studies professors Keith Hampton and Eszter Hargittai made a persuasive case in the Hill that Trump’s win wasn’t Facebook’s fault. Hampton and Hargittai pointed out that research shows Facebook users are more likely to be connected to different kinds of people, while disconnection from the internet is broadly associated with social isolation and intolerance. Trump voters were also far less likely to use Twitter or Reddit than Clinton voters, they noted. This doesn’t mean the internet was irrelevant to the 2016 campaign, Shapiro told me. “The question is not whether the internet is having any impact on politics—it surely is—but whether it deserves the top billing it often gets in discussions about the election,” he said. The finding that Trump performed worse than prior Republican candidates among internet users holds across three different ways of measuring internet use. The first two are based on survey questions from the American National Election Studies between 1996 and 2016. One asks whether the respondent has internet access, and the other asks whether they read news about the campaign online. The third measure, which they call “predicted internet access,” uses a model based on demographic traits that correlate with internet access. Still, the authors were careful to acknowledge that more research is needed. The conclusion that “the internet was not a source of advantage to Trump,” they explain, relies on a series of three assumptions, each of which could be called into question. For one, it assumes that the internet affects elections only by changing the partisan vote shares of people active on the internet. But Shapiro allows that it’s possible the internet could indirectly influence the votes of non-internet users. That is, their views could be shaped by internet-connected friends, colleagues, or mainstream media personalities. This seems especially likely given that internet use, and Twitter in particular, is pervasive among members of the media. Trump voters might get their views about him from Fox News, but Fox News personalities might in turn be drawing heavily on material from the internet. Indeed, the network’s top-rated host, Sean Hannity, has been known to latch onto online conspiracy theories to counter news cycles that cast Trump in a negative light. Then there’s the fact that Trump himself drives a lot of mainstream media coverage with his own internet use—in particular, his volatile tweets. Another caveat is that Trump was a very different candidate from McCain, Romney, or George W. Bush. It seems plausible that his message was always going to resonate better with non-internet users, but that his campaign’s savvy use of social media—or Russian trolling, for that matter—led him to perform better with internet users than he would have otherwise. Shapiro agreed that seems likely, but pointed out that it still implies that internet users were not the driving force behind Trump’s win. So if Facebook and filter bubbles and Russian misinformation didn’t hand Trump the election, what did? This study can’t answer that question, Shapiro said. But in a 2017 New York Times op-ed, he and his co-authors proposed the following: If any media platform is to blame, it is not the web. It is more likely television, which is a more important source of political information. Growing polarization may also result from structural economic changes, like rising inequality, that have occurred in recent decades. A 2009 study by Shapiro and Daniel J. Benjamin, now an economics professor at the University of Southern California, showed that laboratory subjects were able to predict the outcome of gubernatorial elections with some reliability just by watching 10-second, silent video clips of the candidates. In fact, those predictions outperformed models that use economic conditions to forecast election outcomes. So the relative impressions that Trump and Clinton made on TV could have been more important to Trump’s victory than the impressions created by Reddit memes or Twitter propaganda—even if TV looked a little more like Reddit and Twitter in 2016 than it ever had before.","For all the hand-wringing about fake news, Russian trolls, Infowars, and Cambridge Analytica, the internet may not have helped elect Donald Trump after all.

MONICA DAVEY,"All of it, his lawyers suggested, meant that the circumstances of Mr. Nassar’s criminal case — the essential legal issue of the sentencing hearing — wound up overshadowed. “The entire sentencing proceedings were designed to send a message to the entire world, as Judge Aquilina stated over and over again,” the lawyers wrote. An official in Judge Aquilina’s office said that the judge would not comment on Mr. Nassar’s request until after the case has made its way through appeals. When Judge Aquilina held the sentencing hearing, Mr. Nassar had already entered a guilty plea to seven counts of sexually abusing girls. Mr. Nassar, 54, was convicted of molesting girls for years under the guise of giving them medical examinations and treatments. Many were Olympic gymnasts, others were Michigan State University athletes. Some of the girls were as young as 6. Mr. Nassar also faces other lengthy sentences in federal and state courts, including 60 years for a child pornography conviction in a separate federal case. Since his incarceration, Mr. Nassar has been physically attacked in a federal prison, his lawyers wrote. The court documents offered no details of the assault, which his lawyers said happened within a few hours of Mr. Nassar being placed in the general population, but they suggested that the judge’s approach was at fault.","Lawrence G.

EMILY BADGER and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) People told Isabel Sanchez that the housing lottery was a waste of time. The odds were too long. Her family would never win. Happy endings are rare in San Francisco’s housing market for anyone who can’t afford luxury rents. But she and her family were facing a no-fault eviction last fall; the house where they rented an in-law unit had been sold to new owners, who wanted their mother to move in. So Ms. Sanchez applied for the city-run lottery for Natalie Gubb Commons, a new 95-unit affordable housing development downtown open to households making up to 50 percent of the area median income. Ms. Sanchez and her family were among 6,580 households that applied for the property, whose lottery and aftermath The New York Times chronicled through this spring. Such lotteries are a regular feature of housing policy in high-cost cities. Far more people need — and qualify for — public housing, housing vouchers or below-market-rate apartments than the assistance available. And so cities, housing authorities and developers often dole out what they have by drawing numbers. Ms. Sanchez pulled No. 16. In April, her family moved into a new three-bedroom apartment renting for a fraction of market rate. That they won the first lottery they ever entered — while some people apply, and fail, for years — shows how utterly random the results are.","Monday: A 95-unit affordable housing complex receives 6,580 applicants, Devin Nunes escalates his demands, and a set of first-generation twins graduate from U.C.

Cherlynn Low,"We checked it out at Caesars Palace, and perhaps it was my own fault, but I had envisioned something a little more seamless. Instead, the whole experience still felt a little stilted -- but I'm getting ahead of myself. To use the translation services, you first have to tell Assistant what language you need. So if you mistook Mandarin for Cantonese or Japanese, for example, then you might have to guess a few times before it works.
After you get Interpreter Mode running in the right language, the display splits in two to offer real-time subtitles for what both of you are saying. You don't have to take turns -- the Assistant is simply listening and will auto detect what language of the two is being spoken and translate correspondingly. But you'll still have to wait for Assistant to be done and can't overlap each other.
Interpreter Mode currently works in languages including Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, French and German. I tried speaking with our friendly concierge Peter at the Mirage hotel here in Las Vegas in Mandarin, asking him about free breakfasts in the hotel. Even though we were in a quiet environment, the Assistant sometimes misheard what I was saying, particularly when I spoke quickly or used colloquialisms. resulting in beautifully hilarious results like ""Natural beauty is very expensive."" In the real world, though, I imagine that confusion is probably frustrating rather than funny.
There's also the fact that you and your conversation partner each have to wait a beat before Assistant will translate what you're saying. This is what I meant earlier about the whole process feeling a bit stilted -- there's a sort of awkward rhythm to the conversation, and Assistant as a conduit is still a little slow. It'd be more accurate to think of Interpreter Mode as a stand-in for an actual translator instead of a device that interprets in real time. With improved WiFi and processing speeds, though, I could see the system getting much more seamless.
Still, as it is, Interpreter Mode on Google's smart displays is helpful especially in hotels and places where masses of international travelers gather. Small business owners who have a Home Hub or Lenovo Smart Display could also find this service useful.

Vanessa Marin,"With sexual harassment and abuse being covered so frequently in the media over these last few weeks, it seemed like a good time to talk about how to move forward and start to heal after abuse. Of course, this is a huge topic, so we’re getting started with how to manage the effects of sexual trauma on your own. Next week, we’ll talk about navigating the waters with new partners. The healing process looks different for every person, but here are some steps that you may find helpful. Acknowledge the Trauma First and foremost, it’s important to acknowledge that you’ve been abused. Denial, distancing, and minimizing are extremely common reactions for sexual abuse survivors. My clients say things like, “That happened so long ago,” “Other people have had it way worse than I have,” or “It wasn’t even that bad.” It’s difficult to acknowledge sexual abuse because it’s something you didn’t want to have happen in the first place. Having to acknowledge it feels even more painful. A lot of male survivors struggle to acknowledge sexual abuse, since we stereotypically believe that only women get sexually abused. If you catch yourself minimizing your abuse, you can say to yourself something like, “I know it’s hard to acknowledge that I’ve been abused. But it did happen, and it needs my attention. I deserve to acknowledge what happened to me, and to heal.” Esther Perel, author of The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity and host of our video series… Read more Read Don’t Blame Yourself On the other side of the spectrum, a lot of sexual trauma survivors blame themselves for what happened. Society and the media can be immensely victim-blaming, and it can be hard not to internalize those beliefs. You may believe that you were at fault due to the clothing you were wearing, the way you acted, the things you said, or the situation you put yourself into. But please know that victims can never, ever be at blame for their abuse. Be Aware of Potential Impacts Sexual trauma is incredibly difficult because not only do you have to deal with the act itself, you also have to cope with its ongoing effects. This kind of trauma can drastically alter your relationship to yourself and to your body, your relationships with others, and your sex life. Many survivors aren’t prepared for the ongoing effects, especially if they’ve minimized or distanced themselves from their abuse. It can be helpful to know some of the common response patterns that survivors may experience, such as: Getting scared or jumpy when approached, talked to, or touched in specific ways Feeling hypervigilant Having a hard time trusting others Feeling scared of losing control Dissociating during sex. Feeling like you go somewhere else mentally A low or nonexistent sex drive Difficulty getting turned on or reaching orgasm Feeling disconnected from your body, or even hating your body Not knowing how to make healthy and safe decisions about sexual activity Sexual pain conditions and health issues, like vulvodynia or UTIs It’s important to get a sense of which effects are showing up in your life. This comes back to acknowledgement. The first step in any healing process is acknowledging what the problem is. Once you have a sense of how this trauma is showing up in your life, you can start taking steps to address it. In case the title isn’t clear, mutual masturbation is when you and your partner masturbate in front … Read more Read Identify Your Triggers In a similar vein, it may also help to start to create a trigger list. Sexual abuse survivors often get triggered by certain actions or words. Try to start gathering information on what triggers you. When you do feel scared, uncomfortable, or nervous? When do you feel dissociated? What words, actions, or activities don’t feel safe? Creating this list can be a tremendously sad experience for many sexual abuse survivors. For that reason, I also recommend creating a safe list. What sexual actions or activities do feel safe to you? Write down any little item on your list, no matter how small or inconsequential it may seem. Come Up With Goals Many sexual abuse survivors feel like their abuse has taken their sex life away from them. They no longer feel in control. You can help yourself start to regain that control by thinking of goals for your sex life. What do you want your sex life to look like? What do you want to feel comfortable doing or saying? How do you want to relate to your body, to yourself, or to others? Take Really Good Care of Yourself Sexual trauma can take a huge toll on your relationship with yourself and lead to depression, anxiety, and a whole host of other mental health issues. It can tank your self-esteem, and even make you hate yourself. It can be particularly tough on your relationship with your body—it may seem difficult to feel present in your own skin. You may even feel like your body betrayed you during the abuse itself. It’s crucial that you take exquisitely good care of yourself. Ignore the negative thoughts and impulses that may be running through your head, and try to be an incredible friend to yourself. You may have favorite self-care activities that you already know you enjoy, like cooking healthy meals or getting plenty of sleep. Or it may be time to brainstorm a new self-care routine. What does your body really like doing? When do you feel the most at home in your own skin? When do you feel happy, calm, safe, or content? Possibilities include exercising, taking a bath, sitting in the sun, cuddling with your pet, wearing favorite items of clothing, journaling, meditating, or watching movies. Try to do at least one kind thing for yourself every day. Fantasies come in many different intensities. Some are so compelling that you’ve just got to act on … Read more Read Get Support You should never, ever feel like you have to manage the impacts of sexual trauma alone. What happened wasn’t your fault, and you deserve plenty of support in processing it. I highly recommend getting personal therapy. It doesn’t matter what type of therapy you choose; just find someone you like and start processing. You may also find it helpful to join a support group. You can also call the RAINN hotline at 800.656.HOPE whenever you’re feeling alone or want someone to talk to. Feeling supported is vital to the healing process.","With sexual harassment and abuse being covered so frequently in the media over these last few weeks, it seemed like a good time to talk about how to move forward and start to heal after abuse.

Carla Herreria,"Twenty-four hours after bashing former friend Jordyn Woods over her alleged affair with Tristan Thompson, Khloe Kardashian may have had a change of heart.
The reality star on Saturday said that Woods is not to be blamed for Kardashians split with her boyfriend and rerouted her frustration towards the Cleveland Cavaliers player, who is also father of her daughter True.
Whats been harder &amp; more painful is being hurt by someone so close to me. Someone whom I love &amp; treat like a little sister, Kardashian tweeted.
But Jordyn is not to be blamed for the breakup of my family, she continued. This was Tristans fault.

Woods, the former best friend and housemate of Kardashians little sister Kylie Jenner, has been at the center of a Kardashian controversy for over a week after reports accused Thompson and Woods of behaving intimately at a party over Valentines Day weekend.
Kardashian took a decidedly different tone with Woods on Friday, accusing the 21-year-old of lying about her alleged affair with Thompson and breaking up her family.
Why are you lying, the Good American founder said in a tweet addressed to Woods. If youre going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. 
Why are you lying @jordynwoods ?? If youre going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!

— Khloé (@khloekardashian) March 1, 2019
Kardashians tweet on Friday was an apparent reaction to Woods emotional interview with Jada Pinkett Smith on the actress Facebook show Red Table Talk.
During the show, a tearful Woods, whose family is very close with Jada Pinkett and Will Smith, denied being alone with Thompson, giving him a lapdance or making out with him. 
She did admit that she had sat on the arm of a chair which Thompson was sitting in, with her legs dangling over his. She also admitted that Thompson had kissed her on the lips to say goodbye.
I dont think hes wrong either, because I allowed myself to be in that position. When alcohol is involved, people make dumb moves and get caught up in the moment, she told Pinkett Smith.
Woods also told Smith that she wasnt totally honest when she confessed to Kardashian and Jenner what had happened between her and Thompson the following day.
I was trying to protect Khloes heart. People have even dehumanized her... Its not fair that she has to deal with this either. The last thing I wanted to do is be that person either... Woods said. Im not a home-wrecker. 
Khloe Kardashian has faced flak for appearing to focus all of her anger towards Woods while Thompson shares the blame. On Friday, the star clarified that Thompson has been addressing the issue privately.
If Tristan were to lie publicly about what conspired,then yes I would address him publicly as well, she tweeted.
On Saturday, she summed up the week as awful and expressed regret for some of her behavior.
I know everyone is sick of hearing about it all (as am I), she tweeted. Im a rollercoaster of emotions &amp; have said things I shouldnt have. Honestly, Tristan cheating on me &amp; humiliating me, wasnt such a shock as the first time.

Shannon Liao,"A man sued T-Mobile on Sunday, claiming that the company’s lack of security allowed hackers to enter his wireless account last fall and steal cryptocoins worth thousands of dollars. Carlos Tapang of Washington state accuses T-Mobile of having “improperly allowed wrongdoers to access” his wireless account on November 7th last year. The hackers then cancelled his number and transferred it to an AT&amp;T account under their control. “T-Mobile was unable to contain this security breach until the next day,” when it finally got the number back from AT&amp;T, Tapang alleges in the suit, first spotted by Law360. After gaining control of his phone number, the hackers were able to change the password on one of Tapang’s cryptocurrency accounts and steal 1,000 OmiseGo (OMG) tokens and 19.6 BitConnect coins, Tapang claims. The hackers then exchanged the coins for 2.875 Bitcoin and transferred it out of his account, the suit states. On November 7th, the price of Bitcoin was $7,118.80, so had the hackers cashed out then, they would have netted a profit of $20,466.55. Tapang goes on to say, “After the incident, BTC price reached more than $17,000.00 per coin,” but given the volatility of bitcoin prices, the hackers may not have benefited from the soar. The suit alleges T-Mobile is at fault partly because the carrier said it would add a PIN code to Tapang’s account prior to the incident, but didn’t actually implement it. Tapang also states that hackers are able to call T-Mobile’s customer support multiple times to gain access to customer accounts, until they’re able to get an agent on the line that would grant them access without requiring further identity verification. The complaint also lists several anonymous internet users who have posted about similar security breaches to their own T-Mobile accounts. Although the suit doesn’t detail how the hackers specifically were able to access Tapang’s account, The Verge has explored a similar Bitcoin-related heist in the past that also involved taking over phone numbers. Tapang alleges he couldn’t use his cellphone number and had to “expend time, energy, and expense” and also suffered “emotional distress” from the incident, so he’s seeking damages and injunctive relief, which could order T-Mobile to enable more security measures. T-Mobile and Tapang’s lawyer, Boris Davidovskiy, could not be immediately reached for comment.","A man sued T-Mobile on Sunday, claiming that the company’s lack of security allowed hackers to enter his wireless account last fall and steal cryptocoins totaling thousands of dollars.",2018-02-06T00:08:53Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Man sues T-Mobile for allegedly failing to stop hackers from draining his cryptocurrency account,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16976114/tmobile-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-hack-security-breach-lawsuit,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o7yEw5nolnK4VnPNtYLR7DyPl3o=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8937277/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v4.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fault,1
Jonathan Shieber,"So… apparently there’s been another kerfuffle on the Twitter about some asinine things that a certain wealthy, rocket-building, payment-revolutionizing, electric vehicle company-creating entrepreneur has written in tweets to millions of followers. This billionaire is, by all accounts, incredibly difficult to work for, very visionary and … a bit thin-skinned for someone with such a habit of courting press. I’m not saying that’s his fault. He’s been shredded by hundreds of people in thousands of messages on a platform that’s given him millions of (fake and) real followers and a megaphone that would be powerful enough to change the world (or at least the world’s coverage of him) with a single bloviating bit of textual hot air. And boy, as a billionaire entrepreneur, does this fella blow the hot air. Wait… I am saying some of this is his fault. That said, he’s done some truly amazing things for the world. AND IS A BILLIONAIRE. With that in mind, here’re a few humble suggestions for him to keep in mind as he approaches the touchpad, keyboard, or any other tweet-enabling appliance as he looks to foray further into the wild feathered world of the Twitter-birds. Image: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch THINGS THAT ARE OKAY TO TWEET Tweeting about offers to help people in dire need of help. Listen, I know you got a lot of heat for this one, and it was ultimately an unnecessary gesture that some folks chalked up to a cynical attempt to change the subject, but I believe that your heart was in the right place. People love John Henry stories — especially now when technology threatens to overwhelm all of us. So this bit of ingenuity that you and your team concocted wound up as an actual embodiment of an old folktale ? So what? Humans can win without machines. This is a good thing. Embrace it. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have offered to help. Or that people should dismiss that offer as ridiculous. Tweeting about phenomenal things that your companies have managed to achieve in the world. It’s a jaded world, so people dismiss a lot of things that they shouldn’t, but landing parts of a rocket successfully for re-use is a goddamn miracle of science. It’s wonderful. Literally an achievement that has the potential to advance humanity… and even if a better solution comes along, you’ve proven naysayers wrong and pushed the bounds of the possible. Go you. Tweeting about political and social issues you feel passionate about. You’re a — fairly — beloved billionaire (which is kind of a weird thing to write) with a platform that has millions of followers. If you think a certain way about a certain thing it’s your right to express it and your privilege to do so on a platform where people care what you have to say. Challenging the substance of arguments and criticisms that are leveled against you and your initiatives by people. t’s a marketplace of ideas and you’ve been able to buy a lot of privilege and respect because you have BILLIONS OF DOLLARS and millions of people in our country and world respect the bank account. But it’s still a marketplace of ideas where you are more than capable of competing without having to rely on knee-jerk responses from [real or imagined] followers or ad hominem attacks on the folks who disagree with you. Tweeting in support of punching nazis. Legit always cool. Maybe just do it once a day to see how people respond? It’s always okay to punch nazis. THINGS THAT ARE NOT OKAY TO TWEET Ad hominem attacks against people who criticize, disagree or denigrate you. (You legit called someone who just helped save 12 boys in one of the most awesome examples of human endurance and resilience a pedophile… and then doubled down on it. That’s just fucked up. Maybe time to rethink how you’re using the Twitter.) Ad hominem attacks against reporters who write negative (and seemingly factually correct) articles about your companies. Going after journalists — especially women journalists — with a rabid following of tech fan boys who have no problem doxxing, verbally assaulting, or threatening people on Twitter seems a bit irresponsible. You know your power… and you’re a nerd… so you should know with great power comes great responsibility — and not just in a messianic, cynical I’m going to save humanity from itself Harry Seldon kind of way. Ad hominem attacks against company executives that you’re competing against. Okay… sometimes this is great. And you’re really funny, so that works for you. And to be honest, at least you’re not punching down. But maybe there’s enough toxicity in the world already that we can actually just start championing folks who’re trying to do radical things… technologically feasible, provable and disclosable radical things. Ain’t nobody want to cheer on Theranos. Lying or obfuscating when you’re caught out for things you’ve actually done. Own up to it and explain it. Rick rolls and the word “lit”. This should go without saying. Fella, you’re an incredibly powerful person with a significant, and rabid, following on a platform that isn’t known for rewarding perspicacity and reason (maybe using your platform you can change that?). Typically, these days, you’ve been uniting more people in anger than you have behind your good intentions. As a public figure with an aggressive following, maybe work on increasing the peace? There’s already one bloviating, egomaniacal, too-powerful, sycophant-encouraging, id and idiocy-inducing jerkface on Twitter. Let them keep that particular throne and maybe keep you keep the toxicity to yourself?","So… apparently there’s been another kerfuffle on the Twitter about some asinine things that a certain wealthy, rocket-building, payment-revolutionizing, electric vehicle company-creating entrepreneur has written in tweets to millions of followers.

However, errors occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant error-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla errors by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific error models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.","A critical component of any quantum error–correcting scheme is detection of errors by using an ancilla system.

Jennifer Bendery,"WASHINGTON ― Four months after abruptly quitting Congress amid a sexual harassment scandal, f ormer Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) still doesn’t think he did anything wrong. In fact, the former GOP lawmaker says he “took a bullet for the team” by resigning. He insists he’s right not to repay $84,000 in taxpayer money he spent on a sexual harassment settlement. He ripped the House Ethics Committee for not caring about facts. And he blames “f-tards” and the Me Too movement for driving him out of a job. Yeah, it’s a lot. And that’s just a sample of Farenthold’s comments in an Aug. 1 deposition he gave in a lawsuit over his new job at a Texas port authority. T he Victoria Advocate, a local newspaper, sued the port authority in May for not giving required public notice that it was hiring Farenthold and creating a $160,000-a-year lobbyist job for him. HuffPost obtained a transcript of Farenthold’s deposition, along with copies of his texts and emails submitted for the lawsuit. What’s clear is that he blames everyone but himself for his downfall and that his reasons for not repaying the $84,000 are bonkers. You can read 79 pages of his deposition yourself, here, or just read below for the bits we thought were particularly bananas. It would be illegal to repay $84,000 in taxpayer money? Farenthold claims he would be breaking the law if he repaid the taxpayer money he spent to settle a 2014 sexual harassment lawsuit by a former aide, Lauren Greene, who alleged he told her she could “show her nipples” and that he had “wet dreams” about her. When the lawsuit became public in December, Farenthold promised to repay the money immediately. He later changed his mind. Here’s the attorney for the Victoria Advocate, John Griffin, asking him why he didn’t pay it back. The highlighted bits are from HuffPost. It’s not clear why Farenthold said it would be illegal to repay taxpayers. A top House Republican aide confirmed that this is nonsense. “Yup. Anyone can donate money to Treasury,” said this aide. He can’t donate $84,000 to a nonprofit that combats sexual harassment. Farenthold, who is worth millions of dollars, once said he would donate $84,000 to a charity focused on sexual harassment. Now he says he won’t do that because there’s a bill in Congress targeting sexual harassment by lawmakers that would potentially authorize the government to take the $84,000 from his retirement plan. He doesn’t want to risk paying that amount twice. He’s right that there is legislation in Congress that would crack down on sexual harassment by lawmakers. But the House and Senate have vastly different bills, and the issue has stalled out as they fail to reach a compromise. More notably, while only the House bill would allow the government to pull from a lawmaker’s retirement account or Social Security if they spend taxpayer money on a sexual harassment settlement, the provision is not retroactive. In other words, this bill has no bearing on Farenthold and there is no reason he could not donate $84,000 to a nonprofit targeting sexual harassment. He blames the House Ethics Committee for disregarding facts. Farenthold quit Congress days before the House Ethics Committee was set to announce its conclusion of a months-long investigation into four alleged violations by his office, one of which was more sexual harassment. The panel gave its required notice to Farenthold that it was going to announce a violation, which he concedes was part of the reason why he quit so abruptly. By quitting, he prevented the panel from announcing anything. Asked about the committee’s probe, which involved the creation of a subcommittee to look into all the allegations of wrongdoing, Farenthold dismissed the whole thing as a political witch hunt. The committee, of course, was not pleased that Farenthold prevented it from releasing its findings. The chairwoman and ranking member issued a scathing statement﻿ after he resigned, urging him “in the strongest possible terms” to repay the $84,000. He blames “f-tards” for his downfall and, helpfully, defines “f-tard.” Farenthold announced his resignation on April 6, and a friend, Matt Woolbright, texted him to say he was sorry to hear the news. Farenthold responded, “The f tards won.” What does “f-tard” mean and who is he talking about? Farenthold says in his deposition that he was referring to people in the media and that it means they are all A-S-S-E-S. He blames the Me Too movement for warping the minds of his colleagues. Farenthold says the Me Too movement blinded members of the House Ethics Committee, leaving them unable to separate facts from politics and therefore with no choice but to announce ethical violations in his office. He bemoans the “deep state” and “fake news.” But who are they? Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) was furious when Farenthold resigned and demanded that he repay the $84,000 and cover the costs of the special election to fill his seat. Farenthold wrote to Abbott in early May saying no, but that he wanted to stay in public service because of the “deep state” ― a conspiracy theory about people deeply embedded in the government trying to delegitimize President Donald Trump ― and “fake news.” Asked during his deposition what exactly he was referring to in both of those references, Farenthold couldn’t say. P.S. You were a real pain in my ass, Mia Love. Farenthold complains a lot about his party turning on him ― “we leave our wounded on the playing field” ― but names one colleague in particular: Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah), who he says threatened to call on him to resign if he didn’t repay the $84,000. A Love spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on whether the congresswoman was upset by Farenthold’s criticism or proud.","Months after quitting Congress in disgrace, the Texas Republican insists his sexual harassment scandal was everyone's fault but his own.",2018-08-19T12:20:01Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}","Blake Farenthold Blames ’F-Tards,” Me Too Movement For His Downfall",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blake-farenthold-sexual-harassment-me-too_us_5b75ae0ae4b0df9b093d8857,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b75aeca200000420034a84f.jpeg?cache=C5sSNPm8Tx&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,fault,1
KAREN ZRAICK,"But momentum against him has been building since Buzzfeed Newss publication in July 2017 of a lengthy investigation into accusations that Mr. Kelly held women in a so-called sex cult.
That article, by the journalist Jim DeRogatis, who has been reporting on the accusations against Mr. Kelly for nearly 20 years, spurred a six-part Lifetime documentary, Surviving R. Kelly, that aired last month and included testimony from several women who accused Mr. Kelly of abuse.
Public opinion seemed to turn against him. His label, RCA Records, has dropped him, and Spotify has removed his songs, which include Ignition and I Believe I Can Fly, from its playlists. He is also being investigated in at least two states: Illinois and Georgia, where he had homes and where prosecutors have urged any potential victims or witnesses to come forward.
The celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti also said last week that he had given Chicago prosecutors a videotape that, according to a report, appears to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been underage.
Ms. Allred said she represented a number of Mr. Kellys accusers she would not specify how many and said that some were worried that videos of them being abused might be circulating.

The blaze, which is believed to have been caused by an electrical fault, has destroyed food supplies and fuel, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said. Four warehouses were reportedly engulfed in flames as thick plumes of black smoke billowed into the sky. The port of Hudaydah receives critical aid for victims of the Yemen conflict, which has killed about 10,000 people. An estimated 50 tonnes of foodstuff was destroyed in Saturday's fire, AFP news agency reports. Workers said the warehouses also contained a large number of mattresses that were meant for those displaced by the war. In 2015, an assault by Houthi rebels on the city of Aden prompted a Saudi-led multinational coalition to launch a military campaign. The UN has referred to the conflict in Yemen as ""the world's worst humanitarian crisis"" with more than 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. In November last year, the Saudi-led coalition allowed aid deliveries to the port of Hudaydah and Sanaa airport following urgent UN appeals.","Supplies critical to the humanitarian aid effort have been destroyed, the World Food Programme says.",2018-03-31T16:02:38Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Yemen war: Fire damages World Food Programme warehouses,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43606207,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C188/production/_100644594_mediaitem100644591.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fault,1

Jon Russell,"On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called Vern Unsworth, one of the rescuers who helped save the young Thai football team trapped in caves, a “pedo.” Today, Wednesday, Musk issued what could be construed as an apology to Unsworth on Twiter. The apology wasn’t a public one sent to all of Musk’s Twitter followers, and therefore many might have missed it. Instead, it came in response to a Twitter user who highlighted “a thorough piece of reporting” on Quora that defends his well-intentioned but ultimately controversial efforts to help save the Thai children. Musk replied to the tweet explaining that he was angered by Unsworth’s comments in the media which played down the importance of a mini-sub constructed by Tesla to aid the operation — Unsworth said it “had absolutely no chance of working” — and suggested Musk should “stick his submarine where it hurts.” Ultimately, Musk admitted, he should not have accused Unsworth of being a pedophile. As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 18, 2018 Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 18, 2018 Musk’s apology comes a day after Tesla’s share price dipped on the news that Unsworth was considering a lawsuit against Musk, who deleted the “pedo” tweet and another that doubled down on the accusation hours after they were spotted by media. Despite the apology, it would be remiss of me not to point out some facts (sus): it took Musk two days to apologize; he didn’t do it directly; he took action only after the Tesla stock price fluctuated; and — finally — he continues to be scathing of media by endorsing the Quora “reporting.” Nonetheless, hopefully, this brings closure to this sorry affair because ultimately it is a near-miracle that these kids were able to leave the caves alive as they did. All this bickering after the event leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.","On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called Vern Unsworth, one of the rescuers who helped save the young Thai football team trapped in caves, a “pedo.” Today, Wednesday, Musk issued what could be construed as an apology to Unsworth on Twiter.

"SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, NICHOLAS FANDOS and PETER BAKER","At one point during the lunch, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government one Republican and one Democratic without consulting Senate Republicans first.
You put us in this position, Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides. Another senior Republican aide familiar with the exchange said Mr. Johnson told Mr. McConnell it was your fault. Mr. McConnell, who had largely absented himself from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, Are you suggesting Im enjoying this?
Details of the exchange were first reported by The Washington Post.
At another point, Mr. McConnell also signaled Vice President Mike Pence, who was present for the lunch, that Senate Republicans were generally not supportive of shutdowns.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"Mr. Darden addressed the impact of that pivotal moment, and his decision to ask Mr. Simpson to try on the glove, during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session in 2017.
Quite honestly, I did not appreciate at the time the impact that little ditty had on the jurors, Mr. Darden wrote. I thought it was a kids rhyme for idiots, to be honest, but it was effective.
He added: I take responsibility for the glove issues, so if there is any blame or fault to be assessed, it fell on me. And it should be assessed to me, because Im the only one strong enough to carry that burden.
He said he felt it was clear that Mr. Simpson did what he could to avoid making the glove fit. I hoped the jury would recognize that, but they couldnt see it, because they didnt want to see it, he said.
Some have been critical of Mr. Darden, 62, for taking on the defense of a man charged with killing a beloved figure in his community. But as Mr. Darden made plain in his book, he has endured such criticism before, including being called a traitor for helping to prosecute Mr. Simpson.
Yet many lawyers hold strongly to the concept that everyone is entitled to a defense. In fact, Mr. Darden has said that if he had been a criminal defense lawyer at the time, he would not have had a problem defending Mr. Simpson.","After the trial in which he made O.J.

Jennifer Ortega,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - A Daytona Beach mother spoke about how she's had to deal after her son was killed in a motorcycle crash while fleeing from police. Terica Charles said it was early Monday morning when police came knocking at her home to let her know Rodney Baker, 24, had been killed. ""They said the motorcycle he was on was stolen and that he died fleeing from the police, and I kind of lost it at that point,"" Charles said. Police said Baker stole the motorcycle from a restaurant in Holly Hill and drove to Daytona Beach where he was met by police. They said he sped off to avoid a traffic stop and crashed a short time later right off the International Speedway bridge. Charles said she later learned from her son's friends why he did it. ""He stole that motorcycle on a dare,"" she said. ""I can't believe it had turned into a decision where he had lost his life."" Broken from what happened, Charles took to Facebook to post a 17-minute message to anyone who would listen. The video has been viewed now more than 41,000 times. ""It's not the police's fault that my son crashed that motorcycle,"" she says in the video. ""He crashed that motorcycle in an effort to not go to jail."" Charles said her son had been going down the wrong path for years. She said she's now using his story so others can learn from his mistakes. ""I want parents to be honest with themselves about what our kids are actually doing,"" she said. ""I want parents to not make excuses for what our kids are doing, and try to figure out how we can help them."" Charles said she's planning to start a parent support group to help the community find a place where they can relate and share their stories.

FRANCES ROBLES,"FEMA did provide huge generators to power water-pumping stations on the island, and has been spending $20 million a month on generators for two electric power plants. In all, the report says, the agency has provided one million nights’ lodging in hotels and 130 million meals after the 2017 storms, a level of aid it considers “unprecedented.” The agency spent nearly $4 billion on aid and recovery efforts related to Puerto Rico. But many in Puerto Rico fault the agency’s efforts. “I don’t think anything provided by FEMA was a ‘meal,’” said Carlos J. Torres, 46, a resident of Guayanilla in the southern part of the island, referring to the military rations and boxes of candies and snacks that the agency often distributed. “You cannot call that food,” he said. Mr. Torres said he received a $500 emergency grant from FEMA, but has not been able to return to his apartment because the building was badly damaged and the landlord, his father, did not qualify for disaster assistance. His father was referred to the Small Business Administration to take out a low-interest loan for repairs, but “what I am expecting to see is a lot of people losing their property,” Mr. Torres said. “They are not going to be able to pay that off.” Thousands of Puerto Ricans left homeless by the storm took refuge on the mainland with FEMA’s help, but have still not been able to return home. Bethzaida Crespo, 36, moved her family to a hotel room in Orlando when her home in Dorado flooded. She received $3,000 for her losses and FEMA has paid for the hotel room. But that assistance is set to run out on July 23, and like many evacuees, she is looking to the agency for help finding a longer-term solution.","When a killer storm came to Puerto Rico, FEMA’s warehouse on the island was nearly empty, with not a single tarpaulin or cot left in stock.",2018-07-12T22:23:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","FEMA Was Sorely Unprepared for Puerto Rico Hurricane, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/us/fema-puerto-rico-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/us/13fema-01/13fema-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fault,1

Gabe Gurwin,"It’s probably been a while since you signed up for internet service, but you should have an idea of how fast your plan is. If not, give your ISP a call. Write down your plan’s maximum download and upload speeds. You can then use these speed-testing websites to see just your wifi’s actual performance stacks up to what you’re theoretically paying for. Before you begin, one quick word on testing: You’ll want to run a few speed tests at different times of the day across different sites, just in case your connection is suffering from congestion or any of the sites are under-reporting your speeds for whatever reason. Fast by Netflix Fast.com certainly lives up to its name, providing you with an almost immediate measurement of your download speeds in Mbps (megabits per second). If you click on “Show More Info” once the site’s measurement is finished, you can also test your upload speed and latency— how long it takes a webpage to start loading after you click a link. Fast.com also has an app if you want to check your speeds from your iOS or Android device. TestMy.net The speeds you see when testing your internet connection in the morning might not reflect the speeds you can expect to get in the afternoon or at night, when everyone is firing up Netflix after work. With TestMy.net, you can keep a tab open in your web browser and automatically measure your internet speed at different intervals throughout the day, which can help you figure out whether your ISP or your bandwidth-hogging neighbors are to blame for your connection. Ookla Speedtest The Ookla Speedtest measures your download speed, upload speed, and latency, and separate apps are also available for checking the same statistics on iOS, Android, and your Windows or Mac computer. Create an account to save your results and chart all of your readings, which can help you figure out whether your speeds are falling (or improving) over long-term testing. Measurement Lab Network Diagnostic Tool If you need more detailed information than some of the other internet speed tests provide, consider Measurement Lab’s Network Diagnostic Tool. It isn’t flashy at first—giving you basic information on latency, download speeds, and upload speeds—but selecting the Details tab will show you even more advanced information : your packet loss, any network congestion, duplex mismatches, and whether it thinks you might have a cable fault (to name a few options). SourceForge Internet Speed Test Numbers only tell so much of a story. You can run a bunch of tests, sure, but how much speed do you really need to stream a movie or play an online game? SourceForge’s Internet Speed Test gives you many of the same statistics as our other options, but it also recommends services you’ll be able to use (or should avoid) based on your ping, download and upload speeds, and a combination of your packet loss, jitter, and latency.

Adam Rosenberg,"More than 100,000 acres of land have been consumed by wildfires in California since Thursday night. Donald Trump would have you believe it's all the state's fault. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018 California's ""forest management"" is to blame. Not the confluence of environmental factors that most experts have pointed out. In Trump's view, California isn't using federal funds correctly. He even threatens to cut the state off from that money in the future if something doesn't change. Yeah. That'll show 'em. SEE ALSO: Intense videos show the Camp Fire ravaging Northern California Of course, the reality of what caused this fire (and so many others across the western U.S. in recent decades) is quite different. ""Climate change"" is the short explanation, since a warmer climate means more of the dry vegetation that helps to kindle and propagate these massive fires. The current spate of fires is still unusual, however. As Mashable's Mark Kaufman noted on Friday, we've reached the time of year when wildfire risks start to abate. As more rain starts to fall in mid-October and beyond, the dry conditions that feed these fires change. Unfortunately, California is in the midst of a record-setting dry spell for the fall season. A lack of rain, coupled with strong, dry winds from the north and east, have combined to create the conditions needed for large fires to start, and then spread. While fire-vulnerable communities can take steps to protect themselves by reducing the amount of vegetation in the surrounding area, it's not an issue that is solved by federal funding (or exacerbated by mismanagement of those dollars). Even setting aside Trump's inability to appreciate the complexity of the situation we've all been dealing with the same historically stupid leader since Jan. 2017 the timing of his victim-blaming tweet is highly questionable, given the tragic impact the fires have had so far. Not to mention the fact that Thousand Oaks, one of the California communities affected by the fires, is still dealing with the fresh grief of a mass shooting. Angry Twitter users were quick to school the president on all of this in the hours after his ill-advised (aren't they all?) Saturday morning tweet.

Sam Rutherford,"Things have been rocky for Snapchat. After going public in March 2017, Snap Inc. has seen its stock price drop by more than 50 percent in a little more than a year, while taking a $40 million loss on unsold Spectacles and more or less canceling a redesign that had users complaining in protest. So in an attempt to generate more revenue, Snapchat is inserting new unskippable ads into its still relatively popular social media app. The good news, though, is that if you just use Snapchat to talk to friends or follow your favorite celebrity, you may never actually see these ads. That’s because Snapchat’s new six-second commercials will be spliced into videos from its “Shows” section, which features longer-form videos produced by ESPN, NBC, Viacom, and others. Originally announced in April, Snap has been testing these ads over the last month before officially going live with them this week. However, it seems there are still some issues with the implementation of the new commercials. That’s because, on top of being unskippable for the first time, the new ads apparently don’t yet include any hyperlinks or additional information about the products in the actual ad. So in the event that you actually see an ad for something you want, you’ll still need to leave the app and resort to a Google search to learn more. With unskippable ads, Snapchat may be paving the way for premium subscriptions similar to what Google does with YouTube Red, which eliminates commercials in exchange for a monthly fee. Regardless, after revealing lackluster growth and higher losses in its latest earnings report, it’s hard to fault Snapchat too much for trying out new methods of bringing in money. The question now is: Will the increased revenue from ads offset the number of users these same ads could potentially drive away? If not, there’s a good chance Snapchat could continue on its slow, downward trajectory. [ AdAge ]","Things have been rocky for Snapchat.

Dr. Nassar, 54, was sentenced to 60 years in prison last month for a conviction related to child pornography, and he is awaiting additional sentencing after having pleaded guilty to one set of molestation charges, which could bring a life sentence. More criminal charges are likely to follow, and a group of accusers has also filed a civil case against him. Among Dr. Nassar’s more prominent accusers are the Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. Ms. Biles, who won four gold medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics, including in the all-around event, is 20 years old and still squarely in her prime as a gymnast. She mentioned in her statement that her dream was to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Games, though she lamented that it would require training in the facilities where she was abused. Ms. Biles had been fiercely protective of her teammates who revealed their own abuse, including during a controversy that ensued after Ms. Raisman disclosed her experience and Ms. Douglas seemed to criticize the victims before apologizing and adding her own name to the list.

Katrin Zimmermann,"I recently watched a stand-up show in which comedian Michelle Wolf made a cunning observation: Its our fault were not further along in period technology, because were ok that our best solution is a rolled-up piece of cotton.
Whether it really is womens fault is debatable, but she does make a valid point. You would assume for a problem that affects half of the worlds population every month, we would have come up with something a little more innovative by now. Yet only little progress has been made in female health since the invention of the birth control pill in 1960.
This came as a surprise to me, considering that both pharma and venture capital are traditionally male-dominated industries. Increasingly however, women are not ok with it.
The last few years have seen a staggering increase in start-ups using technology to cater to female health concerns, from period tracking to fertility solutions.
Currently, 21 percent of female-founded companies are in the health sphere, a market that is predicted to grow to $50 billion by 2025. These femtech companies succeed in what many start-ups set out to do but ultimately fail to achieve  solve real problems.
With only four percent of overall research and development funding going to female health, most products are designed without taking the physiological differences between men and women into account.
Until as recent as 1993, women were not even included in trials for new drugs. The reason for this, you guessed it, was the fear women might get pregnant during the trial period. Even today, most research is tested only on men. And not just human men even tests carried out on animals usually prefer male lab rats.
Yet the physiological differences between men and women are crucial when it comes to both the discovery and treatment of illnesses. 
Recent studies have revealed distinctive symptoms for heart attacks in men and women and demonstrated differences in the side effects of chemotherapy. In a world that is usually quick to point out the differences between men and women, I think its ironic we have failed to acknowledge them in one of the few areas where they actually matter.
Our lack of knowledge about the female body results in womens health concerns being taken less seriously than mens. This can have fatal consequences.
Women are more likely to be told that their pain is psychosomatic, which is a fancy way of saying that their symptoms are simply emotional reactions. On average, women wait 16 minutes longer to receive pain medication when they visit an emergency room from my experience, that is a pretty long time in this context.  
Yet its not just doctors who often dont take womens health concerns seriously. Years of stigmatization have also had a severe impact on womens understanding of their physical needs.
A Yale study found that many women hesitate to seek help when experiencing the symptoms of a heart attack, because they are afraid of being perceived as hypochondriacs.
Femtech makes an important contribution to combating these structural issues by demonstrating the authentic demand for products in the female health sphere. In fact, the demand is so high that many femtech start-ups, such as fertility-tracking app Woom, raise money through crowdfunding.
In addition, many femtech companies support the much-needed research in these fields. Period- tracking app Clue for example is sharing its data with leading universities such as Oxford, Stanford and Columbia.
Yet its not just researchers for whom this information is interesting. A lot of femtech companies perceive themselves as educators, fostering a long overdue honest conversation with women about their bodies.
At a time when womens bodies increasingly become battle grounds of identity politics, there are few areas where the personal and the political are as intertwined as in female health.
Women are already less likely to have insurance coverage compared to men, and often pay more for their schemes. With federal funding cut from many institutions catering to female health, femtech can play an important role in making at least some health products accessible and affordable.
Michelle Wolff may be happy to hear that 88 years after its invention, there are finally alternatives to the tampon. From Flex, a patented menstrual disc to Thinxs period-proof underwear. Many female founders are working to make the rolled-up piece of cotton history.","I recently watched a stand-up show in which comedian Michelle Wolf made a cunning observation: “It’s our fault we’re not further along in period technology, because we’re ok that our best solution is a rolled-up piece of cotton.” Whether it really is women’s …",2018-12-26T23:00:44Z,"{'id': 'the-next-web', 'name': 'The Next Web'}",Now’s the time to bridge the gap between female health and technology,https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/12/26/nows-the-time-to-bridge-the-gap-between-female-health-and-technology/,https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F12%2FUntitled-design-3-3.png&signature=874e92b381b882785655d64b6014a930,the-next-web,The Next Web,fault,1

And continually from time to time you drive away, by deferring it, the happiness of life, proper behavior, the being and living conformably to nature.” What It Means When you let yourself get distracted and allow your attention to slip, even for a little bit, Epictetus says you shouldn’t expect to get back to the focused mental state you were in. Remember, when you make a mistake like that now, everything that follows will be more difficult. You’re only deferring what you need to get done to a later day. To Epictetus, focus is a habit you form and maintain—but it goes both ways. If you constantly let your mind wander and your attention change course, you’ll develop bad habits that hinder your productivity down the line. What to Take From It You can’t work nonstop and you can’t stay focused on one thing eternally—breaks are important for the body and mind. But when it’s time to work, you need to buckle down and stay focused on what needs to be done. As Epictetus puts it, if procrastinating your focus was profitable, the complete lack of focus would be even more profitable. We all know that isn’t the case, so then why do you not maintain your focus when it’s time to get things done? Taking on a big task is like playing an arcade game: it requires all of your focus. As soon as you… Read more Read Work time is for work, play time is for play. And even when you play, you should do so with attention. A day without focus, he says, is a wasted day: “But now when you have said, ‘To-morrow I will begin to attend,’ you must be told that you are saying this, ‘To-day I will be shameless, disregardful of time and place, mean; it will be in the power of others to give me pain; to-day I will be passionate and envious.’ See how many evil things you are permitting yourself to do.” Enjoy your play time as much as you like, but focus on what you’re doing. Beware a fleeting mindset that constantly bounces from one thing to the other. Such distracted habits carry over to your working mind and make your life harder. Do things with intention, do them with focus, and you’ll develop a sharp, productive mind.","Welcome back to Mid-Week Meditations, Lifehacker’s weekly dip into the pool of stoic wisdom, and a guide to using its waters to reflect on and improve your life.

Robin Camarote,"I spend a fair amount of time working with some pretty miserable people. They see incompetence everywhere they look. They despise their staff and let it show. Working with these people is one of the many joys that comes with the organizational and leadership development work I do. And, I mean it. It's a joy--not as much for them--but it is for me. Here's why. I was miserable too. I held the title of the World's Worst Manager for several years in the 2000s. Only after a little HR crisis did I find a path to a happier, more productive, and satisfying place for myself and my team. On the other side of that experience, I gravitated towards managers in a similar place to where I'd been. Crossing paths in the hallways and break rooms, exchanging emails, and on conference calls, I could see and hear the pattern of anger and frustration. I wanted to help them, so I made one of those sharp right turns in my career. I left big data problems in search of big people problems--I made bad leadership behavior my focus. Not only are the patterns of bad leadership behavior the same, the blame game is the same too. The most common refrain I hear when first meeting with a leader in crisis is all about how truly awful, insubordinate, entitled, disrespectful, and ungrateful their team is. And while there is usually a kernel of truth in their complaints, the common denominator is always the leader themself. They're the problem. The sooner they see that, the faster they can fix it. The challenge is that it's really hard for most people to see themselves as the root of their problems. There are many years of excuses, justifications, and thought patterns that have led to where they are. These beliefs aren't reprogrammed quickly, but doing so is the key to moving forward. If you're a manager in the midst of your own little HR crisis, here are some signs that you'll find the culprit of it all in the mirror. More than one person has raised concerns to you or your boss. People stop talking when you walk into the room. You're getting similar feedback to what you've heard in a prior position. You were promoted based on your technical skills. You were professionally ""raised"" in an environment where you did what your boss told you to do. You think leadership training caters too much to people's softer sides. Because they're paid, you believe your team should just do their jobs and stop complaining. You've heard yourself think something like, ""If they're so unhappy, then they can just leave."" Your name is on the door. I include this catch-all at the end because this is the reality: If you're in charge, the team's culture and compatibility is your responsibility. This includes the team dynamic, morale, and the staff's attitude about you and the work. It's all you. I'd argue that when you accept a leadership position, you're also accepting responsibility for all of your team's outcomes. You can't have the glory, title, and compensation without owning the challenges that come with it. It's not an easy conversation to have with someone--especially a client who is paying for advice on how to get their team in line. But it's one that I often have to have. The faster you accept that it's you and not them, the faster you can find the help, resources, mentoring, and training needed to get yourself out of that miserable place. It's ok that you're not a perfect manager already. Despite what some people believe, great leaders and managers aren't born that way. They make themselves through intense self-reflection and behavior adjustments over time. You can do the same.

Ron Miller,"IBM has been offering quantum computing as a cloud service since last year when it came out with a 5 qubit version of the advanced computers. Today, the company announced that it’s releasing 20-qubit quantum computers, quite a leap in just 18 months. A qubit is a single unit of quantum information. The company also announced that IBM researchers had successfully built a 50 qubit prototype, which is the next milestone for quantum computing, but it’s unclear when we will see this commercially available. While the earliest versions of IBM’s quantum computers were offered for free to build a community of users, and help educate people on programming and using these machines, today’s announcement is the first commercial offering. It will be available by the end of the year. Quantum computing is a difficult area of technology to understand. Instead of being built on machines interpreting zeroes and ones in on/off states, quantum computers can live in multiple states. This creates all kinds of new programming possibilities and requires new software and systems to build programs that can work with this way of computing. Dario Gil, IBM Research VP of AI and IBM Q, says the increased number qubits is only part of the story. The more Qubits you deal with, the more complex the qubit interactions become because they interact with one another in a process called entanglement. If you have more qubits, but there is a high error rate as they interact, then they might not be any more powerful than 5 qubit machine with a lower error rate. He says that IBM researchers have managed to achieve the higher qubit number with low error rates, making them highly useful to researchers. “We have more qubits and less errors, which is combined to solve more problems,” Gil said. The other issue that comes into play when dealing with quantum states is that they tend to exist for a short period of time in a process known as coherence. It basically means that you only have a brief window of time before the qubits revert to a classical computing state of zeroes and ones. To give you a sense of how this coherence has been progressing, it was just a few nanoseconds when researchers started looking at this in the late 90s. Even as recently as last year, they were able to achieve coherence times of 47 and 50 microseconds for the 5 qubit machines. Today’s quantum machines are in the 90 microsecond range. While that doesn’t sound like much, it’s actually a huge leap forward. All of these variables make it difficult for a programmer to build a quantum algorithm that can achieve something useful without errors and before it reverts to a classical state, but that doesn’t take away from just how far researchers have come in recent years, and how big today’s announcement is in the quantum computing world. The ultimate goal of quantum computing is a fault tolerant universal system that automatically fixes errors and has unlimited coherence. “The holy grail is fault-tolerant universal quantum computing. Today, we are creating approximate universal, meaning it can perform arbitrary operations and programs, but it’s approximating so that I have to live with errors and a [limited] window of time to perform the operations,” Gil explained. He sees this is an incremental process and today’s announcement is a step along along the path, but he believes that even what they can do today is quite powerful. With today’s release and the the improvements that IBM made to the QISKit, a software development kit (SDK) to help companies understand how to program quantum computers, they can continue to advance the technology. It’s not going to happen overnight, but companies, governments, universities and interested parties are undertaking research to see how this can work in practical application. (And of course, IBM isn’t the only company working on this problem.) IBM sees applications for quantum computing in areas like medicine, drug discovery and materials science as this technology advances and becomes better understood. It is also trying to anticipate possible negative consequences of an advanced technology such as the ability to eventually be able to break encryption. Gil says they are working with standards bodies to try and develop post-quantum computing encryption algorithms, and while they are a long way from achieving that, they certainly seem to understand the magnitude of the issues and are trying to mitigate them.","IBM has been offering quantum computing as a cloud service since last year when it came out with a 5 qubit version of the advanced computers.

David Murphy,"macOS: I’m busy. You’re busy. We’re all busy. Sometimes, the sheer amount of crap you have to deal with can almost feel overwhelming, but a good way to get control of your chaotic to-do list without going crazy is to make sure you’re getting enough downtime, too. We have’t talked about the macOS app Time Out in more than a decade, but it’s a great way to ensure that you’re rewarding yourself with regular breaks throughout the day—be they “sit around and do nothing” breaks, “it’s time to stand up” breaks, or “Time to go lose a quick game of Fortnite” breaks. You should be treating yourself on a regular basis, and Time Out will help you stick to that promise. YouTube videos: You can never watch just one. It’s not your fault. YouTube does a great job of… Read more Read How to get set up with Time Out When you first start up the app, Time Out suggests two different kinds of breaks that you should consider taking throughout the day. The first, a “normal” break, is your typical “do nothing for 10 minutes every hour” routine. Fire up Metafilter. Put on your favorite music. If you work in a pretty hectic environment and feel guilty about doing absolutely nothing at your desk, it might be a good time to refill your coffee/water/soul (or sneak off for a fake poop, which not even the busiest of worker bees would dare question). Time Out also suggests you try taking advantage of “MicroBreaks,” or quick, 15-second spurts every 15 minutes—the kind of thing you would use to remind yourself not to slouch in your chair, to look away from your monitor and refresh your eyes a little, or to just stand up. Standing feels great. You can edit these intervals to anything you want, so be creative if Time Out’s suggestions don’t align with your workday. As you continue forward through the setup process, Time Out will ask you if you want it to try and determine when you aren’t at your computer—if you’re not typing on it, for example—so it can assume that you are out taking a break instead of prompting you to do so at set time periods. The app will drop you off at a final configuration screen that lets you set all sorts of options, including whether you want to use the app’s built-in snooze feature to delay a break for any number of minutes, whether you want a countdown for your breaks to appear in your macOS menu bar, and whether you want the app to skip breaks if you’re hunkering down in a particular app—like when you’re editing a video, for example. When break time hits, a giant image of the app’s tropical logo will fade into view on top of whatever you’re working on. The break timer then starts, though you’ll also be able to postpone your break for two different time periods or skip it altogether. Once the timer has elapsed, the icon fades back into nothingness, and back to work you go (high ho).","macOS: I’m busy. You’re busy. We’re all busy.

Caitlin Schneider,"Not to stress you out, but Christmas is 19 days away. And not to make assumptions about you, but you probably still need to buy gifts for your mom, dad, siblings, nieces and nephews, friends, significant other, office secret Santa, book club white elephant exchange, and that one aunt who always gives you a snow globe. As visions of dollar signs and Amazon browser tabs start to dance maniacally in your head, let us present an alternative. Save your wallet, your blood pressure, and frankly your soul, by not buying gifts for any of them. Gift giving is nice in theory, but it’s rarely a truly worthwhile exercise, especially when it comes to far-flung friends and relatives. You might love each other and care about each other, but that doesn’t mean you know about the headphones or decorative pillows each other have been eyeing, and you probably don’t share the kind of intimacy that allows you to say, “This isn’t quite my taste, but thank you!” Which is fine and understandable! But begs the question: why do we all put each other through this? What if we all agreed instead to just banish the ritual? Wouldn’t that bring its own kind of holiday cheer? Before you start to get clammy thinking about proposing this to your loved ones and subsequently being labeled a Scrooge, we have alternatives! Suggest, for example, pooling your money toward a group outing (did you know that experiences are very hip these days ?), or having everyone pick their favorite charity and make some donations for each other. When it comes to your significant other, propose investing in something for you as a couple (be it a fancy coffee maker or a night out). Or you could take a cue from Lifehacker’s own Nick Douglas and at least temper the gift giving madness by instituting a family Secret Santa exchange, so everyone only has to buy one gift, which solves all sorts of problems. Then there’s the most radical alternative: spending no money. There are plenty of other ways, after all, to outwardly express your love, gratitude, and festiveness. Instead of a mass gift exchange, you and your loved ones could trim the tree, cook a big meal together, listen to Christmas music, or take a drive to look at all the neighborhood lights. For long distance folks, there’s Skype calls, letters, Facebook posts, and you know, other forms of human connection that aren’t tied to consumerism. It might not be literally wrapped up with a bow, but as the old Grinch himself learned: Maybe Christmas doesn’t come from a store. It should be said that gifts themselves aren’t necessarily the problem—if you feel compelled to give, you should! Especially when it comes to people you really want to acknowledge like teachers, mail carriers, the kiddos in your life, or your work bestie. The trouble is with the holiday-mandated exchange, not the basic expression of appreciation or affection. If you do plan to try to forego gifts this year, start making moves now, and remember that the key is to not treat it like a death, but rather, the chance to do something new. You should prepare yourself to manage people’s feelings (many of us are way too used to that already), but people will probably be less offended than you think, especially if you make it less about banishing a beloved holiday ritual and more about putting a fresh, snow-covered spin on it. Everyone is fond of saying it’s the thought that counts, so whether you’d want to stop faking that thought, or want to find a way to better reflect it, no one can fault you for trying to bring some sincerity into the holiday fold.","Not to stress you out, but Christmas is 19 days away.

"USA TODAY, Charles Curtis, USA TODAY","NEW YORK - Pay the players? Change the rules of amateurism for student-athletes? Destroy everything at the NCAA and start from scratch? There's no perfect solution to the mountain of problems college basketball faces as the NCAA Tournament looms in the wake of a reported federal corruption investigation. But Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has some thoughts on the subject that he shared while attending the Turner and CBS Sports' March Madness media day Tuesday morning. On who's at fault: ""We all involved. The players, they took the money, so don't act like they're innocent bystanders. I tend to look at the big picture. Is the NCAA perfect? Not even close, but I don't want these people out there telling young black kids education is not important. Education is really important. How many of these guys are actually going to go pro? Less than 1 percent. It's interesting, I hear all these guys, who make a lot of money, who are the chosen ones, who are great at sports, talk how corrupt the NCAA is because (the organization) make (millions) a year. ""But the truth of the matter is I'm more concerned about the guys who don't go pro. People who actually have to get a real job who get a free education. I don't know anything about any of y'all in here, but I'm pretty sure some of y'all got some college debt. Would have been nice to go to a college and get a free education and not be in debt."" On the argument that college players don't get anything in return despite a scholarship: ""That drives me crazy when I hear they don't get anything. I'm not here to pound the drum for the NCAA. But the notion they're screwing these players, I hate that. I know so many of my friends, not NBA players who make millions, I mean friends who have real jobs who are still paying off college debt 10 to 20 years later. So I don't want to hear this crap they don't get anything."" (Photo by Frederick Breedon/Getty Images) On what the solution is: ""It's one of those unsolvable problems. But you need to sit at the table and make it better. Coaches are always going to cheat because they need to keep their jobs. Players are always going to take money, nobody turns down free money. You have people's livelihood at stake, because if you don't win, you're getting fired. ""There's no perfect answer. I hear these fools on TV - 'We have to play the players' - and I say, 'Well, how are you going to pay the players?' Are we paying the basketball and football teams? Then we have to pay the soccer team, the diving team, the swimming team. Then we have to pay the girls' sports. It's easy for a guy to get on TV and say we have to pay the players.

Olivia Singh,"Khloe Kardashian is backtracking on her previous comments and now saying that Tristan Thompson is to blame for her family's breakup, not Jordyn Woods. 
 In a series of tweets posted on Saturday, Kardashian wrote that she's ""a rollercoaster of emotions"" and ""said things that I shouldn't have."" 
 ""This has been an awful week &amp; I know everyone is sick of hearing about it all (as am I). I'm a rollercoaster of emotions &amp; have said things I shouldn't have. Honestly, Tristan cheating on me &amp; humiliating me, wasn't such a shock as the first time,"" Kardashian wrote. 
 She went on to say that Thompson's latest cheating scandal, in which he and Jordyn Woods kissed after she left a party at his home on Monday morning, was more difficult to deal with because of her close relationship with Woods. The Kardashian-Jenner family has known Woods since she was a child, after she formed a friendship with Kylie Jenner and Jaden Smith. 
 ""What's been harder &amp; more painful is being hurt by someone so close to me. Someone whom I love &amp; treat like a little sister. But Jordyn is not to be blamed for the breakup of my family. This was Tristan's fault,"" Kardashian wrote. 
 The reality TV star added that going forward, she's to focus on other aspects of her life, like her and Thompson's daughter named True. 
 ""I have to move on with my life &amp; count my blessings, my family, my health, &amp; my beautiful baby True,"" she wrote. 
 On Friday, Kardashian took to Twitter to call Woods a liar after the 21-year-old appeared on Jada Pinkett Smith's Facebook Watch series called ""Red Table Talk."" The interview marked the first time that Woods publicly commented on the incident that took place on Sunday.

 ""If you're going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!"" Kardashian tweeted. 
 The 34-year-old's remarks were contradictory to what Woods told Pinkett Smith on ""Red Table Talk."" During the episode, Woods said: ""I know I'm not the reason that Tristan and Khloe are not together."" 
 She added: ""This situation may have made it harder for her to want to be with him and I understand that, but I know I'm not the reason."" 
Tristan Thompson and Khloe Kardashian share a 10-month-old daughter, True Thompson.

Kardashian also said that Woods didn't apologize privately before her conversation with Pinkett Smith, but Woods said that she ""reached out"" and ""did as much apologizing as I could do over the phone, over text."" 
 In response to people who criticized Kardashian for seeming to put more blame on Woods than Thompson in regards to their cheating scandal, she said that the athlete was being held accountable. 
 ""Tristan is equally to blame but Tristan is the father of my child. Regardless of what he does to me I won't do that to my daughter. He has been addressing this situation PRIVATELY. If Tristan were to lie publicly about what conspired, then yes I would address him publicly as well,"" she wrote. 
 This isn't the first time reports have come out about Thompson's alleged infidelity. Kardashian and Thompson first went public as a couple in September 2016. About one year later, news of Kardashian's pregnancy broke. In the months following the pregnancy announcement, video surveillance footage surfaced which appeared to show Thompson ""fooling around"" with other women. Kardashian gave birth to their daughter, True Thompson, in April 2018. Representatives for Thompson didn't immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment.","On Saturday, Khloe Kardashian posted several tweets regarding Tristan Thompson's cheating scandal.

"Yascha Mounk, Yascha Mounk","If there’s one thing for which it’s impossible to fault Donald Trump, it is the clarity of his intentions. As he has emphasized in scores of tweets and public statements, he believes that the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia is illegitimate and that the president should have much greater sway over the decisions of the country’s law enforcement agencies. This conviction is the reason why he keeps attacking Robert Mueller. It is the reason why he and his allies have orchestrated a ferocious campaign to undermine the senior leadership of the FBI and the Department of Justice—from Andrew McCabe, who was fired in March, to Rod Rosenstein, who is still holding onto his job by a thin thread. And it is, as Trump himself admitted Monday, also why he has long called for the head of Peter Strzok, the senior FBI agent who sent private text messages that were highly critical of Trump and who was unceremoniously fired Monday. Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 13, 2018 In the wake of this news, talking heads and opinion writers are battling about whether Strzok did anything sufficiently egregious to justify his firing. It is true that there is considerable evidence that he at times fell short of the FBI’s exacting professional standards. As a report by the bureau’s inspector general pointed out, he may have been at fault in not moving fast enough to investigate an additional trove of Hillary Clinton’s emails recovered from Anthony Weiner’s laptop. He violated standard security policies by forwarding the draft of a search warrant affidavit containing highly sensitive information to his private email address. And while employees of the FBI are of course at liberty to express their personal political views in private conversations, the careless phrasing of some of his text messages—asked whether Trump could ever become president, he responded: “ No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.”—could reasonably undermine public confidence about the independence of the bureau. However, there is also strong evidence that Strzok’s personal views did not affect his professional conduct and even more compelling evidence that they did not sway the actions of the bureau as a whole. And while some of Strzok’s text messages do sound damning when taken out of context, the overall exchange makes it amply evident that he was not proposing some deep state plot to undermine Trump’s candidacy. As the inspector general’s report concluded, “we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.” But the minutiae of Strzok’s conduct are ultimately a distraction. The most important question right now is not “Were Strzok’s failings sufficiently grievous for him to get fired?” It is, rather: “Did he get fired because of his failings—or did the FBI buckle under the enormous pressure exerted by Donald Trump?” That question is, unfortunately, far easier to answer. Testifying in front of Congress in June, the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, promised that the investigation into Strzok would be “ done by the book.” But that is emphatically not what happened. The bureau’s Office of Professional Responsibility merely recommended that Strzok be demoted and suspended for 60 days. But it was then overruled by David Bowdich, the deputy director of the FBI As Bradley Moss, a leading national security lawyer, has pointed out, that step was “highly unusual. Maybe legal but definitely not standard practice.” This should make us very concerned about the impending clash between Trump and his real target: Robert Mueller. And this is why the crux of this complicated saga is actually pretty straightforward. Strzok stood accused of undermining public trust in the independence of the FBI through his carelessness. This is indeed a significant offense, one that liberals and conservatives alike should take very seriously. But by caving to a massive campaign of vilification by the president, and publicly violating Wray’s promise that the investigation into Strzok would be done by the book, the bureau’s leadership has undermined that trust in a much more public, deliberate, and grievous manner than the man they scapegoated ever did. Even at this late stage, many commentators still take it for granted that Trump’s attempts to curb the independence of key political institutions will miraculously be foiled by the Constitution. But Strzok’s firing is only the latest in a series of cases in which high-ranking civil servants have been personally attacked by the president and then been forced to leave office under highly unusual circumstances: At this point, Trump has managed to dispatch the FBI’s director, its deputy director, its general counsel, and the head agent of its investigating agency. This is worrying for two important reasons. First, it sends a clear message to rank-and-file bureaucrats across different agencies: If you value your career, you better stay in the president’s good books. It will take years or decades until we gain the full measure to which this message may already be swaying supposedly apolitical decisions at all levels of the government. And if the message keeps being sent in ever more high-profile cases, we will have to start worrying that political pressure could influence the behavior of key institutions in ways that are directly inimical to the proper functioning of a democracy (like, for example, an investigation of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on trumped-up charges). Second, it should make us very concerned about the impending clash between Trump and his real target: Robert Mueller. As Rep. Devin Nunes recently reminded us in his shocking remarks at a private fundraiser, many Republican legislators are now determined to defend the president against any meaningful investigation at just about any cost. The received wisdom remains that Trump cannot possibly win such an open confrontation. If Trump removes Mueller, the smart money says, it would mark the effective end of his presidency. But so far, Trump has amassed a strikingly strong batting average when it came to getting the targets of his ire fired from their jobs. So if the strange saga of Peter Strzok does nothing else, it should refocus our attention on the urgency of defending the independence of our key political institutions, including the FBI and the Mueller probe. As the experience of countless other countries, from Russia to Turkey, shows, attacks on the rule of law often start with the politically motivated purge of comparatively minor figures whose record is not entirely clean. Once institutions that are supposed to be independent from the head of state become accustomed to yielding to political pressure, the demands keep ratcheting up. Before long, any critics of the government know that they are unlikely to receive the same treatment as other citizens. We are still far from that dystopia. But despite Strzok’s undoubted failings, the highly irregular manner of his firing is another early link along the chain that leads from the rule of law to what the Founding Fathers rightly deplored as “the rule of men.” If you think Slate’s work matters, become a Slate Plus member.

Devin Coldewey,"It wouldn’t be the launch of a first-generation Apple product without a few hiccups — who can forget Antennagate and Bendgate? — and the iPhone X is no different. A handful of users report that a mysterious and inextinguishable green line has appeared on their device’s display. The above images, from Twitter users mix0mat0sis, Nate Heagy, and Christian Roman, represent a few of the examples of the “green line of death” as the latter called it. No one seems to know what causes it or how prevalent it actually is. I’ve asked Apple for comment. We can at least speculate on one part of that. iPhone Xs have a new diamond subpixel pattern in their displays, and as such all green subpixels appear in lines, while red and blue alternate. You can see that in this image taken as part of DisplayMate’s tests : It seems likely that an electrical fault in a few phones is causing voltage to flow to all the green sub-pixels in a line. That it stretches all the way from top to bottom suggests it’s something at the edge of the display that’s sending an incorrect voltage down a few lines of pixels (if it were just one line of sub-pixels, it would appear much thinner). The line tends to be close to the right or left side of the phone, but that’s harder to diagnose. This kind of issue always pops up in ambitious devices that use several new kinds of tech at scale. It happened to Samsung last year, except the line was pink. Even if only 0.001 percent of the displays they put together were faulty, a frequency that’s nearly impossible to test for, a few users will still end up with a bum phone. One such user already reports that their phone was replaced at the Apple store, so it seems unlikely that this is a software issue. Is your phone showing this line? Take a picture and let us know.

MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Mr. Romney appeared at peace in relative obscurity, friends say, though whenever he would inch back into the public consciousness, the megaphone he retained pleased him. “He was surprised that he could still get on any TV show,” Josh Romney said. He flirted briefly with a run for president in 2016, before reconsidering. The Senate opening, with Orrin G. Hatch stepping away after seven terms, made him think harder, with bipartisan encouragement. In fact, a funny thing had happened to Mr. Romney when he receded from view: People got to know him better. A documentary in 2014, “ Mitt,” captured shades of character that his campaigns never could, for all the millions spent on messaging. He was warm, self-deprecating, cleareyed about his weaknesses. Mr. Romney had long been such a stylistic throwback — a man whose idea of profanity was “H-E-double-hockey-sticks,” edging into a theater of insults — that his earnestness qualified as refreshing. He does not swear. He does not drink. He does not age. “People need to see the real Mitt,” said Fraser Bullock, who worked with Mr. Romney at Bain Capital and as a top lieutenant for the 2002 Olympics. And the Senate campaign, friends believe, is a last chance to do it right. They do not fault him for de-emphasizing his past rejection of Mr. Trump, observing that he has not explicitly disavowed the remarks, either. Mr. Romney recently told NBC News that he does not consider Mr. Trump a role model for his grandchildren. “He’s not running against Donald Trump. He’s running for Mitt Romney,” said Thomas Rath, a former top aide on his presidential campaigns. “I haven’t heard him say that he withdraws his previous reservations.” “Look at the ducks. Look at the ducks. There’s a duck! There’s a duck. Hello, ducks.” His wife was freezing, damp babies were crying, and Mr. Romney was admiring farm animals.","His wife said they were done with campaigns.

TIMOTHY EGAN,"To authoritarians, language is a weapon, usually deployed in the service of an emotional half-truth: something you believe to be true even if it isn’t. Truth has to become meaningless — “What is a fact?” — in order for this strategy to work and morality to become a shapeless thing. We saw it when Vice President Mike Pence called the former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio a champion of “the rule of law.” Arpaio is a convicted criminal later pardoned by Trump. You can say he’s a hero to the political right, or a fighter, but by no standard is a sheriff who was repeatedly called out for violating the law a champion of the rule of law. And we saw it in graphic detail over the last week with the Trump administration policy of ripping migrant children from their parents. The cages holding weeping kids are “ essentially summer camps,” in the words of the Fox News host Laura Ingraham. Worse, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the administration’s zero tolerance policy that led to 2,300 children being taken from their parents doesn’t exist — “period.” A day after saying this, she defended the policy that doesn’t exist. And on Wednesday, Trump signed an order trying to resolve a crisis that he created, after saying earlier he couldn’t stop it because it was the fault of others, even if it did exist. After a while, people come to “believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true,” wrote Hannah Arendt, the German-born philosopher, in describing how truth lost its way in her native land.","Mike Leach, head football coach at Washington State University, tweeted out a video that was doctored to make Barack Obama sound like a one-world-government tyrant.

BEN BRANTLEY,"If Mr. Iwuji is your first Othello, you may not entirely buy his getting fatally worked up over Iago’s planting of false evidence about Desdemona’s alleged infidelity. When speaking of Desdemona, Othello declares that “when I love thee not/Chaos is come again,” it’s with a cerebral self-awareness that blunts the prophecy’s grim threat. Mr. Stoll, a fine Brutus in last summer’s notorious “Julius Caesar,” is not quite the evil genius that Iago must be. Whether explaining his dastardly plans to the audience or whispering sweet poison into Othello’s ear, this Iago’s manner is usually jocular and expository. Until the very end, when he loses his smiling cool, he comes across less as a supersmart psychopath than a riled-up good old boy. And when at the first half’s conclusion, he tells Othello, “I am your own forever,” that terrifying, double-edged pledge of loyalty lands with muffled impact. The tableau-like staging here, as Iago kneels before his commander, brings to mind Lancelot and Arthur in “Camelot.” In terms of clarity and pace, it’s hard to fault the direction of Mr. Santiago-Hudson, who oversaw last year’s splendid, Tony-winning revival of August Wilson’s “Jitney.” The show’s pageantry — enhanced by Rachel Hauck’s stately set, Jane Cox’s strategic lighting and Jessica Paz’s stealthy sound design — never eclipses its exceptional legibility of story and character. Every crucial plot point is neatly but never disproportionately highlighted. For once, you are unlikely to confuse any of the supporting characters, and some of these roles are as well drawn as any I’ve seen. The relative newcomer Babak Tafti gives a terrific, breakout performance as Cassio, Othello’s lieutenant and Iago’s bane. He brims with the untidy passion of a decent but ambitious young man who has not yet learned to control his emotions. His drunk scene in Cyprus (orchestrated by Iago) is heartbreaking; so is his abject contrition afterward.","Ruben Santiago-Hudson’s elegantly staged interpretation of this tale is good-looking and well-spoken, though lacking in fatal passion.",2018-06-19T01:45:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Review: A Cool-Tempered ‘Othello’ for Warm Central Park Nights,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/theater/othello-shakespeare-in-the-park-review.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/19/arts/19othello1/19othello1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fault,1

But that “town crier” is just a random guy dressed in goofy clothes and has nothing to do with Buckingham Palace. The self-appointed town crier, whose real name is Tony Appleton, has been around for years. He announced that a royal baby was on its way in 2013, and popped up again in 2015 when the baby was born. But again, he has nothing to do with the royal family, despite what some American news outlets might have you believe. ABC News posted an uncritical video of the dude and Business Insider did the same before changing its headline and story to acknowledge that Appleton has nothing to do with the royal family. And he’s fooled plenty of others in the past. So why does Appleton do it? “I’m a royalist. I love the royal family,” Appleton told the Associated Press in 2013 while admitting that he has no official royal duties. “I came unannounced.” Many people are wise to Appleton’s fakery, but that doesn’t stop plenty of American news outlets from seeing a guy in a tricorn hat and thinking, yeah this seems normal. And from there, it spreads like wildfire across social media. But I suppose it’s not entirely our fault. The idea of royalty is about as silly as this over-the-top town crier is anyway—though I guess no less silly than having a reality TV star as your president.

Kevin Daum,"People often talk about the importance of listening, and indeed it is critical. But it's much harder today to really listen with all the distractions of modern life. Businesses can lose their customer service focus if they're not fully tuned in. And it's not just about hearing your customer's voices. It's also about recognizing what they're not saying, and satisfying needs they don't even know they have. YPO member Bobby Jorgensen is all ears. When Jorgensen opened his first car dealership - in Detroit - he knew he would have to be different to attract customers in such an overcrowded market. His solution sounds simple : listen to the customers very, very carefully. But it's not as easy as it seems. Truly understanding what customers are communicating is a skill Jorgensen had to develop. But the more he listened, the more his dealership, Kistler Ford, grew. Here, Jorgensen shares his philosophy on exactly why listening makes for good business and society: 1. Most Don't Do It If you're looking for a way to differentiate yourself, Jorgensen advises being a better listener. ""People talk about how important listening is,"" Jorgensen says. ""But it's much harder today to really do it, so they don't follow through."" When he opened his dealership, Jorgensen listened everywhere: his customers, his salespeople, even his kids. What he found was a customer base longing for someone to take the time to hear and understand their needs. He says, ""Oddly, with all the communication technology we have, I've found people actually listen even less."" Jorgensen was there to fill this void for his customers, and his dealership took off. Listening is an inexpensive, effective way of making yourself stand out to consumers. 2. People Don't Like a Salesman Jorgensen started to build his company by asking a lot of what he called "" common sense questions."" Jorgensen reflected, ""What do people hate? They hate salespeople. But why, exactly?"" Now, Jorgensen believes the way we sell cars is broken. He explains, ""People hate going into a dealership and getting beaten down in the finance office. So we don't!"" So in addition to making his dealership unique, listening also makes Jorgensen's dealership a more pleasant place for people to visit. 3. It's Free, With Huge ROI For Jorgensen, one of the most satisfying parts of listening is that it's free. Customer service doesn't have to be elaborate or expensive. Sometimes what's really needed is genuine attention. ""Listening is an opportunity,"" Jorgensen asserts. ""It takes more time, but sitting and listening to my customers and my salespeople has been the single most important thing I've done for my organization."" By listening carefully, Jorgensen is able to hear what his competitors cannot, and thereby stay a step ahead of them. 4. There a Lot to Hear in Silence Jorgensen likes to listen even when there aren't words.

Bill Bostock,"American Airlines passengers were put back onto an aircraft which was forced into an emergency landing the day before after an electrical fault— only for the same thing to happen again. 
 The passengers had spent an unscheduled night in Phoenix, Arizona, on their way from Los Angeles International Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy, because of an electrical fault with a chiller on board the Airbus 321. 
 But, not long into their replacement flight to New York, staff noticed a similar fault which meant the plane had to land again. 
 Passengers were put on flight AA9240 just after midday Thursday, around 12 hours after the emergency landing, which was at around midnight the night before. 
 They spent less than half an hour in the air before coming back, after what American described as an ""electrical smell"" from the device. This map, from tracking site flightradar24, shows the brief journey:

A passenger on board, who asked not to be named, described the experience to Business Insider. American Airlines confirmed the details of their account. 
 A spokesman for the airline said the Airbus 321 had undergone maintenance work between the two flights. After the second landing, it was taken out of service altogether. 
 A statement said: 
 ""The aircraft that was previously diverted to Phoenix the other night was fixed Thursday morning. The issue was isolated to the aircraft chiller in the forward galley of the aircraft. Most passengers had already been rebooked on other flights from Phoenix to New York, when the flight continued under Flight 9240. 
 (Sometimes when we have the same flight number operating on the same day we need to renumber the flight number.) 
 Once airborne from Phoenix, a similar issue involving an odor from the chiller was noticed by our crew, and the flight returned back to Phoenix. The aircraft is out of service, as our team continues to troubleshoot the source of the odor, which may be a faulty fan. 
 The return on the second flight was NOT an emergency landing, and it was an electrical smell from the area where the chiller is installed in the front galley."" 
Afer the second landing, passenger Addisa Gugal tweeted: ""Complete disregard for passenger safety."" 
 ""After making an emergency landing last night because the cabin smelled like an electrical fire, American Airlines put us back on the same plane this morning because they 'needed the plane in NY' and we had to make another emergency landing.""

 Another passenger, who wished to remain anonymous, told Business Insider that passengers were not aware they were getting back on the plane from the previous day. 
Another third passenger, Jason Gallus, tweeted: ""I was on flight aa10 last night LAX to JFK and smoke filled up the cabin and we had to make an emergency landing in Phoenix."" 
 ""Then this morning my parents went on the same aircraft flight aa9240 and 20 minutes into the flight had to make another emergency landing, with all the same passengers.""

But $100 for a dash cam from a company like Garmin is a good deal, and given the Speak is designed to sit smack dab in the middle of your windshield, you probably wouldn’t want to stick a second device up there anyways.

"USA TODAY, Kevin Allen, USA TODAY","Los Angeles Kings head coach John Stevens has overseen a struggling group early this season. (Photo: Kyusung Gong, AP) The NHL boasts its share of good stories in the early going, including surprising starts by the Montreal Canadians (4-1-2) and Vancouver Canucks (5-3-0). And how about those Colorado Avalanche, who are 5-1-2? Or Auston Matthews, who has 10 goals in nine games, or David Pastrnak and Nathan MacKinnon, who both have eight goals in eight games? Anaheim Ducks goalie John Gibson’s.949 save percentage in his first seven starts is also noteworthy because his Gibson’s save percentage has been growing steadily since 2014-15. But life hasn’t gone as well for other NHL folks. Here are those already feeling the pressure after the first 19 days of the season: Los Angeles Kings general manager Rob Blake: The Kings are 2-5-1 and that does not appear to be a fluke. While it is true injuries to Jonathan Quick and Dustin Brown have undermined them, they simply don’t look like a team designed to compete in the speed-driven NHL. Fans are starting to wonder whether Blake should have done more in the offseason to change the look of this team. The Kings still boast core players from their two championships. Have they kept them for too long? The Kings have a -13 goal differential and rank 30th in the league with a 1.88 goals-per-game scoring average. The team’s power-play percentage is 10.7%. Quick is a proven difference-maker, but his return to the lineup a few days ago didn’t change all of that. His.851 save percentage and 4.67 goals-against average after three games are symbolic of the team’s struggles. San Jose Sharks defenseman Erik Karlsson : This is not the kind of start the Sharks envisioned when they acquired Karlsson this offseason. At some point, Karlsson will explode offensively. But right now, he has no goals and his plus-minus of -4 in the Sharks’ worst. The Sharks' power play also ranks 22nd. The 4-3-1 Sharks are expected to be among the Western Conference's best teams. St. Louis Blues defenseman Jay Bouwmeester: He was a healthy scratch on Saturday for the first time in his career, and the Blues looked sharper defensively in a 4-1 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bouwmeester is 35, and his effectiveness has slipped. Blues general manager Doug Armstrong made key offseason moves to strengthen this team, but they need Bouwmeester playing at a higher level to be a strong defensive team. Los Angeles Kings coach John Stevens : Fair or not, coaches are the first to pay the price for a struggling team. It’s hard to not list him on the top of the candidates to be the first coach to be fired this season. Could he be getting more out of his team? Probably. But he cannot make them faster. Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas: The managerial wunderkind has as much job security as any GM in the game. But he’s in Toronto, where fans judge the tiniest of moves. He has to feel pressure about the stalemated contract negotiations with William Nylander, a restricted free agent, who hasn't played this season. Nylander is an important asset. Should Dubas budge on his offer and risk more salary cap trouble in the future? He has more negotiations on the horizon, including with Matthews, a restricted free agent this offseason. Or does Dubas trade Nylander for a defenseman, a position the Maple Leafs need to strengthen to make a run for the Stanley Cup? Even if Dubas gets Nylander signed, he is under pressure to find a blueliner. Vegas Golden Knights left wing Max Pacioretty : General manager George McPhee acquired Pacioretty and gave him a four-year contract extension that pays him $7 million per season starting in 2019-20. He is supposed to replace the goals lost by the departure of James Neal. But Pacioretty hasn’t found his way yet, posting one goal and no assists in his first eight games. Neal has also started slowly in Calgary with one goal in eight games. Both of them have 25-goal potential.

Nick Visser,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeatedly refused to blame American student Otto Warmbier’s death on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an appearance before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday.
Instead, Pompeo broadly cast Warmbier’s death as that fault of the “North Korean regime” and declined to explain President Donald Trump’s fondness for Kim himself. Trump has referred to the dictator as his “friend” and a “real leader” he fell in “love” with.
Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) pressed Pompeo about the White House’s reversals on sanctions against North Korea last week during the secretary’s testimony before the committee. The exchange grew fiery at one point when the lawmaker simply asked why Trump liked Kim.
“Was he responsible for the decision not to allow Otto Warmbier to come home until he was on death’s door?” Malinowski asked of Kim.
“I’ll leave the president’s statement to stand,” Pompeo said. “We all know that the North Korean regime was responsible for the tragedy that occurred to Otto Warmbier. I’ve met that family, I know those people, I love them dearly. They suffered mightily, sir.”
“So what’s to like about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski asked.
“Sir, don’t make this a political football,” Pompeo replied. “It’s inappropriate.”
Pompeo demurred in a similar way earlier this month in an interview with USA Today, declining to link Kim to Warmbier’s death several times.
North Korea imprisoned Warmbier for stealing a propaganda poster during a trip in 2016 and sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor. Pyongyang released him to the United States a year later in critical condition, and he died in June 2017.
Trump has heralded himself for bringing Warmbier home, but members of his administration have continually failed to directly blame Kim for the student’s death. The president drew widespread ire last month when he said he took Kim “at his word” after the dictator said he was unaware of the student’s treatment. Experts are highly skeptical that a U.S. prisoner could have been held in the country without Kim knowing it.
The comments also drew a rebuke from Warmbier’s family, who said their son’s death was the responsibility of “Kim and his evil regime. ... No excuses or lavish praise can change that.”
North Korea policy experts said they weren’t surprised by Pompeo’s reluctance to link Kim directly to Warmbier’s death on Wednesday, saying that by doing so, the Trump administration can appear to be taking a hard line against the regime while maintaining some semblance of diplomacy with Kim himself.
“The administration is trying to square the circle between holding the regime responsible for its treatment of Otto Warmbier, but not criticize Kim directly — who they are trying to keep from testing a satellite launch vehicle, or worse, and to keep the diplomatic process from completely imploding,” Vipin Narang, an associate professor at MIT, told HuffPost.
Alexandra Bell, a senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said Pompeo has long avoided laying any specific blame at Kim’s feet, instead painting the regime with a broad brush to preserve any diplomatic relations.
“That is not surprising given the (hopefully) ongoing negotiations with North Korea,” Bell wrote in an email. “That said, Rep. Malinowski has been very clear about his concerns over human rights in North Korea and in his assessment of who is to blame for the death of Otto Warmbier. His line of questioning should not have come as a surprise.”","The secretary of state broadly said the North Korean regime was at fault, but experts say he is still trying to play diplomat with Kim.",2019-03-28T01:06:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Mike Pompeo Again Refuses To Blame Kim Jong Un For Otto Warmbier’s Death,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-pompeo-kim-jong-un-otto-warmbier_n_5c9c0c7be4b072a7f60472ce,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9c15802a0000ba024f7b66.jpeg?cache=gwYnQprhlG&ops=1200_630,,Huffpost.com,fault,1
Sinéad Baker,"President Donald Trump denied directing his former lawyer Michael Cohen to break the law, and said that it is Cohen's own fault if anything he did on Trump's behalf was illegal. Trump tweeted on Thursday: ""I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law."" Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday for an array of crimes he committed while employed by the president. Cohen has implicated Trump, saying he broke the law out of ""blind loyalty"" to the president. He said in court that he had felt it was his ""duty"" to cover for Trump's ""dirty deeds."" Read More: How Michael Cohen went from saying he would 'take a bullet' for Trump to implicating him in federal crimes ""I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real-estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired,"" he said. Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said during Wednesday's sentencing that Cohen had come forward ""to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country."" Lanny Davis, an adviser to Cohen, also said the president's former lawyer would ""state publicly all he knows"" about the president. Cohen lied to Congress about his involvement in a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and made hush-money payments in 2016 to two women who said they had affairs with the president. Cohen implicated Trump in the campaign-finance violations, which were connected to the payments, saying they were made on the president's behalf at the height of the 2016 campaign. Trump said on Twitter on Thursday that Cohen ""was guilty on many charges unrelated to me."" He said that the charges he was found guilty of were not criminal and repeated his earlier argument that Cohen pleaded guilty to get a shorter sentence. ""Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not guilty even on a civil basis,"" Trump wrote. ""Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!!"" Trump, who once had a close relationship with Cohen, had called his former personal lawyer a liar before he was sentenced. And over the last few weeks, the president has found himself facing mounting legal and political liability as Cohen cooperated with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York as well as those working for the special counsel Robert Mueller. On Wednesday, federal prosecutors announced that they had reached a nonprosecution agreement with American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, which spent $150,000 to purchase the rights to, but not publish, the account of Karen McDougal, the model who said she had a 10-month affair with Trump. While Cohen says he broke the law at Trump's direction, Trump's attorneys argue that Cohen's payments to buy the silence of McDougal and of the porn star Stormy Daniels, who Cohen paid $130,000 in October 2016 to keep her from discussing what she says was a 2006 affair with Trump, were a ""simple private transaction"" and did not constitute campaign finance violations because they were made to protect Trump's family and businesses. But election-law experts and former federal prosecutors aren't convinced that Trump, who has denied having an affair with either woman, was concerned about the women's stories solely for personal reasons. ""The timing and surrounding facts, which include a NPA with the Enquirer, show a pattern of purposeful concealment with the sole intent of hiding the truth from the electorate a month before the election,"" Jeffrey Cramer, a former longtime federal prosecutor in Chicago, told INSIDER.",President Trump denied directing his former lawyer Michael Cohen to break the law after Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes he committed while employed by the president.

Rachel Kraus,"It's a sue and be sued world out there! In August, Juul Labs filed trademark claims against 30 entities in China selling counterfeit Juul products on Ebay. Now, the company has announced that a federal court granted the company a temporary restraining order over the accounts, and froze the counterfeiters' PayPals. Take that, counterfeiters! SEE ALSO: This anti-smoking giant is taking on Juul For Juul, this isn't a simple matter of copyright infringement, though. The company is fighting to reduce teenage use of the product, especially in light of a FDA investigation into why teens love Juuls so much (and whether that's Juul's fault ). And maintaining control over online sales that are age-verified is a crucial component of that campaign. Legitimate Juul products are only available online through Juul's website. However, as of this writing, there were over 2,000 listings for Juul or Juul-related products on Ebay. Any Juul device or pod you might see on Ebay or elsewhere that's not Juul's website directly comes from a counterfeiter, or an unauthorized seller. But selling Juul directly through the company's own site isn't just important to controlling the company's cashflow, or even for verifying that the product is the real deal. Keeping Juul's site as the sole online seller is crucial to ensuring that teens don't purchase the e-cigs online. ""Keeping JUUL out of the hands of young people is a priority for us,"" Victoria Davis, a Juul Labs spokesperson told Mashable over email. ""We have a strict and industry-leading age-verification process on our Web site so no one under the age of 21 can access JUUL. However, counterfeiters do not utilize the same type of age verification systems, which may enable minors to purchase products."" Juul's site requires users to register with their social security numbers in order to verify that they're over 21. So circumventing Juul's commerce system means that the counterfeiters are actually undermining the company's very intentional efforts to keep the cute lil' vapes out of the hands of kids. Juul is going after the counterfeiters through the legal system, as well as directly with sales platforms like Ebay and Amazon. But Davis described the hunt for counterfeiters as a ""challenge"" because the sellers can easily make new profiles. That isn't deterring Juul, though, since more counterfeiters are popping up as the company grows. ""The prevalence of counterfeiters has increased dramatically over the last year consistent with JUUL’s rise in the marketplace,"" Davis said. ""The process of tracking and identifying the culprits of counterfeit products is time intensive. We have dedicated resources to this initiative to ensure these products stay off the market and out of hands of underage users."" In other words, Juul's attempts to go after counterfeiters is like USB-vape whack-a-mole. And the nicotine habits of kids are on the line.","It's a sue and be sued world out there!

Carla Sinclair,"Apparently sexual harassment is a woman's fault when she goes out of her way to make herself attractive, according to actress Angela Lansbury. In an interview with Radio Times, the 92-year-old actress said women need to take at least some of the blame for sexual harassment and rape. “There are two sides to this coin. We have to own up to the fact that women, since time immemorial, have gone out of their way to make themselves attractive. And unfortunately it has backfired on us - and this is where we are today,"" she said. “We must sometimes take blame, women. I really do think that. Although it’s awful to say we can’t make ourselves look as attractive as possible without being knocked down and raped.” According to Uproxx : Lansbury went on to say she never suffered any kind of harassment while working as a young actress at MGM Studios in the 1940s. What’s more, she added that individual women were not to blame, necessarily. “Should women be prepared for this? No, they shouldn’t have to be. There’s no excuse for that,” she said, “and I think it will stop now — it will have to. I think a lot of men must be very worried at this point.” Even so, her blanket statements about some of the fault belonging to women as a group have not sat well with those who have read them. Yes, Lansbury, who brags about never herself having been sexually harassed, is from another generation, and will hopefully evolve after the onslaught of reactions she's getting from the Twitterverse.

Not sure. 11k Bitcoin is over $11k, which is great news for me, the person that sold some around 4 hours before it hit $11k. Either way, it always produces some really good articles, like this one, where someone suggests that there’s such a thing as a “Bitcoin investment strategy,” which I call “bullshit.” There’s no such thing.

Chris Taylor,"Remember the optical illusion known simply as the dress ? Sure you do. Black and blue or white and gold? This was the question that divided the internet back in the more innocent time of February 2015. The fault lines ran through marriages and friendships: We simply could not believe that someone so close to us could see things so differently when the truth, as we saw it, seemed so obvious. Then came the candidacy and presidency of one Donald J. Trump, and we discovered what divided perceptions really looked like online. And now, the Trump effect seems to have settled a bit. At this point, you've probably blocked and unfriended everyone whose mind could not be changed, or you've become numb to the constant lies and corruption, or maybe we're just in the calm before the Mueller and midterm storms. Clearly, we needed a new thing that could tear us apart in a safer, more innocent way. Something that would break through the social media filter bubbles we've built around ourselves to avoid hearing aggravating opinions. And into that cultural vacuum stepped Yanny vs. Laurel. SEE ALSO: The original Yanny vs. Laurel audio will finally settle this once and for all This time it was an audio illusion rather than an optical one. In a one-second clip, some heard the name Yanny, some heard Laurel. The clip spread in just as viral a manner as the dress. In a matter of hours it hopped the barrier from Twitter and Facebook sensation to old-school media curiosity. Local news loved it. The New York Times produced a slider tool that changed the frequency from high to low, helping you hear one sound or the other. As with the dress, our obsession with this test appeared to be derived from its unpredictability. In 2018, cultural bubbles have become almost boringly impenetrable. Tell me how someone voted at the last presidential election, and I've got a pretty good chance at guessing their positions on gun control or immigration — and at assessing whether real debate is even possible. But with Yanny v. Laurel, there's no telling what a given ear will hear. Anecdotal evidence suggested offices were about equally divided. The controversy was tailor-made for watercooler chatter. ""Team Yanny"" and ""Team Laurel"" quickly emerged (as did the smaller subset of us that could hear both and wondered what all the fuss was about). ""Our marriage is a lie!"" joked a friend on Facebook of her spouse hearing things differently. With Yanny v. Laurel, there's no telling what a given ear will hear. The subtext of all this: how nice it is to find a vast gulf of difference between friends, especially a difference that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. This need seems to be something new in the world. It isn't quite the same impetus that divides us as sports fans; the teams we choose have more to do with our birthplace and family background than anything else. Debates between fandoms — Star Trek and Star Wars, say — are an endless set of questions with no objective answers. Fans who loved or hated The Last Jedi are almost as immovable as the pro- and anti-Trumpers. SEE ALSO: 'Last Jedi' gets thumbs up from 89% of viewers, says new poll So a big part of what made the divisions over the dress and the audio clip so satisfying is that both controversies had definitive answers that were discovered within 24 hours. Widespread curiosity over such a small thing mandated that we would find the truth sooner rather than later. The dress was black and blue. The audio clip turned out to be from a recording for Vocabulary.com, and the word was ""laurel."" Sorry about that, Team Yanny. In the era of fake news, when our country can't agree on a single political reality even when presented with evidence, how nice it is to have that level of certainty! Sports fans never have this sense of closure: Win the World Series or the Super Bowl and you're still open to the charge that the victory was a fluke. You still have to defend it endlessly. Again, the fact that the stakes are so low is helpful. We'll remember the controversy, we'll devour the science on why we hear differently, but there isn't going to be an online industry of Yanny truthers. Info Wars (probably) isn't going to bother insisting that the Deep State is trying to make us hear Laurel. The game is definitively over, but thanks for playing! There isn't going to be an online industry of Yanny truthers. What does it say about us that we're so eager for this kind of division? One explanation is the rule of 150, also known as Dunbar's Number. Turns out our brains have a hard time handling more than this number of friendships, because that's the rough size of the tribal groups we evolved in. We see the 150 limit cropping up in military units, small businesses, Christmas card lists, and even the number of Facebook friends we actually interact with. But the modern world, driven by social media, bombards us with more friends than we can handle, some of whom we never see. We may live in cultural bubbles, but the bubbles are generally huge. How can our brains make sense of this? How can they impose the 150 limit again? By latching onto any potential differences that mark people out as members of our tribe. This explains the enduring popularity of online quizzes and the Harry Potter house-sorting: We're desperate to know where our fellow Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws are at. The dress and Yanny vs. Laurel are both low-grade versions of this urge. Few people are going to fall out over hearing an audio clip differently, but it scratches the sorting itch in a mostly harmless way. Now that it's over, we shuffle back to our bubbles — ready to fight the next culture war, hoping we soon get to fight over a sensual illusion instead.",Remember the optical illusion known simply as the dress ?

Jess Joho,"After the release of two documentaries about the ill-fated Fyre Festival former company co-founder Ja Rule took to Twitter to shed light on who the real victim of the whole situation was: himself.
Over a period of hours on Sunday, Ja Rule defended himself with the claim that people shouldn't think they know the real story after having watched the two documentaries on Hulu and Netflix. But with little in the way of specifics being shared, things quickly got ugly from there.
SEE ALSO: Netflix's Fyre Festival documentary is even more disturbing than we had imagined
The rapper has claimed no wrongdoing for his part disastrous festival that left Fyre employees and local Bahamians in massive debt. At the time of the event in 2017, he apologized on Twitter but still claimed it was, ""NOT MY FAULT...but I'm taking responsibility."" 
Despite lots of chummy footage in the documentaries of Ja Rule with Fyre co-founder Billy McFarland, as well as first-hand accounts of people who say they warned the rapper of the impending disaster, he continues to maintain his innocence and ignorance of the fraudulent activity.
""I had an amazing vision to create a festival like NO OTHER!!! I would NEVER SCAM or FRAUD anyone what sense does that make???"" he wrote during the Sunday tweetstorm. ""I too was hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!""
One scene in the Netflix documentary shows a team-wide meeting directly after the festival with Ja Rule, McFarland, and Fyre employees. Ja Rule can be heard on the phone saying, ""Right now, yes, we are the fucking laughing stock of everything. We are 'Scam Fyre.' But that might not be the case after we fucking put our plan in play and start to spin it.""
I love how ppl watch a doc and think they have all the answers... 
 Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) January 20, 2019
One employee pushed back on this, saying they could not come back from the way they lied to the public and basically committed fraud. Ja Rule was quick to respond with, ""That's not fraud. that's not fraud. That is, uh, I would call that false advertising.""
In his tweetstorm, Ja Rule went on to claim that the two documentaries were not to be trusted because both are ethically compromised.
""Hulu PAID BILLY!!! That money shouldve went to the Bahamian ppl Netflix PAID fuck Jerry the same guys that did the promo for the festival,"" he wrote.
I too was hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!
 Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) January 20, 2019
When asked why he declined to give his side of the story in either of the docs, Ja Rule added, ""Because Billy was involved with BOTH [documentaries] he was trying to get them to pay him and Hulu bit... I heard they paid him somewhere btw 100 to 250... that money was supposed to go to the locals by LAW...""
To his credit, this is somewhat correct. The social media company behind Fuck Jerry was responsible for Fyre Festival's social media, and then proceeded to serve as executive producers on the Netflix documentary. The Ringer also confirmed that the Hulu documentarians paid McFarland for an interview and behind-the-scenes footage, but deny the $250,000 figure.
In the Hulu documentary, the interviewer presses McFarland about how it could be possible that Ja Rule had no idea what was going on with the festival, since he was frequently on the island while the planning (or lack thereof) was occurring. McFarland dodges the question, saying he will not comment on their private conversations.
McFarland was found guilty on charges of fraud and sentenced to six years in prison, and there have been legal repercussions for other key organizers as well. But not for Ja Rule. The rapper cited the lack of FBI investigations and legal charges against him as proof that he was not the one who scammed people.
His Twitter screed devolved into angry responses directed at those criticizing him, and retweets of a woman appearing to imply that the Bahamian caterer who did not get paid for her work on the festival (inspiring a recent GoFundMe) should also not be be trusted and is partially to blame for the fallout.
The full picture of the Fyre Festival fiasco remains murky, even after two documentaries. For his part, Ja Rule hinted that he'd be providing his version of events too, writing, ""You aint getting the goods over Twitter... but I will tell my truth real soon... AND I HAVE RECEIPTS!!!""
We'd certainly like to see those receipts, Mr. Rule.","After the release of two documentaries about the ill-fated Fyre Festival former company co-founder Ja Rule took to Twitter to shed light on who the real victim of the whole situation was: himself.

Matthew Hughes,"Stripe, the card payment technology platform, has published research on the role software developers pay in the wider economy. It found that the inefficient use of developers could cost British businesses an astonishing £76 billion (nearly $100 billion) over the next decade. This is down to a number of factors, the main being that developers are increasingly bogged down with maintaining existing IT infrastructure, rather than working on strategic projects that could help their company innovate. We just launched Plugged It's our cool new gadget site. Stripe’s research shows developers spend more than 17 hours a week focusing on maintenance and infrastructure issues. That’s almost half the hours spent during an average working week. Nearly 70 percent of UK developers who responded to the survey said their businesses are being held back by outdated and legacy technology systems, with their scarce time increasingly monopolized by patching old systems or fixing bad code. This is especially troubling when you consider that there’s a chronic shortage of developers in the UK. 68 percent of respondents said their company faces difficulties in developer recruitment. This is something that’s been made even more acute by the UK’s impending departure from the European Union. With the prospect of a hugely damaging hard Brexit, and an uncertain visa regime for EU-27 citizens, Britain has never looked more unattractive to foreign talent. From nursing to software developers and fruit pickers, they’re staying away. This exodus of European coders is being felt at the front-lines of most tech companies, with a majority of respondents saying the total number of developers employed has shrunk by almost a quarter in five years. Most businesses now are tech businesses, regardless of the industry they’re in. Companies rely on digital processes to get things done, but as Stripe’s research shows, they’re being held back by legacy systems, which monopolizes developer time in a major way. Sadly, there’s no quick fix for this. When companies have invested in a technology or product and centered their businesses around it, migrating to something better is a long and disruptive process that can be hugely expensive. But given the huge amount of money that’s being lost by developer efficiency, can companies afford not to?","Stripe, the card payment technology platform, has published research on the role software developers pay in the wider economy.

Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing firm, is rolling out new security systems one month after a female customer was raped and murdered by a driver, the second such fatality on its Hitch service this year. Today the company said it introduced a number of new safety features which include random biometric ID testing for drivers (in addition to a selfie-based log-in each day) and the introduction of an SOS button within Didi’s driver app which connects directly to police. Didi said that SOS feature is tied into “a streamlined critical response process” — which includes “a special police response team” set up to assist with issues on the Didi service — and there are fatigue and tiredness alerts for drivers. Earlier this month, Didi added a safety center featuring guidelines and help, and updated the SOS button within the passenger app so it goes directly to the police rather than customer support agents. The company also started trialing an on-route audio recording function for its Express and Premier services. Didi’s CEO and chairwoman earlier said that it plans to prioritize user safety over growth. The company faced strong criticism after it emerged that its own systems had been at fault in both murders. For the first fatality, the driver who committed the murder bypassed Didi’s driver authentication system (using an account belonging to his father) while a sexual harassment complaint lodged against the account before the incident was not followed up on. The second murder showed further problems. The driver had been flagged to Didis safety team just one day before the murder after a female passenger complained that he had requested her to ride in the front seat and then followed her for some time after she left his vehicle. Yet, the safety center representative who handled the complaint had not followed company policy of initiating an investigation within two hours. Didi fired two executives following the second murder — the general manager for Hitch and the companys vice president of customer services — and it suspended the Hitch service for the second time this year. China instituted new regulations around ride-sharing last month which included tasking provinces and autonomous regions with setting up passenger safety committees and ensuring that incidents are investigated promptly. Rival Meituan, which raised $4 billion from an IPO in Hong Kong last week, entered the ride-hailing space earlier this year. The company has been keen to battle Didi but, perhaps sensing the difficulty of the moment, it suspended plans to expand beyond Nanjing and Shanghai and into more parts of China. Didi has been without a strong direct competitor since it reached a deal to acquire Uber’s China-based service two years ago.","Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing firm, is rolling out new security systems one month after a female customer was raped and murdered by a driver, the second such fatality on its Hitch service this year.

It was developed by stem4, a UK-based group that describes itself as a teenage mental health charity. More apps in the same vein are available for both platforms, each offering a slightly different approach to support. Calm Harm seems to be a favorite because it offers so many different options—you can tap buttons for comfort, distraction, and more—and it keeps a log of when you felt the urge and what triggered it. When you want help, you tell the app whether you’d like to try five one-minute exercises or a single 15-minute session. Some typical prompts: “Think of a comforting place and in your mind run through all the comforting things you do when you are there.” “Stick some fake tattoos where you hurt yourself. Remind yourself to do one comforting thing every time you see them.” “Think of the lyrics of a song you know really well. Try reciting it from back to front.” “Ring someone you know who will be comforting and talk it out.” Besides Calm Harm, check out: My Shiny Thing (iOS): This app specializes in distraction. It asks how much you want to hurt yourself, and then shows you pages and pages of funny and cute YouTube videos. Self-Heal (iOS and Android): The app gives you a randomly chosen activity to do, either now (“write words on yourself with a red marker”) or long term (“plan for the future: holidays, weekends away, job or study plans.”) There’s also a button that takes you to a library of motivational memes and cute pictures, and another for information on managing self-harm urges. Moods (iOS): This one isn’t just for self-harm, and it doesn’t help you manage your moods. It just asks you what they are. Select whether you’re feeling “good,” “okay,” or “bad,” and then you can tag your mood (“lethargic,” “furious,” “😡,”etc) and add a note if you like. The app compiles a report of the moods you feel most often, and it can remind you at a set time of day to log your moods. Android has plenty of mood apps as well, or try Daylio, which tracks moods and daily activities on both platforms. What’s up ( iOS and Android ): This is an app meant for all types of mental health crises. If you tap the “help right now” button, you can choose between a breathing exercise, a random “name 5 things” game (for example, name five things around you that are green), and a “catastrophe scale” where you can evaluate what’s bothering you on a range from “everything in life is perfect” to “everything has fallen apart and it feels like it’s all your fault.” There’s also a link to forums where you can talk to others.","iOS/Android: The urge to self-harm, the Calm Harm app tells us, is like a wave.

PADMA LAKSHMI,"Soon I began to feel that it was my fault. We had no language in the 1980s for date rape. I imagined that adults would say: What the hell were you doing in his apartment? Why were you dating someone so much older? I dont think I classified it as rape or even sex in my head. Id always thought that when I lost my virginity, it would be a big deal or at least a conscious decision. The loss of control was disorienting. In my mind, when I one day had intercourse, it would be to express love, to share pleasure or to have a baby. This was clearly none of those things. Later, when I had other boyfriends my senior year of high school and in my first year of college, I lied to them I said I was still a virgin. Emotionally, I still was. When I think about it now, I realize that by the time of this rape, I had already absorbed certain lessons. When I was 7 years old, my stepfathers relative touched me between my legs and put my hand on his erect penis. Shortly after I told my mother and stepfather, they sent me to India for a year to live with my grandparents. The lesson was: If you speak up, you will be cast out. These experiences have affected me and my ability to trust. It took me decades to talk about this with intimate partners and a therapist. Some say a man shouldnt pay a price for an act he committed as a teenager. But the woman pays the price for the rest of her life, and so do the people who love her.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many social media users have criticised conservative attitudes towards sex and sex education The taboo issue of sexual abuse in Iran has reignited after allegations that a string of indecent activities involving more than a dozen students were carried out by an adult at an all-boys high school in Tehran. The suspect is said to have plied the students with alcohol, showed them pornographic videos and forced them to engage in sex acts. In the wake of this case and previous similar incidents, Iranians have taken to social media using the global hashtag #MeToo, sharing stories of their own experiences - and confessions. An the difference this time is that, in an unusual step, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has personally asked for the perpetrator to be punished. Some believe his reaction stems from a previous case that caused public anger. Last year a prominent Koran recital teacher with close ties to the supreme leader was accused of sexually abusing children in his classes - something he strongly denied. In January this year, the teacher was cleared without charge and the case was closed. But the verdict caused outrage in some quarters, with one Iranian MP claiming it was the result of interventions by the supreme leader's aides. #MosqueMeToo This is not the first time Iranians have used the MeToo hashtag. It was adopted by Iranian social media users when the Harvey Weinstein story broke, and another version of the hashtag, called #MosqueMeToo, was also used to raise awareness about sexual harassment at Islamic holy sights and the annual Hajj pilgrimage. One male user has tweeted: ""I was in middle school when our headmaster took me to his home and abused me, I was afraid of telling my father, I was also abused by our neighbour in his car once. I now realise the pain I endured."" One tweeter (Sotvan_d) used the hashtag to confess to inappropriately touching a girl when he was a teenager and to apologise for what he did. Eli, on Twitter, said she was regularly abused between the ages of seven and 16 by someone close to her parents but she never had the courage to tell anyone because she believed it was her own fault. She says she now regularly talks to her child and lets her know that if such a thing happens it is never her fault and that she must let her parents know. A row over sex education The abuse cases have sparked a debate among Iranians, many of whom are blaming social conservatism and the failure of the state to raise awareness about healthy sexual behaviour. Sex education in Iran is not part of the school curriculum and is only available as an option for the first time at university - long after many young people become sexually active, despite strict laws against sex outside marriage. Almost a year ago Ayatollah Khamenei ordered officials in Iran's education system to reject UN guidelines that urge countries to include sexuality education in their school curriculum by appropriating it to their own culture. He said the guidelines were an attempt to ""Westernise"" the country, encouraged indecency and threatened Islamic values. However, in recent days many Iranians on social media have criticised the ayatollah's decision, claiming it will lead to more cases of child sexual abuse.",Iranians share #MeToo moments as sex assault anger swells.,2018-06-01T23:46:17Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Why Iranians are sharing their #MeToo moments,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44313751,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0EBD/production/_101837730_gettyimages-640147462.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fault,1
Nick Douglas,"In another stellar win for the Trump administration, today the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists pushed the Doomsday Clock forward to 2 minutes from midnight. The last time the Bulletin got this grim was in 1953, after the US and USSR tested their first hydrogen bombs. What’s the Doomsday clock? Since it began in 1947, the Doomsday Clock has become the best-known measure of humanity’s risk of global catastrophe. Until 2007, it only tracked the danger of nuclear weapons; since then it’s also incorporated the effects of climate change. Who sets the clock? The nineteen members of the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board, including national security experts, physicists, climate scientists, a public health expert and a cybersecurity expert; and the Board of Sponsors, including 15 Nobel laureates. Each year the Bulletin decides whether to move the clock or leave it as-is. (Until 1973, the Bulletin’s editor set the clock.) How has the setting changed over time? The clock was set at 7 minutes to midnight in 1947, kind of accidentally—it was originally just a cover design for the Bulletin, and artist Martyl Langsdorf said this setting “looked good to my eye.” In 1949, when the USSR tested its first atomic bomb, Rabinowitch moved the hand to 3 minutes to midnight. Since then the Bulletin has changed the setting 22 times. The high mark was 17 to midnight, set in 1991 after the US and Russia signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The low mark is 2 to midnight, reached in 1953 and again today. Why did it change this time? In today’s announcement, the Bulletin blamed rising tensions between the US and Russia, the US and North Korea, and the US and China. It’s not entirely our fault; the announcement also mentions the continuing arms race between India and Pakistan, and Iran’s quest for nuclear capability. The announcement also discusses the persistent threat of climate change and even references fake news and election tampering, as they degrade the public’s ability to push for sane nuclear and climate policy. How do we push it back? The Bulletin has some ideas! They listed several bullet points, and we’re slightly paraphrasing them here but: Trump should calm the fuck down. The US government should open up “multiple channels of communication,” which sounds a lot like “go behind the administration’s back.” China should step up and whip North Korea into shape. The US should stop being so dramatic about Iran. The US and Russia talk. None of this nuclear bullshit matters if the US, and everyone else, keep pumping carbon into the air. The “international community” should find a way to make people believe facts again, because Facebook sure won’t. Nobody make any Terminators or new Ebolas please The announcement ends with the reassurance that we could all step away from the brink of destruction, if we just somehow magically stop doing all the bad things we’re doing.

JILL COWAN,"Its somewhat based on the individual responsibility, the responsibility of the vendor and also the manufacturer, Mr. Rickert said. Everybody has to assume responsibility for those shared assets.
Sure, you have to scroll through a pages-long waiver on your phone before you can unlock a scooter, which in theory means anything that happens to you while youre riding is all your responsibility.
But, Mr. Rickert said, there can always be exceptions.
If a business leaves debris in the street and you scoot into it and fall, whose fault is it? Another crucial question is whether there is a financial backstop if home, auto or health insurance dont cover the accident costs.
If, say, you hit a pothole, could a city be liable? Mr. Rickert said that varied widely by jurisdiction.
In any case, he said, people like him are keeping a close eye on a growing market for trip insurance where you might pay a few cents to cover your liability for every mile.","Wednesday: Welcome to the share economy, where liability gets complicated; fact-checking the State of the Union; and snow in the Bay Area.",2019-02-06T13:56:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Who Pays if You Fall Off an E-Scooter?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/california-today-scooter-lawsuits-liability.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/us/06scootercatoday/merlin_142341495_398b6674-9056-4450-a97b-050871f7cd51-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fault,1
SIMON ROMERO,"Robert Talk, 61, a former amusement park worker, said he enjoyed telling jokes and sharing gossip with the evacuees. He said that his small dog, Princeton Peabody, interacts effortlessly with strangers, making it easy to start conversations with people in the camp. Were kind of all in the same boat now, arent we? Mr. Talk remarked. Its good for normal folk to realize were just like them. A lot of us are in this situation through no fault of our own. Maybe thisll open eyes, so we can start helping each other more. One new resident of the tent camp, Kelly Clark, said that she appreciated meeting Mr. Talk and his dog and talking about how the fires were still raging around them. With a smile, she pointed to her tent and said: Look at my new condo. Luxurious, isnt it? Ms. Clark, 39, said that money was now a problem after the house where she lived with her boyfriend was destroyed. She said she was unemployed, and wondered how much longer they could sleep rough outside the Walmart. She, too, was wary about going to one of the shelters, saying she had heard talk that viruses were spreading there. I just feel freer out here, like Im not locked up inside with a bunch of other people crying about what they lost, Ms. Clark said. When it starts raining, maybe then well make a move.

Kellen Beck,"Game critic John Bain, known to millions by his moniker TotalBiscuit, died Thursday after a battle against cancer that lasted for years. Bain, 33, was a popular and controversial voice in games media, always being very up front about his beliefs and opinions, sometimes to a fault. He was known primarily for his Cynical Brit game reviews on YouTube and hosting the Co-Optional Podcast as well as providing esports commentary for StarCraft II and Planetside 2. Bain's passing was announced by his wife, Genna Bain, on Twitter. Bain has been open about his illness, announcing that he had bowel cancer publicly in 2014. Although the cancer in his bowel had gone into remission, it metastasized and spread over the years to his liver and spine and ultimately caused his death. Bain gave frequent updates to fans about his condition on social media and spoke at length about his cancer at various times over the years. Throughout his career, Bain focused on coverage of PC games and indie games, often criticizing mainstream, big-budget games as being more focused on profit than on creating a worthwhile experience for players. He announced he was retiring from game criticism three weeks before he died. Bain was also involved in propagating GamerGate, a misogynist campaign of harassment that primarily targeted women in the games industry as well as other journalists and developers who were perceived as feminist or social justice warriors. Supporters of GamerGate routinely harassed and threatened the lives of people in the games industry and media, which continues to happen today. Despite his polarizing views and unwillingness to concede, Bain became one of the most popular and prolific critics in gaming, amassing over 2 million subscribers on YouTube. Bain is survived by his wife, Genna, and his step-son Orion.","Game critic John Bain, known to millions by his moniker TotalBiscuit, died Thursday after a battle against cancer that lasted for years.

Alexis Nedd,"When Bill Skarsgård was cast in Hulu’s Castle Rock, the joke was that he was going to play evil again. It was an obvious connection, considering that Castle Rock is a Stephen King adaptation like 2017’s It, where Skarsgård played Pennywise/It, a child-munching entity in the shape of a dancing clown. “At least in this one,” went the thought, “he won’t have to wear all that clown makeup,” like being able to see his face would make his inevitably evil character less frightening. At least in this one he gets to be, you know, hot. Having seen the first few episodes of Castle Rock, to this I say: yes, Bill Skarsgård is hot, and no, it doesn’t make him any less scary. It makes him more scary. And it’s not his fault. SEE ALSO: Four episodes in, 'Castle Rock' feels like a real deal Stephen King creepshow Anyone can see from the trailer for Castle Rock that Skarsgård's character, credited only as “The Kid” is more than some random guy they found in a hole at Shawshank prison. It’s not a story where a man is bravely rescued and everyone is happy because they saved a valuable human life — no one casts Bill Skarsgård for those kinds of stories. Bill Skarsgård is a two-legged spoiler: whoever he’s playing is a bad dude, the kind who maybe should be left in a cage in the prison from that Morgan Freeman movie. Bill Skarsgård, by virtue of existing, is a walking special effect. He’s a talented and hardworking actor who happens to look like the form Satan himself would take if he decided once more to prey upon the earthly kingdom of god. The dude has the eyes of a Siberian Husky, the cheekbones of a goddamn Bernini marble, and everything he does in his role in Castle Rock makes people want to run like the absolute Dickens. The dude has the eyes of a Siberian Husky, the cheekbones of a goddamn Bernini marble, and everything he does in his role in Castle Rock makes people want to run like the absolute Dickens. He’s scary pretty. Not so pretty it’s scary, but scary because he is pretty. In Castle Rock, The Kid barely speaks but the camera still hovers on his face while people talk around him, catching every lost microexpression and flicker of confusion (and menace?). He’s meant to look, at different moments, innocent and threatening, with both modes focused on the effect his body has on other characters. There is so much focus on his face, his height, and his broken-looking “I’ve been locked in a water tank for god knows how long” physicality in the show, and every bit of it is terrifying. And then there are his eyes. Guy’s got a very effective pair of peepers. Skarsgård’s famously large eyes are A Lot in Castle Rock, so much so that the pilot episode times its first jump scare to the first time the audience sees them. Just his eyes! He’s not even doing anything, he’s just Bill Skarsgård and he has eyes. Damn, this guy is good. There must be a certain comfort in being a character actor. They’re known for being “the guy who does the thing” and when a role comes up that needs the thing they’re the first person on a director’s mind. Bill Skarsgård’s thing, insofar as his career in America, is being so handsome in such a specific way that everyone is afraid of him. Castle Rock knows this, Castle Rock uses this, and in the context of the show it works very well. Is he just some guy in a cage? Is he literally Satan? Who knows, nobody can take their eyes off him. That’s the point. For the record, Bill Skarsgård is reportedly a very nice man.","When Bill Skarsgård was cast in Hulu’s Castle Rock, the joke was that he was going to play evil again.

Nicole Gallucci,"Olympic gold-medalist Gabby Douglas is joining more than 100 women — including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney — who've accused former USA Gymnastics team physician Larry Nassar of sexual abuse.
