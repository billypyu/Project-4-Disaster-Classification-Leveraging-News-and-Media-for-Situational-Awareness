Emily Price,"A bomb cyclone hit Colorado on Wednesday. While the term sounds like something out of science fiction, its quite realbomb cyclone is a scientific term describing the aftermath of bombogenesis, which is another word Im thankful is now in my vocabulary. So, to understand a bomb cyclone you first need to understand a bombogenesis.
Bombogenesis
According to the National Ocean Service, a bombogenesis describes a midlatitude cyclone that rapidly intensifies. 
Heres the full definition from the ocean service.
[Bombogenesis] occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure. This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters. The formation of this rapidly strengthening weather system is a process called bombogenesis, which creates what is known as a bomb cyclone.
Its referred to as a bomb because its an explosive storm that cpmes on quickly. Bombogenesis is a combination of the two words bomb and cyclogenesis. All storms are considered cyclones, and genesis means the beginning. So Bombogenesis is the beginning of an explosive storm.
Bomb cyclone
The lower the pressure gets, the stronger the storm, or bomb cyclone, will be. Stronger storms can mean high winds and large amounts of snow.
In the case of Denver, when an Arctic air mass from the north hit the warm, humid air mass that was over the area at the time, the pressure dropped quickly and the bomb cyclone was formed.
This essentially means that it was a strong storm that appeared quickly, rather than a slow storm that everyone was able to track on its approach.
While we dont hear about them too often, bomb cyclones typically occur at least once a year, according to the National Weather Service. With climate change, theyre something we might start to see a lot more of as cold air continues to migrate a bit farther south than it has in the past.","A “bomb cyclone” hit Colorado on Wednesday.

Alex Davies,"The next time you feel like complaining about flying, (so, the next time you fly) a report this morning from a pilot landing at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D, should put things into perspective: “Very bump on descent. Pretty much every one on the plane threw up. Pilots were on the verge of throwing up.” The members of the cleaning crew assigned to that wretched and retched-upon Bombardier regional jet were among the many victims of the Nor’easter currently slamming the East Coast. Winds as fierce as 70 mph have downed enough power lines to leave 450,000 in the dark, forced officials to suspend rail service and close bridges, and thrown planes about like a baby whacking the mobile above its crib. This kind of storm is no fun for anyone, except, maybe, the pilots. “It’s kind of fun,” says Doug Moss, a commercial pilot and aviation consultant, even if the people outside the cockpit don’t think so. “I’m sure it scares the living daylights out of a lot of them.” When they’re cruising, pilots can avoid most turbulence with a slight change to the flight plan. But the runway is where the runway is, and there’s only one path from the air to the ground. Which can mean having to land in crosswinds that can push planes to and fro. That may look scary, Moss says. But for a competent pilot, it’s just a matter of crabbing and slipping. When the winds are calm, coming in to land is a matter of lining up with the runway as you gradually slow down and lose altitude, and lifting the nose (that’s called flaring) at the last moment to reduce your vertical speed and soften the impact. A heavy crosswind, however, will push the plane off course as it makes its approach. When you crab, as you approach, you point the nose of the plane to the left or the right, angling into the wind. The plane is flying sideways, in a sense—the way a crab walks—but doing so keeps it on course. As you shed altitude and speed, you’ll turn further into the wind, using a mix of experience and trial and error to find the right angle. When you’re just 50 or 100 feet above the ground, about to lift the nose and put rubber to runway, you switch techniques, from the crab to the slip. That means using the rudder pedals to swing the plane so the fuselage is parallel to the runway, the way it would have been from the beginning in calmer winds. Now, to counteract the crosswind, you use the ailerons (those hinged bits near the tip of the wing) to bank the aircraft, tipping the wings into the wind. Because the plane isn’t quite level, you may put one set of wheels on the ground before the other. That’s why different planes are certified for landing at different crosswind speeds—aircraft differ in what structural forces they can handle when landing in suboptimal optimal conditions. “It’s a real finesse maneuver,” Moss says. The art of flying is doing all of that smoothly enough to keep your passengers safe and their barf bags untouched. And while modern autopilot systems can do a lot of this, they only work up to a certain wind speed. The most galling of gales call for a human touch. That’s why pilots start training to make these moves as soon as they start training to fly. “By the time you’re an airline pilot, you’re so used to them, that it’s second nature to you,” says Brian Strzempkowski, an instructor at Ohio State University’s Center for Aviation Studies. Much of that training happens in simulators, where pilots refresh their skills every six months or so. Like the simulator, real life landings come with second changes. If the pilots come in at the wrong angle, or just don’t feel comfortable going for the landing, they can always pull back on the throttle, climb back up, circle around, and try again. “One thing I always try to stress to my students is always assume that every landing is going to end in a go-around,” Strzempkowski says. “If you’re always planning to do it, you’re not surprised when you have to make that call.” Even with experience in the cockpit, crosswind landings can easily go … sideways. Witness this Lufthansa Airbus A320 clipping a wing on the ground before climbing back into the sky for another go. That’s why airlines, the most nervous of nellies when it comes to questions of safety, undertake an even more dramatic maneuver when the winds get bad enough: They keep the planes on the ground. On Friday, airlines cancelled about 3,000 flights because of the Nor’easter—giving lots of passengers, and more than a few fun-loving pilots, something new to complain about.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind. Earther can’t really give you any insights into our big button boy’s mindset on the nuclear front, but we’ve got you covered when it comes to this bomb cyclone thing that’s about to “ blast the East Coast.” Snow is falling in northern Florida thanks to moist air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with the frigid cold hanging over the eastern U.S. The impending storm will get really organized and march up toward the Mid-Atlantic this evening, where there are rare blizzard watches already in effect. By late tonight or early tomorrow, snow, storm surge, and powerful winds will smack the Northeast. Along the way, this extratropical cyclone will undergo “explosive bombogenesis.” Or, in less nerdy terms, it will bomb out. And that has got people on edge. You’ve probably seen the Washington Post tweet that sparked the whole bomb cyclone freakout (it is a Very Good Tweet): In some ways, the freakout is warranted. This is shaping up to be a massive, dangerous storm that could fell records and cause widespread power outages. Snow in Florida is really, deeply weird and wrong. The cold air rushing in after the storm passes could be deadly. But let’s step back for a sec and talk about what’s actually going on. In simple terms, bombogenesis describes what happens when a storm’s central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The lower the pressure, the more intense the storm. Those types of rapid drops can happen in hurricanes, but only extratropical cyclones—storms that have cold air at their core—technically qualify as bomb cyclones. That means you generally only get weather bombs in winter, and often in coastal areas where cold land meets relatively warm ocean water. The bigger the difference between warm and cold air masses, the bigger the potential for bombogenesis. “The contrast between the warm and cold air gives you an indication of the energy available to intensify an extratropical cyclone,” Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, told Earther. “In this case, large contrasts in temperature between Arctic air currently over the Northeast and warm Atlantic waters suggest the potential for an intense cyclone.” This week’s bomb storm could see pressure drop an unbelievable 45 millibars in 24 hours, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration model ensemble. It’s forecast to bottom out around 950 millibars, a central pressure typically associated with Category 3 hurricanes (though this storm will not bring Category 3 winds). While this storm could be one for the record books, storms bombing out isn’t that rare. Jonathan Martin, a meteorology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told BuzzFeed that you can expect about 10 of these types of storms across the northern hemisphere in any given winter. In the Northeast, many storms that bomb out take the form of nor’easters, winter storms that have their strongest winds out of the northeast. In Europe, they’re usually wind storms. Elsewhere like the Bering Sea, they’re just really nasty storms. Scientists have been throwing around some combination of the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather”,and “climatological” since the 1940s. They somewhat entered the mainstream lexicon in 1980. That year, MIT professors Fred Sanders and John Gyakumpublished the amazingly-titled study “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb.’” It’s one of the first papers to deconstruct the process of bombogenesis. Sanders attributes the focus on rapidly dropping pressure in storms to Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who also gave us our working theory of how precipitation forms in the 1930s. So, this whole cyclone bomb thing has been a known quantity for a while. That doesn’t mean this storm won’t be bad, or that you shouldn’t be prepared for power outages, especially considering the bone-rattling cold that will follow. But make sure to allocate your freakout between meteorological and existential threats accordingly.",Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind.

Darrell Etherington,"The Dyson Cyclone V10 cord-free vacuum that Dyson unveiled today at an event in New York is a new milestone for the company’s strong line of battery-powered vacuums. In fact, it spells the end for plug-in models, even for holdouts who’ve been reluctant to ditch their big bulky continuous power versions. Dyson’s Cyclone V10 has Dyson’s most advanced digital motor yet. In a briefing, Dyson showed me the motor and how it compares to its previous generation version. I’m no electric motor engineer, but I can say that it’s significantly smaller and lighter (made possible using some ceramic in place of metal in its construction) and it’s a something that will blow away the existing models in terms of performance. Performance is obviously what matters most to end users, and while the enabling technology underneath is interesting to gadget and tech-lovers like me and our beloved audience here, the vacuum’s use in day-to-day cleaning is what makes it a real step change in terms of Dyson’s vacuum advancements. I’ve used a lot of cordless Dyson machines, but the Cyclone V10 is the first that I’ve come across that has me truly eager and able to ditch my canister vacuum for whole home cleaning purposes. The suction, which is improved around 20 percent compared to the V8 it replaces, is way better, and the bigger bin that’s fit in line with the vacuum’s shaft instead of perpendicular not only holds 40 percent more dirt and dust, but also enables better air flow because air doesn’t have to travel anywhere but in a straight line right down the machine. The thing’s light, too – it looks like it’s going to be heavier and bulkier than previous versions, but it really doesn’t seem it, and it’s easy to operate for lifting up to ceiling corners and other hard to reach areas. Battery life is really the killer feature on this vacuum, however – it can operate for up to 60 minutes on a single charge (which takes only 3.5 hours plugged in to achieve). That’s a full hour of cleaning, which h is more than most people need to vacuum their entire place thoroughly. There’s also a super suction mode that’ll delete your charge in under 10 minutes, but that really does the job when you have ground in dirt, for instance. And new to this model, there’s an intermediary stage for when you want to balance power and time. Dyson’s also done something terrific with the user interface on this machine, putting more info on the battery via simple LEDs. You’ll now see when there’s a blockage, for instance, and also be alerted when the vacuum detects that its single filter needs washing to restore full suction power. It seems like a small detail, but based on my past experience with Dyson’s vacuums, having a clear sign of when you should be cleaning those filters is actually a huge help. In the box with the Cyclone V10 are a variety of cleaning head options, including two cleaner heads, with one designed for hard floors and the other geared towards carpets. Both feature built-in motors to boost their cleaning power, and the carpet brush also features adjustable ‘gate’-type things that can be raised and lowered to allow larger debris to get sucked up rather than be pushed around. Dyson’s focused on its portable vacuums with a clarity of purpose that it takes from having basically wound down its attention to plug-in models (also useful since motor and battery tech could apply to its car plans, too, so there’s a unification of purpose), and the advantages of that are clear in the Cyclone V10. It’s proven a terrific vacuum for my two-floor apartment, which has about 1300 square feet, and I’m happy to report the plug-in model I was using hasn’t left the closet since I got it. The Cyclone V10 is on sale staring at $499 U.S. ($599 in Canada) via Dyson’s website beginning today and will be available in retail starting in April.","The Dyson Cyclone V10 cord-free vacuum that Dyson unveiled today at an event in New York is a new milestone for the company’s strong line of battery-powered vacuums.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A pair of fierce tropical cyclonesCyclone Trevor and Cyclone Veronicaare poised to strike Australia on two coasts within a day of each other, prompting mass evacuations as well as official warnings of severe and dangerous weather.
A state of emergency was declared in Australias Northern Territory this week ahead of Trevors second landfall early Saturday. As the cyclone moved through the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory saw its largest evacuation since 1974 during Cyclone Tracy, according to ABC News Australia.
Thousands of people were reportedly evacuated from areas that lay in Trevors path. ABC News reported that some residents of the region, including those on the island Groote Eylandt and the coastal town of Borroloola, had to be airlifted to safety.
Trevor made landfall on the Northern Territory on Saturday at around 11 a.m. local time as a Category 4 cyclone, delivering dangerous winds that were felt more than 200 kilometers from the storms center. ABC News reporter Kristy OBrien was situated in Borroloola when the storm struck the Northern Territory and described the system to the BBC as delivering a guttural howling roar.
The cyclone first made landfall on the Cape York Peninsula earlier this week, which according to the Washington Post resulted in flooding and other destruction in the area. The force of the cyclones first landfall was reportedly equivalent to that of a Category 3 hurricane.
The Bureau of Meteorology Northern Territory said Saturday that Cyclone Trevor had been downgraded to a tropical low system, but added that it would be delivering dangerous conditions and severe weather as it moved further inland.
Tropical Cyclone Veronica, meanwhile, was nearing Western Australias Pilbara coast as of Sunday morning local time, bringing with it powerful and destructive winds and prompting safety warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology.
While the destructive wind and heavy rain are the obvious impacts, this system also has the potential to bring significant storm surge and flooding to the region, the Bureau of Meteorology Western Australia tweeted Saturday evening eastern time. Its worth thinking about what you would do if those threats occur.
The government agency said its been more than four years since twin cyclones have pummeled Australia at once, with the last event occurring in 2015 with Cyclones Marcia and Lam.
As the Washington Post noted, the pair of cyclones arrives as Australia recently experienced its hottest summer on record with a mean national temperature average of 30.8 degrees Celcius in January. As the paper noted, surrounding sea waters saw above normal surface temperatures, a recipe for brewing tropical storms.

Andrew Freedman,"We've been warning for two days now that a major storm would develop along the East Coast and intensify so rapidly that it could earn a place in the record books. We were the first to call it a ""weather bomb"" or ""bomb cyclone,"" and now that that term has taken off in the broader media, it's important to understand just what it means. ""Bomb cyclone"" may seem like an obscure expression invented by meteorologists for attention, or to describe some sinister atmosphere terrorism plot, but it's actually rooted in the science of meteorology. SEE ALSO: 'Bomb cyclone' to pummel East Coast, followed by a polar vortex-related cold snap It refers to a meteorological phenomenon known as bombogenesis, in which a storm's minimum central pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such storms are common in the fall and winter along the East Coast, and most major snowstorms that hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast meet this definition. What's unusual about this particular storm is that it's likely to greatly exceed the typical intensification rate to qualify as a weather bomb, perhaps even doubling that rate. This would put it in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storms in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin. Meteorologist Ryan Maue of Weather.us said on Twitter that this storm is likely to be in the top 15 percent of all ""bomb cyclones,"" based on the intensification rate. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections have consistently been showing that this storm could reach a peak intensity, as measured by its minimum air pressure, close to that of Hurricane Sandy when that monstrous storm slammed into the New Jersey coast in Oct. 2012.

It then spirals inward toward the center, rises and exits through the top. If more air is leaving the storm than is sucked inward, the pressure falls even more and the system will continue to grow."" The rapid intensification of this storm, which the National Weather Service has repeatedly pointed to in its public forecast discussions, is tied to its impacts over land, because such a sharp drop in air pressure will cause extremely strong winds. The Weather Service is predicting winds as high as 50 miles per hour along much of the East Coast, including New York City, with gusts to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across eastern New England.

The greatest risk for such outages is across southern New England, including the greater Boston area and Cape Cod and the Islands. The storm currently gathering strength over the Gulf Stream waters off the Southeast coast may end up being comparable in its intensification rate to a storm that struck New England in March of 2014, which brought 80 mile-per-hour winds to Cape Cod despite tracking farther off the coast than the present-day storm. Though the term may be new to you, ""bomb cyclone"" isn't a new weapon developed by some mad scientist, or a desperate attempt by weather nerds to get clicks. Instead, it's a type of storm that is relatively rare, but which you've probably experienced before. These storms are awesome to behold, transforming from small splotches of cloud cover to fully formed, comma-shaped behemoths in as little as 24 hours. This transformation will occur between today and tomorrow, leading to some spectacular weather satellite imagery. With weather communication, as well as science communication in general, it can often be difficult to engage a wide audience and make them aware of imminent risks. Pulling terminology from the scientific lexicon is a valid way to do that, provided that the terms match the phenomena being predicted. A similar dynamic played out with the polar vortex winter four years ago, when an actual weather term was popularized for the first time, and became part of popular culture seemingly overnight. Right now, it's bomb cyclone's turn. Perhaps next to come will be tropopause fold, or gravity wave (both real things).","We've been warning for two days now that a major storm would develop along the East Coast and intensify so rapidly that it could earn a place in the record books.

Andrew Liszewski,"The Dyson upright ball vacuum, an iconic piece of engineering and design that made vacs a gadget worthy of your lust, is being eliminated. In its place is Dyson’s latest cordless vac, the Cyclone V10. The company claims the V10's upgraded electric motor can suck better and last longer on a single charge. But can a rechargeable vacuum really replace a corded one? It has for me. The new Dyson Cyclone V10 may have a few issues, but this little cordless vacuum is so good it might finally justify Dyson’s premium pricing. Dyson Cyclone V10 WHAT IS IT? A rechargeable handheld vacuum cleaner designed to replace cordless models. PRICE $500-$700 depending on included accessories. LIKE If you don't live in a mansion, it can definitely replace a corded vacuum. DISLIKE At maximum power, battery life is under 10 minutes. As someone who obsesses over clean floors, five or six years ago I would have balked at the idea of giving up my corded Dyson vacuum that could clean for hours on end. But eventually, even with a limited run time, the rechargeable Dyson DC59 slowly started to replace my corded upright vac. And ever since the Dyson V8 arrived two years ago, the predecessor to the new Cyclone V10, my corded Dyson upright has remained untouched in a closet. If you live in an oversized McMansion with countless rooms to maintain, or if you prefer to let messes pile up until you have to spend an entire day cleaning your home, a rechargeable vacuum might not be for you. But if you hate cords and dragging around heavy appliances, and are OK with a continuous cleaning routine where you deal with spills or messes as they happen, the improvements Dyson has made to the new Cyclone V10 means you might be able to ditch your uprights. With the Cyclone V10, Dyson gives its cordless vacuums their first major facelift in years. According to Dyson, the redesigned V10 electric motor in this vacuum spins at up to 125,000 RPM and is so fast that the vacuum’s impeller, the bit of the vacuum’s compressor that rotates, now has to be made with a stronger ceramic shaft instead of steel which would break under the intense G-forces. So what does all that super fancy engineering actually mean? The Cyclone V10 should suck hard. And it does! In my tests, it gobbled up dust, dirt, and even chunks of ice-melting salt that had been traipsed into our home. For larger debris, Dyson redesigned the Cyclone V10's direct-drive cleaner head attachment with adjustable openings on the front allowing it to more easily suck in larger items like bits of cereal, instead of just pushing them around your floors. Because Dyson wants users to completely replace their larger corded vacuums with the Cyclone V10, it’s increased the capacity of the handheld vac’s dust bin by 40 percent compared to previous models. It’s not as large as the bins included on the company’s now-defunct full-sized vacuums, but it’s a lot easier to empty, so you’ll be OK with cleaning it out more frequently. Dyson has also changed the orientation of the Cyclone V10's dust bin, facilitating an improved ‘point-and-shoot’ method for emptying it. It’s definitely a lot easier to dump its contents into a trash can without spilling dust everywhere, but the release mechanism now includes a locking latch that I’ve already forgotten to re-lock after emptying it, causing the bin to inadvertently pop open when I didn’t want it to. 1 / 6 The Cyclone V10 has many other improvements over its predecessors, including a single filter you need to occasionally (forget to) clean, an improved power meter showing a more accurate estimate of remaining battery life, a clog indicator letting you know when you’ve sucked up something too large for the vac to handle, and three adjustable power settings to help maximize battery life. Adjustable power settings is probably the feature that will make or break the Cyclone V10 for some people. The vacuum undoubtedly features some impressive and expensive tech, but the one area where Dyson’s R&amp;D teams have limited control over innovation is battery tech. Dyson claims you can clean for a full hour on a single charge—which is 20 minutes more than it promised with its predecessor, the Cyclone V8. But in reality, that would be under the most ideal conditions using an un-powered accessory to clean up minimal dirt on the vac’s lowest power setting. In my tests, battery life with the Cyclone V10 was definitely shorter, depending on how and where I used it. Cleaning carpets clogged with dirt would demand using the vacuum with its direct-drive cleaning head attachment at its Max setting. That net me just over eight minutes of cleaning time before the vac’s battery died. Eek. Yet if your carpets aren’t so filthy, switching to the Cyclone V10's lowest power setting (which still sucked up enough dirt to fill the dust bin in about 15 minutes) scored me a more respectable 37 minutes on a full charge. Battery life gets a little better when cleaning hardwood floors where there’s less resistance on the Cyclone V10's soft roller cleaner attachment’s spinning brushes. At MAX power I was able to clean for just over nine minutes before the battery called it quits, but switching to the lowest power setting kept it sucking for a solid 52 minutes. Still not quite a full hour, but definitely an improvement over its predecessors. Is it finally time to switch to a cordless vacuum? Yes, but only if you’re willing to work around the Cyclone V10's limitations. Dedicating an entire Saturday once a month to vacuum your entire home will no longer be an option, but since the Cyclone V10 is lighter and more convenient to use than a clunky upright vacuum, you’ll find yourself reaching for it more often, and staying on top of messes before they get out of hand. I ditched a corded vacuum for Dyson’s cordless models years ago, and the Cyclone V10 makes that transition even easier. It’s certainly best suited to apartments, condos, and smaller homes featuring hardwood floors, but living in a giant house isn’t a deal breaker. If you’re able to deal with Dyson’s sticker shock (the Cyclone V10 ranges in price from $500 to $700, depending on included accessories) the added conveniences of cutting the cord is definitely worth the inconveniences. README If you’re willing to adjust your cleaning routines, and don’t live in a sprawling mansion, Dyson’s new Cyclone V10 can definitely replace your bulky, corded vacuum. Battery-life is definitely the Cyclone V10's biggest drawback, with maximum cleaning settings reducing its runtime to just over eight minutes on carpeting. Ouch. It does fare slightly better on hardwood floors, however, and at lower power settings. Expensive! The base model starts at $500. The vacuum won’t run while it’s being charged, so if it’s dead, you’ll have to wait about three-and-a-half hours to start cleaning again. The re-oriented dust bin improves the Cyclone V10's ergonomics, and can hold 40 percent more dirt than its predecessor, the V8. The handheld’s re-design also makes maintaining the vacuum a lot simpler, with a dust bin that’s easier to empty, and just a single filter that occasionally needs a wash. Amazing suction power at the vacuum’s max setting, so much so that it’s hard to actually maneuver the vacuum at max power on carpeted floors.","The Dyson upright ball vacuum, an iconic piece of engineering and design that made vacs a gadget worthy of your lust, is being eliminated.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The island chain of Socotra, famed for unique plants and animals found nowhere else on the planet, is coping with the aftermath of a powerful cyclone. The archipelago was struck by Cyclone Mekunu on Wednesday night, leaving at least 17 people missing and forcing its native population to flee floodwaters. Socotra is part of Yemen, which is embroiled in a lengthy civil war - something from which the four islands have largely been spared. But after two boats capsized during the cyclone, and at least three cars were washed away by powerful floods, the government has declared Socotra a disaster zone. Media caption Residents sought shelter from the knee-deep torrential floodwaters Coastal areas ""were submerged by floods causing heavy damage to homes,"" a spokesman told AFP. Hundreds have been evacuated from villages, but rescue workers are reportedly unable to reach many people in isolated parts of the main island. Officials have appealed to international aid agencies for help. Home of the blood dragon Socotra is famed for its natural beauty. Its startling biodiversity has earned it the nickname ""Galapagos of the Indian Ocean"" - a nod to Ecuador's famous Pacific island chain whose ecosystem is so unique it inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Image copyright Getty Images The link to the famed Galapagos is not purely marketing either. Since it was first surveyed by United Nations' biologists in 1997, Socotra has been considered one of the most biologically diverse and distinct places on Earth. It's estimated that 37% of its plants and 90% of its reptiles (along with almost all of its snails) are found nowhere else on earth, and the entire island chain is a registered Unesco World Heritage site. One of the most iconic of its native species is the blood dragon tree - a striking, umbrella-shaped tree with a thick trunk. Image copyright Getty Images It gets its name from the deep red sap within, which is gathered as a resin - and has a wide range of uses including as a dye, as incense, and in traditional medicine. Inaccessible island beauty The island's status as an ecological gem, however, has caused some problems for its residents. As its population battles the torrential floods left behind by Cyclone Mekunu, reaching those in need is a major problem - partly because Socotra has few roads stretching into its biodiversity areas. A 2007 travel article in the New York Times said a journey in a four-wheel-drive vehicle with an expert local driver as guide was ""a struggle to the death"", covering five miles in an hour and a half. It was, the author writes, worth it. But plans to build and expand access roads on Socotra's main island have been controversial for years. Unesco considers the building of roads in the protected areas ""a serious threat"" to the island's value, and no improvements have been made since 2010. Image copyright Getty Images Unesco had also expressed concern about how exactly humanitarian funds were being spent, amid reports they could be used to build ""residential cities, ports, hotels, and roads"". But some construction work is sorely needed - because this week's cyclone is the third in recent years. Chapala and Megh Two cyclones - the name given to hurricanes when they form in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans - battered Socotra in November 2015. Cyclone Chapala brought powerful winds similar to a category four hurricane, damaging homes, vehicles, and injuring dozens. Image copyright EPA Image caption Cyclone Chapala, seen from the International Space Station in 2015 Less than a week later, Cyclone Megh passed directly over the main island, triggering flash floods and killing another two people. Thousands were displaced from their homes. The damage was not limited to buildings and infrastructure. Soil erosion and habitat damage were also probable, and Unesco approved $75,000 (£56,000) in assistance last year to help mitigate the impact on threatened plants. Yemen's wider crisis Socotra remains under the control of the internationally-backed government, whose President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi is in exile in Saudi Arabia. His government called for all ""urgent aid"" possible for the people of Socotra. But the mainland continues to be plagued by a complex civil war involving several regional titans. The result is that mainland Yemen is suffering the worst humanitarian disaster on Earth, according to the United Nations. Since March 2015, 9,559 people have been killed and 55,616 injured in the conflict. The vast majority are men, but 791 children are reported among the dead - and the UN believes the actual numbers of the dead, including those not formally recorded, ""are likely to be much higher"". Cyclone Mekunu could hit the mainland this weekend near the border with neighbouring Oman, and could gain strength before making landfall.

Authorities warn that Cyclone Owen could still reform offshore on Monday. Severe weather and flood warnings are in place. Owen hit land as a category 3 cyclone at around 03:00 on Saturday (17:00 Friday GMT), 70km (43 miles) from Kowanyama.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah. Now, a new satellite image reveals the extent of unloaded rainfall in the nearby desert of Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert and (normally) one of the driest places on Earth. The image, taken by NASA’s Operational Land Imager three days after the storm brought heavy rains to the region—Salalah saw 11 inches of precipitation in just 24 hours, more than double its yearly average—captures the arid desert’s typical large swaths of sand with ripples sculpted by wind. But there’s one novel feature: water lakes in the flat lowlands between the sand dune tops. This water lake phenomenon has not been seen in the desert in almost two decades, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. The desert, also known as the Empty Quarter, receives about 1.2 inches of rain per year on average. Aside from being quite the sight, these bountiful rainwater deposits could be beneficial for local business. “The land will need 30 days to sprout their summer plants,” Ali Al- Hatish, a regular visitor desert visitor, told Al Arabiya.net. After that, camel owners expect this vegetation to feed their camels for the next two years. The paper also reports that the rare sight of lakes interspersed with dunes could send to tourists flocking to the area. Tropical Cyclone Mekunu spun up in the Arabian Sea in late May. Extremely warm waters (31-32 degrees Celsius or 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit) fed the storm until its winds equalled that of a Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Arabian Peninsula, according to The Weather Channel. This made Mekunu’s landfall historic; the Arabian Peninsula sees a tropical cyclone every year or every couple of years, but a tropical cyclone making landfall with hurricane-like wind speeds is a rarity in Oman and Yemen. As myriad media outlets reported, Oman and Yemen bore the brunt of the tropical cyclone with destructive winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding wreaking havoc in cities. These new satellite images are a reminder that powerful storms have the potential to dramatically reshaping natural landscapes, too.","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere. The storm, which struck the southeastern coast of Africa with the strength of a Category 2 hurricanelast week, almost obliterated the city of Beira in Mozambique, home to some 500,000 people.
While the countrys death toll currently stands at 84, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi is estimating that number could rise to more than 1,000, according to the Associated Press. And thats just for one country; the death tolls for other affected countries like Zimbabwe and Malawi may continue to rise as governments begin evaluating their situations. In Zimbabwe, at least 89 people are dead. In Malawi, at least 56, per Africa News.
It is a real disaster of great proportions, President Nyusi said to state Radio Mozambique, according to the AP.
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that.
CNN reports people in Mozambique are still awaiting rescue on their rooftops in places like Buzi where floodwaters remain high. At least 67 schools and 24 health units have been affected across the country according to ReliefWeb, and many areas are without power. To make matters worse, the rains are expected to continue through Thursday even though the cyclone has dissipated.
The deadliest storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere is Cyclone Leon-Eline in 2000, which killed some 800 people in this same region, as noted by Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters in a blog post. Even if the death toll doesnt increase, Cyclone Idai is already among the deadliest tropical storms this part of the world: So far, its No. 5. 
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that, Masters told Earther. Just a couple days before landfall, I was saying this is going to be a bad one because they dont have a lot of hurricane experience there preparing for big storms like this.
The people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi arent prepared because, well, storms of this strength arent all that common in this area. The last time these countries experienced a storm this intense, Masters said, was Leon-Eline in 2000. Though that storm was much strongera Category 4it didnt hit Mozambique the way Cyclone Idai did.
Idai had all the makings of a meteorological horror story. It was moving slowly, contributing to extreme rainfall conditions, including about 2 feet of rainwater in Beira. The storm also hit during high tide, which made the surge much worse than it wouldve been during low tide. On top of that, the cyclone came ashore just north of Beira where the surge could move into the Pungwe River delta, which exaggerated the flooding conditions. 
Idai was a near-textbook example of a cyclone inflicting maximum flood damage on this part of Mozambique, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, to Earther in an email.
Idai was borne from the same system that was already causing downpours in the area in the week prior, explained Masters. A tropical disturbance over land dumped one to two feet of rain over Mozambique some two weeks back, with one station recording 11 inches in just 12 hours March 7, he said. Once that disturbance moved over the water, Cyclone Idai formed.
We cant be sure how much of a role climate change played in Idai, but science is telling us that these type of extreme weather events will become more common in a warmer world with higher ocean temperatures. Even though they had little to do with causing this mess, African governments need to be better equipped if they want to safeguard their communities. Experiencing both flooding and droughts, Mozambique currently ranks third in Africa in terms of its vulnerability to these types of events.
Cyclone Idai underlines that no matter how effective early warnings are, there is still a huge demand for greater investment in resilient infrastructure in many parts of the world if we are to break the cycle of disaster-response-recovery, said United Nations Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction Mami Mizutori, in a statement.","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","More than a week has passed since Cyclone Idai tore through the coast of southeastern Africa, dealing a devastating blow to the region. The cyclone has killed more than 750 among the three countries impacted, reports the Associated Press. And its left the major city of Beira in ruins.
All this is only the beginning, however, as the affected countries of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi brace for a public health crisis that has the potential to be widespread and long-lasting, with impacts ranging from infectious disease outbreaks to psychological trauma. The 900,000 children affected by the cyclone are particularly vulnerable.
So are the 110,000 currently taking refuge in camps in Mozambique, which sound like magnets for disease and further trauma to experts. 
The close proximity of everyone to everyone else is a real problem in the spread of diseases, Irwin Redlener, the director of Columbia Universitys National Center for Disaster Preparedness whos also a clinical professor at the universitys Mailman School of Public Health, told Earther. Thats one issue, but there are many more concerns there. People are under a great deal of stress.
From a disease perspective, cholera and malaria are of primary concern because the floodwaters, which are finally dropping in Beira but continue to isolate rural areas, contribute to the growth of these diseases, which are endemic in the region. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has reported, but not confirmed, malaria infections, which are spread through infected mosquitoes that reproduce in stagnant waters (like floodwaters). The group has also reported, but not confirmed, cases of cholera, a waterborne bacterialillness that kills by dehydrating those who are ill, in Beira. The Mozambican government is reporting cases of acute watery diarrhea, a symptom of cholera, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
Both infectious diseases can be deadly if left untreatedand they can spread quickly when hitting a dense population. Like these camps. 
In disasters like this onewhere there is a lack of clean water and sanitation, and potential overcrowdingoutbreaks of waterborne diseases are common, said Jana Sweeny, a spokesperson for IFRC who is on the ground in Beira, in an email to Earther. The Red Cross is focusing on bringing in vital sanitation and clean water resources to help prevent any disease outbreak.
The organization has brought in its first sanitation Emergency Response Unit, a team supplied with special equipment that offers water purification services to up to 20,000 people every day,to Beira. Another unit is on its way to the region, with the ability to produce clean water for 15,000 people a day, Sweeny said. A field hospital arrived Monday in Beira and will be operational Tuesday. while a second field hospital is coming later in the week. Both can help doctors conduct emergency surgeries and provide medical services to at least 30,000 people.
Medical services and clean drinking water are among the most immediate concerns. But the people impacted by this disaster will need mental health services, too. Psychological impactsfrom general anxiety to post traumatic stress disorderoften result from disasters like this.For instance Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico more than a year ago, left high rates of PTSD in its wake. 
Children are most at risk for psychological trauma, explained Redlener.
Children can be protected from the stress of a major event like whats happening in Mozambique, but they need resilient, caring parents who are able to keep things under control to the extent possible and continue to reassure their children that things are going to be OK, he said.
Sadly, thats not an option for the kids who lost their parents, which Redlener described as the most significant and dangerous kind of stress to any child on the planet.The international faith-based organization ACT Alliance estimates that in the Mozambican province of Zambezia alone, some 683 orphans and vulnerable children have been affected by the disaster.
More children have been separated from their families, so the Red Cross has set up an online portal to help connect distressed parents to their kids, as well as conducting radio announcements. More than 36,000 homes were completely destroyed in Mozambique during the catastrophic eventand those floodwaters often swept people away. In a press release, OCHA describes traumatized children who reportedly witnessed the loss of their parents or siblings.
For children affected by Cyclone Idai, the road to recovery will be long, said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore, in a press release. They will need to regain access to health, education, water and sanitation. And they will need to heal from the deep trauma they have just experienced.
Disasters arent easy on anyone, and studies show that the psychological impacts can last years after. That may be especially true for Cyclone Idai, which already ranks among the three deadliest tropical cyclones ever to hit the Southern Hemisphere. A whole lot of trauma will come attached to that titleand it wont go away on its own. 
Neither will climate change, which could make these awful events all the more common for the people least responsible for causing it.","More than a week has passed since Cyclone Idai tore through the coast of southeastern Africa, dealing a devastating blow to the region.

With a population of more than 500,000, Beiras recovery is bound to be long: Aid workers couldnt reach the city until Sunday because flooding cut off roads, and IFRC team lead LeSueur said almost everything is destroyed. 
Mozambique had received some5.5 to 7.4 inchesof rain in 24 hours in the week before the storm even hit. Seven people died then, and more than 30,000 were already experiencing displacement, according to ReliefWeb. The cyclones heavy rainfallit was expected to drop up to 18 inches onto Mozambiquehas only made things worse. 
This cyclone was, indeed, unusual, as its the seventh cyclone in the Indian Ocean this season. Thats more than double the average for this time of year. Unfortunately, although the cyclone has fizzled out Mozambiques Institute of Meteorology expects conditions of extreme rain, thunder, and wind to persist throughout the country until Thursday.
Meanwhile, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs activated an international charter Monday, which should help agencies map out the damage and necessary response through satellite imagery. 
The United Nations is requesting $40.8 million in U.S. dollars for emergency relief. The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations has already allocated 150,000 Euros to Mozambique to provide shelter and health needs and another 100,000 Euros to help Malawi with relief efforts. 
So far, agencies estimate that the cyclone has impacted about 850,000 people in Malawi and Mozambiquehalf of whom are children. The flood waters have also taken down 145 houses and four major bridges in Zimbabwe, according to ReliefWeb. Schools and clinics have likely suffered extensive damage throughout the region, as have crops and local water supplies, per the World Meteorological Organization. Currently, healthcare and clean water are high priorities for government relief efforts, according to Al Jazeera.
Its hard to say whether climate change had an influence on this cyclone, which was big but not unprecedented for the region. Butthe strongest cyclones have grown more common in the Southern Indian Ocean since 1994, according to a 2018 study, and their frequency is likely to continue increasing as our oceans warm. Overall, climate change is forecasted put more pressure on southern Africa in the future, through more heavier rainfall events and more drought. As Cyclone Idai demonstrates, governments will need to start preparing.","On March 15, a rare, giant cyclone made landfall in Mozambique before making its way west to Malawi and Zimbabwe.

Cyclone Owen is moving slowly over waters off the Northern Territory with winds of up to 200km/h (124 mph), meteorologists said. It is expected to intensify into a category four system before making landfall sometime early on Saturday local time (late on Friday GMT). Residents have been urged to stay safe. Forecasters predict the cyclone will travel from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Queensland's east coast, bringing destructive winds inland for hundreds of kilometres. ""Owen will wreak havoc across our state and come down the east coast,"" Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told the Seven network on Friday. Parts of the state were likely to receive up to 400mm of rain in coming days, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said. Authorities warned that flash-flooding and storm surges were also expected, urging residents to secure items and stay indoors. The cyclone is forecast to be downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves inland, but could redevelop into a cyclone on Monday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","That bomb cyclone you’ve surely read about has officially gone off. And the images rolling in are something else. Pressure dropped 54 millibars in 24 hours in the winter storm currently climbing up the eastern seaboard. That’s more than double what’s needed to classify it as a bomb, making it a super bomb (kidding, please don’t repeat that, especially not to a meteorologist). In all seriousness, the impacts are piling up. Hurricane force winds have reached as far north as Cape Cod. Iguanas are turning into iguanicles in South Florida. The lights are starting to flicker out in Massachusetts. Snow is accumulating everywhere from Florida to Maine. This storm has been well forecast, and is playing out as expected. Cold air is waiting in the wings to make this weekend miserable ( and potentially deadly ) for the eastern U.S. But let’s step back and admire this storm because man is it a beauty from space. To wit: The recently operationalized GOES-16 satellite is returning a wealth of stunning views of a storm that could be writing its way into the record books. That’s why so many meteorologists doing a little happy dance even as they try to forecast a dangerous event. Here’s a bigger picture look: Here’s a slightly zoomed in look at the swirl off the Mid-Atlantic: And this is as tightly zoomed as it gets. You can see tiny swirls—the mesovortices mentioned in the tweet—which indicate areas of intense activity churning within the storm: Seriously, this storm is a thing of meteorological beauty and likely inspiring the next generation of meteorologists sitting at home enjoying a snow day. The source of the storm’s power is the huge temperature difference between the warm ocean currents and cold air covering most of the eastern U.S. The process is known as baroclinic instability. Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, likened it to what would happen if you had a fish tank divided in half with warm water on the bottom and cool water on the top. If you pull out the divider, the dense cold water would immediately drop and the warm water would rise. “From a physics perspective, potential energy in the mass of the water was converted to kinetic energy (the movement of the water) to create a circulation,” she told Earther in an email. “In the atmosphere, this type of instability is called baroclinic instability.” Baroclinic instability is a common factor in all nor’easters, strong winter storms that impact the East Coast, but this storm will likely go down as one of the most rapidly intensifying on record for the region. The new GOES-16 satellite is not only helping produce drool-inducing images, but returning data on a major event that will help meteorologists improve forecasts for the next storm, whether its a bomb or a plain ol’ nor’easter.",That bomb cyclone you’ve surely read about has officially gone off.

JOSH GONDELMAN,"Photo Credit JooHee Yoon I am finally ready to admit that I hate the winter. This is a big deal for me. It took the recent “bomb cyclone” to put me over the top. Every year brings at least one storm that causes havoc in the South and devastation across the Northeast. But the name of this one. Bomb. Cyclone. It sounded like an altogether new kind of destruction. The news reports may as well have announced a “knifequake” or a “bankruptcy tsunami.” I grew up in the Boston suburbs and inherited a stubborn New England refusal to acknowledge frigid temperatures. I don’t embrace the chill; I simply will not modify my behavior to accommodate its presence, as if the weather itself were a houseguest that overstayed its welcome. I would like it to be gone, and I am not going to dress up on its behalf. I am not what you call a man’s man (as you could tell if you saw me with my floral-print backpack or witnessed my inability to change my own oil), but I have a certain macho pride in refusing to bend to the elements. “Are you sure you’re going to be warm enough?” is a question I get a lot. I wear a hoodie to walk my dog (in her little plaid coat, she’s often more bundled up than I am) until the elements freeze or soak or whip right through it and I have to upgrade to a medium-weight jacket. Then, when a medium-weight jacket isn’t enough, I don the protection of the classic Northeastern winter face: a scowl so complete it takes over one’s posture and gait, giving every pedestrian the relentless forward momentum of an N.F.L. running back. We hunch forward, seeking out space to maneuver, legs churning through air and slush. “I love the change of the seasons,” I mutter, through gritted teeth, as a 20-mile-per-hour gust renders my pants irrelevant. Clothing choices aren’t my only failure to adapt to my climate. I drink iced coffee nearly every morning and many afternoons year-round. Often I walk past my subway station and two fancy cold-brew spots at the end of my block, cross the street to Dunkin’ Donuts and then double back with a clear plastic cup big enough to hydrate a hockey team, were it full of water and not chilled, low-grade stimulant. When temperatures dip below freezing, I take off my gloves to pay for my purchase and put them on when I go back outside. There are probably more sensible beverages I could enjoy over the full third of the year when nature itself is essentially a series of physical and psychological tortures. But caving in to that impulse runs counter to my native stoicism.

 A man injured in the cyclone in Zimbabwe is carried away from a helicopter.
Cyclone Idai, which struck the coastline of Mozambique on 14 March, has caused devastation and heavy loss of life. 
The UN says 1.7 million people in Mozambique lived in the path of the cyclone, with a further 920,000 people affected in Malawi and many thousands more in Zimbabwe. 
So how common is extreme weather in southern Africa, and were these countries sufficiently prepared? 
Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. 
Most form in the central Indian Ocean, sufficiently far enough off the coast for some preparations to be made. 
Cyclone Idai was unusual in that it formed in the Mozambique Channel, close to the coastline, giving governments and aid agencies less time to issue warnings and make plans.
""The cyclone was by no stretch of the imagination the most powerful... but what made it so devastating was where and how it hit,"" said Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization.
""The ocean floor along the coast by Mozambique is conducive to give storm surges, which reached roughly 3.5m-to-4m in the coastal city of Beira - which is absolutely huge.""
The low-lying coastal areas of central Mozambique are highly vulnerable to natural disasters but the budget for preparing and responding to them is very small. 
Last year, the government received support from international donors for a disaster fund of $18.3m (£13.9m) for 2018 and 2019.
This contingency plan is the main source of funding for any disaster response and is intended specifically for search and rescue within the first 72 hours.
For a major disaster such as Cyclone Idai, most of the funds for recovery and reconstruction are raised after a disaster has struck. 
And even without this latest emergency, Mozambique was facing economic strains as a result of a controversial loan deal in 2016 which resulted in a suspension of some international donor aid to the government.
Media captionAerial footage showing the disaster in Mozambique
How much warning?
The meteorological office of Mozambique, Inam, issued weather alerts as the storm developed.
Three days before the cyclone struck, the government raised the alert to the highest possible level, telling people to evacuate threatened areas. 
Some people were moved out by boat beforehand, but many didn't respond to warnings or weren't aware of them. 
""These public alerts were made in a timely fashion but it's always down to actors along the chain to decide how to act on this type of information,"" says Joao de Lima Rego, an adviser at Deltares, a research organisation focusing on coastal regions and river basins that has helped develop a forecasting system in Mozambique. 
As part of the forward planning for severe weather, safe zones had been created in rural areas for evacuation above the flood plain. 
On this occasion, however, the flooding was far more severe than anticipated.

Preparations in urban areas
The port city of Beira, with a population of half a million, had introduced measures to strengthen resilience to cyclones and flooding. 
Preparedness has focused on drainage systems, says Dinis Juizo, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo. 
Drainage canals and flood-control protection, such as a large water basin, have also been introduced.
However, much of the population of Beira outside the city centre live in informal housing often made of materials unable to withstand severe weather.
""The level of investment has not been high enough for an event of this scale,"" says Dinis Juizo.

 Aid agencies have faced challenges in getting resources to flood-hit areas of Mozambique
Malawi and Zimbabwe
The storm that eventually became Cyclone Idai had caused deaths in Malawi, to the north of Mozambique, in early March.
People in lowland areas were warned, but because warnings about flooding and rainfall are an annual occurrence during the rainy season, many people were reluctant to move and didn't anticipate the extent to which the country would suffer.
In Zimbabwe, there were also warnings about the approaching storm. 
But Zimbabwe's Minister of Defence, Oppah Muchinguri, has said her government failed to anticipate its strength. 
By the time the storm reached Zimbabwe it had weakened considerably and was no longer a tropical cyclone.
Nevertheless, it had a severe impact on the eastern regions of the country.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe. After assessing every tropical cyclone on record between 1949 and 2016, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist James Kossin found that the storms have slowed down in every ocean, save the Northern Indian. This research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, concluded these storms are now moving about 10 percent slower on average than they did in the past, though regional speeds in specific oceans vary. SEE ALSO: Hurricane damage could triple in the U.S. if global warming goes unchecked At first blush, 10 percent might sound like a relatively small percentage, but in reality, it's a big deal, said Kossin, in an interview. A storm that sits still over one place for an extended period of time brings that much more wind and rain to that area. ""Nothing good can come of a slower storm,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey on August 25, 2017, when it reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Image: nOaa Hurricanes already bring a number of well-known hazards — flooding, pummeling winds, and surging seas — all which can prove fatal and wreak havoc on infrastructure. In a May 2018 report, NOAA said last year's Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Houston, was responsible for the direct deaths of at least 68 Americans. ""It's safe to say you want them [hurricanes] to get out of your neighborhood as quickly as possible,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey may have been exceptional — breaking rainfall records while dumping over four feet of rain onto Houston — but any cyclone can wreak havoc if slowed or stalled. ""Sitting still for two days is a big deal,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Willoughby noted that there's another culprit at play here, too. With every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) rise in global temperature, the atmosphere becomes capable of holding 7 percent more water vapor, which provides fuel for heavier downpours. A Houston resident paddles through his home following Hurricane Harvey. Image: John Glaser/CSM/REX/Shutterstock ""This research gives a pretty good picture of what we should expect in the future,"" said Willoughby. ""The threat to the U.S. is from flooding."" Atmospheric scientists, like Kossin, have a pretty good idea about why these storms are slowing down as well. Warming global temperatures, especially the accelerated heating of the Arctic, are disrupting the way air travels through the atmosphere. One of these changes amount to a weakening circulation of tropical air, particularly during the summer. These winds, and others, are hugely influential as they push major storms around ""a bit like a cork in a stream,"" said Kossin. ""It makes physical sense that they should be slowing down,"" said Willoughby, adding that there's still not quite enough historical storm data to say for certain that the storms have slowed as much as the new study shows. ""Stuff happened out in the ocean before 1950 that we didn’t know about,"" said Willoughby. Today, NOAA has a sophisticated group of weather-tracking satellites, so in the coming years scientists' grasp of storm trends will only improve. But at the same time, global temperatures will almost certainly increase, perhaps by 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if the global community fails to rein in carbon emissions. Image: noaa Damage to U.S. communities and coastlines from future hurricanes are expected to hit the U.S. economy quite hard. Research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that future storms — enhanced by rising seas and carrying more water — could bring three times the amount of economic damage than infrastructure-pummeling tempests do today. Over the nearly 70 years of hurricane data Kossin analyzed, the planet warmed by half a degree Celsius (about 1 degree Fahrenheit) on average, but it's unknown what will happen with another degree of warming or more, said Kossin. There could be more than a 10 percent drop in storm speed — or perhaps less. What is known, however, is that while deaths from surging stormwaters on U.S. coastlines have gone down over the decades, inland flooding has become a substantially higher risk for death, said Kossin. People generally don't evacuate from these places during hurricanes, said Kossin. ""That's a scary idea,"" he said.","Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe.

That’s why there’s a small chance one could spin up off the Florida Panhandle this week. A large, low pressure area filled with clouds and thunderstorms has developed across the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it’s marching slowly northward toward the west coast of Florida. As it moves across warm Gulf waters and gathers strength over the next 48 hours, it has about a 30 percent chance of getting organized into a cyclone. Over the next five days, those odds rise to 40 percent, according to the National Weather Service. Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther that in all likelihood, any cyclone that does form would be classified a tropical or subtropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. But, he added, there’s a “small chance” of a named tropical or subtropical storm, one featuring wind speeds of 39—73 mph. “I wouldn’t rule it out, it’s just on the lower side of the probabilities,” Henson said, noting that water temperatures are a bit marginal right now. Regardless of how fierce the storm gets, Floridians are going to feel it. The entire Florida Peninsula could be in for heavy rainfall this week, with eastern Florida around Kennedy Space Center expected to see up to seven inches of precipitation. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing—central and South Florida are coming off a particularly dry dry season, with more than 30 percent of the state in moderate to severe drought as of May 8. “This will slowly alleviate some of the drought conditions,” Henson said, adding that there’s also some concern about localized flash flooding. Predicted rainfall totals for 7-day period ending on May 20. Image: National Weather Service The system has already brought record rainfall to the Florida Keys. By yesterday evening, Key West had notched 3.24 inches of precipitation—more than double the previous May 13 record in logs going back to 1871. On the off chance that the Gulf of Mexico does get a named storm this week, that’d be pretty special. Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told Earther via email that since 1851, only four named storms have formed in the Gulf of Mexico in May. The last one was in 1976.","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation.

A.A. Newton,"The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be. This tracker from ESRI Media takes the familiar prediction model and uses it to calculate some key demographic data for the area inside the error cone. ESRI’s tracker shows the total population, total households, and total educational organizations in Florence’s projected path: Clicking on the individual items in the legend pulls up more data, including the proportion of the total population that’s over age 65, and how many of the total households are below the poverty line. At the time of writing, 16% of the affected population is over 65, with 15% of affected households living in poverty; the median household income is $51,000. Whether you’re smack dab in the danger zone or watching the storm from afar, you should know how to correctly read an error cone projection. ESRI has an efficient summary in the description of their tracker (emphasis mine) that hits on the main points: “The Cone of Uncertainty...represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center.” In other words, if your city—or your loved ones’—is outside the error cone, it just means that the center of the storm isn’t expected to pass over; areas outside the cone can still expect high winds and heavy rain, and should watch local forecasts extra-carefully in the days to come. That’s the most important thing to take away from error cone projections, but if you’d like a more in-depth explainer, this Wall Street Journal piece briefly explains how they’re calculated, how to correctly interpret them, and what the limitations are. Understanding the potential human cost of a storm—especially among vulnerable populations—is a crucial first step to mobilizing support for communities that’ll see the worst of it. Get your hurricane plan locked down, check in on your friends and family, and be prepared to do some vetting before making any donations to relief efforts.","The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionCyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air
Mozambique's port city of Beira is reeling from the damage inflicted by Cyclone Idai.
So far 200 people have been confirmed dead in the southern African country, but the death toll could be much higher.
Those who survived the disaster have had little reprieve to mourn the loss of their loved ones or salvage the little that is remaining of their belongings. They are in desperate need of food, shelter and clothing, as the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports.
Inside a makeshift response centre at the airport in Beira, aid agencies are scrambling to get to those still trapped across the region. 
It's the first point of call for all the teams coming in from around the world and offers the first glimpse of how heavily this operation is relying on outside help. 
A few kilometres away, panic is setting in. The people of Beira are growing anxious - help is coming, but it is really slow and not nearly enough.
""I have nothing. I have lost everything. We don't have food. I don't even have blankets. We need help,"" one woman tells me as we make our way through the village of Manhava. 
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Most of the port city of Beira is under water
Beira's geography, with parts of it lying below sea level, has always made it vulnerable to effects of extreme weather like Cyclone Ida which made landfall last week with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph).
The city bore the full brunt of the destructive storm, which triggered flooding of the whole city and knocked down buildings and cut off roads. The latter is now stalling rescuers from reaching desperate people in need. 
More on Cyclone Idai: 
Some people here are trying to salvage what they can to create shelter. Those who can are repairing their metal roofs, while others are tying together pine branches to sleep under. 
Homes have been damaged, some even completely destroyed, and there are pools of water everywhere. 
A local church has become a temporary home for scores of people. Half of its roof was blown off, but the walls have held and to some it is better than being out in the cold.

 Floodwaters have cut off roads and knocked down buildings
The UN has said that Cyclone Idai triggered a ""massive disaster"" in southern Africa, affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. 
Neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi have also been affected by the freak storm that has caused the deaths of dozens and displacement of thousands of people.
Everyone we come across here is begging us to come into their homes to show us what they have lost and how nature has stolen from them.
We are the first people they have seen since the cyclone hit a few days ago. 
""Please help us. Tell the world we are suffering. We don't know where we are going to sleep,"" says Pedro, a father of three children all under the age of 10. 
The residents here feel like they have been forgotten. 
'100,000 people at risk'
As the full picture of this crisis slowly becomes clear, there are questions about whether the government of Mozambique could have done more to prepare for the disaster. 
The floods of the year 2000 claimed hundreds of lives and yet some here feel lessons have not been learned. 
""Our city was destroyed so easily because our infrastructure is not taken care of. Every time there is a problem here we need foreign countries to save us. What is our government doing, what is our own plan?"" our driver asks me. 
Back at the airport, a helicopter has just landed and rescue workers rush out carrying in their arms children whose eyes are wide with fear.
""Many villages have been washed away. We found women and children holding on to trees. We are doing what we can,"" said one of the rescuers. 
More rains are expected and those who made it to safety are the lucky ones. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk - and there is growing concern that help may not get to them in time.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area. For the third time this winter, we’re using the term bomb cyclone to describe the storm. But neither of those facts are what’s got meteorologists glued to their radar maps today. They’re watching the snow. There’s going to be a lot of it. “This one’s main impact is going to be snow,” NWS meteorologist Kim Buttrick told the Associated Press of the storm. A blizzard warning is in effect for coastal Massachusetts, where total snowfall accumulations of up to nearly two feet are expected. The snow is is falling fast, at rates of up to 1-3 inches per hour, which, combined with wind gusts veering well into tropical storm-force territory, sets the stage or whiteout conditions that could make travel “very dangerous,” the National Weather Service warns. In Boston proper, more modest snowfall totals of 17 to 18 inches are expected. That’s still no fun to dig your car out of, mind you. Boston is no stranger to snowy winters. ““We don’t see snowfall rates of 1-3 inches per hour every day in New England, but neither are they unheard of,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email. “Likewise, the expected accumulations are impressive but not necessarily record-smashing.” But combined with the fact that this is the third nor’easter the region has seen in the past few weeks, and combined with the fact that meteorologists are already talking about a potential fourth, March 2018 is almost certainly going down as one of the snowiest in Boston’s history. “We’re definitely seeing an anomalous event for this time of the year with respect to snowfall,” meteorologist Ed Vallee told Earther, noting that Boston’s number one snowstorm for March and April, on April Fool’s Day ‘97, saw about 22 inches of snow. Vallee told Earther that the city has already seen seven inches of snow this month and that he’d add “at least another foot” after today’s storm. “Especially late in the winter, it often takes a highly dynamic system to chill the atmosphere to snow-producing temperatures, and those strong dynamics can also lead to very heavy snowfall rates,” Henson said. So let’s talk about those dynamics a bit. Henson told Earther the volley of storms we’ve seen in recent weeks is likely connected to a record strong phase of the Madden-Julien Oscillation, which NOAA describes as “a major fluctuation in tropical circulation and rainfall that moves eastward along the equator and circles the entire globe in a span of 30–60 days on average.” This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is stationary in the tropical Pacific. As Henson explained, a strongly active MJO “fed into a split of the stratospheric polar vortex in February” that’s still having atmospheric reverberations, including the recent “ Beast from the East ” cold outbreak over Europe and record cold in Siberia. The MJO is also a strong contributor to Arctic air outbreaks across the central and eastern U.S., according to NOAA. In addition to the legacy of the MJO, another atmospheric pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) veered into record low territory earlier this month. A negative NAO is characterized by a ridge of high pressure air over Greenland, something meteorologists call the Greenland block. Vallee explained that the Greenland block leads to a trough of low pressure further south and west. “That’s a very conducive pattern for nor’easters to form,” he said, noting that the Greenland block not only enhances the pressure gradient fueling these storms, but can slow their progress out to sea. The nor’easter that drove massive coastal flooding in Boston at the beginning of the month was slow to get out of the city’s way thanks to the Greenland block, Weather Underground reported at the time. This time around, at least, the coastal flooding risk for Massachusetts is much fairly low. Weather Underground reports that the strongest winds from today’s nor’easter will be further offshore, with peak land gusts of about 60 miles per hour forecast to blow across Cape Cod and Nantucket. This storm, unlike its predecessors, also happens to coincide with some of the lowest astronomical tides of the month. So, while Massachusetts will wind up buried in snow today, at least folks’ basements won’t be flooding, too? Small miracles, I guess.","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice. The Arctic is no stranger to cyclones, but the latest no-name storm, which emerged in the Kara sea north of Siberia, has garnered attention both for its size and timing. The storm’s central pressure (a measure of its strength) bottomed out Thursday at about 966 millibars, placing it par with the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012, one of the most extreme summertime storms in recent memory. That storm reached a minimum central pressure 963-966 millibars, depending on which analysis you trust. The new storm’s occurrence in June is also noteworthy. Big cyclones like this don’t normally start hitting the Arctic until late summer. The Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 spun up in August as did a major storm in 2016. “Preliminarily, this storm could rank in the Top 10 for Arctic Cyclones in June as well as for the summer (June through August) in strength,” Steven Cavallo, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther via email. Xiangdong Zhang, a scientist at the International Arctic Research Center who specializes in Arctic cyclones, cited a few factors responsible for the storm’s formation, including low sea ice cover in the North Atlantic which has increased the amount of heat in the atmosphere, a strong temperature gradient between land and sea, and the stratospheric polar vortex, an area of low pressure just above the storm. “The downward intrusion of this polar vortex intensified [the] storm,” Zhang told Earther via email. The no-name storm reached peak photogenicity yesterday, with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration capturing a stunning high-resolution image. While your typical late-season Arctic cyclones are notorious for chewing up sea ice, what this early season beast will mean for ice remains to be seen. “This storm is very quick-moving and occurring earlier in the season,” University of California, Irvine Ph.D. candidate Zack Labe told Earther via Twitter direct message. “Its impacts to sea ice are likely not comparable to these other strong cyclones that have occurred later in the summer.” Labe noted that early summer storms can favor cooler, cloudier conditions, slowing down the loss of sea ice, which typically bottoms out in September. However, he added that a storm of this strength “may precondition the ice for easier melt later in the season.” Zhang said that due to the storm’s location, it can transport more sea ice out of the Arctic through the passage between Greenland and Svalbard known as the Fram Straight. “This will contribute to Arctic sea ice decrease, in particular thick ice,” he said. Storm or no, it’s been a weird, bad year for Arctic sea ice so far. After limping along all winter, Bering sea ice was basically gone by May, months ahead of schedule. Even before this storm, sea ice around Svalbard was looking more like it should in September. Overall, Arctic sea ice extent for May was at its second-lowest on record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s latest monthly sea ice report released on June 6. The role of rising temperatures in driving down sea ice is well established. But there’s also growing evidence that climate change could fuel more ice-shredding cyclones. Research going back to the early 2000s suggests Arctic cyclone activity is on the rise. And a study published in April concluded that these storms will become more frequent and intense in the future as the contrast between land and sea temperatures continues to rise.","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice.

Kristy O'Brien, a journalist for Australian broadcaster ABC, was sheltering in a mining camp near the town of Borroloola when Cyclone Trevor made landfall. 
She tells the BBC what it was like to be in the eye of a category four storm, hearing punishing winds and rain squalls outside.
Covering the cyclone
""We caught a plane out here a couple of days ago, ahead of Tropical Cyclone Trevor arriving.
""It was predicted to be very nasty and it lived up to that - it was a category four system which brings winds in excess of 250km/h (155 mph). 
""On top of that we had a high tide, which brought in a huge tidal surge, and we've also got localised flooding which could extend for another 500km (310 miles) inland as the tropical system moves through to the centre of Australia.""

""It's been organised chaos in some ways. We were here when the defence force brought in several Hercules aircraft, one after the other,"" she says.
Ms O'Brien and her colleagues were the last people in the town of Borroloola in the Northern Territory - the main town to be evacuated.
It is home to about 900 people, and lies about 50km (31 miles) inland.
""Up to 1,400 people were evacuated from remote coastal communities, and they're all in evacuation centres in Darwin and Katherine - the nearest big towns to here. 
""It was seen as too dangerous to keep anyone in the communities,"" she says. ""It'll be some time before they're allowed to come back to their homes because we can't ascertain the damage as yet. It's expected to be quite widespread.""
""There will be entire homes and areas flattened by this. We'll have to go in tomorrow once it's safe and once police have been in, to start to get the first pictures out.
""We still have the huge weather system in this region - when you look on a map of Australia it takes up the entire northern half. It's quite phenomenal - it's about 1,000km (621 miles) or so wide.""
In the eye of the storm
Ms O'Brien and her team found shelter in the McArthur River mines, about 70km (43 miles) southwest of Borroloola.

Patrick Allan,"A massive, super cold storm is set to slam into the East later this week thanks to a process known as “bombogenesis,” and it’s going to have a massive impact on air travel. If you’re flying later this week, you might want to think of a backup plan, or at least pack a nice long book. Next time you go to book a flight you might want to look at the early-morning options first.… Read more Read According to the NOAA, bombogenesis is term used by meteorologists to describe the process of a cyclone that rapidly intensifies as it drops in atmospheric pressure (also known as a “bomb cyclone). In this case, it’s because there’s cold air from the land colliding with warm air over the ocean water. Think of it as a winter hurricane. It sounds scary, but it’s actually pretty common, especially on the East Coast where this type of thing occurs almost every year, albeit usually on a smaller scale. Unfortunately, this particular storm is shaping up to be a pretty big one, and freezing temperatures, massive blizzards, tons of ice, and high-speed winds are going to make it really hard for planes to fly and for airports to keep things running smoothly. This probably isn’t going to go too well. If you have a flight in or out of any airports on the East Coast—from Florida’s Tallahassee International (TLH) all the way up to Maine’s Bangor International (BGR)—you should contact your airline immediately and see what’s going on. Many airlines are preparing for major delays and cancellations, but they’re also offering travel waivers to passengers in case you’d like to change your flights to a later date at no additional cost. These airlines include Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, United, and more. JT Genter at The Points Guy blog has a thorough list of what each airline is offering for this particular weather event. It’s important you take some initiative here and contact your airline so you know the specifics for your flight itinerary, but it’s also helpful if you can be flexible and delay your trip. Delays are all but guaranteed, and cancellations are definitely possible as well. Keep in mind that when you bought a ticket you agreed that the airline is not responsible for paying for your food or hotel stays in the event of weather-related delays or cancellations.

Frank Bainimarama said Fiji had entered a ""frightening new era"" of extreme weather that needed to be confronted. His comments came after Cyclone Josie caused deaths and flooding on Fiji's main island, Viti Levu, at the weekend. In 2016, a cyclone hit Fiji leaving 44 people dead and wiping out one-third of the nation's economic production. Four people have died in severe flooding caused by Cyclone Josie, according to Reuters news agency. ""We are now at an almost constant level of threat from these extreme weather events,"" Mr Bainimarama said on Tuesday, adding that powerful cyclones in the region were becoming ""more severe"" as a result of climate change. ""We need to get the message out loud and clear to the entire world about the absolute need to confront this crisis head on,"" he said. ""As a nation we are starting to build our resilience in response to the frightening new era that is upon us,"" he added.

The planet's climate has constantly been changing over time. However, the current period of warming is occurring more rapidly than many past events. The changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes in food production conditions, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.","Global warming is bringing ""almost constant"" extreme weather to the Pacific island nation, says PM.",2018-04-03T07:14:28Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Fiji PM: Climate change threatens our survival,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43625608,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11753/production/_100670517_hi045906389.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,cyclone,1
Andrew Freedman,"A major nor'easter is taking aim at the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, bringing an array of life-threatening hazards, from hurricane-force winds to record-breaking coastal flooding. Based on current forecasts, it's clear that this storm is likely to be more damaging than the so-called ""Bomb Cyclone"" that struck in early January. Technically, the storm, like many winter storms in the Northern Hemisphere, will rapidly intensify once it gets going on Thursday night and Friday morning. During the course of 24 hours, its minimum central air pressure — a key measure of the storm's intensity — is expected to plummet by more than 24 millibars. This would be sufficient to qualify the storm as undergoing a process known as bombogenesis (which, incidentally would also make a great heavy metal band name). SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions By that standard, one could also call this storm a ""bomb,"" or even a ""bomb cyclone."" Some media outlets, like CNN, Mother Jones, and AccuWeather, are doing just that in their headlines, thereby reprising the name used for the fastest-intensifying winter storm ever observed off the East Coast. But there are major problems with this using this nomenclature in headlines about this storm. Computer model projection of sea level pressure and low-level wind speeds on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com When facing a major storm threat, it's important that the public focuses on the hazards they are likely to face. This storm is going to have a broader, more damaging footprint across a larger amount of real estate than the ""Bomb Cyclone"" did in January. Power outages from this storm, for example, are likely to spread from the Washington, D.C., area, northward to upstate New York, and eastward to Boston. In addition, many of the other impacts from this storm will exceed those of the January 4 storm, particularly when it comes to coastal flooding. The National Weather Service forecast office in Boston is using dire language to warn people of the flood threat, noting that this is a ""LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION"" along the coast, where record flooding is likely from a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and towering waves up to 35 feet high just offshore. The National Weather Service expects seas that may exceed 15.3 feet at the Boston Harbor tidal gauge, which would be an all-time record, beating the one set during the Jan. 4 ""Bomb Cyclone"" by about 2 inches. This is a rather incredible depiction. Bombs the low to ~972mb nestling it just south of the cape with a series of wind maxima/meso lows landfalling into Boston/Cape Cod. I hope folks have done what they can to prepare. pic.twitter.com/i35EQ0cHPU — Taylor Trogdon (@TTrogdon) March 1, 2018 Mashable was one of the first media outlets (along with the Washington Post 's Capital Weather Gang) to call the exceptional nor'easter in early January the ""Bomb Cyclone."" The storm dumped heavy snow across Southern New England, and set a record for the highest-recorded water level in Boston. The setup for this storm looks far worse, in part because it is going to be traveling slowly, exposing the Massachusetts coastline to major coastal flooding during at least three tide cycles, whereas the ""Bomb Cyclone"" was moving quickly when it struck. Another aspect of this storm that is different, and potentially far more destructive, is the type of snow it will produce. The ""Bomb Cyclone"" had plenty of Arctic air to work with, making the snow that fell on New England light and fluffy. This storm, however, will dump pasty, wet cement-like snow on upstate New York, and the higher elevations of Connecticut and Massachusetts. The weight of such snow on tree limbs and power lines tends to cause significant power outages. This event will be different from the January 4 storm in two big ways: more wave energy coming from offshore and THREE tide cycles instead of one and done. Both equate to increased damage potential. — Matt Noyes NBC10 Boston &amp; NECN (@MattNBCBoston) March 1, 2018 The bottom line is that if the media were to call this upcoming storm another ""Bomb Cyclone,"" as other outlets are starting to do, we would run the risk of confusing readers into thinking that the impacts of the storm and its characteristics will be the same. In many ways — from coastal flooding to the storm's wind and wave field, as well as the power outage footprint — this upcoming storm will be worse. Using the Internet-friendly ""Bomb Cyclone"" moniker here would be to the detriment of public understanding of this weather phenomenon. Yes, this storm will undergo bombogenesis. Yes, you could call it a ""bomb."" But it will likely end up being remembered for being even more damaging than the January storm.","A major nor'easter is taking aim at the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, bringing an array of life-threatening hazards, from hurricane-force winds to record-breaking coastal flooding.

 Satellite imagery shows Cyclone Trevor approaching the northeast state of Queensland
Thousands of Australians have been forced to evacuate their homes in preparation for two potentially devastating cyclones.
Over the weekend, Cyclone Trevor will hit the north while Cyclone Veronica will strike the country's west coast.
Destructive winds are expected, while heavy rains and large waves threaten to cause severe flooding. 
Experts say a ""severe impact"" is likely and residents have been told to prepare for a ""massive weather event"".

 Cyclone Oma hit Queensland in February, bringing severe flooding
It is only the second time in history that two cyclones are predicted to strike the country at the same time. 
Having already lashed the far north of Queensland, Tropical Cyclone Trevor is expected to hit the communities of Numbulwa and Borroloola in the Northern Territory on Saturday morning. 
The storm could bring a year's worth of rain in just a couple of days.

 Trevor will hit communities along the coast in the Northern Territory, while Veronica is expected to strike between Port Hedland and Karratha in Western Australia
In the biggest ever evacuation ahead of a cyclone, people living in its the path have moved into tented sites in Darwin and Katherine. 
Emergency services and the military were called in to rescue residents from the island of Groote Eylandt, off the north coast on Thursday. 
The last evacuation of a similar scale was for Tropical Cyclone Tracy, which killed 49 people in Darwin in 1974. 
Cyclone Veronica is due to hit the northwest coast of Australia between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. 
Very strong gusts are expected and the Bureau of Meteorology in Western Australia said a ""severe impact"" is likely. 
In the mining town of Port Headland, where the storm is set to strike first, supermarkets have been stripped bare as residents stockpile in preparation, ABC News reported.
The town's mayor, Camilo Blanco, has warned residents to be ready for ""this massive weather event"" and people have been protecting their houses with sandbags.

Parts of southern Africa have been left devastated after Cyclone Idai swept through Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands more have been affected. Even though the cyclone hit Mozambique over a week ago, aid agencies are warning that the disaster is getting worse. Here are three reasons why:
1. More floods
The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday 14 March, and the subsequent flood submerged much of the city. 
But aid agencies warn that other areas continue to be at risk of becoming submerged. 
That's because it is still raining.
Two rivers, including the Buzi, burst their banks after rain in Zimbabwe and Malawi at the weekend, sending even more torrents of water into Mozambique.
And more rivers risk bursting their banks, says Rotafina Donco, Oxfam programme manager in Mozambique.
She told BBC Newsday that this rain was affecting most of the rivers in Mozambique that flow into the Indian Ocean. 
She said she expected more casualties. 
As late as Tuesday, she received information that people in Manica province, near the Zimbabwean border, much further inland from the epicentre of the crisis, Beira, were stranded on rooftops because one of the rivers had burst and the area had become submerged. 
In Mozambique waters are expected to rise by up to eight metres, putting at least 350,000 people at risk, says the Disaster Emergencies Committee (DEC).
A similar situation is playing out in Zimbabwe. 
Herve Verhoosel, spokesperson for the UN World Food Programme said in a statement that heavy rains in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces continue to cause massive destruction. 
The Marowanyati dam in Buhera, Manicaland has overflowed, raising river levels, he added.
2. Cholera
An outbreak of cholera could lead to the death toll increasing exponentially. 
Cholera is spread through human waste in the water supply. 
The flood water itself isn't the primary risk. Instead the risk comes because the existing drinking water supplies having been damaged by the flooding. 
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 Water supplies have been cut in Beira since the cyclone hit
This means people are finding it harder to find safe water. Larger groups of people are also sharing the same water supply, which increases the risk of cholera spreading quickly. 
""It's bound to rear its head at some point,"" says Paolo Cernuschi, Zimbabwe Country Director at the International Rescue Committee.
But that doesn't mean inevitable disaster. 
That's because cholera is relatively easy to contain when there is good healthcare available - people just need rehydration salts and to be put on an IV drip, he says. 
So, Mr Cernuschi says, there is the ""race against time"" to get the healthcare all set up before an outbreak happens.
More on Cyclone Idai: 
The worst-case scenario is that cholera breaks out in an area that is inaccessible, where there is no health care and spreads, Mr Cernuschi, said. 
Currently an area his organisation is finding it difficult to access is Zimbabwe's south-eastern town of Chimanimani - making it difficult to tell whether cholera has already begun to spread. 
Other waterborne diseases like typhoid and malaria also pose a risk, Mr Cernuschi says. 
Malaria in particular is likely to spread because the aftermath of the flood there is an increase in stagnant water - the preferred breeding ground of mosquitoes that spread malaria. 
Standing water also creates a risk of diarrheal diseases, Christian Lindmeier of the WHO told Newsday. 
Even though there is water everywhere it is not safe enough to drink.

Access to safe water is vital to prevent any further disease, says Mr Lindmeier.
Relief efforts need to deliver clean water or water purification tablets.
And that's the issue. 
""Getting there is the biggest challenge,"" he says.
The floods have cut off land routes and the only way to get to people is by air or water. 
3. Starvation
While people may make it through the next few weeks with the energy biscuits and water purification tablets that are currently being airdropped, a more long-term threat of starvation still looms.
Mr Cernuschi explains that the cyclone has compounded a crisis that was already there. 
He says drought in parts of Zimbabwe had already written off an estimated 75% of crops in the areas affected by the cyclone.
""Whatever crops that were being grown despite the drought have now been destroyed in the floods,"" he says.
He warns of a food insecurity crisis in the next six to 12 months - when people will face starvation as a result of the cyclone destroying their crops. 
As for the country that is worst hit by the cyclone, Mozambique, a total of 600,000 people are believed to be in need of help, writes Andre Vornic from the World Food Programme. 
Monica Blagescu, DEC Director of Humanitarian Programmes, warns that if more is not done, a ""secondary emergency is approaching rapidly"".","Aid agencies warn that it is becoming more dangerous, not less, in southern Africa after Cyclone Idai.",2019-03-22T00:28:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Cyclone Idai: What are the immediate dangers?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47654070,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9C9C/production/_106129004_carry976.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,cyclone,1

 Thousands of people are still awaiting rescue from flooded areas across in southern Africa
A week after the flooded Mozambican port of Beira was hit by Cyclone Idai, cases of cholera have been recorded, a humanitarian aid group said on Friday.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria.
The storm has so far killed 557 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, but the death toll is expected to rise.
Idai made landfall near Beira with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March.
Aid workers are slowly delivering relief but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and a scarcity of helicopters.
Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods.
""There is growing concern among aid groups on the ground of potential disease outbreaks,"" the IFRC statement said. ""Already, some cholera cases have been reported in Beira along with an increasing number of malaria infections among people trapped by the flooding.""
Cholera, which is endemic in Mozambique, is spread by water contaminated by sewage, and can kill within hours if left untreated.
""There's stagnant water, it's not draining, decomposing bodies, lack of good hygiene and sanitation,"" Henrietta Fore, the head of Unicef who is in Mozambique, told AFP news agency.
Media caption'It has become an inland sea'
""We are running out of time, it is at a critical point here,"" she said, warning that hygiene and safe drinking water were absolute priorities.
""The scale of this crisis is staggering,"" Elhadj As Sy, the head of the IFRC, said after seeing Beira, which was home to 500,000 people. 
""We can't forget that it is an intimate and human crisis. Tens of thousands of families have lost everything. Children have lost parents. Communities have lost schools and clinics.""
A spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP) said the aid effort was ""slow to start, [but]... is now accelerating, thankfully.""
""We are not yet where it needs to be,"" he told AFP.
The United Nations has released $20m (£15m) from its emergency fund, and on Friday its chief made a personal appeal for more international support.
Aid groups said Mozambique has borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. At least 65,000 people are sheltering in 100 temporary sites, many of which are in ""desperate conditions"", according to the UN.
Many people are said to have not yet received emergency rations, with some still clinging to rooftops and trees.","Cases are reported in the flooded port city of Beira, a week after it was hit by a deadly cyclone.",2019-03-22T20:03:47Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Cyclone Idai: Cholera cases reported in storm-hit Mozambique,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47674253,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A2B6/production/_106145614_mediaitem106145613.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,cyclone,1

As aid began to pour in, neighbors across this blistered landscape tried to help one another.
Humanitarian groups are grappling with a double crisis: the brunt of the cyclone itself, and the severe flooding left in its wake.
Nearly a week after the storm hit, heavy rains were still endangering communities isolated by flooding, and complicating efforts by rescue workers to reach them. Rising floodwaters were threatening to partially submerge Buzi, a town of 200,000, not far from Beira, the United Nations warned.
Beira has become a place of refuge for people fleeing flooded areas, but on Wednesday, the whole town still lacked electricity. Cellphone service was extremely limited, and people thronged the few areas with connectivity along the main road.
Fallen trees had yet to be cleared from central Beira, an area with modern buildings and colonial Portuguese homes. Stores and other businesses were closed. There was no activity at the port, the sector that defines the city. Large stores owned by Indians and Chinese, more recent arrivals, were shuttered.
Roofs had been torn off many buildings, but the physical damage was limited.
The greatest destruction was found in the poor rural neighborhoods outside the city center. There, many poorly built houses had collapsed instantly when the storm hit.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/cyclone-idai-rescue.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,cyclone,1
Pete Pachal,"Every product here is independently selected by Mashable journalists. If you buy something featured, we may earn an affiliate commission which helps support our work. The Dyson Cyclone V10 is the most powerful and capable of all of Dyson's handheld vacuums — perhaps of all handheld vacuums, period. It's also not for everyone. Dyson is so confident in the Cyclone that, with its release, the company says it will halt all new designs of its stand-up vacuums. It'll still sell the existing products — there will always be a customer who simply prefers a stand-up vacuum over a handheld — but Dyson really thinks it's nailed it this time: It contends this vacuum's performance is as good as, if not better, than any vacuum cleaner you plug into a wall. The Dyson Cyclone V10 is 20% more powerful then its predecessor, the V8. It also looks a lot like a ray gun. Image: Dustin Drankoski/Mashable After using a Dyson-supplied review unit for a week, I'd have to agree, but I'd add that performance and convenience aren't the same thing. While I found the Cyclone V10 to be powerful and, frankly, awesome-looking, I also thought it was too heavy to serve as a go-to vacuum for smaller jobs. TL;DR review Who it's for: It's large weight, versatile heads, and robust battery means it's best suited for big houses, or those times when you want to do all the vacuuming. Who it's not for: People in small apartments — or any apartment — will likely find the Dyson Cyclone a tad intimidating to pull out for any old mess. Whereas the current generation of Dyson stick vacuums, led by the V8, are compact and lightweight enough to grab at a moment's notice for a sudden Cheerios spill, picking up the Cyclone V10 feels like a commitment. For apartment dwellers, it's probably overkill. What it has going for it: What makes Dyson's new flagship vac tempting for everyone are its multitude of improvements over previous designs, like the new bin that's 40 percent bigger and points forward for easier dumping, the robust battery that lasts up to 60 minutes, and three-speed switch for cranking up suction power when you need it. It also looks more like a badass ray gun than any previous Dyson handheld. However, the $499 starting price will give anyone pause, and in this case it's a good thing. Customers wanting a powerful handheld vacuum that can handle virtually any size job should take a good hard look at themselves and their homes and ask themselves: How much vacuuming do I do anyway? This is one powerful vacuum, but sometimes ultimate power is just too much. Review continues after summary Dyson Cyclone V10 Ease of use 😎😎😎(out of five) The Dyson Cyclone comes in three different packages: the V10 Motorhead ($499), which sports a smaller-size bin and the bare minimum of accessories, the V10 Animal ($599), which has the 40 percent bigger bin and more accessories, and the V10 Absolute ($699), which is the same as the Animal but includes a soft motorhead for extra gentleness on hardwood floors. Despite their futuristic design, Dyson cordless handheld vacuums are very intuitive to use, and the Cyclone V10 is no different. It's shaped like a gun, and there's only one button where the trigger is, so there's no mistaking how to hold and operate it. The first time you pull it out of the box, you'll be tempted to pull the trigger and start sucking up stuff — and why not? It's shipped with a partial charge, so all you need to do is slap on one of the multitude of modular cleaning heads and you're good to go. The first time you pick it up, though, you may be a little surprised by the weight. The V10 weighs 5.9 pounds, which is just 0.2 pounds more than the most recent top-of-the-line model, the V8. But it's not just the extra ounces: In this new design, the bin faces forward, whereas every pervious Dyson handheld had it facing downward, just in front of the trigger handle. While there's a lot to be said for the forward-facing design — mostly that particles don't need to be redirected 90 degrees at the end of their journey — it has the unfortunate effect of throwing off the vacuum's center of mass. While resting on its battery base, the V10 has a tendency to tip forward if it's disturbed in the slightest, and you certainly can't put it down with any kind of cleaning head inserted and not expect it to tip over. The new Dyson V10 is very front-heavy, meaning it has a tendency to tip over. Image: Dustin Drankoski/Mashable The tipping isn't such a big deal, but the awkwardness of the weight is. With so much of its weight in the front, the V10 tends to put more strain on your wrist (instead of your arm) as you move it around. Whereas I could wield older Dyson models like the DC59 Animal, complete with sticks and heads, with ease, I got more of a workout from the Cyclone V10. Some might find that to be a good thing, but generally I prefer my household chores to by as physically unchallenging as possible. The last thing I'll say about the size: It makes the V10 slightly harder to tuck away in a closet or cabinet. If you think of a handheld vacuum as something you like to whip out at a moment's notice, that's probably not going to fly with the V10. You'll need to give this thing a permanent base of operations in your home, but, like previous Dysons, it comes with a wall mount to make it easier to create that space. At the same time, the larger size gives the V10 a major advantage over previous designs: a significantly better battery. The V10's battery is 2,600 milliamp-hours, a whole 500 mAh over the DC59. The V10 also flips the charging port from the back to the front, which, considering the wall mount has the vacuum pointing down, makes way more sense. Performance ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡(out of five) Like other Dysons, the V10 comes with a whole bunch of different cleaning heads, including: a short adjustable brush for countertops and furniture a large carpet-cleaning motorhead with a rotating brush a large hard-floor motorhead with a fabric rotating brush a smaller motorhead for deeper cleaning of upholstery a small static brush for corners and edges a thin stick for hard-to-reach nooks and crannies an extension stick that fits all the heads and turns the V10 into a stand-up vacuum From the top: The Dyson Cyclone V10 with hard-floor motorhead, extension stick, thin stick, small static brush, short adjustable brush, small motorhead, large carpet-cleaning motorhead. Image: Dustin Drankoski/Mashable You'll use some more than others. I used the short brush almost religiously, and I mostly used the head meant for carpet cleaning on both carpets and hardwood floors. I almost never used the smaller rotating brush, but if I had pets it might be a different story. The carpet-cleaning head (also called the direct-drive head) has a nifty new feature: two tiny doors in the front that can let in larger pieces of gunk (like Cheerios) if you leave them open by sliding the physical switch to the ""+"" position. For when you want that extra insurance against picking up bigger debris (like Lego pieces), just leave them closed. The carpet motorhead (left) has tiny doors in front to let in larger debris when you want to. The hardwood motorhead (right) fits under most furniture. Image: Dustin Drankoski/Mashable The grab bag of heads is one of Dyson's strengths, not just because of the variety, but also because they're very well-designed: The larger heads, for example, both have joints that rotate in two directions, letting you make maneuvers like come at edges from an angle, or get down low to vacuum under furniture. Dyson says the V10's motor is 20 percent more powerful than the V8's (150 ""air watts"" instead of 115). I've never used a V8, but I've used a Dyson DC59, and I was struck by how much quieter the V10 is (at least in its lowest-power mode) than the older model. Clearly Dyson's engineers are also steadily improving their muffling technology, too. The V10 is the first Dyson handheld with three power levels instead of two (one dot, two dots and ""MAX""), and the switch up is a big improvement, too. Not only is it clearly labeled, but since it's not a simple toggle (like the rear button on the DC59), you're far less likely to accidentally engage the higher level without knowing. At higher power levels, the vacuum gets noisier, though that's to be expected. The power switch shows the three levels of suction. Image: Dustin DRankoski/Mashable Power and maintenance 🔋🔋🔋🔋🔋(out of 5) The most welcome upgrade in the Dyson Cyclone V10 is the larger battery. Dyson rates the run time as follows: Extended: 60 minutes Increased: 40 minutes Maximum: 6 minutes Due to interruptions, I didn't keep a precise time when I vacuumed my entire 2,000-square-foot house from top to bottom, but the Cyclone got through the whole thing without giving out. I was in Extended mode, and, once I was done, just turning on Maximum power for even a couple of seconds exhausted the last of the battery. Generally I found Dyson's estimates to be slightly conservative. Charging time (from empty to full) is rated as 3.5 hours. I also very much appreciated the new battery indicator, which is split into three sections, so you at least have some idea of how much vacuum time you have left. One advantage of the front-facing bin design is that it's slightly less awkward to empty — Dyson calls it ""point and shoot"" emptying — and it's just as easy to re-seal. The filter is shaped differently than previous Dyson handhelds, but it's still simple to clean: just run it under the tap for a few minutes. (You only need to clean the filter every three months, Dyson says.) The bin on the Dyson V10 is 40% larger than its predecessor. Image: Dustin Drankoski/Mashable Final score: 4.3 (out of five) The Dyson Cyclone V10 has the power and features to clean an entire house, plus furniture, in one go, and that's clearly what it was designed to do. But just as an SUV is bigger and more capable than a sedan, the smaller ride is more appropriate for a lot of situations. On the other side, though, are the huge, plug-in vacs — the minivans and buses in this analogy. If you're used to those, an SUV would be an exhilarating breath of fresh air, and V10 certainly has the goods to be an ample replacement for a stand-up model for all but the largest houses. Just be sure it's not more vacuum than you need.","Every product here is independently selected by Mashable journalists.

KAI SCHULTZ,"Cyclones occur in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean ; in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, such severe storms are called hurricanes. “There was no forewarning,” Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose, of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, said by telephone. “There was no scientific means of establishing that this was going to become a cyclone.” But fishermen, saying the government had been slow to notify people of the storm, organized protests on Saturday in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu, blocking roads and pooling resources and boats to try to locate the missing. Speaking to the families of missing fishermen in Tamil Nadu villages, India’s defense minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said on Sunday that the country’s navy, air force and coast guard were doing everything possible to try to find the missing fishermen. “I speak with folded hands,” she told the crowd, in which wives of the missing fishermen wept. “We have not stopped searching for them.” Several hundred fishermen have been rescued, the Kerala disaster management agency said. The state has announced compensation payments of about $15,000 each for the families of those who have died. Mr. Kuriakose said that some of the missing fishermen had already been out at sea days before the cyclone formed. Before gathering force, the storm killed at least 13 people last week in neighboring Sri Lanka, uprooting trees, forcing schools to shut and disrupting air travel. The India Meteorological Department said the cyclone was expected to weaken gradually in the next couple of days as it moved north toward the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Heavy rainfall was forecast for the area on Tuesday and officials have advised fishermen in southern Gujarat and northern Maharashtra to stay on shore.

Sam Rutherford,"Just in time for the eastern seafront to get assaulted with a bomb cyclone carrying blasts of snow and freezing temps, OnePlus has released a frosty new color variant of the 5T. On the inside, the white OP5T is the same as the black model I reviewed a few months ago, so I’m not going to spend a ton of time going over every single detail again. In short, the OP5t remains one of the best deals among smartphones, especially for people looking for a big screen and flagship specs without the $800 price tags you see on a lot of other competing Android phones. Instead this is going to serve as a quick overview to highlight the few differences between the white and black models, along with a quick check in on developments since the OP5T’s launch. One of the big things OnePlus promised for late 2017/early 2018 was an OTA update to bring Android Oreo to the OnePlus 5. And right on schedule, just before Christmas, OnePlus brought Oxygen OS 5.0 out of beta, which included Android Oreo, a revamped UI for the camera app and a few other improvements. Unfortunately, that release had a major bug, so OnePlus had to cancel the global rollout of Oxygen OS 5.0, which means we’re still waiting to receive Android 8 on the OP5 and OP5T. Now let’s focus on the new white OP5T itself. Earlier this fall, OnePlus released a special Star Wars edition version of the OP5T, but didn’t make it available here in the US. That was kind of a bummer because I liked that phone’s white back paired with subtle red accents. Luckily, this new white variant is just that, minus the Star Wars logo and a few limited edition UI tweaks on the inside, which in my opinion, makes this model even better. Even for a pretty ardent Star Wars fan like me, there’s only so much branding I can take. Unlike the regular OP5T’s brushed aluminum back, the white model has an entirely different feel. OnePlus is calling it Sandstone White, but it doesn’t really have that gritty texture that people either loved or hated on the original OnePlus One. Really, it’s more like a mix between a chalkboard and an eggshell, which is something that serves to differentiate this phone even more when compared to Apple’s, Samsung’s and LG’s latest handsets, which are all sporting trendy glass sandwich designs. OnePlus even made sure to match the color of the fingerprint sensor to the rest of the phone’s rear, while on the left side, the metallic red volume slider provides a nice pop of color. The one thing that kind of sticks out is the SIM tray, which is black instead of white, and seems a little out of place. Despite that lone oddity, I prefer this color scheme over the standard black, and I think it’s a shame this model wasn’t available from the start. The white coating on the back even feels a bit more durable than bare brushed aluminum, though I can’t really say how clean that paint job will look six months to a year from now. The last big thing you should know about the white model is that it’s only available with the upgraded memory and storage configuration, which means you’re getting 8GB of RAM and a 128GB of storage. However, with a price tag of $560, at least you won’t be paying a premium when compared to a black OP5T with the same specs.","Just in time for the eastern seafront to get assaulted with a bomb cyclone carrying blasts of snow and freezing temps, OnePlus has released a frosty new color variant of the 5T.

First there was the hellish Atlantic hurricane season, when storms wiped out Domenica, Barbuda, Puerto Rico, St. John and other islands.

By the time it struck, it was a formidable storm that passed close to the islands of Tongatapu and 'Eua. It's likely that the island nation has sustained major damage. Tongatapu alone has about 75,000 people, and it appeared to enter the storm's eye wall, where the fiercest winds and heaviest rains are located. Tropical Cyclone Gita is forecast to move to the southwest during the next few days, potentially impacting Noumea, New Caledonia, and potentially bringing stormy weather to northern New Zealand by late in the week.

Adam Clark Estes,"Dyson is famous for making amazing vacuum cleaners that cost amazing amounts of money. Its latest model, the Dyson Cyclone V10, earned a strong review from Gizmodo. It also cost $700, if you want all the attachments. That’s bananas! The good news is that the market for Dysons is predictable, much like the market for iPhones. New models come out every year, and the old models get cheaper, even though they all use the same basic technology. The other good news is that Dyson vacuums aren’t as novel as they used to be. There are now a number of decently cheap alternatives to the expensive handheld cyclone from the famous vacuum maker. Why Dyson? Let’s start with the predictable Dyson market. Broadly speaking, Dyson keeps improving its vacuum lineup, but the technology barely changes It all dates back to the early 90s, when James Dyson sold his first “dual cyclone” vacuum cleaner: the DC01. This upright vacuum pulled dirty air through two cone-shaped containers that created cyclones, pulling particles out of the air and into a tank. Dyson famously went through 5,126 prototypes before landing on the final design for his “bagless vacuum that didn’t lose suction.” Over time, Dyson has improved that original design, however incrementally. The company has added more cones (thus, more cyclones), more powerful motors, and more designs. Recently, its streamlined cordless vacuums have supposedly become as powerful as uprights. These handhelds are also some of the cheapest and most versatile vacuum cleaners on the market. If you’re thinking about getting a Dyson, the cordless models are a great starting point. They’re based on the same technology as the original upright Dysons, and older models can be super affordable. The secret? Go with a basic model, and get a refurbished unit. Although this sounds obvious, buying a refurbished Dyson can be an especially great deal, given the huge price difference. Currently, the cheapest Dyson handheld on the market is the Dyson V6. While Dyson sells these cordless vacuums for $300, you can find certified refurbished models for as little as $150. Buying the refurbished unit means you’ll get a six-month limited warranty instead of the standard two- to five-year Dyson warranty. Dyson refurbishes these vacuums in house, and they’re supposed to perform just as well as the regular units. You can drive down the price slightly more if you buy a refurbished Dyson Trigger, which is basically just the vacuum part of the handheld, and then add generic brand accessories, as you need them. And if you can wait another year, you could see Dyson release a new handheld and then the prices of older models will shift down again. Why Not Dyson? You don’t need a Dyson. They’re great vacuum cleaners, sure, but the technology also isn’t not quite as novel as it was 20 years ago. Dysons also aren’t perfect. The vacuums famously don’t require a filter, but that means that debris can get caught in the air channels, causing clogs. This leads to the dreaded “Dyson pulsing” problem you’ll see people complain about online. Sure, the clogs can be cleared, but it’s evidence that those very expensive Dyson vacuums are not invincible. Plenty of cheaper handheld vacuums will still suck up the dirt from your floor. While Dyson has fiercely protected— and even successfully sued rivals over —its patents on the dual cyclone technology, other companies now make Dyson lookalikes that offer similar performance at much lower prices. In the cordless arena, these stick vacuums are also bagless, also feature a handheld motor with a wand, and also come with myriad accessories. If you like the basic setup of a model like the Dyson V6, for instance, you might also like the $100 Dirt Devil Reach Max Multi. This Wirecutter favorite includes useful accessories like a brush roll that digs into carpets as well as a smaller, motorized brush for upholstery. The Devil even feels like a Dyson in how it navigates floors. The Bissell Multi Reach is more expensive at $200, although it almost looks like a Dyson clone with its pistol grip motor and cylindrical tank. Meanwhile, the Hoover React series and the Shark Ion vacuums also offer loads of accessories and suction, although some of these models cost just as much as a Dyson. At the end of the day, your budget and your preferences will decide which vacuum works best for you. If you’ve always wanted a Dyson, there are ways to get one without spending your lifesavings. If you just want a good versatile vacuum, the Dirt Devil is a decent option. If you can’t really be bothered anyways, brooms are cheap as hell.","Dyson is famous for making amazing vacuum cleaners that cost amazing amounts of money.

Andrew Freedman,"The ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday exceeded weather forecasters' expectations in nearly every way. It dumped more than a foot of snow on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including 16 inches in Islip, Long Island, and flooded parts of downtown Boston with a storm surge that sent water rising to historic levels. The storm got its name for the process known as bombogenesis, which describes a storm whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained On Thursday, the bomb cyclone intensified by 59 millibars in 24 hours, which is the fastest rate ever observed in any other winter storm along the East Coast since at least 1976, according to data from David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, and Andrea Lang, an assistant professor at the University of Albany. Lang said that research by her and Hannah Attard, a doctoral student in her research group, found 1,218 cyclones that originated north of 30 degrees North latitude and met the bombogenesis criteria in the Northern Hemisphere between 1980 and 2015. This indicates that meteorological bombs, so to speak, aren't that rare. ""What is uncommon is the rate of deepening for the 4 January cyclone,"" Lang said in an email. ""If you filter all 1218 cyclones that meet the 'bomb' criteria for those that occurred in a box just off the East Coast (60-80˚W and 30-55˚N) we find 23 'bomb' cyclones in the 1980-2015 reanalysis data."" ""This storm would be the new number 1 in terms of 24 hr mean sea level pressure fall... for storms on our list,"" she added. The intensification rate isn't just a bit of trivia for weather geeks, either. It had implications for the storm's impacts, primarily by accelerating the storm's winds. Winds gusted to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across Cape Cod and the Islands, and high winds raked everywhere from the Carolinas to Nova Scotia. This occurred because air was rushing in toward the center of the storm in response to the rapid drop in air pressure. Such winds helped drive the storm surge flooding that created so many problems in New England, too. The satellite imagery taken of the storm clearly shows how intense it became, as it even sported an eye-like feature near its center. Meteorologist Jeff Frame annotated an image to show all the meteorological features it revealed. There are many reasons why this storm intensified so quickly and significantly, with a minimum pressure eventually dropping to levels more typically seen in Category 2 or 3 hurricanes. For one, there were tremendous contrasts in air masses between cold, dry Arctic air pouring in from the northwest, and moisture-rich subtropical air streaming north over the Atlantic. ""There are several factors that contribute to the intensification of all cyclones, all of these factors were on the extreme side for this event,"" Lang said. ""All extratropical cyclones, which includes storms like nor'easters, form on boundaries between cold and warm air. However, not all nor'easters form when there is record-breaking cold air already in place along the east coast,"" she said. ""In general terms, the magnitude and scale of the temperature contrast is an indicator of energy available for cyclone intensification."" Zoomed-in satellite image of the eye-like feature in the 'bomb cyclone' on Jan. 4, 2018. Image: noaa Lang said that the southern location of the initial storm, which spun up near the coast of Florida, added more energy to the mix. ""The fact that the cyclone formed as far south as it did allowed the cyclone [to maintain] a link to the subtropics (nicely shown in the satellite imagery),"" she said. ""The subtropical link provided the cyclone with a source of fuel, in the form of water vapor, that fed the large field of precipitation and enhanced the storm strength."" While many of the East Coast's most memorable snowstorms also underwent bombogenesis, there was nothing typical about this particular weather bomb. And that's why satellite images of it have been saved to weather geek's hard drives, (and set as my new desktop background.) This storm was a beast, and looked absolutely gorgeous from space.","The ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday exceeded weather forecasters' expectations in nearly every way.

Some villagers said this was a ""wake up call"" as it was common practice to segregate menstruating girls. Cyclone Gaja is known to have killed at least 46 people in the coastal state. Menstruation is taboo in large parts of rural India. Women are traditionally believed to be impure during their periods.

Though there's little evidence showing that the planet is experiencing more cyclones and hurricanes, there is mounting evidence that illustrates these storms are growing stronger compared to storms in the 21st century.
What's more, cyclones, like any big storm today, can now carry more water: The world has warmed by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 Celsius, over the last century, and for every 1 degree C of warming, the atmosphere holds seven percent more water. 
Since the 1960s, only three tropical storms of category 3 or stronger have hit Mozambique, according to Weather.com.

NORIMITSU ONISHI,"At the house, his daughter confirmed that the man, Francisco Madjai Mussengere, had been killed by a collapsing roof, and had died waiting for an ambulance blocked by debris. He was 71, she said, adding, He was able to ride the public bus for free.
His oldest son, Elias Francisco, 39, was busy preparing a simple eulogy. In an old, worn notebook, he had recorded the important dates of his fathers life: 1981, arrived in Beira; 1988, joins the Zion Church; 1991-1999, serves as a church elder; 2016, elected pastor.
He had one wife, the son read, and left behind five children and 28 grandchildren.
The family lived not far from a brick factory where Mr. Mussengere had long worked as a supervisor, said the daughter, Graca Francisco. He had left the capital, Maputo, in 1981 to come to Beira to work at the factory.
But after he retired, the factory owner reneged on a promise to build Mr. Mussengere a proper home, she and her brothers said. Instead, he lived in a tiny cinder-block structure.
The unfulfilled dream of a cozy retirement home gnawed at Mr. Mussengere in recent years so much so that he had instructed his children to keep fighting for a new house in the event of his death.
Now, that house has killed him, Ms. Francisco said.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/mozambique-cyclone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,cyclone,1

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","If you live anywhere in the eastern U.S., you had a moment this winter when you just wished it was summer. Maybe it was during the polar vortex cold snap in January. Maybe it was after the bomb cyclone or during any of the endless nor’easters. Or perhaps it was when your baseball team’s games got snowed out in April. Well, congratulations. Your wish, uttered in those dark, cold days, came true. Rather than a nice prolonged spring—which is objectively the best season—the U.S. has jumped right into summer. From coast-to-coast, May has been extremely hot. With what National Weather Service program manager Victor Murphy dubbed “ blast furnace temps ” across the Lower 48, it’ll likely go down as the hottest May on record for the country. The past week has seen widespread heat records fall across the normally mild Midwest. Chicago topped out at 97 degrees Fahrenheit over Memorial Day weekend, good for its second-hottest May day on record. Minneapolis recorded its earliest 100 degree Fahrenheit temperature as well as its longest May stretch of 90+ degree Fahrenheit days. The remarkable heat comes just six weeks after the city saw nearly 15 inches of snow fall. It’s also miserably hot in locales more known for heat like the Southwest, where Phoenix is forecast to reach 103 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday. All told, the U.S. has seen 3,070 daily and 118 monthly high temperature records set for the month-to-date. In comparison, there have only been 119 daily low and six monthly lows, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. Preliminary data show that the average U.S. temperature for the month through May 28 was 64.6 degrees Fahrenheit, just 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit behind the hottest May on record: May 1934, which fell smack dab in the middle of the Dust Bowl. For the last two days in May, temperatures from Las Vegas to Columbus could see temperatures up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, which may be enough to drag this May to a new record. A big atmospheric pattern flip has brought about this unseasonably fast shift to summer. A record or near-record disruption of the polar vortex, a weather-driving phenomenon that lives in the layer above our atmosphere and generally keeps cold air trapped over the Arctic, occurred in February. Because the disruption was so severe, it kept rippling through the atmosphere for months on end. It was pegged as the culprit behind haywire winter weather as cold air spilled out of the Arctic and into the U.S. and Europe. This set-up continued to keep the U.S. chilly into April. In May, a big pattern shift occurred as the jet stream that normally keeps the polar vortex and its cold air trapped in the Arctic moved pretty far north. That shift has allowed warmer air more associated with the tropics to make its way to U.S. and usher in summer with a vengeance. Even with the calendar set to turn to June in a few days, the heat isn’t going to stop. The mercury is forecast to crack 110 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix for the first time this year on Sunday, starting “but it’s a dry heat” season. And hey, it could be worse.","If you live anywhere in the eastern U.S., you had a moment this winter when you just wished it was summer. Maybe it was during the polar vortex cold snap in January.

Mark Kaufman,"The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017. This number, however, is ""highly uncertain"" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A new study published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine puts that number at an estimated 4,645 — 70 times higher than the official estimate. ""Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,"" write the authors, led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. SEE ALSO: Puerto Ricans never know if they'll have power. This is how they're surviving. NOAA says that the storm, which caused some $90 billion in damage, is the third costliest in U.S. history. But it's the deadliest in over a century, since a hurricane pummeled Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing more than 6,000 people. Back then, both NOAA and the National Hurricane Center didn't exist, so people were largely unaware of the power brought by the coming cyclone. Puerto Rico knew what was coming, but the hurricane's wind and downpours ravaged the island's water system and electrical grid. The storm blew down more than 80 percent of the island's utility poles and transmission lines. ""Practically all cell phone service was lost and municipal water supplies were knocked out,"" said NOAA. While some fatalities were caused by drownings and people being carried away in unprecedented floodwaters, the researchers show that thousands more succumbed during the period between September 20 through December 31, 2017. Around a third of those died due to ""delayed or interrupted health care."" In the U.S., official deaths are documented by medical examiners, and in Puerto Rico, specifically, disaster-caused deaths are confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. This has proven difficult in Puerto Rico, the authors said, because the process often involves taking a dead body to be inspected in the capital. And the storm killed many people indirectly, such as from a lack of medical treatment for chronic disease. It can be challenging for medical examiners to identify such deaths as being cyclone-caused. NOAA satellite GOES-16 captures an image of Hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Image: cira/noaa For this reason, the researchers relied upon a survey of 3,299 randomly chosen homes all over Puerto Rico, asking residents about the causes of death and other factors, like whether or not they were forced to leave their houses. Only 7 percent of households involved did not complete the survey. Once the surveys were reviewed, the researchers compared the rate of deaths that occurred between September 20 and December 31 in 2016 and 2017, finding that there were more than 4,500 ""excess deaths"" in 2017 — i.e., deaths that would not have occurred without the devastating impacts of Hurricane Maria. ""These numbers will serve as an important independent comparison to official statistics from death-registry data, which are currently being reevaluated, and underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" write the authors. If the official government report approximates this latest estimate by researchers outside the government, it may persuade current and future U.S. lawmakers to address the aftermath of a tropical cyclone more promptly, and with a heightened awareness of the necessary resources. NOAA forecasts the coming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season to be ""active,"" with between five and nine hurricane-level storms.","The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017.

People living in one of Mozambique's largest cities have been warned to expect the ""worst-case scenario"" as a major cyclone makes landfall.
Cyclone Idai, which is carrying winds of up to 165km/h (103mph), is making landfall near the port of Beira.
A storm surge of at least six metres (20 feet) is expected near low-lying Beira, a city of 500,000 people, Météo France said.
Heavy rains have already killed about 100 people in Mozambique and Malawi.
Beira is the fourth largest city in Mozambique and its major port sits on the mouth of the Pungwe river, that runs to Zimbabwe.
Météo France, which monitors French territories in the Indian Ocean, said Idai was ""an extremely dangerous tropical cyclone"" packing a ""life-threatening"" storm surge of at least four metres along the coast, and six metres near the mouth of the Pungwe river near Beira.
The surge could be even higher because of high tide, Météo France warned.
The cyclone's late change of course meant that ""the worst case scenario is very likely"", it added.
Images posted on social media showed significant damage to Beira as the storm approached, with large trees uprooted. 
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.
Beira has often seen the brunt of the storms and has worked to limit the effects of rising waters brought about by climate change through a series of infrastructure projects.

Nicole Gallucci,"Snow may be dominating headlines in the wake of Thursday's "" bomb cyclone,"" but coastal flooding has proven to be another serious danger in places along the East Coast.

The resulting coastal flooding reached record levels in Boston, with severe flooding reported all along the coast. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained Flood waters took over sidewalks and streets, trapped cars, and shut down subway stations. The severity of the floods, which exceeded the region's benchmark storm of the Blizzard of 1978, was caused by a combination of high astronomical tides from Monday's supermoon, the timing of the storm that brought the strongest winds onto the coast at high tide, and a rising sea level over the past few decades.

 The storm had earlier caused destruction in Mozambique
A tropical storm has swept away bridges and homes in eastern Zimbabwe, killing at least 24 people, officials say.
Cyclone Idai cut off power and communications in parts of Manicaland province on the border with Mozambique. Some 40 people are missing.
People fled from their homes to the slopes of mountain and were waiting to be rescued, but strong winds have hampered helicopter flights.
In Mozambique, where Idai made landfall on Thursday, at least 19 people died.
Flooding across the rest of the country had already killed nearly 70 people before the storm's arrival.
Zimbabwe's information ministry said the town of Chimanimani had been cut from the rest of Manicaland province. The country's national army was leading the rescue efforts, it added.
The death toll was expected to rise as authorities continued to assess the situation.
Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said a ""serious humanitarian crisis [was] unfolding"" in the east of the country.
The cyclone hit Mozambique with winds of up to 177km/h (106 mph). It cut off more than 500,000 residents in the port city of Beira, one the country's largest cities. Roads were flooded and the airport was shut down.
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.

"Jennifer Gray, CNN","(CNN)While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over. 
The potential is there for a ""bomb cyclone"" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. 
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. 
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. 
Things begin to unravel Tuesday
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota.
Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes. 
Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions.
Thursday the bottom drops out
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours.
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis. 
Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous. 
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. 
On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms.
The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest
Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely. 
We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected. 
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding. 
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend. 
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Nearly half the flights at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and around a quarter of the flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were called off. The Newark airport also sidelined its AirTrain because of high winds and replaced it with shuttle buses. • More than 200,000 people were without power in Virginia, Dominion Energy reported, mostly in the northern part of the state. Forecasters were warning that other parts of the East Coast might lose power, too. • The National Weather Service said coastal flooding from high seas and storm surge could impact areas from New Jersey to Massachusetts, and warned of inland flooding from the heavy rains. • New York City and Long Island can expect heavy rain — an estimated two to three inches — and some snow mixed in, but the biggest concern will be the damaging winds in the afternoon and evening. Read more in New York Today. • Some communities in Massachusetts, including Scituate and Newburyport, urged residents to evacuate ahead of the storm. The state’s governor, Charlie Baker, warned Friday’s storm could be more severe than the Jan. 4 storm that brought historic flooding to the city. Another ‘bomb cyclone’ is expected. The dire warnings prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Governor Baker of Massachusetts said he had called in the National Guard. The Jan. 4 storm gained much attention in part because some meteorologists described it as a “bomb cyclone.” (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Meteorologists say the pressure in the center of this weekend’s storm will plummet so fast that it, too, is likely to become a bomb cyclone. Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Taunton, Mass., said the storm was essentially an area of low pressure that was moving northeast — strengthening and spiraling before it comes to a halt for about two days. While the system spins north, the strong winds will whip out around it, Ms. Buttrick said, churning up the seas and adding to the conditions that, along with “astronomically high tides” and other factors, could create the catastrophic flooding. Video The rising waters are looking ‘really bad’ near Boston. At Revere Beach, north of Boston, the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean was churning up on the shore on Friday morning, and threatening to flood homes and businesses along the beach. “The water is bad, really bad,” said Fernando Loaiza, the manager of Antonia’s restaurant. Motorists were inching slowly along the boulevard that runs the length of the beach. All along the Massachusetts coast, residents were bracing for high tides. Combined with buffeting winds, seas were expected to surge beyond the record-breaking levels of the Jan. 4 storm, which caused major damage. Already, high winds have taken down trees and branches, hurling them across train tracks and stalling subway and commuter trains, and power losses have been reported across the region. Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood and Katharine Q. Seelye from Boston; Matt Stevens and Alexandra S. Levine from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The East Coast is bracing for another nor’easter this week, with the National Weather Service in Boston warning that the city and nearby coastlines could see three to four feet of storm surge flooding. This, in the same winter that the bomb cyclone turned many of Boston’s streets into frozen soup. Parts of the Northeast are getting hammered by frigid temperatures right now, just 24 hours after a … Read more Read Is it the latest sign of the end times? Not really. Winter storms like nor’easters, it turns out, routinely deliver worse flooding than hurricanes to this part of the world, a reality confirmed by a study published earlier this year, the Washington Post ’s Capital Weather Gang noted today. Why’s that, you might ask? The reason has everything to do with the difference in how nor’easters and hurricanes form—a difference that allows nor’easters to maintain hurricane-like central pressures and rip-roaring winds at latitudes where their tropical cousins typically fizzle out. “By the time a hurricane gets off New England, it’s over very cold water and starts to decay,” Jeff Masters, meteorologist and blogger with Weather Underground, told Earther. Hurricanes get their strength from oceanic heat, forming in warm equatorial regions where there’s plenty of evaporating water to condense into storm clouds. Nor’easters get their energy from an entirely different source: as Masters put it, the contrast in density between warm, moist air from the ocean and cold, dry air from the land. When these contrasting air masses collide, the cold dry air sinks, and releases energy. The technical term for the atmospheric set-up that drives the formation of a nor’easter is ‘ baroclinic instability.’ Unlike hurricanes, which form and thrive in tropical waters and feature a warm core, nor’easters form at mid-latitudes, and their cores are cold. Because they don’t rely on ocean heat for their energy, they can maintain hurricane-like central pressures and wind strengths at latitudes where hurricanes struggle to. This can lead to some very bad flooding. “Occasionally you get a strong hurricane up there [in the northeast], but they’re pretty uncommon,” Masters said. “It’s the big ‘nor’easters that dominate the record storm surge,” for the region. Models are calling for this week’s nor’easter to deliver damaging winds, heavy rain, and snowfall to the Eastern seaboard beginning on Thursday night, although the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, the Weather Channel reports. A coastal flood watch is in effect from Friday morning through Saturday afternoon for eastern Massachusetts, with the NWS warning that “moderate to major” coastal flooding that could inundate roads and basements and tear up beaches. Coastal flood watches are also in effect for much of Delaware and New Jersey, and parts of Queens and Long Island. Exacerbating the flood risk is the fact that this storm is due to coincide with the astronomical high tide—the full moon rises tomorrow. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are perfectly aligned, the gravitational tug-of-war causes the most extreme tides of the month. The coastal flood risk is expected to persist over three high tide cycles, thanks to the long-lived nature of this storm. “All three tides are expected to be in the top ten on record [for Boston], maybe in the top five,” Masters said said. Lastly, just in case you thought we were going to get through an entire weather post without mentioning climate change, you should know that for nor’easters as for hurricanes, sea level rise is adding inches to storm surge and making the coastal flooding threat worse. A recent study in Nature found that sea levels along the northern half of the Eastern seaboard have risen about an inch per decade since 1980, three to four times the global average rate. “That makes it a lot easier to get a record-high water level causing substantial damage,” Masters said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over. A powerful storm is set to spin up in the Midwest this week. And if youre getting deja vu looking at the weather map up top, youre not alone.
The swirling mass of air forecast to blast the region with blustery winds, snow, and rain bears more than a passing resemblance to last months bomb cyclone that devastated the region. While this weeks storm might not be quite as strong, it will unleash a wave of misery in places still suffering from flooding.
The gnarly weather pattern will follow a similar evolution to last months bomb cyclone. A storm will come racing on the back of a strong jet stream dipping across the west through the first half of the week. As the jet stream swoops back up into the Midwest on Wednesday, it will pull ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico up to meet cold air from the north. Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota are all under winter storm watches. The contrasting air temperatures will have winds whipping up to 35 mph and six or more inches of snow are forecast, according to the National Weather Service. Other parts of the Upper Midwest could also see snow through Thursday before the storm swirls into the Ohio River Valley, and its extremely likely those winter storm watches could expand to other areas and be upgraded to warnings. Blizzard-like conditions are also possible, so it wouldnt be wholly shocking to see the National Weather Service issue blizzard warnings at some point either.
While the storm is no joke, its also not likely to be quite as potent as last months bomb cyclone, which arrived with hurricane-force winds and record-setting low pressure. Thats because the environment isnt as conducive to as powerful a storm this time around. The temperature gradient on either side of the fronta key ingredient for winter storms to bomb outwont be as extreme. That means this storm might not meet the textbook definition of a bomb cyclone, a term that applies to storms that see their central pressure drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. 
But textbook definitions aside, this storm poses a serious risk to the region still recovering from flooding last month. Data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows thatMidwest soil moisture levels are in the 99th percentile, which is to say that soils are extremely waterlogged. The new batch of rain and snow is like pouring a can of gas on a fire. Except instead of the flames rising higher, the water will. 
If youre wondering what climate change looks like, this is it. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, unleashing more deluges and with them, more floods. With saturated soil, water is once again expected to run off into rivers and streams, many of which are still swollen. In the Missouri River basin, 26 flood gaugesin NOAAs networkare in a state of major or moderate flooding. In the Upper Mississippi basin, 56 gauges are at those levels of flooding. The new influx of water will add to the flood woes and is likely to tip other gauges back toward moderate or major flooding.
That could add to the billions of dollars in losses and once again raise the specter of flooding at Superfund sites. And it will add to the slow moving torrent of water working down the Mississippi River toward the Gulf of Mexico. That wall of water is forecast to unleash historic flooding through May, according to NOAA.","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over.

 The storm is the second deadliest to hit the Philippines in 2018
More than 60 people have died after a powerful storm struck the Philippines, with locals reportedly taken by surprise by its strength.
Storm Usman hit the Bicol region southeast of capital Manila on Saturday.
At least 17 people are missing and the death toll is expected to rise.
One official told AFP news agency that people did not take precautions as it was not classed as a typhoon under the government's alert system.
""People were overconfident because they were on vacation mode and there was no tropical cyclone warning,"" Bicol civil defence director Claudio Yucot said.
Although the storm did not have strong winds, it brought heavy rains which triggered deadly landslides.
The tropical depression has destroyed infrastructure and displaced more than 40,000 people nationwide.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Florence is now a post-tropical cyclone, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday, adding that system continues to produce heavy rain over parts of the Mid-Atlantic region. Some strengthening is forecast on Tuesday and Wednesday as Florence transitions into an extratropical cyclone, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. The system is located about 85 miles (125 km) west-southwest of Morgantown, West Virginia with maximum sustained winds of 25 miles per hour (35 km per hour), the NHC said. Catastrophic flooding continues over the Carolinas while flash flooding could develop across parts of the Delmarva into Pennsylvania on Monday, it said.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities. The latest areas under scrutiny are Superfund sites, whose toxic pollutants can be spread far and wide by floodwaters.
 Currently on the radar for federal and state officials are seven Superfund sites and a landfill across Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri, states that are still experiencing some minor to major flooding as of Thursday. These are some of the most contaminated sites in the U.S., and when floodwaters hit them, they can become major threats to human and environmental health if their pollutants travel off site, as was seen in Houston after Hurricane Harvey.
Superfund sites contain some of the most dangerous chemicals known to humankind, Jacob Carter, a research scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists Center for Science and Democracy, told Earther.
Thats why the Environmental Protection Agency is nowmonitoring a bunch of Superfund sites closely, although so far, it seems to think all of them are doing okay.
The EPA has taken action on two Superfunds in particular, it announced Tuesday: Nebraska Ordnance Plant, a former munitions production plant in Mead, Nebraska, and Conservation Chemical Corporation in Kansas City, Missouri, which used to store chemicals. The agency hasnt spotted any contaminant releases at either, but floodwaters did hit them hard.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
The EPA told Earther italso flagged another two sites in Iowa with water on the property that didnt require actionthe Railroad Avenue Groundwater Contamination Site in West Des Moines and the Mid-America Tanning Company Site near Sergeant Bluff. The Lawrence Todtz Farm Site in Iowawasnt flooded, but its been made inaccessible due to the flooding, so the EPA is also monitoring it. And the EPA, in coordination with state environmental agencies, is keeping tabs on another two Superfund sites in Nebraskawhere the flooding has paused clean up activities, as well as a landfill in the City of St. Joseph in Missouri that isnt a Superfund. 
The Nebraska Ordnance Plant, which sits in the states still slightly-flooded southeast corner, has its soil and groundwater contaminated with potentially carcinogenic substances like trichloroethene (or TCE), as well as explosives. The facility saw its groundwater treatment plant and extraction wells, which help remove the TCE, temporarily shut down because authorities couldnt access them and to avoid any treated water from mixing with the floodwaters. They are all back up and running now.
This is only one of the facilities the state of Nebraska is monitoring. Others will still require close attention as the floodwaters recedeespecially if anything strange turns up in the states drinking water.
Right now, a combination of flood waters and damaged roads are keeping responders from a few of Nebraska Superfund Sites for inspection. Those sites have not been fully evaluated yet, Amanda Woita, a public information officer with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), told Earther in an email. DEQs primary responsibility is protecting public health. That includes testing drinking water and assessing other important infrastructure, such as community drinking water wells and sewage treatment plants. The department is in that phase right now. 
Back in Missouri, the Conservation Chemical Corporations soil and groundwater are also contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals like benzene and TCE. The site experienced flooding, but the EPA reports that it didnt stop its clean-up operations in response. Instead, more groundwater was extracted to help keep pace with the floodwaters. 
Half of Missouris St. Joseph City Landfill has become flooded, according to Brian Quinn, the information officer for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. He told Earther in an email that the non-hazardous landfill was last inspected in January 2018, and the department will conduct another investigation once the waters recede to make sure the asphalt and soil cap covering the garbage is still in place.
All in all, the EPA hasnt issued any public health alerts or advisories in wake of these floods, the agency told Earther. But there could still be trouble as the floodwaters migrate farther down the Mississippi River in Missouri. John Hickey, the executive director of the states Sierra Club chapter, is worried that the many coal ash disposal sites in the eastern portion of the state along the Mississippi could pose a threat if floodwaters breach them. Coal ash landfills and ponds often contain heavy metals like lead and mercury, which are hazardous to human health. Similar flooding concerns were raised in North Carolina in wake of Hurricane Florence last year. 
 But the Superfund sites that have already experienced flooding worry Hickey, too.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river, Hickey told Earther. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
Americans experienced that reality firsthand in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey damaged 13 Superfund sites in Texas, leading to mass contamination from one site alone. It took the EPA eight months to begin cleaning up that site, the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, and cleanup is slated to go on another year or more. Then, there was Hurricane Maria, which flooded a lead-contaminated Superfund in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, leaving residents worried about contamination long after the natural disaster.

As Carter noted, low-income communities and people of color tend to be closest to these facilities, so theyre the most at risk. 
These are some of the most disenfranchised communities in the United States, he told Earther. [They] dont have a ton of power in the United States, and they will be the ones impacted by this flooding at Superfund sites.
The EPA is well aware of the threat that floodingwhich is set to intensify in the Midwest in a warmer worldposes to these sites. Its Climate Adaptation Plan published in 2014 makes this clear: Inundation and flooding may lead to transport of contaminants through surface soils, ground water, surface waters, and/or coastal waters. 
Former President Barack Obama issued an executive order that wouldve required all federal departments, including those that manage Superfunds, prepare for future flood risks. President Donald Trump, predictably, rescinded it. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations spring flood outlook, heavier than usual rainfall is set to bring historic, widespread flooding to the Midwest through May.
Whether or not the latest bout of floods caused any Superfund sites to spread their contaminants, it seems clear these sites will only become more vulnerable. We better ready up.
Correction: An earlier version of this post indicated that eight Superfund sites have dealt with floodwaters. One of those sites, a landfill, is not actually a Superfund. The text and headline have been updated accordingly. We have also updated to clarify that the Nebraska Ordnance Plant was shut down to avoid treated water from mixing with floodwaters in addition to access issues.","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Historic flooding has followed in the wake of the bomb cyclone that rammed into the central U.S. this week, with USA Today reporting that Nebraska experienced what may be the worst floods in half a century. Flooding has continued in swathes of Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska, according to CNN.
A bomb cyclone occurs whenas happened last week when a storm that began to form in the Southwest swept across the Central U.S.pressure drops dramatically in a short period of time, a phenomenon known as explosive bombogenesis. Its rare for one to happen in the inland U.S., and this weeks storm resulted in severe weather across a massive stretch of the country.
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts characterized the situation on Friday as historic flooding and extreme weather in nearly every region of the state. Flood teams throughout Nebraska have been rescuing stranded civilians since Thursday, CNN wrote.
CNN added that one man in the state, Columbus farmer James Wilke, received a distress call, headed out on his tractor, and died when a bridge collapsed:
According to CNN affiliate KMTV, a close family friend posted on social media about his last moments.
It is no surprise to anyone that knew James that when he got the phone call to assist emergency responders ... his answers would be yes, Jodi L. Hefti wrote on Facebook.
With the guidance of emergency responders, James drove his tractor over the Shell Creek bridge on the Monestary Road and the bridge gave out. James and the tractor went down into the flood water below.
Some 15 members of a Platte Valley rescue team, which was assisting residents around King Lake, were stranded until Nebraska National Guard troops rescued them with a Black Hawk helicopter. At least four Nebraska state highways were washed out or damaged, USA Today wrote.
Altogether, the paper reported, disaster declarations had been in effect in 41 cities and 53 of Nebraskas 93 counties. Two additional people are missing and around 900 had to take refuge in temporary shelters.
While flood warnings and advisories remained in effect on Saturday in parts of the eastern Nebraska, Iowa, and southern Wisconsin, according to the National Weather Services Weather Prediction Center, much of the worst is over except along areas adjacent to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries. Numerous locations in those regions will continue to have major to historic flooding for at least into early next week thanks to heavy rainfall earlier this week falling on frozen ground and a deep snow pack that lead to intense and quick melting, the center wrote.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When last weeks bomb cyclone hit the Midwest, it was hard to imagine the inundation it could bring amid whiteout conditions and more than a foot of snow. But the warm weather that wrapped in behind it quickly melted out all that white stuff and unleashed historic flooding across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri.
Floodwaters have worked their way down the rivers that run like arteries through the region, overtop the banks of the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, and more. Dams have been destroyed, bridges and other infrastructure have been washed away, and small towns have been cut off from the outside world, surrounded by moats of muddy water. The flooding has also paralyzed the various military bases scattered across the region, with waters lapping up against Fort Leavenworth and Offutt Air Force Base, home U.S. Strategic Command. As Task and Purpose helpfully notes, that means the base that oversees the Pentagons nuclear strategic deterrence and global strike capabilities is largely underwater. 
The situation also neatly illustrates how climate changewhich is leading to more intense precipitationis a threat multiplier.
As of Monday, nine flood gauges operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remained at major flood stage with another 17 in moderate flood stages. While the on-the-ground photos show the human toll of the floods, satellites are the best way to get a handle on the full scope of whats happening in the Midwest. Below are before and after images captured by the European Space Agencys Sentinel satellites.

Michael Roberts,"The much-hyped bomb cyclone that hit Denver yesterday, March 13, packed a considerable punch, and it proved deadly for Colorado State Patrol Corporal Daniel Groves, who was struck and killed on I-76 while helping a motorist just after 11 a.m. Governor Jared Polis has ordered flags statewide to be flown at half-staff in Groves's honor until after his thus-far unscheduled memorial service.
The snow totals recorded by the National Weather Service don't compare to those posted during most of the entries on our list of Denver's ten most spectacular snowstorms: Denver International Airport (where all six runways were closed yesterday afternoon; four have reopened, but 662 flights have already been canceled) measured 7.1 inches. But high winds made driving a nightmare, particularly on the eastern side of the metro area, and roads are still closed across the plains. Those winds also caused a rash of power outages. This morning, there's still no juice at thousands of Colorado homes.
An update from Xcel Energy noted that as of 7 p.m. last night, service had been restored to approximately 235,000 customers, and efforts were being made to do likewise for another 165,000, with crews assigned to toil through the night.
Continue Reading""Restoring power is our main focus to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and customers — it is of paramount importance,"" said Xcel Energy-Colorado president Alice Jackson in a statement. ""We will continue to diligently work to restore electric service throughout Colorado as quickly and as safely as possible. As we all have experienced today, this storm has brought dangerous conditions, including high winds and road closures, which have slowed restoration efforts.""
To speed the company toward this goal, around 150 Xcel Energy employees working for the firm in states to Colorado's north are being transported here and should be on the job today.
In the meantime, though, plenty of folks in metro Denver remain without power.
The image at the top of this post is a screen capture from Xcel's online electric-outage map, grabbed around 5:15 a.m. on the 14th. The circled numbers correspond to the number of outages in a given area, and the digits change as a user zooms in and out.
In a wider-angle view, central Denver shows a cumulative 167 outages affecting 6,233 people. Near the nexus of Interstate 25 and Interstate 70, there are 96 outages listed, impacting 3,236 people. Near Edgewater, the figures are 81 outages that are keeping 2,017 folks in the dark.
A closer look at downtown Denver, as seen in the second graphic here (it's from 5:20 a.m.), allows visitors to drill down even further into outages. For instance, there are a slew of outages in the City Park West and North Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Some affect single homes, while one has resulted in an interruption of service for 174 people. Around 105 people living near Coors Field are also energy-free according to the map, and 947 people living near Downing west of Cheesman Park are experiencing the same situation.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The massive, dangerous bomb cyclone that barreled into the central United States this week hit as hard as its name would imply on Wednesday, CNN reported, with law enforcement officials in some areas forced to take shelter instead of assisting motorists involved in collisions.
This particular storm began far west, where moisture from the Pacific headed into the Southwest. As it pushed into the Central U.S., it grew in strength and its pressure dropped dramaticallya phenomenon known as explosive bombogenesis, hence the term bomb cycloneas it cycled moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico into contact with freezing air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. This particular phenomenon normally does not happen inland, and is more common on the East Coast.
Per CNN, an estimated 1,100 motorists were stranded throughout Colorado, with Wellington Fire Protection reporting a single incident in which 100 vehicles were involved in a pileup on Interstate 25. On the streets of Denver, some 125 accidents were reported. A Colorado State Patrol corporal was struck by a vehicle in Weld County while assisting another motorist who had driven off Interstate 76, losing his life.
Snowfall in parts of Colorado closed in on 20 inches as of 10:45 p.m. local time, according to ABC 7, though totals were wildly variable across the state.
While Colorado is one of the hardest-hit areas, the winter storm is huge and has caused hurricane-force winds over a massive area, with a train actually derailing in the northeastern New Mexico town of Logan, CNN wrote:
The storm is bringing hurricane winds to the Rockies and as far away as Amarillo, Texas. Winds gusts equivalent to Category 1 and 2 hurricane winds were reported at the Denver International Airport and in Colorado Springs, the National Weather Service.
In New Mexico, heavy winds contributed to the derailment of a 26-car train near the village of Logan, according to a tweet from state police. No injuries were reported.
78 mile per hour winds were reported as far south as Dallas, the Washington Post wrote, where an Amazon warehouse near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had its roof shorn off. A record-setting 80 mph gust was reported at Denver International Airport, which was shut down for the vast majority of air traffic.
The weather is finally settling down in New Mexico, KQRE reported, though gusting winds were the biggest problem on Wednesday. Los Alamos Police Commander Preston Bellew told the station that I know guys who have lived and worked here their whole lives and they have not seen the powerful winds, snow drifts, and the snow all in such a short period of time.
Heavy snow was reported in northern Colorado, including Denver, western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming, central South Dakota, and southeastern North Dakota, according to Accuweather. Blizzard conditions remained a danger in the northeastern part of Colorado as of late Wednesday night.
There is a considerable risk of flooding as precipitation continues and snow melts in the Midwest and Great Plains regions. There is also a risk of avalanches in mountainous regions that received heavy snowfall.
The South is not being spared, either. The Storm Prediction Center wrote that parts of the Mississippi River Valley, including eastern Arkansas, southwest Tennessee, and the northwest corner of Mississippi would be considered at enhanced risk for severe weather as the storm moves east, the Post noted. The paper added that reports indicate severe thunderstorms may still occur on a cold front stretching from Mississippi and Alabama to Southern Michigan on Thursday. According to CNN, the storm is forecast to rapidly intensify overnight east of the Colorado Rockies and bring extreme weather to the Midwest on Thursday.
By late on Thursday, however, the storm is expected to weaken considerably on its route towards northeastern Canada (where it will end up on Friday). States in the East should expect some rain.

Agence France-Presse,"“It was very scary, we were running in all direction, the water was full of snakes,” recalls 39-year-old Otelea Jose after arriving from one of the areas worst hit by southern Africa’s deadly cyclone.
Jose had been in Buzi, home to nearly 120,000 people, and moved to higher ground fleeing the raging flood waters unleashed by powerful cyclone Idai 10 days ago. 
But soon it was not high enough. 
She survived by scaling onto the roof of a local administrator’s office, but 446 other of her compatriots were not so lucky.
Authorities fear the toll will be more than 1,000 in one of the worst storms to hit southern Africa.
Jose lives in Beira, which was also smashed by Idai, but had gone to Buzi to visit her mother. 
Now she has to check if her husband, left behind in Beira, is safe.
She spoke at Beira port just after disembarking from a boat from Buzi where many people had by the weekend started picking up pieces of their lives as the waters receded and the sun came out.
Survivors are not only dealing with immediate needs of food, shelter and healthcare.
Joaquin Joao Chidja, 16, managed to salvage prized possessions: family photos. He dries them on the roof of a commercial building where he climbed when flood waters rapidly rose.
- ‘Water covered everything’ -
Joao Zakaria, 42, is still haunted by the viciousness of the cyclone which also left a trail of destruction in neighbouring Zimbabwe where more than 250 people were killed, and bridges and roads ripped apart.
There are “lots of dead (people), we can’t even count”, he says.
Zakaria vividly remembers the velocity of the water as it swept past his neighbourhood and mourns on behalf of his neighbour.
“There was a man, he had 40 cows and he lost all of them. Forty! Imagine. Everybody lost everything,”he says.
The father of four, who survived by climbing up a tree, remembers the floods back in the year 2000 that claimed 800 lives, saying that was nothing compared to Idai.
“I have never seen anything like that, even the elders have never experienced something like that, it’s new.
“ In 2000 there was flooding but (the water) was up to the shoulder-level only. 
“But this time ...the water covered everything,” he says. 
But as a rainbow appears in the sky, more people start to venture outside into the wet and muddy streets of Buzi -- 30 kilometres southwest of Beira -- to try pick up pieces of their lives.
Some mop thick layers of mud off the floors of their homes while others dry wet laundry on sagging electricity power lines that were blown down by the force of the cyclone which produced wind gusts of close to 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph).
Around 2,000 people have been rescued from Buzi, a town which aid agencies feared had been wipped out by the floods.

Miriam Kramer,"There are plenty of terms meteorologists use to describe storm systems. From ""atmospheric river"" to ""jet streak,"" meteorologists love to label weather phenomena in colorful and sometimes goofy ways. (Here's looking at you, "" vorticity lobe."") But perhaps the most exotic-sounding and useful weather term floating around these days is ""bombogenesis."" SEE ALSO: Upcoming nor'easter could be even worse than the 'Bomb Cyclone' While it sounds like a band name or a fancy new video game console, bombogenesis is really just a fancy way of saying that an area of low pressure is rapidly intensifying. Specifically, to qualify as a ""weather bomb,"" the minimum central pressure of a storm must drop by at least 24 millibars within 24 hours. Some storms meet or exceed this threshold. One of the best examples of this kind of rapid intensification was the ""Bomb Cyclone"" that hit the East Coast of the in early January 2018. That storm intensified 59 millibars in 24 hours, which was the fastest intensification rate ever observed in a winter storm in that part of the world since at least the mid-1970s, according to data from David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, and Andrea Lang, an assistant professor at the University of Albany. Bombogenesis is a fairly rare occurrence, happening in a particular region in the northern mid-latitudes, such as the Northeast, a few times a season. Such intense, large-scale storms are more common in the U.S. during fall, winter and spring. Storms that ""bomb out"" are typically accompanied by strong winds, since air rushes from higher to lower pressure, as well as heavy precipitation. For example, a storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in early March 2018 was undergoing bombogenesis. It knocked out power to hundreds of thousands in the Washington, D.C. area due to strong winds in excess of 60 miles per hour, and also brought hurricane force winds to Cape Cod and the Islands. Zoomed-in satellite image of the eye-like feature in the 'bomb cyclone' on Jan. 4, 2018. Image: NOAA The storms that go through this process are fueled by intense air and moisture contrasts, such as the presence of a polar air mass across the northeastern U.S., and a warm and moist air mass sitting over the Gulf Stream waters. Aided by jet stream winds and areas of atmospheric spin, these storms can generate a lot of lift, which is a trigger for heavy rain and snow. East Coast blizzards tend to be weather bombs, as are some of the more intense North Atlantic and North Pacific winter storms. Such a storm recently caused damage in Newfoundland, where winds exceeded 100 miles per hour. That storm featured a staggering 42 millibar pressure drop in 24 hours, which helps explain the strong winds. And in the U.K., winter storm Doris rapidly intensified, too, causing damage as well. Because bombogenesis often occurs over the oceans, the National Weather Service's Ocean Prediction Center maintains one of the best catalogs of weather bomb animations. They reveal how these storms are shape shifters, going from relatively innocuous-looking spins to full-fledged, backwards shaped commas. So remember, the next time you hear the word ""bombogenesis,"" or a storm referred to as a weather ""bomb,"" it means you should take that storm seriously.","There are plenty of terms meteorologists use to describe storm systems.

Farai Mutsaka and Andrew Meldrum,"CHIMANIMANI, Zimbabwe -- Aid workers rushed to rescue victims clinging to trees and crammed on rooftops Tuesday after a cyclone unleashed devastating floods in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. More than 350 people were confirmed dead, hundreds were missing and thousands more were at risk.
In Mozambique, the rapidly rising floodwaters created ""an inland ocean,"" endangering tens of thousands of families, aid workers said as they scrambled to rescue survivors and airdrop, food, water and blankets to survivors of Cyclone Idai.
""This is the worst humanitarian crisis in Mozambique's recent history,"" said Jamie LeSueur, head of response efforts for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi said late Tuesday more than 200 people had been confirmed dead in his country. Earlier he said the death toll could reach 1,000.
At least 400,000 people were left homeless.
In Zimbabwe's eastern mountain areas bordering Mozambique, residents struggled to cope with the disaster.
""There was a house there, it was buried and the owners may have been buried with it. They are missing,"" said Zacharia Chinyai of the Zimbabwean border town of Chimanimani, who lost 12 relatives in the disaster.
The cyclone took residents by surprise, Chinyai said.
""We heard news on the radio"" about the flooding in neighbouring Mozambique, he said. ""But we never thought we could also be victims. ... No one told us it was going to be this devastating.""
Chipo Dhliwayo lost her daughters, 4-year-old Anita and 8-year-old Amanda.
""I wasn't able to save anything except this baby,"" she said of her lone surviving child, a 6-month-old son, who suffered an eye injury and scars to his face.
The family was sleeping when theit house collapsed, the 30-year-old said.
""Trees, rocks and mud were raining on us. I grabbed my son, my husband took Anita and we ran to a hut, but that also collapsed. Anita died there,"" she said.
Amanda was trapped in the rubble of their house and her body was not found until the next day.
""I knew she was already dead. I cried the whole night,"" Dhliwayo said. ""I lost so much that I wish I had just died.""
The cyclone created southern Africa's most destructive flooding in 20 years, said emergency workers. Heavy rains were expected to continue through Thursday.
Mozambique's Pungue and Buzi rivers overflowed, creating ""inland oceans extending for miles and miles in all directions,"" said Herve Verhoosel of the World Food Program.
""This is a major humanitarian emergency that is getting bigger by the hour,"" Verhoosel said.
He said people were ""crammed on rooftops and elevated patches of land.""
""People visible from the air may be the lucky ones and the top priority now is to rescue as many as possible,"" he said.
Many areas remained impassible. With key roads washed away, aid groups were trying to get badly needed food, medicine and fuel into the hard-hit city of Beira, on Mozambique's coast, by air and by sea.
""It's dire,"" Caroline Haga of the Red Cross told The Associated Press from Beira, a city of 500,000. ""We did an aerial surveillance yesterday and saw people on rooftops and in tree branches. The waters are still rising and we are desperately trying to save as many as possible.""
Satellite images were helping the rescue teams target the most critical areas, Haga said. Rescue operations were based at Beira airport, one of the few places in the city with working communications.
The waters flooded a swath of land more than 150 square miles (290 square kilometres) in central Mozambique, according to the European Union's global observation program, which was mapping the crisis, putting more than 100,000 people at risk.
""The full horror, the full impact is only going to emerge over coming days,""Red Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane told reporters in Geneva.
Thousands of homes were destroyed in Beira, and the city and surrounding areas were without power and nearly all communication lines were destroyed. Beira's main hospital was badly damaged, and in large areas flood waters completely covered homes, telephone poles and trees, the Red Cross said.
Beira could face a ""serious fuel shortage"" in coming days, the WFP said, and its power grid was expected to be non-functional through the end of the month.
In Zimbabwe the death toll was 98 but expected to rise, a local government minister, July Moyo, said.
He said bodies of Zimbabweans had been reported floating all the way into Mozambique. ""Some of the peasants in Mozambique were calling some of our people to say, 'We see bodies, we believe those bodies are coming from Zimbabwe,""' Moyo said.
Among those fleeing Chimanimani on foot was Luckmore Rusero, who carried a small bag with his remaining possessions. His wife carried their 1-year-old while their 11-year-old son struggled to keep pace as they joined many others in seeking refuge.
""Thank God we survived. There are no roads, no transport, so we have been walking for more than 20 kilometres now through the forests and the mountains,"" Rusero said.
Some escaped with nothing but their lives.
""I fled naked,"" said Tecla Chagwiza, whose home in Chimanimani was destroyed, ""I only received clothes in the morning from well-wishers who are also helping me with food.""
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa arrived in the flooded area on Tuesday and was expected to fly by helicopter to disaster sites on Wednesday. He said the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania and Angola, were offering aid.
The European Union and Britain also pledged aid, and the U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe said the U.S. was ""mobilizing to provide support"" to partners in the three affected countries, but provided no details.
Malawi's government confirmed 56 deaths, three missing and 577 injured in the flooding, which caused rivers to burst their banks, leaving many houses submerged and around 11,000 households displaced in the southern district of Nsanje.

Miriam Kramer,"We all know about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the extreme, Earth-sized storm that's been swirling on the huge planet for decades. But what about the world's other, less well known tempests? A series of studies published in the journal Nature this week reveal new discoveries about the way that Jupiter's atmosphere functions and the storms that swirl within it. In particular, one of the studies details the nature of the cyclones spinning in the clouds of Jupiter's north and south poles. SEE ALSO: This is what Jupiter sounds like In the planet's north pole, one large cyclone is surrounded by eight other polar cyclones, and a large south polar cyclone is encircled by five cyclones, according to the new study produced using data from NASA's Jupiter-exploring Juno probe. A computer-generated image showing Jupiter's south pole. Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM ""Prior to Juno we did not know what the weather was like near Jupiter's poles. Now, we have been able to observe the polar weather up-close every two months,"" Alberto Adriani, Juno co-investigator, and lead author of the cyclone study, said in a statement. ""Each one of the northern cyclones is almost as wide as the distance between Naples, Italy and New York City — and the southern ones are even larger than that. They have very violent winds, reaching, in some cases, speeds as great as 220 mph (350 kph). Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, they are very close together and enduring. There is nothing else like it that we know of in the solar system."" That's for sure. Jupiter's storms are complex beasts that defy explanation at this point. The dynamics of the storms in the south and north poles of the world are mysterious, and scientists aren't sure how they formed or how they have persisted. Even Saturn's storms aren't a good proxy for the dynamics at play on Jupiter. Saturn actually has one hexagon-shaped storm at each pole, so why does Jupiter have more than one and why don't they merge together? It's also odd that the cyclones at the north and south pole on Jupiter aren't the same. ""The Juno observations so far provide concrete evidence that the Jovian poles display multitudes of structure at its poles, but that structure is not identical at both poles, even though the stability and structures have remained stable over 11-months,"" planetary scientist Padma Yanamandra-Fisher, who wasn't an author on the new study, said via email. ""How? Why? These are questions that will engage Jovian researchers for years to come."" In general, storms on Jupiter are pretty badass. A storm called the North North Temperate Little Red Spot 1 is 3,700 miles across. Yes, a storm that's over 3,000 miles across — which is roughly the distance from California to New York — is considered ""little"" on Jupiter. The huge planet's storms can also swirl for years and years because Jupiter, unlike Earth, doesn't have any continents that would break up airflow feeding these tempests.","We all know about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the extreme, Earth-sized storm that's been swirling on the huge planet for decades.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It feels like 2018 is the year of rapid intensification. Storm after storm after storm has spun up from humble begins to cyclonic monster around the world. The latest cyclone to join the ignominious club is Typhoon Yutu which is in the midst of spinning up into a forecast Category 5 super typhoon by Wednesday. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands lie squarely in the typhoons path. Yutu spent all of Tuesday ramping up and as of the latest Joint Typhoon Warning Center bulletin, it had estimated winds of 127 mph. Thats the equivalent of a very strong Category 3 storm, and with nothing but warm water in its path, Yutu is expected to continuing amping up. The storms winds could be roaring around 155 mph as it approaches Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands on Thursday morning local time. The National Weather Service Guam office has posted a typhoon warning calling for powerful surf and up to half a foot of rain. The hilly terrain of Guam will be but a speed bump for Yutu, which is forecast to keep climbing in intensity through the end of the week. Its winds could reach an astounding 172 mph, which would put it among the strongest storm on Earth this year. Thankfully, it will achieve that terrifying feat over open water with no threat to land. Some weather experts have been watching the storm via satellite and wondering if the official forecast is a bit underdone and if Yutu could be more intense than current estimates. Thats because theres a subjective element involved. Satellites dont measure storms wind speeds directly, but provide a snapshot of convection and the processes that indicate how healthy a storm is. Meteorologists use that data to estimate wind speeds using something called the Dvorak technique. Without getting into a bunch of equations, suffice to say forecasters use what the satellite imagery reveals about convection, temperatures within the storm, and a few other factors to come up with a T number, which can be translated into an estimated wind speed. The technique is super useful for remote parts of the Pacific that dont have the benefit of estimates from aircraft like the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administrations Hurricane Hunters. And Chris Velden, a hurricane expert at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), told Earther that using the technique gets the mean state right most of the time, but it can break down when you have anomalous conditions like a very rapidly intensifying storm or decaying storm. Yutu is one of those storms, and while Velden said he felt the current official forecast was pretty spot-on, that doesnt mean the storm wont continue to push the limits of whats possible. This has potential to grow into a Category 5 real quickly, he said. People at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center are watching this. They know what theyre doing.",It feels like 2018 is the year of rapid intensification. Storm after storm after storm has spun up from humble begins to cyclonic monster around the world.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years. This week, we can add another one to the list.
Typhoon Wutip formed and brushed Guam late last week. That alone made it an oddity in terms of timing and location. But rather than weakening as forecast, the storm blew up into a Category 5 monster over the weekend. That makes Wutip the first Category 5 storm of any kindtyphoon, cyclone, or hurricaneever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere in February.
When we covered Wutip on Friday, all forecasts pointed to the storm wimping out over the weekend. Instead, the storm exploded into a super typhoon, a storm with winds in excess of 150 mph, on Saturday into early Sunday morning. Its sustained winds leaped from from 125 mph to 160 mph in just 12 hours with gusts reaching up to 180 mph, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That put it well above the previous February record holder, Super Typhoon Higos, which saw winds top out at 150 mph winds in February 2015. It also made Wutip the first February Category 5-equivalent storm to form not just in the Pacific but anywhere in the northern hemisphere.
Wutip also looked the part, with satellite imagery straight out of central casting. The storm had a wide and symmetrical eye at its peak. Both are characteristics of an annular cyclone, storms that tend to be exceptionally strong and usually form over open water. 
Typhoon Wutip as of Tuesday afternoon in a slightly less formidable state.
GIF: Colorado State University
The storm has since weakened as it chugs toward the Philippines, but what caused the power up seems to have been a bit of meteorological luck. The normal recipe for rapid intensification is weak upper level winds and ocean waters warmer than 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). Those conditions are rare in the northern hemisphere in February, though El Niñowhich is currently in effectdoes tilt the odds towards them slightly in parts of the Pacific. In the case of Wutip, upper level winds were moderate and sea surface temperatures were around 29 degrees Celsius (84.2 degrees Fahrenheit), which was slightly warmer than normal.
Not prohibitive for rapid intensification, but also not a slam dunk. It appears Wutip simply beat the odds.","We’ve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

Andrew Liszewski,"If something runs on batteries, youll find a battery meter somewhere on it. Your smartphone, your vape; even batteries themselves can tell you how close they are to dying. So why am I excited about Dysons inclusion of a redesigned battery meter on its new V11 cordless vacuum? It finally alleviates the anxieties of not knowing when its going to suddenly run out of power while youre in the middle of cleaning up a mess.
The V11 actually brings a handful of useful improvements to the Cyclone V10 Dyson introduced last year, while not changing much in terms of its overall hardware design. Its powered by Dysons new V11 digital motor which spins at the same speed as the V10 did (a peppy 125,000 RPM) but Dyson claims it has improved airflow and suction with redesigned blades.
1 / 4
The Cyclone V10 used a simple sliding switch to toggle between cleaning modes, which is what Dyson has included on its cordless vacuums since they were first introduced. But the V11 upgrades this to a single button and a small LCD screen on the back thats always visible while youre cleaning. It provides info on the vacuums status, when to clean the filter, and more detailed warnings about problems like blockages, with suggestions on how to fix them. But it also makes it easier to tell which cleaning mode you are using.
In addition to the V11's max-power Boost mode and its low-power, battery-saving Eco mode, Dyson is adding a new Auto mode that sits somewhere between the other two. Working in conjunction with a redesigned floor cleaning attachment that can detect when its being used on hard surfaces or varying levels of thick carpet, in Auto mode the Dyson V11 will automatically adjust the intensity of its suction on the fly so its only at max power for as long as it needs to be.
Its a welcome improvement to Dysons handheld vacuums because with previous iterations, Id often find myself increasing power when maneuvering onto carpet, and then forgetting to turn the suction power back down after, which quickly kills the battery. The Dynamic Load Sensor, as Dyson calls it, worked well enough on the small section of flooring that was provided for testing, but I do wish the feature worked with any of V11's cleaning attachments. For now its dependent on, and limited to, the floor cleaning head.
So why am I most excited about the addition of a better battery meter? With last years Cyclone V10, Dyson also revealed the company was stopping production of corded vacuums altogether, which was mostly a good decision because cords are annoying. But batteries are still far from perfect, and in a high-drain device like a vacuum cleaner, even a beefy lithium power cell can be quickly drained. On the Cyclone V10, battery life was indicated using a series of three LED lights that would turn off, one-by-one, as the battery drained. It was incredibly vague, leaving users racing to finish vacuuming a room when there was only a single LED left glowing.
The Dyson V11 now provides a countdown clock telling you how many minutes and seconds you have left to finish your vacuuming. As you switch between the three different cleaning modes, it automatically updates how much time youll have left based on the suction power, making it easier to choose which option will work best for how much cleaning youve got to do. Dysons handheld vacs have always been battery power-only, so falling back on a power cord when you run out of power has never been an option. Not knowing exactly how long you can clean for has always been their biggest drawback as a result, but this new battery meter goes a long way to helping you work within the limitations.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

AFP,"Beira (Mozambique): More than a thousand people are feared to have died in a cyclone that smashed into Mozambique last week, while scores were killed and more than 200 are missing in neighbouring Zimbabwe.The city of Beira in central Mozambique bore Cyclone Idai's full wrath on Thursday before the storm barrelled on to neighbouring Zimbabwe, unleashing fierce winds and flash floods and washing away roads and houses.
""For the moment we have registered 84 deaths officially, but when we flew over the area... this morning to understand what's going on, everything indicates that we could register more than 1,000 deaths,"" Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address. 
 ""This is a real humanitarian disaster,"" he said. 
""More than 100,000 people are in danger"".Survivors have taken refuge in trees while awaiting help, the president added.
Aerial photographs released by a Christian non-profit organisation, the Mission Aviation Fellowship, showed groups of people stuck on rooftops with flood waters up to window level.
""The scale of damage... (in) Beira is massive and horrifying"", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.
Ninety per cent of the city of some 530,000 people and its surrounding area has been ""damaged or destroyed,"" it said in a statement.
""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous,"" the IFRC's Jamie LeSueur said.
""Almost everything is destroyed. Communication lines have been completely cut and roads have been destroyed. Some affected communities are not accessible."" 
A large dam burst on Sunday and cut off the last road to Beira, he said.
Sofala province governor Alberto Mondlane warned that the ""biggest threat we have now, even bigger than the cyclone, is floods because it's raining more and more"".
Emma Beaty, coordinator of a grouping of NGOs known as Cosaco, said: ""We've never had something of this magnitude before in Mozambique"".
""Some dams have broken, and others have reached full capacity, they'll very soon open the flood gates. It's a convergence of flooding, cyclones, dams breaking and making a potential wave: everything's in place so we get a perfect storm."" 
Nyusi said the Pungwe and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique ""have burst their banks and engulfed entire villages."" 
""Communities are isolated and bodies are floating"" on the waters, he said.
Beira international airport was closed because of cyclone damage but later reopened.
In neighbouring Zimbabwe, Idai left 98 dead and at least 217 more missing, according to the information ministry.
Families started burying their dead on Monday in damp graves, according to an AFP photographer.
The storm swept away homes and ripped bridges to pieces, leaving destruction that acting defence minister Perrance Shiri said ""resembles the aftermath of a full-scale war"".
Some roads were swallowed up by massive sinkholes, while bridges were ripped to pieces by flash floods.
""This is the worst infrastructural damage we have ever had,"" Zimbabwe's Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza said.
The eastern district of Chimanimani was worst-hit, with houses and most of the region's bridges washed away by flash floods.
The most affected areas are not yet accessible, and high winds and dense clouds have hampered military rescue helicopter flights.
Two pupils and a worker at a secondary school in the area were among those killed after a landslide sent a boulder crashing into their dormitory.
Soldiers on Sunday helped rescue the surviving nearly 200 pupils, teachers and staff who had been trapped at the school in Chimanimani.Joshua Sacco, lawmaker for Chimanimani, told AFP that ""150 to 200 people"" are missing.
The majority of them are thought to be government workers, whose housing complex was completely engulfed by raging waters. Their fate was unknown because the area was still unreachable.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa cut short a visit to Abu Dhabi, returning home on Monday.
""With every hour and day that passes, our worst fears become increasingly real,"" he said in a statement. 
""Many drowned while others were killed in their sleep from swift and unexpected rockfalls which demolished their homes"".
His government has come under fire for failing to evacuate people in time.

"kloria@techinsider.io (Kevin Loria), Kevin Loria","Waves crash over houses on Turner Rd. as a large coastal storm affects the area on March 2, 2018 in Scituate, Massachusetts. Scott Eisen/Getty Images The nor'easter storm known as Riley is undergoing a rapid intensification process called""bombogenesis."" This describes the process in which a storm quickly gets stronger if its central surface pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours and qualifies it as a bomb cyclone. ""Bomb cyclone"" is a real meteorological term but it describes strength, not potential damage. Even so, this storm is expected to cause heavy damage on the coast. It's official: the bomb cyclone is back. The winter storm that the Weather Channel has dubbed ""Riley"" has been undergoing the rapid intensification process called ""bombogenesis,"" which means its central pressure is dropping quickly (an indicator of a storm's strength). In this case, the nor'easter still appears to be intensifying, but the central surface pressure of the storm system has already dropped by at least 24 millibars (mb) in 24 hours, which means it is undergoing bombogenesis (or ""explosive bombogenesis"") and qualifies it as a weather bomb or bomb cyclone. The term bomb cyclone dates back to a 1980 paper by Frederick Sanders and John Gyakum, which described the phenomenon as a ""bomb."" That sounds dramatic, but it actually refers to an extratropical surface cyclone: a storm occurring outside of tropics, usually between 30 and 60 degrees latitude if it happens in the Northern Hemisphere, with a quickly-dropping central pressure. Central pressure is the measure of how much the atmosphere in the middle of a storm weighs, and it's one of the key indicators of any cyclone's intensity. The lower the air pressure in the middle of the storm, the more intense that cyclone is. Normal air pressure is about 1010 mb; when central pressure is lower than that, things become more turbulent, with more air movement and wind kicking up. It's not uncommon for nor'easter storms to undergo bombogenesis. It happens on average between 40 and 50 times in the Northern Hemisphere each year, according to meteorologist Ryan Maue. Despite the menacing terminology, the term ""bomb cyclone"" doesn't have anything to do with potential damage. However, this particular nor'reaster looks like a bad one. Potentially record-setting moderate to major flooding is expected in Boston Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, intense winds with close to hurricane-force gusts have been battering the East Coast to the point that the term #windmageddon started trending on Twitter. On Twitter on Thursday, NWS Boston warned : ""Take this storm seriously! This is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation for those living along the coast.""","Scott Eisen/Getty Images The nor'easter storm known as Riley is undergoing a rapid intensification process called""bombogenesis.""

Adam Rosenberg,"It's rare for a single airport to make headlines, but that's what happens when a cascading series of events shuts down one of the world's biggest transit hubs. John F. Kennedy International Airport is in a state of disarray on Sunday as nasty weather, blistering cold, and human error conspired to create a logjam that's left travelers stranded and planes grounded or redirected. Not a great mixture for people moving into or out of New York this weekend. SEE ALSO: Even weather experts are in awe of the 'bomb cyclone' Troubles started last week, when the terrifyingly named ""bomb cyclone"" dumped snow and windy weather across the eastern United States on Wednesday and Thursday. The inclement weather was followed immediately by a lingering cold snap that's slowed down cleanup and recovery efforts. Those two events alone caused heavy delays and cancelled or redirected flights that piled on top of each other as the week wore on. The issues were then further exacerbated over the weekend by instances of human error, unexpected disasters, and downright bad behavior. Taken together, this confluence of events led to a mob scene at JFK on Saturday and Sunday as distraught, angry, and, in some cases, stranded travelers coped with disrupted travel plans and the inevitable frustrating hold-ups that come about when thousands of people are stuck in the same physical space, with the same fundamental problems to solve. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey attempted to sum up the situation and what led to it in a lengthy thread (for a state agency, at least) posted on Saturday. has resulted in terminal operators and airlines experiencing delays in getting planes and their passengers into their gates. 2/7 — Port Authority NY&amp;NJ (@PANYNJ) January 6, 2018 Departing passengers, as well as those meeting flights, are encouraged to check with their carriers for any changes in flight schedules. 4/7 — Port Authority NY&amp;NJ (@PANYNJ) January 6, 2018 The Port Authority has deployed additional staff to assist travelers and will continue to offer buses to bring passengers experiencing delays back to the terminals. 6/7 — Port Authority NY&amp;NJ (@PANYNJ) January 6, 2018 The Port Authority intends to aggressively review with its partners, the terminal operators and airlines, the process to assure that planes and passengers get to their gates during the surge of rescheduled flights that follow a severe weather event. 7/7 — Port Authority NY&amp;NJ (@PANYNJ) January 6, 2018 That final tweet in the thread is notable. While some of the traffic jam was unavoidable given the nature of the storm and its after-effects, observers have noted that there was plenty of advance warning here. The storm was a known threat before it had even fully formed, and the intense period of cold that followed was expected. All of which is to say: preparations at JFK could have been more thorough, airlines could have done a better job of anticipating flight disruptions, and the lines of communication to passengers all throughout could have been clearer. Predictably, much of this has been documented on social media. Take a look, and spend some time scrolling through FlightRadar24's Twitter feed to see the long lineup of JFK-related delays and redirects. A clue about some of the problems at JFK Airport right now.

Andrew Freedman,"The East Coast ""bomb cyclone"" on Thursday looks both beautiful and sinister from space. While scientists have been tracking storms using satellites in orbit for decades, they now have a brand new tool at their disposal: GOES-16, also called GOES-East. The brand new satellite — which wasn't available to scientists last winter — is one of the most powerful weather-watching tools in history, able to take snapshots of the storm every minute. The result? Some truly astonishing images. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained The storm, which is bringing blizzard conditions to areas from Virginia to Maine, along with hurricane-force wind gusts and damaging coastal flooding, looks like a classic non-tropical storm. It took on a comma shape, drawing in moisture all the way from the Bahamas, and dumping it into an Arctic air mass in place over the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast. Its minimum central air pressure, a key measure of its intensity, has been falling by double digits every few hours, greatly exceeding the criteria needed to fit the definition of a weather ""bomb."" Such a term refers to the meteorological term ""bombogenesis,"" which combines the words ""bomb"" and ""cyclogensis,"" and means a storm that intensifies by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. The current storm has already seen a 53 millibar drop in just 21 hours, placing it in the top 5 percent of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storm systems. Computer model projections show that the minimum central pressure could fall to 947 millibars, which would be comparable to Hurricane Sandy when that storm made landfall in 2012. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, this storm, while not tropical in nature, has a massive wind field, bringing 60-mile-per-hour winds to New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Carolinas at the same time. The center of the storm even developed an eye-like feature, clearly seen in this satellite image: Image: colorado state university/noaa Impressive GOES-16 high resolution infrared satellite imagery showing explosive cyclogenesis/rapid intensification with the hurricane force low pressure system in the W Atlantic from late last night into this morning. pic.twitter.com/h3lLrYcWL8 — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 4, 2018 It's not a hurricane but it has an ""eye-like"" feature where warmer air is trapped, encircled, or ""secluded"" by a bent-back warm front.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Look, Im as sick of typhoons and hurricanes menacing humanity as you are. Theyre planetary bullies and they suck. But I can take a begrudging moment to appreciate how they look from space. The latest storm to give me pause is Super Typhoon Tramicurrently churning in the West Pacificand images courtesy of astronaut Alex Gerst. The images, snapped from the lofty perch of the International Space Station, show crisp white clouds against a deep blue ocean, the symmetry of the eye, and the swirl of clouds within the eye itself like a world within a world. In a Facebook post, Gerst quipped that it looks like somebody pulled the planets gigantic plug. A look inside Tramis eye. Photo: Alex Gerst Trami is the most powerful storm on the face of the planet right now. On Tuesday morning, it was packing sustained winds of 149 mph and gusts up to 184 mph. Thats down a bit from its 160-mph peak on Monday and there are signs the typhoon may have weakened a bit more, but dont let that or its gorgeous appearance fool you. Trami still poses a threat to Japans southern islands later this week as it begins it turn northward. The storm could even reach Honshu, Japans most populous island, early next week. In terms of destructiveness its unlikely to rival Mangkhut, which rocked the Philippines and Hong Kong last week, but its also not what disaster-weary Japan needs after a year of torrential rains. The Western Pacific is the most active tropical cyclone basin in the world, but this year has been particularly rough. There have been more major storms than usual and accumulated cyclone energya metric that uses wind from all cyclones in a basin and adds them up over timeis also higher than the norm. Research published in 2016 shows that landfalling storms in Asia have become 12-15 percent more intense since 1970, likely driven by warmer oceans. So while its easy to admire these stunning beasts over the ocean, lets not forget theyre often still beastly at landfall. And even when theyre not at their peak, they can still cause major damage.

SEE ALSO: 'Bomb cyclone' to pummel East Coast, followed by a polar vortex-related cold snap Not used to the snow, Floridians were pretty pumped to see the white fluffy stuff for a change. This pup, however, was very confused. South Carolina also saw a good amount of snow. And so did North Carolina. People in Georgia were trying their very best to make snowmen. Some were better than others. The fire chief for Valdosta, Georgia, even made a snow angel. Snow-covered palm trees are a pretty rare sight. Ill-equipped and unaccustomed, some roads were closed with just a dusting. A fountain even froze in Atlanta. While this is exciting to many who live in the South and rarely see snow, this storm is part of an explosive "" bomb cyclone "" that's expected to pummel the rest of the East Coast Wednesday night into Thursday. Snow will overspread the region tonight/Thursday morning &amp; last most of the day. Heavy snowfall is possible around 9am to 4 pm w/ snowfall rates near 2 inches an hour.

JOHN LELAND and TRAVIS HUGGETT,"Travis Huggett thought of the subway as a means of getting from one place to another. Then he had a son on the autism spectrum. To Orson, now 9, a train was something more than transportation. It was soothing, endlessly fascinating, more intriguing than any destination it might reach. At his school for children with autism, other boys shared the same passion. When Mr. Huggett started photographing some of them, asking them about their interest in trains, he discovered how many different ways they were drawn. Some were really interested in maps and timetables, Mr. Huggett said. Some liked model trains more than the real thing. Some found crowded cars too stimulating, but one wanted even more stimulation: his idea was to ride the subway to Coney Island and then ride the Cyclone roller coaster. It was incredible how different they all are, he said. I learned a lot about how diverse the community is.","It’s loud, it’s crowded, it’s delayed because of an earlier incident.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Weather Service, called the storm a “mid-latitude cyclone” — as opposed to a hurricane, which is a tropical cyclone. “If it comes close enough to the coast, you can get a walloping snowfall,” Mr. Carbin said Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday was already cold, with high temperatures ranging from 0 degrees in the Northeast to the low 40s in parts of North Florida. It was in the 20s and 30s in parts of Texas, where much of the state was under a freeze warning. A shot of Arctic air will reinforce that cold and feed the storm, according to Mr. Carbin, who noted that a stretch from Louisiana to Georgia had already seen snow a few weeks ago. “We are,” he said, “in the depths of winter.” Southern governors encourage residents to stay aware. Mr. Deal was among the Georgia politicians who received criticism after a winter storm paralyzed Atlanta in 2014. In a statement on Tuesday evening, he noted that the state Department of Transportation had sent all of its brine trucks, as well as 75 plows, to southeast Georgia. “I encourage all Georgians in the potentially impacted areas to stay informed, get prepared and be safe,” he said. In North Carolina on Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Roy Cooper warned that the forecast for his state — up to five inches of snow in eastern counties — could change quickly. “A small change in a storm’s track can make a big difference in how much snow falls and where,” Mr. Cooper said. The state’s emergency management director, Mike Sprayberry, said counties were preparing to open warming centers if they were needed, and state officials said workers were already dumping brine onto roadways, overpasses and bridges from Raleigh eastward. The conditions also led to the shutdown, or planned closure, of ports in Savannah, Ga., and Charleston. Officials at other major ports said Wednesday morning that they were monitoring conditions and could close them later in the week.

Mallory Locklear,"Starting at the surface, one of the Nature papers describes some peculiar activity going on at Jupiter's poles. While we've known that the northern- and southernmost regions of the planet play host to rather large cyclones, new images taken by Juno show that these cyclones are arranged in a rather strange pattern -- eight cyclones surround one large one in the north while five surround a central cyclone in the south. You can see the southern arrangement in the image above. They've been situated this way throughout multiple Juno orbits, but how they became arranged that way or why they haven't merged aren't yet understood. Two other papers took a look at the hallmark bands on Jupiter's surface and set out to determine whether the activity going on within them was related to what's going on beneath the planet's surface. Jupiter has a very distinct surface pattern with its bright and dark bands of gas, each featuring strong winds flowing in opposite directions. But scientists haven't been able to say whether that activity extends below the surface. However, by measuring small differences in the signals Juno sends back to Earth as it travels around Jupiter, researchers were able to determine that Jupiter's gravitational field isn't the same across its north and south hemispheres. And that lack of symmetry suggests that what's going on at Jupiter's surface extends deeper. For surface winds to affect something as significant as a planet's gravitational field, they have to run deeper. And building on that observation, another group was able to show that Jupiter's surface jet streams extend around 3,000 kilometers deep -- much deeper than expected -- and make up around one percent of the planet's mass. Together, these two papers answer the long-standing question of whether Jupiter's surface activity continues below -- it does. Lastly, the final paper of the four looks even deeper. While Jupiter's core is known to be fluid, mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, researchers find that from Juno's measurements, Jupiter's fluid core likely rotates as a rigid body. The scientists think that the gases within the core are electrically charged and are therefore moved around together by the planet's massive magnetic field. These studies provide a look below Jupiter's surface and not only do they answer some questions about the planet itself, they give us insight into how gas giants like Jupiter function and evolve. The Juno mission hopefully has a few more years to go and we're certainly in for more discoveries about this weird and wonderful planet if so.","The Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016 and it has already provided us with a wealth of information about the gas giant.

Andrew Freedman,"It all started innocently enough. Shortly before New Year's celebrations kicked off in the Southeast, a record-cold air mass blew in from the north. This air had a direct connection to the Arctic, spilling out as if someone left the Northern Hemisphere's refrigerator door open. This frigid air oozed across the Gulf of Mexico, into Florida, and served as one of the catalysts for a low pressure area to develop in the Bahamas on Tuesday. Snow flurries were even reported on an oil platform off the coast of Louisiana. SEE ALSO: Incredible photos from space show off the historic East Coast 'bomb cyclone' The cold air sitting over unusually warm Atlantic Ocean waters helped set up a huge thermal, or heat, contrast, which the East Coast's bomb cyclone was then able to take advantage of and intensify at nearly unheard of rates late Wednesday and Thursday. During the 24 hour period ending at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, the storm's central air pressure dropped by 59 millibars, to 951 millibars, which put the blizzard in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying storms. No other non-tropical storm has intensified this rapidly off the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast in the past 30 years or more.

So much to see! pic.twitter.com/OS4hLO9wOd — Jeff Frame (@VORTEXJeff) January 4, 2018 After the cold air moved into the Southeast, all that was needed for a storm to form was a trigger to come along. Mother Nature delivered multiple triggers on Wednesday, when three distinct, potent waves of energy embedded within the jet stream moved over the area. According to meteorologist Alex Lamers of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, meteorologists are scrambling to understand how this storm got so strong, so quickly. The temperature contrast was just one of the key ingredients that set this storm off, he said. “You had a really anomalously cold air mass south to the Gulf,"" Lamers said in an interview. “I think that was a big driver, just the big gradients in temperature and moisture,” he said. Some other factors, he said, may not be known now, and will require further study by researchers. “I think that was probably a big factor, and then jet [stream] dynamics probably played a big role too,” Lamers said. Winds at the upper levels of the atmosphere, within the highway of air that steers weather systems, promoted ascending air and storm intensification, Lamers said. 10 AM official WPC analysis has low pressure down to 951mb, a remarkable drop of 59 millibars in 24 hours. Also 38mb in the last 12 hours. pic.twitter.com/TgoLDS9J7h — Alex Lamers (@AlexJLamers) January 4, 2018 Sam Lillo, a meteorology Phd. student at the University of Oklahoma, said the jet stream disturbances acted ""like a vacuum, evacuating mass out of the column of atmosphere [and] resulting in decreasing pressure at the surface."" ""Even one shortwave interacting with the low and its subtropical connection would've resulted in a strong Atlantic storm. The three shortwaves also aren't perfectly phasing, so the actual ceiling for the strength of this storm was likely even higher."" Another ingredient in the bomb cyclone was unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Western Atlantic, Lillo said in a Twitter message. ""These origins, along with the unusually high Atlantic sea surface temperatures are important because there has been extraordinary influence from latent heat fluxes and deep convection in this storm...,"" he said, referring to the formation of powerful thunderstorms as part of the low pressure area. The above normal sea surface temperatures also produced an unusually sharp zone of temperature contrasts, which helped to fuel the low pressure area, Lamers said. Such storms, after all, feed off of the differences in air masses, so the bigger the contrast in air masses, the stronger the storm may get.

The main difference between a rapidly intensifying storm like the one on Thursday and one that intensifies at a more typical rate for the Northeast is that storms that undergo bombogenesis tend to produce higher wind gusts, as well as more thunderstorms. They can also be more difficult to predict, since computer models may struggle to predict their complex evolution. With winds gusting to at least 80 miles per hour, and a foot-plus of snow already falling in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, it's clear that the bomb cyclone of 2018 lived up to most of the hype. Now it's up to meteorologists to figure out how to better predict more storms like it in the future.","It all started innocently enough.

Adam Rosenberg,"No one boarding the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship in New York on Dec. 29, 2017 expected to start the new year coping with seasickness and mortal terror. But in the end, that's what happened. It's not clear what led Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) to stick to the ship's planned itinerary as forecasts made as early as Dec. 31 pointed to a winter storm of historic proportions forming along the East Coast. But the decision left Ellen Leffak, her family, and many of the fellow passengers they commiserated with sick from the rough voyage and furious at what they see as negligence on the part of NCL's decision-makers. The passengers aboard the ship endured a horrific journey home despite the fact that the storm was accurately forecast days in advance by the U.S. government and private sector meteorologists. ""I know that sometimes we are just subject to forces of nature that we can't help,"" Leffak said during a post-cruise phone interview. ""But I think what went bad here was that the ship's decisions and responses to those forces of nature were totally inappropriate."" SEE ALSO: Norwegian Cruise Line sailed right through the nightmarish winter storm Our 96-hr forecast (valid 12Z January 4) highlights very dangerous #Atlantic marine conditions expected later this week. Rapidly intensifying low pressure is forecast to develop hurricane force winds on Thu as it lifts northward along the outer portion of our offshore zones. pic.twitter.com/LvqoTSTJnM — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) December 31, 2017 Trouble started midway through the trip, on Jan. 2, as the ship dropped anchor off the coast of Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas. The cruise line owns this private island and uses it as a sort of rest and play stop during the long journey up and down the East Coast to Key West, Florida, a place where passengers can disembark for beachside fun. By Jan. 2, weather forecasters from the U.S. government and private sector were unanimous in predicting that a storm of potentially historic proportions would form off the Southeast coast, near Florida, and spin up the East Coast toward Nova Scotia by Jan. 5. Computer models differed slightly in the storm track forecast, particularly on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, but they all agreed that the system would be incredibly intense — possibly breaking a record for the rate of intensification in such a short period of time. This aspect of the storm is crucial, because such a rapid pressure drop would lead to hurricane force winds of 75 miles per hour or greater as well as building seas. ""It was horrible to watch."" The waters off the coast of Great Stirrup Cay are shallow, which meant the Breakaway had to drop anchor in deeper waters and ferry passengers aboard smaller tender boats. Leffak and her husband opted to stay aboard the big boat that morning for breakfast before heading out on a later tender. Unfortunately, high winds and waves caused the crew to quickly recall all the tenders and set sail for New York instead. ""They were starting to bring people back to the ship because of the forecast of high winds up to 60 miles an hour and the water swells of 15 feet,"" Leffak said. No one mentioned anything about a storm, let alone a historic storm that would affect every coastal state from Florida to Maine. Never again on the #NorwegianBreakaway. That was the scariest cruise ever. All we knew was tenders couldn't make it to NCL private island. Then we just left, no information, no updates, 3+ days of rough waves, and entire family sick, locked inside a tilted ship. Disgraceful..... pic.twitter.com/5ecdPtTrlc — Los_Angeles (@LA4Life32) January 6, 2018 ""They were bouncing and bouncing,"" Leffak said of the small shuttle boats. ""If I was on one of those things I would have been as sick as a dog. It was horrible to watch."" After that, the long, tumultuous journey back to New York began, spanning the days between Jan. 2 and Jan. 5. The worst moments of 2018's historic winter storm hammered the East Coast on Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, which is when conditions aboard the ship deteriorated dramatically. As waves rocked the cruise ship and guests and staff became seasick, the ship's captain repeated the same message: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are in rough seas and we are optimizing our speed and course to minimize the movement of the ship."" He would then hand the mic over to the cruise director, who ran through ongoing activities and events aboard the ship. Leffak recited that message from memory with the cadence of someone who heard it too many times. ""The announcements were totally canned, totally repetitive,"" she said. ""The same words over and over and over and over again."" Leffak and her fellow passengers were unsettled by a lack of communication from the bridge — roughly a full day went by between Tuesday and Wednesday night without any updates — and the storm was in full swing, with the ship swaying in high winds and waves. ""[Wednesday] was the night that people were actually being thrown out of their beds,"" Leffak said. ""This ship was moving so much people were actually rolling out of their beds."" Image: ellen leffak The cabin experience got to be so uncomfortable that many guests sought rest in the ship's public spaces. Or they just gave up on sleep all together. On top of all that, the cruise's concierge service had no answers; ""We just take our orders from the bridge,"" Leffak recalls being told. They dispensed dramamine to sick passengers, but getting just a single dose came with a 20-minute wait. There's a big problem here that isn't evident in Leffak's telling of events: This storm and its intensity should not have been a surprise to the ship’s captain or crew. In fact, it's clear that the cruise line made a decision to proceed despite the storm, rather than being surprised by it. In an email from National Weather Service spokeswoman Lauren Gaches, the organization’s Ocean Prediction Center, which forecasts maritime conditions, ""... Was forecasting the potential for hurricane force winds associated with the storm as early as Sunday, December 31."" The storm was predicted to peak on Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 3 and 4. ""Warnings for storm and hurricane force winds were gradually expanded, and by Tuesday, January 2, storm and hurricane-force wind warnings were in effect. On Tuesday, in OPC forecast discussions, forecasters stated that ""marine interests should be rushing any avoidance plans to completion.""” This means that by the time the Norwegian Breakaway's crew decided to head through the storm and on to New York, the forecast was clearly calling for a dangerous event with high winds, building waves, and other hazards. They may have thought that cruising along the western side of the storm would minimize the waves, since the highest waves built ahead of the low pressure area, but computer models were consistent in showing an area of hurricane force winds on the backside of the storm as well. In a statement defending its crew’s actions, Norwegian Cruise Lines has said the ship encountered worse conditions than anticipated. But the Weather Service's Gaches said forecasts were progressively more certain starting on Sunday the 31st. ""Confidence was high on Sunday and only grew through Wednesday. Ocean Prediction Center forecast discussions indicated that confidence was high and growing,"" she said. Presumably that information was available to the ship’s crew, since it was available to the public on OPC’s website. The 12Z OPC surface analysis indicates that low pressure currently near Miami will rapidly intensify while moving NE in the W Atlantic over the next 24 hours.

Such a rapid drop in pressure caused air to rush inward toward the center, as if filling a growing void in the atmosphere. This resulted in powerful winds measured at 80 miles per hour over land. Waves as high as 51 feet were observed in Nova Scotia, though the waves that affected the Norwegian Breakaway were likely far lower in height, closer to 15 to 30 feet. The Norwegian Breakaway is just the latest cruise ship to wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. 24-hour OPC surface &amp; wind/wave forecasts from today indicate intense low pressure to develop in the W Atlantic by 1200 UTC (7AM EST) 01/04/18 with winds up to 80 kt and seas to 33 ft. pic.twitter.com/P4aGol8tbN — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 3, 2018 Royal Caribbean’s “Anthem of the Seas” ran straight into post-tropical storm Hermine in 2016, just one year after suffering damage when it encountered a storm off the coast of North Carolina. In response, the cruise line hired a meteorologist to advise on its ships' routing decisions. Ryan Maue, the chief operating officer of weather company weather.us, urged caution before judging the crew of the NCL Breakaway as reckless in the face of the storm. ""I think we should all be careful expressing an expert 'forensic meteorology' opinion on the decision-making in this specific case since we do not have the inside knowledge about the weather forecasts provided to the Captain, routes or how the company determines what is tolerable ocean-going risk,"" he said in an email. ""All that being said, once the ship's Captain decides YES we are going to go through the storm, then the task at hand is to find the safest and most efficient route — probably balancing those two factors,” he said. ""It's likely that the course chosen by NCL was indeed suboptimal."" Maue said the storm developed quickly and had an unusually large wind field for a weather system of its type. He said from a passenger perspective, it's clear that the route chosen was not one that maximized their comfort. ""... Even with our best global models and coupled-ocean wave tools, it's likely that the course chosen by NCL was indeed suboptimal in terms of waves, wind and the passengers comfort because the ship is moving too slowly to adapt or course change. It's like a bobbing cork in a very angry stream."" Maue did, however, criticize Norwegian’s statements for calling weather forecasts into question. ""Blaming the weather forecasts for 'more dangerous' sailing conditions than expected is disingenuous since you have already decided on purpose to sail into the storm, not avoid it,"" he said. The full text of the statement received from NCL's spokesperson reads as follows: During the early morning hours of January 4, Norwegian Breakaway encountered stronger than forecasted weather conditions due to winter storm Grayson. The safety of our guest and crew is always our top priority and the ship's Captain adjusted the ship's speed and itinerary accordingly to maintain the safest possible route, delaying the ship's arrival. ‎Norwegian Breakaway returned safely to port approximately eight hours later than scheduled. Due to the late hour and the weather conditions, the ship remained alongside overnight, departing one day late for the next scheduled cruise. We sincerely apologize to our guests for the stronger than expected weather conditions and any resulting discomfort or inconvenience they may have experienced. The spokesperson added that when inclement weather strikes, the company, as a rule, charts ""a route that has the least impact to our guests and crew."" The ship finally came into port in New York on the afternoon of Jan. 5, hours after it was supposed to have arrived. Ice build-up on the walkways slowed the disembarkation process, leaving Leffak and her family waiting with everyone else in a long line. It's here that the cruise staff's priorities became clear. Leffak suspects the decision to make the hellish trip through the storm was made in order to get the ship ready for the next trip. ""I went over to this bar and I asked the woman [if I could have] some glasses of water,"" Leffak said. ""I don't have any glasses,"" the woman replied. Leffak didn't understand. ""You have a whole bar here,"" she said. ""How could you not have any glasses?"" The bartender replied: ""I'm getting ready for the next group of people coming on, I don't have glasses."" Image: Mark Lennihan/AP/REX/Shutterstock The Breakaway was set to leave on a 14-day journey the next day, Jan. 6. It was originally supposed to leave on Jan. 5, but the ship's late arrival in New York prompted a delay for the next trip. It's unclear if the ship rushed back to New York — perhaps along a needlessly risky or uncomfortable course — with the next trip in mind, but even after the brutal journey, the crew's minds were on the next trip before departing passengers had fully disembarked. When Leffak's line finally did start to move, she remembers an anxious crewmember shouting ""C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!"" (She turned toward the woman doing the shouting and told her to ""shut the fuck up."") Now that the journey is over, Leffak is busy thinking about next steps. Days later, she said, she's still suffering from vertigo that her doctor recommended waiting out with continued sedation. But she's angry about what she and her family went through aboard the Breakaway, and she's in the process of bringing a class action lawsuit to bear against NCL. ""I am a lawyer. I don't know about this kind of law, but I know that there are people who do,"" Leffak said. ""My philosophy was always advising my clients, always, that if you screwed up, the best thing you can do is say, 'We screwed up. We know it's going to cost us some money, but we also know it's worth some good will and we know it will protect us better in the future.'"" ""You say, 'I screwed up. I have to make this right.'""","No one boarding the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship in New York on Dec. 29, 2017 expected to start the new year coping with seasickness and mortal terror.

Andrew Freedman,"A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast. The blizzard is the result of three distinct disturbances in the atmosphere as well as the intense contrast between the Arctic air mass in place across the East and a subtropical plume of moisture moving up the coast near the Gulf Stream. Non-tropical storms feed off air mass differences, along with upper level disturbances, and these ingredients are quickly coming together for a historically intense storm to form. SEE ALSO: A meteorological ‘bomb’ is set to go off along the East Coast, and dangerous cold will soon follow In fact, snow, sleet, and freezing rain is already underway across the Southeast, where the heaviest snowstorm on record is possible on Wednesday in Savannah, Georgia, and the first measurable snowfall in 28 years is falling in Tallahassee, Florida. Snow will overspread the region tonight/Thursday morning &amp; last most of the day. Heavy snowfall is possible around 9am to 4 pm w/ snowfall rates near 2 inches an hour. Travel may become difficult due to poor vsbys &amp; snow covered roads. Blowing &amp; drifting snow is also possible. pic.twitter.com/BSF9XzJj6f — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) January 3, 2018 While there are still nagging questions about the storm's exact track and evolution, it's clear that it will intensify at an explosive rate, potentially doubling the intensification rate needed to qualify for undergoing a process known to meteorologists as ""bombogenesis,"" which refers to a storm whose minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm is projected to go from about 998 millibars on Wednesday morning to 950 millibars by midday Thursday, a plunge of 48 millibars in about 24 hours. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Storms of this intensity are extremely unusual in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin when compared to climate records during the past 30 years. Hurricane Sandy, which had tropical characteristics, ruling it out as a direct comparison, had a minimum central air pressure of 946 millibars when it made landfall in New Jersey in October 2012. Blizzard conditions to hammer Northeast, Carolinas Late Tuesday and into Wednesday, computer models have tended to move the storm track to the west, bringing the heaviest precipitation over the East Coast. So, what first appeared to be a glancing blow now promises to be a full-fledged blizzard in some locations. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for Boston on Thursday, where up to a foot of snow is expected to fall, accompanied by wind gusts to 70 miles per hour. Computer model projection of satellite imagery on Jan. 4, 2018, from the high resolution NAM model. Image: tropicaltidbits Blizzard warnings have also been hoisted for parts of the Carolinas, and more may be issued later Wednesday depending on the latest computer model data. Blizzard warnings for up to a foot of snow, along with howling winds and low visibility, include Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia, which is the largest naval base in the world. Blizzard warnings are extremely rare in this area. Near-blizzard conditions are also anticipated to affect coastal Rhode Island and Connecticut, along with Long Island, with perhaps the toughest snowfall forecast reserved for New York City and New Jersey. Some computer model projections show this region getting buried by a foot of snow, while others show a far less severe event, with just 4 to 7 inches of snow. It may take until late Wednesday for the forecast to be ironed out for the Big Apple, and even then the level of uncertainty may be unusually high. The local National Weather Service office in New York City said the following in a morning technical forecast discussion on Wednesday: As mentioned, this remains a fluid situation based on model spread, with potential for these numbers to go down, but still seems more so upwards based on model trends and mode of SREF/GEFS/ ECMWF ensemble members compared to operational runs. This higher trend is reflected in latest WFO /WPC snow probs, with high probs of greater than 6 inches of snow across E LI /SE CT and low to moderate probs to Hudson River. A significant jump in the reasonable worse case has also been noted, with 1 in 10 chance of seeing more than 12-16 inches of snow across much of LI /CT, 8 to 12 inches of snow across NYC/NJ metro to Hudson River, and 4 to 8 inches N &amp; W still in play. To try to reduce the forecast uncertainty, the National Weather Service is dispatching hurricane hunter research aircraft to fly a route around the Southeast U.S. today to drop instruments that will gather data on winds, humidity, pressure, and other parameters. This information will then be fed directly into the agency's computer models, potentially making their projections more reliable. In recent years, the Weather Service has flown such missions outside of hurricane season for high uncertainty, high impact events, and this one definitely qualifies. Ice chunks to exacerbate coastal flooding Because the storm will intensify so significantly, and so quickly, it will generate very strong winds. These winds — in some instances gusting to hurricane force of 75 miles per hour — will drive water toward the coast, particularly in southeastern New England, where moderate to major coastal flooding is expected during high tides on Thursday. Given the recent, unrelenting cold snap, one additional threat will come from the ice chunks that are clogging many harbors and portions of Cape Cod Bay. These chunks could cause damage to shoreline infrastructure, or worsen flooding in some cases. Farther out at sea, high winds will create towering waves, creating a major hazard to mariners caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why this low pressure area will become such a monster The storm will have every ingredient it needs to intensify into a blockbuster. First, it will have ample upper level support from three distinct disturbances in the fast-moving current of air known as the jet stream. Once these combine into one, powerful system, they will promote lifting of the air over the East Coast, which is essential to forming precipitation. Lift is also key to the formation of a surface area of low pressure, as well as its intensification. An animation from the North American Model, known as the NAM, shows the combination of the three disturbances and the formation of a deep trough, or dip, in the jet stream off the East Coast, with the low pressure area tucked into it. If the model projections prove correct, as they have been so far, this could be one of the strongest winter storms on record, at least for this part of the North Atlantic Ocean. Image: tropicaltidbits The storm, named winter storm Grayson by The Weather Channel, will also have the advantage of forming in an area off the Southeast coast where the temperature contrast between frigid, dry Arctic air, near-record-warm ocean waters, and comparatively moist subtropical air is at its maximum, allowing the low pressure area to feast off this contrast as if it were at an all-you-can-eat buffet. And as it moves northward up the coast, it will also sustain itself through the release of latent heat via the formation of thunderstorms and precipitation in the cold sector. Winter Storm #Grayson will act as a heat bomb in the atmosphere in response to all the deep convection associated with the cyclone. Watch how this coastal cyclone accelerates the upper-level irrotational wind field, building the downstream jetstreak. #Science is awesome. pic.twitter.com/6V45hgw3d8 — Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) January 3, 2018 The Gulf Stream will play a key role in allowing this storm to explosively intensify, experts say. ""Relationships between the ocean and atmosphere are complicated, especially as they relate to explosively developing extratropical cyclones (like the one currently in the forecast),"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, in a Twitter message. ""But the extreme thermal contrast between very cold atmospheric temperatures over land and an unusually warm nearby Gulf Stream certainly sets the stage for impressive storm-strengthening potential,"" he added. ""Ocean conditions are not the only factor at play (atmospheric conditions, like the position and strength of jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere, are also critical), but they’re definitely important."" Polar vortex to follow this beastly storm The winter storm will plow into the Canadian Maritimes on Thursday night, and behind it, the coldest air of the season will pour southward, into the East, from Greenland, Hudson Bay, and the Arctic. Map showing a piece of the polar vortex (in white) moving from Hudson Bay down into New England on Saturday, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell Technically speaking, the cold that will follow the blizzard is associated with part of the polar vortex, which is a circulation of air around the Arctic that plays a role in determining how cold winters are in North America, Europe, and Asia. Temperatures of 30 degrees Fahrenheit below average are expected on Friday and Saturday in the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic, which will put all-time temperature records in jeopardy. Anyone that loses power during the storm will have to seek out heat elsewhere, as temperatures plunge well below zero at night, and barely recover above the single digits during the day. Even in New York City, the high temperature on Saturday may not climb much above 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and winds gusting to 30 miles per hour will make it feel far colder. Fortunately, this weekend appears to be the end of this extraordinarily long cold snap, as more seasonable temperatures return next week.","A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast.

The Associated Press
Mozambicans lined up Wednesday to get cholera vaccines in the cyclone-hit city of Beira, at the start of a drive to inoculate nearly 900,000 storm survivors as part of efforts contain an outbreak of the deadly disease.
Beiras Mayor Daviz Simango was among those who swallowed the oral vaccine Wednesday and then had their fingers marked to show that they have been immunized.
The Indian Ocean port of Beira, a city of 500,000, is where most of the more than 1,400 cases of cholera have been reported since the outbreak was declared a week ago.

Mozambican authorities have reported two deaths so far from the acute diarrheal disease, which can kill within hours if not properly treated.
Cases also have been confirmed in some outlying communities and vaccinations will begin there on Thursday. Overall the campaign aims to vaccinate some 884,000 people in Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi.
More than 100,000 survivors of Cyclone Idai are still living in displacement camps with little access to clean water or sanitation, and the World Health Organization has warned of a second disaster if water-borne diseases such as cholera and malaria spread.
Already the number of cholera cases is more than double the 500 beds set up for patients in Beira that is the centre of relief efforts for central Mozambique.
Cholera was first reported in one of the citys poorest and most crowded neighbourhoods, Munhava. As authorities hurried to repair the citys damaged water system, aid organizations reported that some people had resorted to drinking stagnant water or from contaminated wells.
Large areas of standing water remain in the low-lying region, which continues to drain after the cyclone swept in on March 14 and caused massive flooding.
Cholera is spread by contaminated food and water and is endemic in the region. Health officials have warned that once it emerges it can spread swiftly, especially in crowded urban areas. The disease is easily treated with an oral rehydration solution or intravenous fluids in severe cases, but health workers say the sooner a person receives treatment, the better.

Announcing the start of the vaccination campaign, Mozambiques government said the oral vaccine begins to take effect a week after it is administered. A second round of the vaccine would be needed after several weeks time for stronger protection, according to the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.
The overall death toll from the cyclone is now 598 in Mozambique, with more than 300 deaths in neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi.
Officials have warned that the death toll is preliminary and the real figure may never be known as some bodies were buried quickly or swept away by the flood waters.","Mozambicans line up for cholera vaccines to fight outbreak in Cyclone Idai affected areas The Globe and Mail Mozambique cholera cases now above 1,400 as vaccines arrive CBC.ca Mozambique cholera cases now above 1,400; vaccines arrive CTV News Mozambique cyclo…",2019-04-03T11:53:35Z,"{'id': 'the-globe-and-mail', 'name': 'The Globe And Mail'}",Mozambicans line up for cholera vaccines to fight outbreak in Cyclone Idai affected areas - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mozambicans-line-up-for-cholera-vaccines-to-fight-outbreak-in-cyclone/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/4dQ_rMcw3TnA7nzZewCOatI39Bw=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DM3LVO26EVECNL7LL2XFOSA74Y.jpg,the-globe-and-mail,The Globe And Mail,cyclone,1

Prickett added: I spent 25 years talking about what would happen if we dont address this issue. Now I have to correct myself and say what is happening. The impacts are real and they are here, but what is new is that while the politics remain polarized, business leadership is getting behind this issue and we now have the technologies to create scale solutions.

First of all, Carr noted by phone, nearly half of Gorongosa Park is now a lake, thanks to Cyclone Idai, but its trees and soils acted like a giant sponge and absorbed tons of water, so flooding of communities downstream was not as bad as it could have been. Parks mitigate climate extremes. Hurricanes are going to be more of a problem, and more nature is the solution. I am talking to the government about creating another 250,000 acres of wetland conservancy to the south of us to soak up more water, because this will not be our last cyclone.",Trump thinks he can win re-election by mocking climate change.

The independent,"Timber company workers stand stranded on a damaged road in Chimanimani, eastern Zimbabwe, on March 18.
Hundreds killed and over 800 square miles covered in water
| The Independent | Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the Sofala province of Mozambique in the waning hours of March 14, causing damage and flooding that could make it one of the worst weather disasters to ever hit the Southern Hemisphere.
Idai left Sofala with what resembled an inland ocean stretching more than 30 miles wide and potentially about 20 feet deep. The tropical storm destroyed 90 percent of Beira, a port city of more than a half-million people. The confirmed death toll as of March 21 was 557 in Mozambique and neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi, but with thousands still missing or at risk Mozambiques president Filipe Nyusi said the death toll could reach 1,000.
The Sofala province is historically prone to flooding, and floods occur every two to three years in Mozambique, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. It also reports that Mozambique ranks third among African countries for exposure to weather-related hazards.
But the inland oceans created by Idai surpass those created by any previous storm. A total of 836 square miles were covered in water as of March 20, according to the United Nations Institute for Training And Research (UNITAR). If the entire country of Bahrain were covered in water, it would only be roughly a third the size of the area flooded in Sofala.
Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said on March 24 that over 700 people were across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi; 417 of them in Mozambique. The number of dead was expected to rise as many people remained unaccounted for. The officials will only be able to determine the final casualty figure once the flood waters have receded.
Meanwhile thousands remain trapped by the floodwaters, and many of the Mozambican government’s relief centres have only just started receiving food supplies.
Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods, according to the BBC. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) were warning of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria.
“We are living an unprecedented natural disaster. A disaster that only matches major disasters,” Correia said. “Unfortunately, no-one in the region and in the world could predict a disaster of this size.”

Brian Bennett,"James Dyson says cordless vacuums are the future. Sarah Tew/CNET Dyson has pulled the plug on corded vacuums. At a press conference in New York to unveil a series of new products, company founder and inventor Sir James Dyson said they will make only cordless models from now on. Referencing the Cyclone V10 stick vac, Dyson said, ""This is why I've stopped developing corded vacuums."" The product is the latest in Dyson's line of cordless, battery-powered, and compact vacuum cleaners. The Dyson Cyclone V10 stick vacuum is mostly motor. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Like the V8 model before it, the Cyclone V10 is mostly all electric motor. This gives it lots of power despite a relatively small size and light weight compared to conventional upright vacuums. The basic model starts at $500 (converts to approximately £360 or AU$640) and climbs to $699 (converts to approximately £500 or AU$900) for the tricked out Cyclone V10 Absolute. The Cyclone V10 is available now for purchase directly through Dyson with wider retail presence soon after. Snap on many different attachments like this soft roller for hardwood floors. Tyler Lizenby/CNET The launch of the Cyclone V10 doesn't mean Dyson will stop selling its upright models, at least for now. At the time of writing the company still sells its Ball vacuums on its website. That said we haven't exactly been thrilled by these cleaners. They're big, heavy, and often fail to remain in their upright position, crashing to the floor unexpectedly. Dyson has updated its Cool Air purifiers. Dyson Dyson also announced updates to its Pure Cool lineup of smart air purifiers. The new machines will now have enhanced air quality detection system that's able to sniff out VOC (volatile organic compounds) levels. A separate sensor scans to both identify and determine particle size. Current Dyson connected air purifiers lack this level of air quality detail. Dyson will sell large and small sizes of the Pure Cool ($550 and $450). Both models are available for direct purchase immediately via Dyson showrooms and the company's website.","Dyson bets big on cordless stick vacs, pulls the plug on future corded models.",2018-03-06T15:00:18Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Dyson says its done making corded vacuums - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/dyson-says-its-done-making-corded-vacuums/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/nEjPTutwo3Mr1m4Vop0PRt3Xgd8=/2018/03/05/f976f325-8828-4cda-9e6a-94231a7d7547/dyson-cyclone-v10-absolute-product-photos-4.jpg,,Cnet.com,cyclone,1

But not every ship in service is a seafaring behemoth — in fact, some vessels are quite small. The smallest warships in US Navy service are Cyclone-class patrol craft. The Navy acquired 14 of these ships for special operations work in the 1990s. These small vessels weigh roughly 288 tons, have a crew of 28 personnel, and can hold either nine SEALs or a six-man Coast Guard law-enforcement detachment. These ships are roughly 178 feet long and have a top speed of 35 knots. They also pack a punch. Cyclones are equipped with two 25mm Bushmaster chain guns and a mix of M2.50-caliber machine guns, 7.62mm machine guns, and Mk 19 automatic grenade launchers. The ships also can carry the FIM-92 Stinger for air defense. The Cyclone-class patrol coastal ship USS Zephyr transits the Caribbean Sea, April 21, 2017. US Navy/Mass Comm Specialist 3rd Class Casey J. Hopkins In some cases, even these tiny ships are too big for special operations work. So for those select missions, Cyclones carry rigid-hull inflatable craft and two combat rubber raiding craft, operated with either a hydraulic lift or a stern ramp. To date, these ships have seen a good amount of action in the Persian Gulf and in the Caribbean. The Navy handed down the lead ship of the class, the former USS Cyclone (PC 1), to the Philippine Navy, where it's still in active service.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige. Spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane has grown into a monstrous Category 5 storm, the most powerful type of hurricane with winds now reaching 160 mph. Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center called the cyclone ""an impressive hurricane,"" and forecast that the storm will ""move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands as a hurricane Thursday through Saturday."" SEE ALSO: Why Trump's EPA wants to kill the nation's most ambitious climate change plan Hawaii's residents should ""prepare for a significant impact"" from Hurricane Lane, Ige said. National hurricane scientists emphasize that even if the center of the storm — where winds are strongest — doesn't pass directly over the islands, the state could still face serious problems from the storm. A storm this sprawling and powerful can bring threatening downpours and winds ""well away from the center of the hurricane, and impacts could be felt on any of the islands,"" the National Hurricane Center said. It's rare for powerful storms to veer near these well-populated tropical islands, in large part because hurricanes feed on warmer waters, and the oceans around Hawaii are often relatively cool for tropical seas. Yet, the National Hurricane Center notes that ocean waters along the storm's predicted track are currently ""warm enough to support a major hurricane."" Hurricane Lane is only the sixth Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific, Federal Emergency Management Agency atmospheric scientist Michael Lowry tweeted. But, Lane is the closest Category 5 storm to Hawaii that scientists have ever observed, he added. Although any year can bring warmer waters to a marine region, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and university scientists published research last year arguing that the tropical Pacific will likely see more ""extremely active"" hurricane seasons as human-caused global warming boosts ocean temperatures. As the planet continues an accelerated rate of warming due to human-caused climate change, around 95 percent of accumulated heat gets absorbed by the oceans, increasing the background levels of ocean warming and making warmer-than-normal temperatures more likely. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recently said in an interview. A classic hurricane killer is wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes on their sides and can tilt them or blow off their top. But as of Tuesday night, government forecasters didn't expect increasing wind shear around Hawaii until Thursday evening, after some major effects are likely already felt in the state. As the storm skims the islands, or perhaps even makes landfall, severe and potentially historic flooding is expected. According to the National Hurricane Center, there will certainly be battering waves on the coast and potentially ""life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall"" as water pours down the famously mountainous Hawaiian terrain.","Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Commuters in Brooklyn, New York City on Thursday morning A winter storm has caused travel chaos on the US north-east and is being blamed for up to 17 deaths. Over 3,000 US flights were cancelled and another 6,000 delayed on Thursday as snow falls on New York and New England, as well as eastern Canada. Boston could get up to 18in (45cm) of snow, while New York City is bracing for up 1ft, say forecasters. The storm, known as a ""bomb cyclone"", is expected to continue to affect eastern North America into the weekend. Media caption It snowed in Tallahassee, Florida, for the first time in 28 years Nearly 60 million people are in the path of the storm, with blizzard warnings in effect from Georgia to Maine in the US. Seventeen cold-related deaths have been reported across the US, according to the Associated Press news agency. Hurricane force winds of up to 60mph (95km/h) are expected to hammer the north-eastern US coastline. US railway operator Amtrak is running on a reduced schedule, and interstate buses are also being cancelled. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida. ""The situation has continued to deteriorate,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as he declared a state of emergency on Thursday. ""It's almost impossible to clear roads when you have those high wind gusts, because as soon as you clear the road the snow, the wind literally just brings the snow back on to the road."" Cars becoming stranded on the Long Island Expressway, he added, could cause a ""situation of life and death"" in which rescuers may be unable to reach trapped motorists. A ""bomb cyclone"" or ""weather bomb"" is an unofficial term for what is known as explosive cyclogenesis, according to BBC Weather. This occurs when the central pressure of a low pressure system falls by 24 millibars in 24 hours and can result in violent winds developing around the system. The winds can be strong enough to bring down trees and cause structural damage. The storm is forecast to undergo rapid cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean throughout Thursday and into the weekend, and current projections show areas north of New York as having the highest risk of significant impacts from strong winds and heavy snow.

Marcus Gilmer,"With a giant nor'easter slamming into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, forecasters are using warnings with dire language to inform coastal residents of Massachusetts that this storm will not be an ordinary event. In fact, record coastal flooding is anticipated in Boston and other parts of eastern Massachusetts, which is leading the National Weather Service to come out with statements that it rarely, if ever, issues. SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions The coastal flooding is the result of a long fetch of easterly winds, reaching hurricane force (75 miles per hour), pointed squarely at the north-south coast of eastern Massachusetts. The combination of astronomical high tides, astorm surge of 3 to 5 feet, storm surge, and waves of up to 30 feet just just offshore, is already inundating the coastline with water levels well above normal tide levels, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). At high tide on Friday morning, the water in Boston Harbor reached 14.36 feet, which was the third-highest water level on record. And the worst of this storm is yet to come. For the high tide on Friday night, the NWS is forecasting a record water level will be set in Boston of between 15.4 and 15.7 feet, beating the old record set just two months ago. The long-lasting flooding and battering waves has prompted unusually drastic language in the NWS' warnings (emphasis ours). Damage to some shoreline structures may occur. There will likely be widespread inundation of coastal roads and basements with life-threatening inundation depths above 3 or more feet possible in some locations. Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time. This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary. Another major impact from the storm will likely be beach erosion, prompting this warning from the NWS: ""Very severe to extreme erosion is likely and may compromise protective dunes, seawalls and other structures. This storm may be capable of producing one or more new inlets."" In other words, this storm could simply smash through existing land, to create new islands. The NWS's Coastal Flood Threat and Inundation map shows where the worst flooding is expected along the Massachusetts coast, with water levels of nearly 15 feet expected in locations like Gloucester Harbor, Revere, Scituate, and Boston. The coastal flooding could break records all along Massachusetts' coast, including the Boston area, records that were just set in early January thanks to the ""Bomb Cyclone"" that whipped through the area. There's a major difference between that storm and this one, even though both are intensifying rapidly enough to be called meteorological bombs. Unlike with the ""Bomb Cyclone,"" which moved through quickly, a high pressure area over Greenland (also known as a ""Greenland block"") will keep the current storm system pinned in place for days. This means the storm will last through several high tide cycles along the North Atlantic coast, making damage more likely.

COREY KILGANNON,"“He said that when we got to 1,000 coasters, we’d stop,” she said, “and conveniently, he forgot.” They visited 125 last year, Mr. Lewison said, and this year’s expeditions have ranged from New Zealand to the Jersey Shore. In coming months, they plan on hitting amusement parks in the Middle East and Vietnam, not to mention the Halloween festivities at Great Adventure in New Jersey. They have traveled to China six times and ridden more than 150 coasters there, said Mr. Lewison, who recently tried planning a marathon trip to a series of obscure Chinese parks involving constant flights. “But my wife said, ‘We’re going to die in a plane crash and people will say, ‘What were they thinking?’” he said Mr. Lewison grew up in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., cutting his teeth on smaller rides at nearby Palisades Park — which is long gone — and then on coasters such as Lightnin’ Loops at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, the Dragon Coaster at Rye Playland in Westchester County, and the Cyclone in Coney Island. His obsession blossomed by age 13 when he traveled to Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Va., and rode the Loch Ness Monster 22 times in one day, he said. His coaster craze cooled after hearing about the fire in 1984 that killed eight teenagers at the Haunted Castle at Six Flags, but it resurfaced while he pursued a doctorate in business in the 1990s at the University of Pittsburgh, thanks to the coasters at nearby Kennywood amusement park.

Katherine Lam,"A “bomb cyclone” wreaking havoc in the Northeast on Thursday unleashed dangerous flooding in Boston and unprecedented high tides along the Massachusetts coast, trapping drivers in cars “floating” through ice-slushed streets covered in mini ""icebergs."" High tide started to peak Thursday afternoon, with the height tying the one set during the blizzard of 1978, Boston25 reported. The National Weather Service compared the flooding to that set during that historic blizzard, and said Thursday’s storm brought in “some of the worst [to Boston] in recent history.” Boston firefighters wading through a street flooded from tidal surge. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder) In Boston's Seaport district, Joe Weatherly, a 40-year-old artist from Los Angeles, held his Boston terrier while searching for a seafood restaurant. Part of the district was flooded. ""For someone in California, this is really, really scary. Mind-blowing,"" he said. ""We don't live in a state where things shut down with the weather. I've just never seen this much snow in my life."" Boston Fire Department tweeted photos of flooded streets and firefighters braving hurricane-force winds while rescuing a man trapped in his water. Boston25 reporter Jason Solowski called it a “big soupy mess” in Boston, while Jacob Long showed his soaked legs after moving through flooded sidewalks. “Word to the wise. Flooded sidewalks can be deeper than they appear. Went to help a woman get across the street to her car and stepped off a big curb. The water is freeeeeeeeezing. Time to change,” Long tweeted. Quincy police said officers rescued at least 20 people as of Thursday afternoon, warning drivers to stay off the roads by using the hashtag “don’t drown, turn around.” In Chatham, several cars were seen “floating” through the street while water rose through a barrier island and reach a condo complex, according to Masslive.com. The storm knocked out power to more than 5,500 homes and businesses Thursday morning in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the outermost tip of Cape Cod, which was being lashed with hurricane-force wind gusts, the Eversource electric utility said. Much of that power was restored by early afternoon. The storm system left at least three people dead in North Carolina from vehicle crashes. Two men died Wednesday night when their truck overturned into a creek in Moore County southwest of the Raleigh-Durham area. Sgt. Michael Baker identified the two killed to The Associated Press as the driver, 57-year-old Michael Alexander Wilson, and a passenger, 73-year-old Jerry David Wilson. Both were from Bear Creek.

https://www.facebook.com/markberman,"BOSTON — It began with a gentle dusting, a flutter of flakes falling on this city already enduring a bitterly cold winter. “This isn’t bad,” said Richie Bianchino, 30, after he parked his car Thursday at a covered mass transit garage. He was wearing a hoodie and no gloves. “We’ve just had a bunch of days near zero. This feels good.” The peaceful start didn’t last. As the day wore on, the mammoth winter storm churning up the East Coast had pummeled Boston with driving snow and painful sleet as it continued marching north, sweeping across population center after population center. As much as 14 inches fell in Greater Boston on Thursday, leaving more than 24,000 without power by late afternoon as the storm caused what officials called a “historic high tide” to flood coastal towns. The storm dumped more than a foot of snow in areas from Virginia to New Hampshire, swamping millions with a one-two-three punch of heavy snowfall, gusting winds and coastal flooding. All across the Northeast, routines of daily life were brought to a standstill Thursday as schools and offices shut down, roadways were left impassable and nearly 5,000 flights were grounded. Hundreds of flights scheduled for Friday were called off as well. [ Historic ‘bomb cyclone’ unleashes blizzard conditions from coastal Virginia to New England. Frigid air to follow. ] In New England, officials worried not only about the snow, but also the wind gusts — topping 40 mph at Boston’s airport and reaching as high as 76 mph on Nantucket — that brought down power lines, leaving people without heat or power before the temperatures are forecast to plummet on Friday and into the weekend. A region already weary of the cold — the high temperature has not been above freezing since Christmas — will now face at least a couple days below zero. “After the storm’s over, the commonwealth will immediately see a return to the bitter cold temperatures of the past few days, which will cause freezing conditions on top of the storm,” Gov. Charlie Baker (R) said at a briefing Thursday. “We’re all hardy New Englanders, but it’s pretty important for everybody to pay attention and be prepared.” The storm strengthened Thursday into a “ bomb cyclone,” the dramatic name for what happens when a storm’s pressure plummets as it explosively intensifies. Though forecasters said this storm was among the most powerful ever observed on the East Coast, much of the cyclone actually remained in the Atlantic Ocean as it lashed the coastal states. After the snow has moved out of New England by Friday, arctic air will descend upon the Eastern Seaboard, plunging temperatures into the single digits and teens in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and New England. When the flakes fell in the Northeast on Thursday — a day after Southern states got an unusual coating of snow — some welcomed the sight. In New York, while flights were suspended at both LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports, the Times Square area was clogged with snow as wind whipped the flakes across the bright electronic billboards looming overhead. Tourists still showed up, taking selfies and throwing snowballs despite the harsh conditions. Casey and Austin Sergent, a brother and sister from Columbus, Ga., braved the elements to line up at the TKTS booth so they could purchase tickets for a Thursday matinee of “The Phantom of the Opera.” “It’s beautiful,” said Casey, 20, who was visiting New York for the first time. “I’m amazed that everything functions here, unlike Columbus, where everything shuts down when it snows.” [ The winter storm brought ice and snow to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas first ] Not everything functioned, of course. School systems from Florida to Massachusetts were closed, canceling classes in major school districts including the District and its suburbs, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Government offices closed down or let employees come in late as they trudged through snow, slush and salt. In New York City, at Tom’s Restaurant — the diner with an exterior made famous by the show “Seinfeld” — cabdriver Brooks Sissay gave himself the day off. He hunkered down at the diner’s counter with a cup of coffee and a pile of newspapers. “I’m 68 years old and I can’t do it any more,” Sissay said. “I might have driven in the snow when I was younger, but not now.” Brian Robinson, escorting a group of high school students from West Texas on a class trip to Boston, wanted them to soak up the frigid climate while they were there. “We want as much snow as we can get and as cold as it can get,” Robinson said. “It’s the experience.” The students shared that enthusiasm. “I’ve never seen snow before!” exclaimed Erynne Turner, 18, a student. “We made a snow angel this morning,” said Hannah Glass, also 18. Authorities pleaded with people to stay off of roads due to the icy conditions. At least three deaths have been attributed to the storm. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said Thursday that three men died, all of them in trucks that overturned. State troopers have responded to more than 1,000 calls since the storm began, more than 700 of them involving car collisions, Cooper said. “With the freezing temperatures, the black ice will be an ongoing concern through the weekend,” Cooper said at a news briefing. “You can make the job of our first responders and our road crews a lot easier by staying off the roads unless it is absolutely necessary.” First responders found difficult conditions when they tried heading out Thursday. About 35 miles south of Boston, fire officials in Duxbury, Mass., said a firefighter was taken to a hospital after crashing while responding to a report of a building fire. Fire officials there also were making “several water rescues,” the department said. The storm pushed historically high tides to flood over coastlines in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, authorities said. Streets along the Boston coastline were awash by midday, flooding that came as the tide swelled so high that some vessels were brought up to street level alongside the city’s Seaport area, according to the Massachusetts State Police. Water flowed down the streets in Scituate, Marshfield, Plum Island, Dorchester and other Massachusetts communities, and police and fire personnel carried people get out of water-stranded cars and low-lying apartments. “We were in the office when all of a sudden the water started coming in,” said Gina Cameron, 36, who works at the Boston Harbor Cruise company at Boston Harbor. “We had to scramble to get the computers up high.” [ How climate change could counterintuitively feed some winter storms ] Officials in New England attacked the snow cleanup with urgency, eyeing the sharp drop in temperatures that would quickly turn slushy snow coating the roads into ice. Most people around Boston huddled in their homes, but those who live on the streets looked for safety. In the St. Francis shelter in downtown Boston, Bo Revera, the shelter manager, was a man in motion. “We just saved a guy’s life with Narcan, we recovered a stolen cellphone, and we’re serving lunch,” he said, referring to the use of an opioid overdose antidote drug, as men and women streamed through the metal detector seeking a hot meal. “It’s just too bad out there,” said Troy Savage, a 21-year-old who said he has been on the streets for two years. In Cambridge, Mass., normally busy sidewalks were largely empty. Dry cleaners and beauty shops were closed, while Inman Square Hardware was busy Thursday morning with people buying rock salt and shovels. At the nearby 1369 Coffee House, lifelong Cambridge resident Terry Carter came in for his hot caramel apple cider before he expected to shovel snow for others later in the day. “I’m used to this weather,” Carter said. “This is like the perfect day.” Despite the cold and ice, it was business as usual for some stores in Hartford, Conn., where bright “OPEN” signs were the only things visible amid blinding snow. Pauline Taylor, a CVS employee, had been working at the store since 7 a.m. Thursday and was shrugging off the snowstorm as just another winter day in New England. “I got my boots, big coat and long johns. It’s fine,” Taylor said. “We never close unless the electricity goes.” Jesse Macauley, a 37-year-old student from New York City, sat at the bar Thursday at the Burlington Airport, about to catch one of the few flights out of Vermont. He had been in New England visiting family and was headed to Lake Tahoe, where he grew up. He felt as though he was escaping another arctic blast — which is expected to drop temperatures 40 degrees below normal by the weekend — but much of the past week or so has been frigid in Vermont. It was a relatively balmy 18 degrees outside the airport on Thursday. “I do feel like I’m escaping,” he said. “This is the coldest weather I’ve ever experienced in my life. I never thought 23 above zero would be a pleasant temperature.” Berman reported from Washington.

"kloria@techinsider.io (Kevin Loria), Kevin Loria","NOAA/NASA Goddard Rapid Response Team The end of November marks the official end of Atlantic hurricane season — 97% of tropical cyclone activity occurs in the six-month between June and November. That's a relief after an intense few months of destructive storms. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was a top-10 hurricane season by most metrics. It set a few all-time records as well. The chart below shows how 2017 stacks up to other years, thanks to data collected by meteorologists at Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project. How Atlantic storms in 2017 compare to other seasons on major metrics. Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project The season was ""extremely active"", to use the National Hurricane Center's technical term. In an ""extremely active"" year, storms have to generate at least 152.5 units of accumulated cyclone energy — a measure of storm intensity, duration, and frequency. 2017 hit 226, mostly due to storms in August and September, when Harvey, Irma, and Maria devastated parts of the Caribbean and US. An ""extremely active"" season also has to meet two out of these three conditions: 13 or more named storms, seven or more hurricanes, and three or more major hurricanes. We hit all three, with 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. Puerto Rico is still trying to recover from Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit the island since 1928. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Here are some of the all-time records set this year, according to CSU: September broke all-time records for the number of storm days, hurricane days, and major hurricane days. There were 40.25 hurricane days, since the days of each storm are counted separately. September 8 set the one-day record for accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), thanks the combined forces of Hurricanes Irma, Jose, and Katia. September also broke the record for most ACE in a month. Irma's maximum sustained wind speed of 185 mph made it the strongest storm that's ever existed in the Atlantic, outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. (Including those regions, it's the second strongest after Allen, which reached 190 mph). Irma set a record for maintaining that same intensity for 37 hours, longer than any other storm on the globe. Harvey broke the record for most rainfall from a tropical cyclone in the US, with more than 60 inches of rain falling at two measuring stations in Southeast Texas. This was the first known year that two Category 4 storms made landfall in the continental US: Irma and Harvey. Maria was the first Category 5 storm to hit Dominica and the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. Overall, it was a rough year — one that exceeded forecasters' expectations, even though most called for an above-average season. The exact factors that made it so active are still under investigation, though warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures likely played a role, since that allows storms to pick up intensity. A lack of strong wind shear, which can break apart storms, is considered a factor. Hurricanes can still happen after November ends, however. As the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notes, ""there is nothing magical in these dates.""",NOAA/NASA Goddard Rapid Response Team The end of November marks the official end of Atlantic hurricane season — 97% of tropical cyclone activity occurs in the six-month between June and November.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Tonga Women's Rugby League Image caption Rugby League has emerged as a popular sport among women in Tonga Tonga's prime minister has reversed a ministry decision that appeared to ban girls from playing rugby in schools. There was outrage in the Pacific nation this week after a girls' high school rugby team was withdrawn from a competition because of their gender. An official letter said that sports such as rugby and boxing went against Tongan women's dignity and culture. Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva responded by saying that the letter did not represent official government policy. He said that the government ""actively encourages the participation of every Tongan student in all sports without discrimination"". ""It is, however, for the individual students and their parents to decide whether or not they should participate in a particular sport like rugby and boxing,"" the prime minister added. Earlier in the week, the Ministry of Education and Training said it had taken the decision in order to ""preserve the dignity of Tongan women and hold on to Tongan cultural values"". The decision was widely criticised, including by Fehoko Tu'ivai, president of the Tonga Women's Rugby Association. ""How can we teach our girls to be independent when we keep making choices for them?"" she asked, quoted by TV New Zealand.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Large parts of Nebraska and the U.S. Central Plains were underwater on Saturday after a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm triggered historic flooding along the Missouri and Platte rivers, causing two deaths, tearing apart homes and swallowing roadways. 
The National Weather Service predicted dangerous flooding would continue through the weekend in Nebraska and in south and west central Iowa, particularly along the Missouri River. 
“We’re still in a very widely dispersed and intense flooding situation in the eastern third of Nebraska,” said Mike Wight, a spokesman for the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a phone interview. 
Nebraska has had two flood-related fatalities this week, Wight said. One person died at home after failing to evacuate, although the exact cause of death was unclear, authorities said, and the other was swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
The Missouri River was still rising on Saturday evening, local TV station KMTV reported, with a record crest of more than 47 feet expected early on Tuesday in Brownville, Nebraska, about 70 miles south of Omaha in the eastern corner of the state. 
“We’re looking at 4, 5, 6, 7 feet above the highest it’s ever been,” Wight said. 
The flooding came in the wake of what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm blew from the western Rockies to the Central Plains last week. 
The rising water has reduced stores and homes to rubble and ripped off a long chunk of a highway bridge, according to photos posted on Twitter by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Ranchers posted images on social media of their cattle being dug out of snowdrifts or stranded in fields. 
The flooding has all but blocked access to some small communities along the river, where potable drinking water has become scarce as the flood has contaminated wells, Wight said. 
Ricketts visited several flooded communities on Saturday and wrote on Twitter that he witnessed “unbelievable devastation.” 
“The whole state is pulling together as we respond to and recover from the ongoing #NebraskaFlood! #NebraskaStrong,” the governor tweeted.

Reuters Editorial,"BEIRA, Mozambique (Reuters) - The situation in the port city of Beira in Mozambique was “boiling” as residents suffered shortages of food, water and other essentials one week after a devastating cyclone, the head of a South African rescue operation said on Friday. 
Cyclone Idai battered Beira, a low-lying city of 500,000 residents, with strong winds and torrential rains last week, before moving inland to neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi. 
In Mozambique, 242 were killed in the storm and resulting floods, according to the official death toll, although this is expected to rise. In Malawi, around 56 were killed while Zimbabwe has recorded 142 deaths. 
Around 15,000 people were still missing in Mozambique, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said late on Thursday. The government is expected to give a briefing on Friday morning to update the number of people missing and dead. 
Briefing his team late on Thursday night, Connor Hartnady, rescue operations task force leader for Rescue South Africa, said Beira residents were becoming fed up with shortages. 
“There have been three security incidents today, all food related,” he told his team, without giving further details. 
Cartnady also said a group of 60 people had been discovered trapped by flood water in an area north of Beira during a reconnaissance flight. Rescue teams and the government were deciding how best to help them, he said, either by airlifting them to safety or dropping supplies. 
The storm’s torrential rains caused the Buzi and Pungwe rivers, whose mouths are in the Beira area, to burst their banks. 
Roads into Beira were cut off by the storm, and most of the city remains without power. The Red Cross has estimated 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed in the storm. 
Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Information said at least 30 students, two headmasters and a teacher from three schools were missing in the eastern region of the country. 
In the capital Harare there were shortages of diesel, leading to long queues following reports earlier this week that a control room for the pipeline in Beira that transports fuel to Zimbabwe had been damaged.

Andrew Freedman,"A major developing storm is taking shape along the Mid-Atlantic coast, and it's proving to be quite the illusionist. Residents of New York City woke up to a mixture of light rain and snow, and questioned whether the storm forecast was a ""bust."" But computer model guidance has been consistent in showing extremely heavy snowfall moving into the Philadelphia metro area, northern New Jersey, New York City, and then up into Connecticut and Massachusetts beginning Wednesday afternoon. This will occur as the storm ""bombs out,"" or undergoes the process of rapid intensification known as bombogenesis. SEE ALSO: What is bombogenesis? In other words, the storm's effects as of Wednesday morning are not WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), to use an old school internet term. Instead, it's trying to lure folks into a false sense of complacency, draw them into work or school, and then make the evening commute impossible. Model projections, for example, show an unusually strong signal for thundersnow across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast associated with this storm. In meteorologist-speak, this storm has strong dynamics associated with it. In normal person vernacular, that means this storm means business, and will bring surprisingly heavy rates of snowfall once it gets going in earnest by early to mid-afternoon in the big cities. The snowfall forecast has been a major challenge, particularly in New York and Boston, where relatively mild air from the ocean could keep snow from sticking or turn precipitation over to rain for a time. However, dynamical cooling from strong lifting of the air aloft and heavy precipitation dragging down cooler air from above should overcome milder temperatures in most areas. That happened in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday night, when rain suddenly switched over to big, fat flakes of snow and stinging sleet accompanied by thunder. Consider, though, the snowfall forecast for New York, where media outlets and the Weather Service are expecting a big difference in accumulations between JFK International Airport in Queens, which is right on the ocean, and Central Park. The Weather Channel, for example, has been predicting 12 to 18 inches will fall in Central Park, while just about 6 inches will fall at JFK, which is located only about 15 miles. Finally, here is a huge warning sign for later. This morning we are seeing significant CAPE values and convective lifting in the mid levels. If this translates this afternoon in precipitation rates, you have 3""+ snowfalls over these regions. pic.twitter.com/EdbhA9KDdw — NY NJ PA Weather (@nynjpaweather) March 7, 2018 The fact that forecasters can now zero in on transition zones with such precision is an example of how far meteorology, aided by powerful computing technology, has come in recent years. However, poor communication of large forecast ranges has led to some media headlines that ruffled feathers in the meteorology community, since large ranges in forecast accumulations is not the same as saying ""we just don't know."" The storm presents a major communications challenge for weather forecasters to make clear that the evening commute in major cities could be downright impossible due to heavy snowfall rates. During past storms, New York City has ground to a sudden halt once snowfall rates reached 2 to 3 inches per hour for even just a couple of hours, putting lives in danger and complicating commutes of all kinds. Similar events in Washington, D.C. have proven that storms involving a benign morning commute followed by a harrowing evening commute can result in stuck cars and commuters overnight. New York City's public schools remained open on Wednesday, for example, suggesting that the authorities may have underestimated the storm's potential to cause havoc. ⚠️ NYC Public Schools will be open tomorrow, Wednesday, March 7, 2018. Afterschool programs will continue as planned. Field trips using yellow bus service will be cancelled. https://t.co/6IAR8fbZYB — NYC Public Schools (@NYCSchools) March 6, 2018 This storm is striking New England right on the heels of an even stronger and slower-moving storm that battered the region beginning on March 1. Coastal flooding from that storm caused serious damage in eastern Massachusetts, including breaching seawalls, weakening coastal homes, and flooding numerous homes and businesses. While this storm won't be as bad, coastal flood warnings are in effect for eastern Massachusetts, as strong onshore winds will ensure that a remarkably prolonged period of flooding continues. In addition, thousands of people still don't have their power back after the previous storm, either, and this event will bring even more wet snow that could take out trees and power lines. This could extend power outages — particularly in inland areas that pick up the most snow — from days to more than a week. This is a developing storm and story.

Jen Karner,"Keep an eye on the weather with these apps! In today's world, we've gotten used to seeing the weather change with little or no notice. From flash floods and hurricanes to knowing precisely how hot — or cold — it is outside, having an app on your side can make all the difference. There are plenty of weather apps available from Google Play, but we've got the best of the bunch for you here! 1Weather 1Weather has always been a beautiful weather app, featuring one of the best dark themes we have encountered… but that dark theme is now broken up with Material Design's bland white cards. These cards aren't themeable like the rest of the app, as you can change the background theme, you can change the icon set from white to black, and you can theme the widgets a multitude of ways… but we can't switch the cards from white back to that beautiful black. Functionally, there are very few flaws we've found in our extended use of 1Weather, and most of them can be attributed to the horizontal, tabbed layout 1Weather uses, such as the disconnect between reaching the map and interacting with it, as you have to tap an expand button before you can zoom or move the map. There are ads in 1Weather that can be removed with a one-time in-app purchase. It even has Android Wear support, though rather than an app it comes in the form of three-card notifications for current conditions and immediate forecast and one-card notifications for alerts, each with customized background images. Download: 1Weather (free with in-app purchases) Yahoo Weather Yahoo takes the honor in this humble writer's eyes for being the prettiest weather app, but when it comes to weather apps, pretty can't be all it has. Yahoo Weather is powered by Weather Underground, so its forecasts and data have the accuracy of its nationwide network of personal weather stations. The background images for the app are pulled from Flickr, Yahoo's picture service, so if you're looking at picturesque locations like New York City or Walt Disney World, you're likely to get a new and beautiful image every time to go into the app. If you're in a more remote location, those pictures will be more generic. The layout for Yahoo Weather is nice if you like to check multiple locations quickly, as you scroll up and down for the data about one location, then scroll side to side to switch between locations. Download: Yahoo Weather (free) Dark Sky Dark Sky is one of the most popular weather apps available, its claim to fame is that its ""hyperlocal"" accuracy can tell you within minutes of when it's actually going to rain. In addition to that, it's got your basic weather information — current temperature, highs, and lows, what it actually feels like, etc. You also get precipitation information, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. You can get detailed information on the week ahead, hour by hour. A handy map feature shows you where the rain (and snow) is worldwide, at any given time. And you've got a wealth of notification options, including a daily summary, next-hour precipitation, severe weather alerts, and custom alerts based on your own variables. Dark Sky also features a dedicated do not disturb mode so you won't be bothered in the middle of the night (but as someone living in Tornado Alley, I highly advise against it). Download: Dark Sky (free) The Weather Channel The Weather Channel app has undergone some changes in recent times, and most of them have improved the app greatly. The layout is much slicker and simpler than before, having ditched its previous UI for one big, long continuous scroll. As you scroll you get to more detailed information, like daily forecasts, radar, even social options and what the weather is like at some ski resorts. The Weather Channel is one of the most well-known sources of forecast information on the planet, and their latest Android app takes out the complicated and makes it ultra simple to see what you need to see. Download: The Weather Channel (free) Arcus Weather If you like to plan your day down to the minute, or you're looking at being outdoors for an extended period of time, having access to the most accurate weather possible is handy.

Every location, whether it's your house or what the weather will look like at your Mom's place halfway across the country, displays tons of information. This includes the distance from incoming precipitation, sunrise and sunset times, and a graphs for incoming precipitation.

Tim Donnelly,"I am, to be clear, a believer in the power of putting arbitrary constraints on yourself in order to achieve something. It’s why I make to-do lists (and write “make to-do list” at the top of the list, for an immediate hit of accomplishment), why I demand deadline even when writing an evergreen story and why I agree self-improvement doesn’t just manifest itself out of thin air without a little bit of nudge from an app or a calendar or some sort of Black Mirror drone with axes for fingers that literally chases you out of bed to start your morning run. I am also, however, a complete skeptic of schemes that are doomed to fail: the friend who keeps getting back with that boyfriend they’ve already broken up with six times before, gimmick diets that don’t involve eating vegetables, seeing any more of the Alien sequels. I am an avowed hater of New Year’s resolutions for that reason: they are all doomed to fail and everyone knows it. This is in part because many of them are trendy, faux-wellness commitments people jump on board with because everyone is already doing it, and then give up on two weeks later when everyone else is giving up as well. But my anti-resolution stance also has to do with the timing. January is nature’s perfect resolution-killing machine. Last week, for instance, the bomb cyclone (or whatever hot #rebrand for the concept of “winter storm” you prefer), dumped a huge ol’ mess of snow and brought whipping winds to a lot of the East Coast, from Boston to Savannah. Let’s say you had resolved just four days earlier to go to the gym more, eat better and quit drinking for a month (the trend whose name is too monstrous of a portmanteau for me to even acknowledge here). Cyclone-snowbound, you would have found yourself with a big bag of fuck-all to do that day, and mounting guilt for not overpowering nature itself in order to forge ahead with your resolutions. January is the month for getting your house in order, and no aspect of one’s life gets quite so… Read more Read So consider this: if you still prefer the resolution model of self-improvement, in which you adhere to specific challenges that begin on a specific date, don’t start those resolutions in January. Start them on April 1st instead. Winter is the time your body craves sloth. You are evolutionarily predisposed to put on weight and store calories to avoid risk of starvation during the cold, fallow months. The outside is a slushy, gray, increasingly bleak landscape of growing garbage-bag snow mountains, as uninviting to human presence as a Kevin Spacey movie. Over the past two winters, America became obsessed with the Danish concept of Hygge, essentially extreme coziness. This is because winter is hell, and the only thing that makes it tolerable is leaning into the coziness it allows. Pour yourself a cup of mulled wine and invite your friends over to play Rocket League for hours at a time and watch all of Riverdale (I hear it’s weird!). Self-motivation will come soon, a few months down the road. Think about it like eating seasonally (something you should be doing anyway for the good of the environment). The earth gives you things you need according to the season: in the summer, we get juicy berries, watermelon, cucumbers and so forth to keep us cool and hydrated. The winter gives us hearty squashes, potatoes and beets to help store calories, and the spring brings leafy greens to help you detox after the hibernation months. January is the squash of months. You can fight the natural order of things, and ship in berries (a.k.a. “resolutions”) from far away, but they won’t taste right, and you’re fighting against biology and the earth itself. Develop your taste for berries when they are in season, however, and you’ll easily be hooked. Just as important as setting New Year’s resolutions is figuring out how we reach them, and not… Read more Read The point is, treat your body seasonally, too. If you must make a resolution, don’t waste it on January, when you almost certainly won’t succeed, and—since you have subscribed to the concept of an annual resolution—your whole year will then be considered a wash. Make your resolutions on April 1st, when you have a fighting chance of achieving them. Why April specifically? March drops a teaser trailer for spring ahead but it’s also a torrent of a month, full of late-season blizzards and brutal cold snaps. But April, friends, April is when the world turns around and the cobwebs clear. It’s time to shape up and shake off the winter doldrums. Nature comes back to life and so do you. April 1st is the perfect day to squeeze into some running tights (yes it will still be slightly chilly—you’re getting a jump on the spring, you go-getter!), dust off your bike and get moving again. The days are longer so your solar batteries get a natural boost (sunset Jan. 1: 4:39 p.m.; Sunset April 1: 7:21 p.m.!). And in the unlikely event that the gym is still full of January’s resolution-havers, too, you can also go running outdoors again. And if you wish to quit drinking for a month or quit smoking forever, April is the time to do it because there is simply much more to do once the world comes back to life. Instead of drinking, perhaps you join a kickball league like Brooklyn hipsters of yore, or become one of those people obsessed with photographing the cherry blossoms at your local botanic garden, or just go for long walks and take that kind of deep inhale to let that still-warming spring air fill your lungs as you recall the winter misery behind you and think: “This, this is the spring I turn myself around.” Relax this winter and wrap yourself in Hygge or whatever comforts you can find to get you through this most miserable month in one of the most miserable times in history. In April, let’s get to work.","I am, to be clear, a believer in the power of putting arbitrary constraints on yourself in order to achieve something.

https://fox13now.com/facebook/,"(CNN) — A potential tropical cyclone is looking to wreak havoc on Central America in the next few days. Known as “Potential Tropical Cyclone 14” by the National Hurricane Center, the storm is expected to form in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Sunday, with heavy rains heading for western Cuba. Track the storm The system is expected to become a tropical depression late Saturday or Sunday and become a tropical storm by Sunday night, the center said. On the current forecast track, the center said the system is expected to move across the Yucatan Channel near the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula through Sunday night, and then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico on Monday. There is a tropical storm watch for the coast of Mexico from Tulum to Cabo Catoche, where tropical storm conditions are possible Sunday and Monday. There is also a tropical storm warning for the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth. Currently, the storm is moving north at 7 mph. It is 120 miles south of Cozumel, Mexico, and is 240 miles south-southwest of the western tip of Cuba, according to the hurricane center’s 11 p.m. ET update Saturday. The storm may also produce 3 to 7 inches of rain in western Cuba and 2 to 4 inches over the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize and northern Honduras through Tuesday. Western Cuba could see isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches, the center said.

Rebecca Hersher,"A satellite image from Wednesday morning shows a powerful storm system heading east across the U.S. The storm is expected to bring high winds, snow and rain to much of the central U.S. in the coming days.
GOES-East/NOAA
When a storm gets very intense very quickly, it gets a very special, very scary name: bomb cyclone.
And just such a storm has arrived in the central U.S.
The powerful system is already bringing high winds, rain and snow to an enormous chunk of the country, including the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region. The National Weather Service has issued high wind and winter storm advisories for an area ranging from Colorado and New Mexico over to Nebraska and parts of Texas, and up to South Dakota.
""This will be one of the strongest wind events in years for West Texas and Southeast New Mexico,"" warned the National Weather Service office in Midland, Texas, with gusts up to 75 miles per hour on Wednesday.
Winds that powerful can make it impossible to drive safely, especially in tall vehicles such as trucks.
The storm could also cause flooding, as rain falls on accumulated snow and rivers clogged with ice begin to rise. Unlike wind, flood risk can last days or even weeks as rivers crest.
On Wednesday morning, some roads were already flooded in the northeastern part of Nebraska, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning, saying more rain is expected later in the day.
In the Denver area, blowing snow could cause dangerous blizzard conditions. On Twitter, the weather service warned residents to ""cancel any travel plans Wednesday afternoon and evening."" Colorado Public Radio reports that the storm could be the most intense storm ever recorded in the area, with the barometric pressure dropping a walloping 23 millibars in just one day.
Barometric pressure is the pressure of the air in the atmosphere, and it changes when the weather changes. A drop in the barometric pressure generally accompanies ""bad weather"": wind, thunder, snow and rain.
When the barometric pressure drops a lot over a short period of time, the bad weather is especially severe. As NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee reported during one of last year's bomb cyclones, this can happen when masses of cold and warm air collide:
""That's where the word 'bomb' comes in, says Jeff Weber, a climatologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 'We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone.' The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic midlatitude cyclone.""
A bomb cyclone on the East Coast around this time last year killed multiple people, shut down train and plane service and knocked out power to about 2 million people.
Scientists are still studying how bomb cyclones in recent years are, or aren't, affected by the larger trend of global climate change. The increasingly wide undulations of the jet stream the wind highway that blows from west to east around the Northern Hemisphere has allowed for more extreme temperature fluctuations in the continental U.S. And sea surface temperatures, which have been steadily rising, also affect the intensity of storms.
But, says climate scientist Jonathan Martin of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ""There isn't a direct link between the slowly changing climate and this event."" 
Although this storm is ""rather unusually intense,"" he notes, ""these things come around every few years.""","The storm is bringing high winds, snow, rain and dangerous road conditions.

Matthew S. Schwartz,"A massive spring storm is bringing blizzard conditions to several central U.S. states, leading officials to close hundreds of schools and hundreds of miles of roads.
NASA/NOAA GOES Project
Interstates were closed for hundreds of miles in the Midwest and Plains Thursday, as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought a major winter storm to states in those regions. Some towns that just days ago were experiencing sunshine and temperate weather are now under one or two feet of snow.
Most of Nebraska and South Dakota remained under a blizzard warning Thursday afternoon, as snow continued to cause dangerous conditions. Minnesota, Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Upper Peninsula face a winter storm warning. Eastern North Dakota is under a flood warning.
Parts of South Dakota have seen up to 18 inches of snow, and ""thunder snow"" snow that falls alongside the crash of thunder and the flash of lightning was also reported in the central part of the state. ""It's essentially a thunderstorm, but it's cold enough for snow,"" Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist, told the Associated Press.
Minnesota has faced snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Hundreds of schools canceled classes Thursday. More than 200 accidents were reported throughout the state. A video from the Minnesota Department of Transportation shows every power line down along a strength of Highway 59 near Fulda, in the southeastern side of the state.
In Minnesota, the bad weather will continue through Friday, with winds gusting more than to 50, according to the National Weather Service.
Some of the snow might be tinted orange, the Twin Cities NWS said. ""The color is likely due to dust that was blown by high winds all the way from west Texas.""
Whiteout conditions were reported Wednesday night northeast of Denver to the Nebraska state line, Colorado Public Radio reported. Some major roads were closed for hundreds of miles because of poor visibility and blowing snow. Colorado DOT closed 150 miles of Interstate 76, and Interstate 70 was closed between Kansas and the Denver metro area, CPR said.
In Nebraska, Interstate 80 and Highway 30 were closed on Thursday morning between Lexington and Wyoming a distance of about 200 miles.
AS NPR's Bill Chappell reported, ""the storm came ashore from the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and floods to Oregon"" and leading to evacuations there.
Snow in April is ""certainly not unheard of"" in many of the areas hit by this blizzard, but ""this storm is a big one, and not just for April, but any time of year,"" said Ian Livingston, a forecaster at the Washington Post.",The springtime storm is bringing blizzard conditions to states throughout the Plains and Midwest.

JACK HEALY,"As far as what condition those levees are in, and how vulnerable they are to flooding, it is almost impossible to know. According to the National Committee on Levee Safety, there are no national policies or standards on levee safety, and there is no full assessment of their condition and performance. Only 10 states keep a list of their levees, and fewer than half have a state agency responsible for levee safety.
Weve adopted this piecemeal approach, said Nicholas Pinter, a geology professor at the University of California, Davis. We built these walls up to give the illusion of protection.
From above, the lines of earthen levees that line the Missouri River in Mills County, Iowa, look like they have been decimated by a marauding army. Frigid, murky floodwater pours through huge, ragged gaps and spreads out for miles.
The countys levees held during 2011 floods that inundated towns across the Midwest, but this is different, said Mr. Hurst, the countys emergency management director.
Heavy rains from what meteorologists called a bomb cyclone storm that ripped across the plains fell onto frozen ground, and instead of soaking in, the rains and snowmelt poured into tiny creeks, tributaries and into the Missouri River.
Mr. Hurst said he watched the flow rate at one marker along the Missouri River soar from 16,000 cubic feet per second to 90,000. Water cascaded over the top of levees like a waterfall, he said, eroding the earthen banks and opening eight breaches.","At least 50 levees have been breached or overtopped by rivers engorged with late-winter rains and snowmelt, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.",2019-03-22T22:51:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","As Floods Inundate the Midwest, Many Ask: Will Our Levees Be the Next to Fail?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/us/midwest-flooding-levees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/22/us/22floods1/22floods1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,cyclone,1
Camila Domonoske,"Notes An NOAA GOES satellite image shows the massive winter storm currently affecting New England. Credit: NOAA A massive winter storm continues to travel up the East Coast, with heavy snow falling from New Jersey to Maine as road crews in Georgia are stilling cleaning up patches of ice. The ""bomb cyclone"" that's bludgeoning New England is a powerful storm, bringing bitter cold and the chance of heavy snow. The National Weather Service warns of possible blizzard conditions, with the risk of damaging, hurricane-force winds. The rate at which the storm has intensified is unusual — the Capital Weather Gang at the Washington Post called it ""astonishing."" A storm can be classified as a ""bomb cyclone,"" or a particularly fast-forming storm, if the pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm has more than doubled that pace. ""This storm's pressure tanked 53 millibars in 21 hours (and 59 millibars in 24 hours ), which puts it into the upper echelon of the most explosive East Coast storms ever observed — and perhaps even at the top,"" the Post writes. The winter storm off the East coast has deepened ~24 millibars in a mere 7 hours. It is very rare for a storm to intensify so fast (usually 24 millibars in 24 hours is the standard for a rapidly intensifying storm). For all our friends out east...stay safe! pic.twitter.com/hgT7jmcA20 — NWS Marquette (@NWSMarquette) January 4, 2018 The NWS in Boston calls this storm ""impressive, explosive"" and ""high-impact."" Thousands of flights have been canceled. Across the Northeast, schools are shuttered, salt has been spread, and local officials are pleading with residents to stay off the streets if they can. There is near-zero visibility in some of the snow bands passing over the states from New Jersey to Maine, the weather service says. As NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports, it's not just the ice and cold that authorities are worried about: ""Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy says drivers should be prepared for strong winds: 'I would ask folks who don't need to be on the highway, and this includes trucks particularly in a high-wind situation, that if you can delay that delivery or delay that travel that you do that.' ""Winds with gusts as high as 75 miles per hour are forecast for some areas. That brings the risk of power outages from downed power lines. Malloy says wind conditions may make it difficult for utility workers to quickly restore power."" Lori Mack, of member station WNPR in Connecticut, tells our newscast unit there are whiteout conditions in parts of the state. Member station WNYC reports that officials are urging New York City residents to remain indoors: ""The city's Department of Education is shuttering schools all day Thursday as the powerful nor'easter moves through the New York/New Jersey region. Many area schools are closed for the day. ""At the same time, Mayor de Blasio is urging people not to drive and to minimize their time outside. "" 'Bottom line is to take this storm very seriously. Very cold temperatures — definitely a major amount of snow — could get to be a lot more. Wind gusts up to 40 miles-per-hour — this is serious stuff. Asking all New Yorkers to take precautions.

Philip Ewing,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions holds a news conference at the Department of Justice on December 15, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images This week in the Russia investigations: Big problems for Sessions, Bannon cut adrift and Republicans search for more weapons to fire. Living on the edge A lighthouse can stand safely on a barrier island one morning and then when a big storm blows through, be teetering at land's end by the next. Following the heavy cyclone of news this week, dawn in Washington, D.C., on Saturday found Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the slippery sand — and that could also mean peril for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. An explosive New York Times scoop revealed that Sessions tried to smear then-FBI Director James Comey before he was fired. The report, by Michael Schmidt, also said President Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to lean on Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia probe, and when Sessions did recuse, the president fustigated him. Sessions offered to quit but Trump said no. So not only is Sessions persona non grata with the president — that's been the case for months. Now the public and people inside the Justice Department know Sessions was actively trying to undermine his own FBI director, as part of a pattern of conduct directed by Trump — who himself had asked Comey to lay off then-national security adviser Mike Flynn, then fired Comey, etc. All this could make life very uncomfortable for Sessions inside DOJ and with the FBI. A small but vocal coterie of House Republicans has already been calling for Sessions' head. (They have no vote but they do keep the anti-Sessions drumbeat going inside the conservative sphere.) Plus Trump did not invite Sessions to a retreat he's holding over the weekend at Camp David. Plus EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt felt comfortable enough with this state of play to wink and nod to Politico about how he'd be interested in becoming attorney general... if the job were open. What does it all mean? Sessions has been in hot water before with Trump but came through it, in part thanks to steadfast support from his longtime allies in the Senate. How strong is that firewall now? Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has said he had no plans to confirm a new attorney general. And Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., has threatened to hold up all Justice Department nominees after Sessions rescinded earlier permissive guidelines on marijuana enforcement. So if Sessions were to go for real this time, Trump might not be able to quickly and easily appoint someone else — someone not recused from the Russia probe — to wrangle the Justice Department on the president's behalf. But if the political dynamics change, that could change the play for the White House. As NPR's Carrie Johnson has reported, replacing the leadership at Justice is one way that Trump could try to control or get rid of Mueller. Bannon: Trump knew The Russia imbroglio essentially boils down to two big questions: Did people in Donald Trump's campaign conspire with the Russians who attacked the 2016 presidential election? And did Trump and his aides break the law in trying to constrain the investigation into the first question? This week brought huge developments in both threads of the story, including the news on obstruction above. That would be a lot of news in a normal week, but this was not a normal week. Separately, there was a huge development in the collusion/conspiracy thread as well: Donald Trump Jr. may have introduced his father, the then-candidate, to the Russian delegation that Trump Jr. and other aides hosted in New York in June 2016. Trump Jr. hosted a delegation of Russians at Trump Tower following messages that described an offer of help for Trump's campaign by the Russian government. Trump Jr. and others who attended have downplayed the importance of that meeting, but Steve Bannon suggests in the ubiquitous and explosive new book by Michael Wolff that it ended with an encounter between the Russians and the candidate: ""The chance that Don Jr did not walk [them] up to his father's office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero,"" as the book quotes Bannon. Comments like that, as well as other remarks about the Russia imbroglio and other matters, brought about a historic break this week between the White House and Bannon. Imagine George W. Bush casting Karl Rove into the darkness or Barack Obama dropping David Axelrod into the Potomac — that's the magnitude of the schism. What does it all mean? The political fireworks obscured the substance of Bannon's comments: Trump Jr. and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner may have known they were being ""treasonous,"" per Bannon, and the Family Trump, including Kushner and his wife, Trump's daughter Ivanka, are presumably terrified of what Mueller might uncover about their finances. The point about the in-person meeting is arguably the most significant. Trump goes back and forth about whether or not he accepts that Russia attacked the 2016 election. But he has always been consistent that neither he nor anyone in his orbit colluded with the Russians who were doing the attacking. Critics on the outside have suspected all along that Trump had to be aware at least of the overtures that aides were getting from Russians — whether he was briefed by Trump Jr. or Sessions or another campaign official such as Sam Clovis. If Trump met himself with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, that is obviously significant. All this assumes Bannon's statements are accurate. Are they? Or is all this just empty talk? That's what White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said — she slammed the falsehoods she said filled the Wolff book and specifically denied the account about a potential in-person meeting with Trump. Wolff told NPR's All Things Considered Friday that he spent about three hours in total with Trump during the campaign and after his inauguration, contradicting Trump's assertion Thursday on Twitter that ""I never spoke to him for book."" Bannon hadn't joined the campaign at the time of the Russian visit; the campaign's chairman then was Paul Manafort, who also attended the Trump Tower meeting. How could Bannon know what took place? Trump and the White House feel strongly enough about it that they not only have set Bannon adrift, they have threatened to sue Wolff's publisher in an effort to stop the book from being released. But the bell cannot be un-rung. The book was published Friday and is a best-seller on Amazon.com. The GOP resistance Trump and his allies are not taking all this lying down. Republicans have intensified a multi-axis offensive against the Justice Department and the FBI and also are using them to try to surface more material for that effort. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., speaks while flanked by and Rep. Don DeSantis, R-Fla., as he announces that his committee and the House Oversight Committee. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Item: House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., reportedly sided with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., in a showdown with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein over more material involving a senior FBI agent who was removed from the Russia investigation after the discovery of text messages that criticized Trump during the 2016 campaign. Republicans say the feds and DOJ are biased and they want more material that will help them make that case; Nunes threatened to hold Rosenstein in contempt of Congress unless he coughed it up. Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray asked Ryan for a meeting to try to head off a confrontation. But Ryan said nope, give Nunes what he wants. The Justice Department may circulate the material itself, as it did with the last batch of these text messages, or members of Congress may be the conduit by which it gets into the bloodstream. Item : FBI agents based in Little Rock, Ark., have reportedly revivified a dormant investigation into the Clinton Foundation. They're looking for evidence of shady pay-to-play-type activities from when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, as the Washington Post reported. Item : Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the chairman of Judiciary's Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have made a ""criminal referral"" to the Justice Department about Christopher Steele, the British ex-intelligence officer who compiled the infamous Trump-Russia dossier. They allege Steele has made ""false statements"" that warrant a formal inquiry. What does it all mean? There's no guarantee — as the Post and other outlets reported — that the FBI investigation in Arkansas or the ""referral"" by Grassley and Graham will result in any action, let alone criminal charges. But the press reports yield more oxygen for Republicans who say this whole saga ought to be about bias, abuse of power and the Clintons, enabling them to keep alive that counter-narrative in this never-ending saga.",A cyclone of news reshapes D.C. and spins the Russia imbroglio into a significant new direction.

Rhitu Chatterjee,"The storm spread snow and freezing rain across the Southeast on Wednesday. It's expected to intensify as it moves up the coast. Stephen B.

It will bring snow, ice, strong winds, massive storm surges and plummeting temperatures all the way up to Maine. Here is what created this monster winter storm. First, the jet stream brought cold, dry air from Canada southward this past week, casting an unusually cold spell on the entire eastern United States. That mass of cold air eventually collided with relatively warm, moist air off the southeastern coast, giving birth to this winter storm. ""Very warm air coming next to cold air mass creates a lot of energy,"" says Jeffrey B. Halverson, a climatologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. It also creates a dramatic decline in air pressure, he says. ""The pressure is going to drop very, very rapidly."" Winter weather will impact the entire East Coast today through Friday. Here are the latest expected snow totals and current winter headlines. Strong winds will accompany the snow in many locations.

""We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone."" The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic mid-latitude cyclone. This particular one has similarities to Superstorm Sandy, which hit the eastern United States in 2012. Unlike this winter storm, Sandy began as a full-fledged hurricane. ""As it moved north, it interacted with cold air and transitioned into a baroclinic mid-latitude cyclone,"" Weber says. ""And that happened literally as the eye was getting ready to make landfall."" Sandy was more powerful than this new storm, because it had more time to build up energy as it moved north from the Caribbean, he says. Nevertheless, this winter storm is expected to be very powerful. Scientists are forecasting that the air pressure in the storm will drop by ""about 50 millibars over the next 24 hours,"" says Weber. ""So this will be a big deepening and strong intensification of the storm over the next 24 hours."" ""This storm is a big, big wind-making machine,"" says Halverson. ""This is going to cause a lot of problems."" The National Weather Service predicts between 6 and 12 inches of snowfall between Virginia Beach and Boston. Northern New England could get more than 12-18 inches. Eastern Long Island and northern New England are likely to see blizzard conditions. There will also be coastal flooding and storm surges that can destroy coastal properties and cause beach erosion, especially up along the New England coastline, says Halverson. Massachusetts and Maine are likely to see widespread power outages due to gusty wind. But the storm's impacts won't end there. ""This storm is going to pull down a huge amount of arctic air,"" says Halverson. ""On Friday and Saturday, temperatures are going to be in the gutter."" Temperatures could drop down to single digits, or even below zero. ""And if you're going to be out of power, you're really going to be in trouble."" States such as Massachusetts and Maine should prepare to shelters for people, he says. ""Sheltering for warmth is going to be key, for potentially several days.""","This powerful storm was created by a cold jet stream colliding with warm air over the Atlantic. It is similar to Superstorm Sandy, but will likely cause less damage.",2018-01-03T21:20:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Scientists Warn 'Bomb Cyclone' Will Bring Strong Winds, Cold Temperatures",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/03/575340541/scientists-warn-bomb-cyclone-will-bring-strong-winds-cold-temperatures,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/03/southern-snow1_wide-e9f687e993972b78ac124ad733a64902a22dcfd9.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,cyclone,1
Andrew Freedman,"Severe weather has been hammering parts of the south central Mediterranean this week, with heavy snow falling in the Alps, torrential rains in lower elevations along with powerful winds, and high waves affecting Italy, in particular. Deadly flash flooding has also occurred in Greece, as the low pressure area sitting to that country's west vaults moisture northward around its eastern periphery. The storm system responsible for this inclement weather is just getting started, however. Computer models show the storm will become a small but powerful hybrid system with some of the characteristics of a tropical cyclone typically found in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin. SEE ALSO: Major federal climate report rebuts everything Trump administration has said about climate change Such storms, known as ""medicanes,"" are relatively rare, but not unheard of. The storm is expected to move south and east of Italy through Thursday while intensifying, and then hug the coast of Greece, where it could bring damaging winds, heavy rain, high waves, and other hazards. By late this week and into the weekend, the storm — be it a purely tropical system or a hybrid storm — will be located just southwest of the Greek coast, with heavy rain and severe thunderstorms affecting that country. During the Thursday through Saturday period, the low pressure area is forecast to move southeast of Italy, and to the west of Greece, while becoming better organized. Low atmospheric wind shear (meaning winds won't change much in direction or speed with height), is forecast for that area, and ocean surface temperatures are relatively mild. Computer model projections show a small, closed circulation system that could have subtropical to tropical characteristics, with a ring of thunderstorms and strong winds surrounding a calmer inner core. Surface wind forecast for Friday, Nov. 17, 2017. Note the donut-shaped circulation near the Greek coast. Image: weatherbell When tropical systems, either subtropical or fully tropical, occur in the Mediterranean, they are usually much smaller in area than their cousins in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, and there's actually some scientific debate over how to classify them in the first place. The structure of a storm matters because it governs how such storms may affect areas that they hit. Interestingly, medicanes typically occur during October and November, which is at the tail end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Satellite image of 2014 medicane that struck Malta. Image: eumetsat A medicane in 2014 struck Malta, bringing winds of up to 154 kilometers per hour, or 95 miles per hour. This was strong enough to knock out power, disrupt air and ferry travel, and cause other damage in three countries, according to the European satellite agency EUMETSAT. Regardless of whether this will truly become a medicane — a wet and wild few days is in store for Greece, and subsequently for Bulgaria and Turkey as well.","Severe weather has been hammering parts of the south central Mediterranean this week, with heavy snow falling in the Alps, torrential rains in lower elevations along with powerful winds, and high waves affecting Italy, in particular.

Sonia Narang,"Farmer Adi Nacoba began diversifying her crops and spreading out plantings after a cyclone destroyed her farm in 2016. Sonia Narang Inside a bustling market in the north coast town of Tavua on Fiji's largest island, farmer Adi Alesi Nacoba stacks her produce of the day. She carefully lays out eggplants, chilies, and papayas at her newspaper-lined table. The Tavua Municipal Market is a large, warehouse-like space with long rows of vendors competing fiercely for customers' attention. A few Indian-Fijian customers wander from the street towards her booth, and Nacoba, an indigenous Fijian, greets them in Hindi. She manages to sell them a pile of her green and red chili peppers, a popular ingredient for Indo-Fijian cooking. A former policewoman in her late 40s, Nacoba switched to farming about five years ago to be her own boss and earn money daily instead of waiting for bi-monthly paychecks. Then, in February 2016, the most powerful and destructive cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere struck Fiji's islands. According to the United Nations, the storm destroyed more than 30,000 homes and displaced more than 150,000 people. Cyclone Winston, a Category 5 storm, wiped out entire villages, including Nacoba's. Powerful 200 mph gusts of wind blew the roof off her home and left her farm in shambles. ""Everything I planted, it was all gone,"" Nacoba says. ""My farm was all gone."" Even after the cyclone passed, the rain did not let up, leading to flooding, major landslides and soil erosion. Scientists say warmer ocean temperatures in the South Pacific are creating more intense storms and flooding. Low-lying islands like Fiji's face some of the most severe effects of climate change. As the country begins to feel these effects, farmers there are re-thinking how they plant. A selection of eggplant for sale at the Tavua Municipal Market in Fiji. Sonia Narang Diversifying crops for food security After the storm and flooding passed, Nacoba spent the next six months getting her farm back in shape. As she rebuilt, she adopted climate-resilient techniques she learned about after attending workshops led by the United Nations Women Markets for Change program. For starters, she significantly diversified her crops by planting 27 different kinds of fruits and vegetables, making it more likely for something to survive. ""I'm trying to plant two acres of cassava, komala [sweet potato], a big tree of fruits, mango, bele [a Fijian leafy vegetable], eggplant, chilies, papaya, bora [long green beans full of cowpeas], and dalo (also known as taro)."" Planting a variety of crops is essential to climate-smart farming, says Vikash Kumar, a Fiji-based agricultural coordinator with the UN Development Program. ""Farmers are considering a triple-layered integrated farming system with some short term crops of three to four-month maturity, medium term crops such as taro and cassava, and long term crops,"" Kumar says. Despite the expert's fancy-sounding description, this technique is actually an ancient Fijian farming method. Farmers are also going back to older varieties of the popular root crop taro, which can grow more easily in a harsh climate. They are learning to adapt in other ways, too. Nacoba now staggers the planting of various crops and keeps meticulous planting records. ""I never did that before, but now I record the date that I sow the seeds, and I plan out when to harvest each one,"" she says. ""I've changed everything I do."" Banking seeds and money Kumar says it's much better for farmers to save their seeds rather than planting all of them at once. ""They must plant in phases, so that if extreme conditions happen, they do not lose huge amounts of crops,"" he says. ""Small phased planting also ensures that seeds are not wasted, and there's enough seeds left for quick planting after disasters."" Farmers are not only banking seeds, but also banking money in this new era of climate unpredictability. At Tavua market, local farmer Vasenai Ralulu took it upon herself to set up a co-op banking system for her fellow farmers. ""When I came to know that some of them are not banking, but putting their money at home, I explained they can keep aside some money in a safe place,"" Ralulu says. ""Especially with climate change or cyclones or floods, they know that the money put inside the bank is safe for them."" Sandra Bernklau, a regional specialist with UN Women in Fiji says she's seen the rise of savings clubs after the cyclone. ""I know that a lot of women farmers are saving more. They're much more conscious of having some money in the bank when things go wrong,"" she says. Another new development is terrace farming, which involves planting on the gentle slopes of hills, by creating a gradual staircase or terraces. It allows farmers to grow at different elevations. ""They have started terracing to make sure if the short crops die because of floods, there are tall crops available. If tall crops are affected by wind, there are short crops available,"" says Sashi Kiran, founder of the Fijian non-profit Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises &amp; Development (FRIEND), which supports local farmers. ""Everybody recognizes that disaster is a fact of life for us. It's very much in our face, and we can't turn around,"" Kiran says. As farmers continue learning how to harvest in a quickly changing climate, their adaptations offer a model for other storm-prone communities worldwide. Even veteran farmers at the Tavua market are beginning to adapt. Sugarcane farmer Sushil Gounder says sugarcane has passed down through her family for generations, from her grandparents all the way to her granddaughter. But excessive flooding and rising waters on her family's six acres of coastal farmland have deluged her crop. ""Half of the land is in the seawater,"" Gounder says. ""We have dug a drain, but now the drain is full. When it is high tide, all the water rises to a high level."" So she's been relying on a back-up garden, where she grows eggplant, tomatoes, and chilies. Agricultural expert Kumar says this is a smart move — a ""food bank for disasters,"" he says. As the Tavua market wraps up for the day, Nacoba packs up her leftover produce after a long, hot day of slower-than-usual sales. But she'll get right back to work on her farm at 7 a.m. tomorrow. ""I have to stand on my own two feet, I have to plant,"" Nacoba says. ""Since God gave us two hands and two legs to work and earn a living, I have to do that.""

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific. A dangerous super typhoon currently packing 170 mph winds could make landfall in Japan early next week. Typhoon Jebi, which started getting organized east of Guam on August 27, exploded to life over the last few days, intensifying from a Category 1 to a Category 5-equivalent storm between August 29-30. Currently located 300 miles northwest of Saipan, Jebi is moving northwest at 16 miles per hour, continuing its trek over open ocean into the weekend before making an expected northward veer early next week. That turn will place it on a direct course for mainland Japan. Recent model runs show a high chance of the storm making landfall near Kyoto, potentially as a powerful typhoon. “Jebi was in a fairly classic environment for rapid strengthening,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email, citing warm ocean waters and favorable upper level wind conditions. “Its forecast track is also a textbook case of recurvature,” with initial movement toward the west or northwest before curving around to the north at mid-latitudes. Henson added that because Japan’s islands run southwest to northeast, “a small change in the track could have a big impact on exactly where Jebi makes landfall.” East of Shioku and south of Honshu, the storm could kick up waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high as it approaches Japan, creating a hazard for ships, according to AccuWeather. But the real concern is the impact on the heavily populated areas within the storm’s forecast cone of uncertainty, including Tokyo. Flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds are all possible impacts. If this feels familiar, it is because we’ve been here before. Japan has already seen heavy rainfall associated with two typhoons, a tropical depression and a tropical storm this month, AccuWeather notes. In July, western and central Japan experienced historic rainfall and deadly landslides brought on in part with Typhoon Prapiroon, with Typhoon Maria following closely on its heels and delivering even more rain to the nation’s southern Ryukyu islands. With northern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity often peaking in September and lasting through November, Japan may not be out of the woods for a while.","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific.

MJ Franklin,"This post is part of Mashable's Spring Cleaning Week. Just a little something to distract you from the eternal dread of constantly wiping all those fingerprints off your screen. Aaaahhh! Spring is finally here (I think?) after what feels like approximately a million years of winter in the northeast thanks to a bomb cyclone, a nor'easter, whatever the hell a bombogenesis is, oh look another nor'easter, plot twist: a third nor'easter. HOPE Y'ALL REALLY LOVE NOR'EASTERS BECAUSE WE GOT YET ANOTHER ONE. Fortunately with the new season comes the opportunity to break out of hibernation, face the sun, and, as Maxine Waters would say, 👏 reclaim 👏 our 👏 time. 👏 SEE ALSO: People are sharing selfies from 2012 and now, because the glow up is too real The traditional means of refreshing ourselves after the winter is with a little bit of spring cleaning. You know, shaking the dust from your rugs, throwing out those old VHS tapes you have lying around because really, why do you still have VHS tapes?, and donating those old clothes you no longer wear. But 2018 is a whole new year. So don't spring clean. Spring glow up instead. For the uninitiated, a Glow Up is when you re-do your whole damn life for the better. The (always comprehensive and authoritative) Urban Dictionary defines the phrase as ""to go from the bottom to the top, to the point of disbelief."" More specifically, it is to go from the inching-along caterpillar to the majestic butterfly. It is, in Pokémon terms, to evolve from "" Magikarp used Splash"" to "" Gyarados is about to wreck your ish with Hyper Beam."" Think of it as a supercharged makeover, but instead of being on the surface, it's *gestures broadly at everything.* For the uninitiated, a glow up is when you re-do your whole damn life. That means it can take many forms. For instance, in 2018, we haven't been able to stop talking about the meteoric glow up of Cardi B, who went from stripper to platinum-record selling, Billboard #1 charting, millionaire rap icon. Yes, her glow up included a style evolution, but it was really about the hard work that brought her fame, fortune, and success. (""I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles / I'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls / I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy,"" Cardi B raps on her new song ""Best Life."") You don't have to be rich and famous to have one. Earlier in 2018, people shared their 6-year glow ups by posting selfies from 2012 vs. 2018. That's the whole premise of the ""If you don't love me at my""/ ""you don't deserve me at my"" meme. At this point, spring cleaning alone feels simple and trite, like a relic of yesteryear. As the Washington Post noted in 2010, the concept began as a necessary tradition. Keeping things tidy is difficult in winter, and, in the old days, the technology that allowed us to get through the cold also generated dirt that we later needed to clean up. ""Because homes used to be lit with whale oil or kerosene and heated with wood or coal, the winter months left a layer of soot and grime in every room."" the Post explains. ""With the arrival of spring, women would throw open windows and doors, and take rugs and bedding outside and beat dust out of them and start scrubbing floors and windows until sparkling."" At this point, like those kerosene lamps, spring cleaning is outdated. Sure, tidying up is nice and makes a place more comfortable. But thanks to modern technology, intense cleaning doesn't have to be seasonal. When the snow begins to thaw, flowers start to bloom, and the sun shines a bit brighter, rather than simply shaking dust from our carpets, we can focus on more substantive changes. You've been meaning to go back to the gym. Do it. Wanna catch up with all those old friends you haven't seen as you've been hiding from the cold? Text 'em up and make plans. Thinking of trying a new hairstyle or adding a new staple to your wardrobe? Collect that tax refund money (another perk of spring, at least for some) and upgrade yo self. Spring is a time for renewal, and that's what your spring glow up is all about. ""People hear cleaning and they think 'work.' But they hear glow up and they think *raised eyebrows, excited wiggling*"" said a friend and colleague. You made it through winter. You survived the million years of cold. Don't treat yourself by doing MORE work. Treat yourself by living your best damn life. Don't just spring clean. ✨🌟✨Rock that spring glow up. ✨🌟✨",This post is part of Mashable's Spring Cleaning Week.

Mahita Gajanan,"A “bomb cyclone” is approaching the central U.S. and is expected to bring blizzard conditions and strong winds to a major portion of the country.
Bomb cyclones occur when a quickly forming storm results in a drop in atmospheric pressure of at least 24 millibars.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned of a major winter storm ranging from the Central Rockies through the Plains. Severe blizzard conditions are expected across parts of Wyoming, western Nebraska, western South Dakota and northeast Colorado. Blizzard warnings were put into effect from northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming across western Nebraska and southwest South Dakota, according to NWS.
CNN reports 70 million people are in the path of the storm, with 45 million under a high wind threat, 10 million under winter storm threats and about 15 million facing a flood threat.
The storm, while more intense in its overall impact than other weather events that generally in hit mid-March, is not too unusual for this time of the year, says Matt Rinde, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather.
“These are early spring storms that really do show their hand in something like this quite often,” he says.
Here’s what to expect from the bomb cyclone.
Strong winds are surpassing 80 mph
Winds are predicted to blow between 50 and 70 miles per hour across the region, and heavy snow accumulating to at least 6 inches is likely in parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
In western Texas, New Mexico, parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, wind gusts are expected to exceed 60 miles per hour. Portions of western Texas have already seen winds between 70 and 80 miles per hour, with some even going beyond 80 mph, according to Rinde.
Strong winds are a hallmark of bomb cyclones, Rinde says, and he calls the scale of the one beginning to slam parts of the midwest “impressive.” Because the storm ranges across a wide swath of the U.S., the system’s impact will differ depending on where it hits.
“It’s a powerful storm system that when it starts to come together, strengthens very quickly,” Rinde says. “With severe weather on the southern side, blizzard conditions on the northern side, the concern for flooding, and then, the winds that are outside of the thunderstorms. It’s an impressive event from top to bottom.”
Heavy snow will cover the region
Widespread, heavy snows are expected between Wednesday and Thursday across the Central High Planes and Upper Mississippi Valley, according to NWS. Snow will blanket the areas where blizzard conditions are likely, such as parts of Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota. Freezing rain will also bring ice accumulation to impacted areas.
Travel plans impacted
Nearly 1,000 flights coming in and going out of Denver International Airport have been cancelled as of Wednesday morning, according to FlightAware. A blizzard warning is in effect for Denver.
Denver Public Schools cancelled classes due to the severe weather, the school district said in a tweet.
Southwest Airlines cancelled 411 flights, while SkyWest Airlines, headquartered in Utah, had cancelled 259 flights by Wednesday morning. United Airlines also cancelled 133 flights.
Rinde advises that travelers in the region give themselves as much extra time as they can and to avoid the storm, if possible.
“It’s better to be out of it,” he says.

Hillary Leung,"Cyclone Idai struck the southeast Africa last week, causing more than 600 deaths in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi as severe flooding ravaged all three nations. An estimated 1.7 million were in the path of the cyclone, prompting the U.N. to call it potentially “one of the worst climate-related disasters to hit Southern Africa.”
The storm made landfall in the Mozambique port city of Beira on March 14, producing a storm surge that destroyed 90% of the area before continuing west towards Zimbabwe and Malawi. Damage has rendered large parts of the affected areas inaccessible, hampering aid efforts from humanitarian groups.
With water and sanitation systems largely destroyed, waterborne diseases present a growing concern. A center to respond to cholera has been set up in Beira as workers brace for the spread of the virus.
The death toll is feared to rise significantly as rescue efforts continue and water levels recede. Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address that “everything indicates that we can have a record of more than 1,000 dead,” according to CNN.
In the wake of the disaster, here is a list of charities providing relief to the affected region:
United Nations World Food Program (WFP)
WFP, the world’s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger, is calling for funds to support the delivery of food to victims of the cyclone. According to the agency, at least 500,000 people are in need of emergency food.
Humanity &amp; Inclusion
Independent organization Humanity &amp; Inclusion has been working in Mozambique since 1986. In the wake of the storm, the group is clearing access points in Beira to enable the transportation of food, water and other essentials to victims, as well as providing food aid and hygiene kits to families.
Doctors Without Borders
As the spread of waterborne diseases poses a growing threat, Doctors Without Borders is providing medical assistance and supplies, including water and sanitation support, across the region.
Oxfam
Oxfam is working to provide access to clean water through the delivery of hygiene kits and water purification tablets to half a million victims. The organization will also run hygiene promotion sessions to advise people how to store and treat water, as well as ensure access to adequate toilet and washing facilities.
Save the Children
Save the Children is providing support for vulnerable children and families in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Critical supplies including hygiene kits, water jugs and tents are being delivered, and Save the Children’s Emergency Health Unit, which assesses damage to health facilities and makes sure children have access to lifesaving healthcare, has also been deployed.

Today it announced a plan to fund AR startups through the new Bose Ventures, but more importantly, it announced a platform that includes AR glasses and, Bose hopes, a new way to interact with AR content—and thus your world. A few months ago, I got a package containing four bottles of Never Too Hungover, one of those hangover remedies that you’re supposed to drink the night before, and another you’re supposed to take the next day. I pounded beers as if I were rushing a fraternity with the knowledge that I’d be immune from the physical consequences. But I was not safe. I felt as headachey and as vomitey as usual the next day.

Well, you’re in luck. Physicists’ main goal is to be able to predict what will happen in the future based on patterns they’ve already observed, whether in massive systems of stars or tiny groups of atoms. Predicting changes over time usually requires developing new mathematical equations. But a researcher at California Institute of Technology recently discovered that a well-known formula, Schrödinger’s equation, governs two vastly different things: particles smaller than an atom and the disks of matter that fill the universe. Lessons are immediately forgotten. Trips are wasted. Obviously poor decisions are made. Hell, Jadis, Queen of the Garbage People, somehow became the episode’s most sympathetic character.

Over the last year, “fake news” has gone from being a niche concern that charlatans exploited for profit, to a code red existential threat to the fabric of society—or something in between. But our scientific understanding of how and why false stories spread is still limited.

Ryan Gaydos,"A ""bomb cyclone"" is set to dump snow and ice Wednesday across parts of the East Coast that rarely see winter weather, the latest bombardment of frigid weather that's brought freezing temperatures to vast portions of the United States. The National Weather Service said Wednesday a mix of snow and freezing rain was expected to move across along the East Coast from Florida to North Carolina before rapidly strengthening at sea. The weather service warned a so-called “bomb cyclone” will bring “blizzard conditions"" across portions of eastern New England late Thursday. ""This winter storm is forecast to bring the potential for a mix of freezing rain/sleet/snow from portions of northern Florida to North Carolina, and snowfall northward along portions of the Mid-Atlantic into northern New England,"" the NWS said in an advisory. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratio n, bombogenesis or bomb cyclone “occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure."" ""This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters. The formation of this rapidly strengthening weather system is a process called bombogenesis, which creates what is known as a bomb cyclone,” NOAA said. The NWS has issued a Winter Storm Warning for all of Southeast Georgia, Interstate 10 corridor in Northeast Florida, and portions of the North and South Carolina costs due to the possibility of ice and snow. The agency warned areas along coastal areas of New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic could see up to 6 inches of snow, while parts of New England may see over a foot. Winter Storm Warnings stretch from Florida to New England. (Fox News) Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janie Dean warned Wednesda y the storm is going to ""almost going to be like a hurricane off shore"" once it reaches the Northeast after bringing snow, sleet, and freezing rain across the Southeast.

Traveling in the ice and snow has also proven to be treacherous. At least one person was killed in upstate New York in an accident involving dozens of vehicles on I-90 east, WIVB-TV reported. At least 11 others were hospitalized. Plunging temperatures in Texas brought rare snow flurries as far south as Austin, and accidents racked up on icy roads across the state. The Abilene police chief said more than three dozen vehicle crashes were reported in 24 hours. Officials in Michigan said dozens of cars piled up in crashes on Sunday, according to the Detroit News. Officials said there were no deaths reported in the crashes, but there were at least seven hospitalized. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Ryan Gaydos is an editor for Fox News.

Johnny Lieu,"Africa's Sahara Desert isn't the place you'd expect to see snow.

SEE ALSO: How the 'bomb cyclone' formed to slam the East Coast What's even odder is snow also fell on the Sahara last year. Before that, the town of Ain Sefra saw snow all the way back in 1979, albeit for only half an hour.

However, it cools right down in winter, hitting an average low of 31.5 degrees Fahrenheit (-0.5 degrees Celsius).

https://www.facebook.com/markberman,"A brutal winter storm descended upon the East Coast on Wednesday, bringing snow to Florida and Georgia along with ominous forecasts of bone-chilling temperatures and pummeling snow expected to follow across the eastern United States. The powerful storm prompted dire warnings from meteorologists and government officials alike, as authorities shut down schools, grounded flights and closed roadways throughout the Southeast. Forecasts called for the storm to become a “ bomb cyclone ” because its pressure will drop so quickly, causing it to intensify at explosive rates. Snow and freezing rain coating parts of the Southeast on Wednesday are only expected to be the beginning. The storm is forecast to travel up the coast like a snowbird in the spring, bringing snow to the Mid-Atlantic and then potential blizzard conditions in New England on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. After that’s done, forecasters warn, a painful cold will follow. “Bitter cold and dangerous wind chills to persist into the weekend,” the National Weather Service said in a warning Wednesday morning. [ ‘Bomb cyclone’ to blast East Coast before polar vortex uncorks tremendous cold late this week ] The storm has already caused issues for travelers, halting scores of flights. Even before the forecast snow arrived in the Northeast, airlines had canceled more than 1,700 flights on Thursday, most of them through the three New York-area airports as well as Boston. Airlines bracing for the weather had begun issuing waivers for travelers heading through essentially the entire East Coast, allowing people to change their flights without any fees. As the storm began to grind across the East Coast, it brought wintry weather to unusual places. Snow fell Wednesday on Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, and stretched across the border into Georgia. The Raleigh, N.C., office of the National Weather Service reported that the temperature there dropped to 9 degrees on Wednesday morning, tying a record low set on the same date in 1887. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) declared a state of emergency for 28 counties, warning that the snowfall and freezing rain could melt and then refreeze, “producing additional ice related hazards.” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said that while it was hard to predict the snowfall totals, the impact could make it treacherous for people to drive. Authorities there also warned about the dangers the extreme cold could pose for the elderly and children, among others. “Cold temperatures can present a challenge for everyone across the state, especially our most vulnerable residents,” Dr. Betsey Tilson, North Carolina’s state health director, said Wednesday. Some braved the icy conditions for supplies. At a Harris Teeter supermarket James Island, S.C., just across the Intra-Coastal Waterway from downtown Charleston, mostly male shoppers stocked up Wednesday morning on water, hot dogs, bread and milk. “The women were too smart to go out,” one cashier said as icy rain turned the parking lot to slush shortly before noon. Further south, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) had ordered transportation crews to prepare state roads and bridges amid the winter storm warnings and advisories issued across the Sunshine State. “As this weather system moves through state, families and visitors across North Florida should prepare for potential hard freezes and below-freezing travel conditions,” Scott said in a statement. Roadways were already shut down by the storm across parts of the Southeast. Florida officials said they closed a stretch of Interstate 10 because of the weather, while a number of roadways were closed in Georgia. The storm essentially meant that many Floridians, more accustomed to seeing schools closed for hurricanes, had snow days this week. Leon County, which is home to Tallahassee, shut down schools Wednesday. About three hours away, Alachua County canceled classes on Wednesday and Thursday due to the warnings of freezing rain, dangerous roads and black ice. “Closing schools is not a decision we make lightly,” the Alachua school system said in a statement. “We recognize that it’s a real headache for families, but safety has to be the first consideration.” While southern states dealt with the snow and ice, many in the north began hearing warnings of what they could soon confront. The National Weather Service forecasts that Boston and nearby areas could see up to a foot of snow — and possibly more — saying that “near blizzard conditions are likely in this region.” Philadelphia could see up to three inches of snow, while New York City may see as much as six inches by Thursday. What path the storm takes could determine its impact. If the storm wobbles away from the coast, snow amounts and peak winds will decrease, but if it hews closer to land, snowfall and gusts could climb higher and extend farther inland. Doug Pardue in Charleston, S.C., and Jason Samenow in Washington contributed to this story, which will be updated throughout the day.

Adam Clark Estes,"Summer is finally here, which means it’s finally time to replace that drone you crashed on Christmas Day. Here’s some advice. Don’t buy an expensive drone if you don’t know how to fly. Cheap drones have gotten really good, and there’s no better way to hone your skills without exploding money into the side of a tree. The problem with cheap drones has always been the cost to quality ratio. If you go too cheap, you risk losing an eye thanks to awful flying abilities. If you go too expensive, you might as well upgrade to a more full featured drone like the DJI Spark or the Yuneec Breeze. So for our latest installment of Battlemodo, we rounded up three cheap drones with three different approaches to cost versus quality: the $70 Drocon Cyclone, the $100 Ryze Tello (powered by DJI technology), and the $180 Parrot Mambo FPV. Our battles were straight forward. How easy is it to get airborne? How well does it fly? How good is the camera? Spoiler: the winner won by a landslide. Usability Unlike their larger, prosumer siblings, cheap drones are relatively simple affairs. There’s a battery, four rotors that stay on the drone, and typically, four clip-on attachments to form a hull for safety. Even still, getting the little birds in the air can be annoying if the controller or app doesn’t work well. That’s why we focused on the frustration of flight preparation for this first battle. Let’s get the painful one out of the way first. The Dronon Cyclone, Amazon’s best-selling cheap drone, is a nightmare. To fire up the gadget, you need to plug a shady-looking battery into a tiny cable in the drone’s undercarriage, and then, when you switch on the flimsy controller, the drone is immediately live. It’s frightfully easy to hit the throttle joystick before you’re ready. Meanwhile, you don’t need to use the app to fly, and you really shouldn’t use it at all because it’s so terrible. We eliminated the Drocon drone from this battle immediately. The Ryze Tello and the Parrot Mambo were both pretty easy to get flight ready. Both use handy battery packs that clip into the drone. Both work well with separate controllers, though it’s worth pointing out that the Mambo comes with a controller while you have to buy one separately for the Tello. The Tello is also different because it comes with a built in camera, while the Mambo uses one that clips on to the top of the body. All that said, the Tello defeats the the Mambo in this battle simply because the software is slicker and more dependable, perhaps thanks to the underlying DJI technology. It’s just easier and quicker to get the Tello in the air. Winner: Ryze Tello Airworthiness All three of these cheap drones fly—some much better than others! But what makes any drone worthy is the ability to fly steadily and maneuver effectively. Otherwise, you’re stuck with an expensive kite drifting around on a windy day. That or you just crash. So for our airworthiness battle, we sent all three drones through an obstacle course involving trees and more trees. This time around the Drocon isn’t just a nightmare. It’s a dangerous nightmare. This is largely because the Drocon doesn’t fly like most quadcopters. Instead of moving the drone up or down in the air, the left joystick simply works like a throttle. To increase altitude, you push up, but to decrease altitude, you just let go of the joystick and the drone enters a free fall. The effect is kind of like trying to levitate a ping pong ball by blowing through a straw. The only upside is that the Drocon is so light and crappy that it doesn’t shatter into a million pieces whenever it inevitably comes crashing back down to Earth. Once again, the Tello and the Mambo appear to be pretty equal contenders in this battle. What differentiated one from the other, however, was stability. The Tello feels rock solid in the air compared to the Mambo which tends to drift. That drifting resulted in several close calls on the obstacle course and one sort of inexplicable crash. The Tello isn’t as stable as a more sophisticated drone equipped with GPS to hold the quadcopter in place, but it was almost twice as easy to fly as the Mambo, which is nearly twice the price. Winner: Ryze Tello Camera Quality Cheap drones aren’t known for their photography abilities. In fact, the cameras on all three of these quadcopters is primarily useful to see where the drone is going. All three drones are supposed to have 1080p HD cameras, but the difference in quality is incredibly stark. No surprise here, but the Drocon’s camera was the worst. The grainy picture looked like something seen through the lens of a cell phone camera circa 2003. It’s laughable, actually. 1 / 3 The Mambo is much better, but it isn’t great. In our testing, the lens actually ended up acquiring a bunch of dust that led to oddly foggy images. After we cleaned off the lens and tested again, though, the images were sharper, but the fogginess wasn’t entirely gone. Again, you’d be able to see where you were going if you wanted to use the drone in FPV mode (that’s where you wear a headset and use the drone’s camera as your eyes). You wouldn’t want to take photos with the Mambo, though. So no surprises again. The Tello bested the other two drones in camera quality. While recorded video comes out shaky due to wind—this was true for all three cameras—the still image quality from the Tello’s camera was impressive to say the least. We took a photo of midtown Manhattan, and the you can make out the tiniest details, just as you’d expect from any camera that captures HD images. Winner: Ryze Tello Winner Winner The Ryze Tello simply smokes its competitors. And at $100, the little DJI-powered drone is a no-brainer of a deal. If you spend a few extra bucks on a Bluetooth controller, you can easily learn to fly on the Tello, and thanks to the surprisingly good camera, you can learn to become an aerial photographer, too. Parrot versus Ryze versus Drocon Easiest Pre-Flight Ryze Tello Best Camera Quality Ryze Tello Inevitably, however, cheap drones are fancy toys that will serve as a gateway to fancier toys: quadcopters like the DJI Mavic Air or even the Phantom 4. And before you spend $1,000 or more on one of these for aerial photography, you should definitely spend some time with a cheap drone. They survive crashes better. They’re smaller and safer. And for some, they’re more fun. The Ryze Tello is definitely all of these things. Winner: Ryze Tello","Summer is finally here, which means it’s finally time to replace that drone you crashed on Christmas Day. Here’s some advice.

Mélissa Godin and William Martin,"When Eliza Jasi saw enormous floods sweeping their way through her village in southern Malawi on March 8th, she had one thought: not again.
Malawi, a small, landlocked country in south-east Africa, home to 18.6 million people, has been hit by devastating floods in recent weeks. In early March, following unusually heavy rains, the Shire river in southern Malawi overflowed, sweeping away crops, homes—and people. More than 800,000 people have been affected and at least 59 people have died. (The toll is expected to rise.) On March 9, Malawian President Mutharika declared a state of disaster. On March 15, Cyclone Idai hit Malawi along with Zimbabwe and Mozambique, one of the worst climate-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere.
Villages are now completely submerged under water and Nsanje, the most southern district of Malawi has been the most severely affected. Although the government deployed its Defense Force, roads are flooded—preventing aid and rescue vehicles from getting to the worst-affected areas.
This is the third major flood that 35-year-old Jasi has endured. In Malawi, violent floods are becoming increasingly frequent and volatile, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and atmospheric moisture are thought to increase the frequency and severity of floods. According to the United States Agency for International Development, Malawians are particularly affected by climate change because of their reliance on subsistence farming; 80% of Malawians work as farmers. According to the International Monetary Fund, Malawi is the fourth poorest country in the world with 50.7 % of people live under the poverty line and 25% live in extreme poverty. 
Women in Malawi are disportionately affected by climate change. Because women are expected to provide food, water, and firewood for their families, droughts have resulted in women walking longer distances to get these resources, increasing the time spent on unpaid household work. The Guardian reports that climate change is also resulting in increased poverty, which is exacerbating the prevalence of early marriages.
During environmental disasters — when people are sent to live in camps — women tend to suffer most, in part because of high rates of sexual violence in the camps.
Jasi is one of them. During the 2012 floods, one of her six children died. When Jasi sought refuge in an aid camp, there was no shelter and little food. Scared of losing another child, she was forced into prostitution to provide for her family and ended up contracting HIV. According to UNAIDS, one million people in Malawi were living with HIV in 2016, increasing the likelihood of women contracting HIV through these transactions.
After the water levels went down, Jasi had to rebuild her home and started regrowing crops that had been swept away. Three years later, another flood hit, displacing more than 230,000 people. Once again, she lost her crops and her home was destroyed. Her husband died shortly after. Now, in 2019, Jasi finds herself in the same predicament: her home and crops have been destroyed and she is once more living in a camp that is unable to provide basic necessities. 
Christina Wholy, 45, agrees. Her home was destroyed on March 8 and when she arrived at the Ngabu evacuation camp in Nsanje with her husband and children, she discovered there was not enough food, no soap or sanitary products, few toilets and no place for people to sleep. “I’m worried no help is coming,” she says. According to Relief Web, Ngabu camp is overcrowded, housing over 1000 families. 
Women are especially affected by the lack of food as they are expected to provide and care for their children. “We do not have freedom,” Wholy says.
The poor living conditions means many men choose to leave the camp. As Winard Ngano, a man living in the Bangula camp puts it: “Men are so desperate. They do not have food to feed the family.” According to Ngano, many men start relationships with women in nearby communities in the hopes of finding food and shelter. 
Some women, however, say their husbands are leaving the camp over frustrations with the sleeping arrangements in the camp. Families do not have their own individual tents to share, because of a lack of supplies. Instead, men and women are separated, sleeping in different parts of the camp. Aid organizations use this model around the world in the hope of preventing sexual violence. Esther Moyo, a Program Officer for the international NGO ActionAid says this model often results in men leaving their wives. 
During the floods in 2015, for instance, “the men were complaining that their conjugal rights were being violated,” Moyo says. Men subsequently abandoned their wives, embarking on relationships with women in nearby communities. 
“Things turned sour when he noticed that the tents could not accommodate a family,” says one woman affected by the 2015 floods who asked to stay anonymous for fear of retaliation from her husband. “My husband fled. To date, he is nowhere to be found. So that’s where the marriage ended. He couldn’t stand to see his wife sleeping separately from him.”
As a result of the difficult conditions within the camp, many displaced people say they wish they have sought shelter elsewhere. “I wish I had just stayed back at home,” Wholy says. “There is no food here and the situation is more tense. I do not know what the future holds.”
But returning home is not an option for those whose homes have been swept away. For years, the government has been encouraging citizens to settle away from the Shire River, the countries largest river running out of Lake Malawi to Mozambique, that is prone to flooding. Yet according to Moyo from ActionAid, the government has not provided adequate land for people to move to nor have they ensured that land rights are secured. As a result, many families will likely return to the disaster prone areas once the flooding has dissipated. 
Jasi will be among them, a lack of money giving her few options to move elsewhere. And so, she has no other choice but to await the next cycle of flooding.

SHERI FINK,"Those conditions, he said, made clearer why the government’s official death count was incomplete. “Even if they were really doing a good job, it was really hard unless you did something like we did — go talk to people on the ground,” he said. People, he added, “died alone in their houses. Nobody went there. Some of them were covered by a landslide, and months after they’ve not recovered the bodies.” Notably, abnormally high death rates continued at least through the end of December. “They didn’t show any sign of coming down in the several months following the hurricane that we were looking at,” said Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the study’s other senior author. “There is clearly an excess mortality, and let’s not argue very specific numbers,” said Dr. Gilbert Burnham, a professor of international health and founder of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the research, but has performed similar studies assessing deaths, including in Mosul, Iraq. Dr. Burnham said that despite the study’s limitations, including the difficulty of estimating Puerto Rico’s total population in light of migration, and the possible oversampling of smaller populations in more remote areas, such surveys “should become a standard activity in post-disaster situations,” because they help reveal vulnerabilities that can be addressed to save lives. Dr. Burnham and another expert unaffiliated with the study agreed with the researchers that the toll could be even higher than estimated if adjusted for the fact that people who died alone could not be surveyed. “It just is stunning how poor our information was as to what was happening in Puerto Rico,” said Leslie Roberts, a professor and director of the program on forced migration and health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. The use of surveys to assess the extent of deaths and suffering in disasters, and to guide improvements, extends back decades. Particularly important were a series of studies in Bangladesh in 1970 and 1971, which revealed that women died at a higher rate than men from a massive cyclone that the researchers estimated killed at least 224,000 people. In Puerto Rico, the researchers visited 104 barrios across the island, selecting them to ensure that both urban and nonurban areas were represented. In the areas most remote from cities, about one in five residences were abandoned. The researchers chose households at random in each of the barrios, asking about deaths in the home, deaths in the neighborhood, and access to electricity, running water and phone service.",The number of people who died because of Hurricane Maria last year has been a matter of debate.

In New York, forecasters are predicting as much as a foot of snow in some spots. Another big winter storm is coming to the Northeast, on the heels of last week's bomb cyclone. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service say snow is in the forecast along the East Coast from Philadelphia up to Boston. They predict it'll start falling in some spots as early as Tuesday night. Conditions are expected to get worse on Wednesday: that's when as much as 12 inches of powder could fall around New York City and Boston. The storm is set to hit eastern Pennsylvania and northern and central New Jersey with four to eight inches of snow, too. Those predicted snow totals could still change between now and Wednesday, but meteorologists are pretty confident that the region will get hit with some mix of snow and rain in the middle of this week. They're warning that the evening commute on Wednesday could be especially rough, with a mix of snow, sleet, and ice on the roads. Strong winds — with gusts of up to 40 miles per hour — are also in the forecast Wednesday night from Pennsylvania into New Jersey, as well as in Maryland and Delaware.

,"At a Glance In less than a day, Beryl went from an area of interest to the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. This tiny hurricane may strengthen a tad more into early Saturday. It will then encounter wind shear this weekend, causing it to weaken rapidly. Beryl should reach the Lesser Antilles by late Sunday or Monday. An increase in showers and gusty winds is expected in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Beryl has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic season well east of the Lesser Antilles, going from a tropical depression to hurricane in less than 24 hours. This tiny hurricane is currently located over 1,100 miles east-southeast of the Windward Islands, moving west. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Beryl was upgraded to a hurricane based on microwave and infrared satellite imagery showing a ""pinhole eye"" had developed. Its tropical storm-force winds extend only up to about 35 miles from its center. Beryl's Current Wind Field (The orange circle shows the extent of the system's tropical storm-force winds (at least 39 mph). The purple circle indicates the extent of hurricane-force winds (at least 74 mph), according to the National Hurricane Center.) Tropical cyclones as tiny as Beryl are prone to intensify faster than forecast. Given barely enough ocean heat content (sea-surface temperatures around 80 degrees Fahrenheit), low wind shear, and its location south of a plume of sinking, dry air known as the Saharan air layer, Beryl intensified quickly from a tropical depression at 11 a.m. EDT Thursday to a Category 1 hurricane just 18 hours later. According to the National Hurricane Center, these favorable conditions may remain in place through early Saturday, and Beryl could gain even more intensity. However, upper-level winds will become hostile before Beryl approaches the Lesser Antilles this weekend. These shearing winds should weaken this system as it draws closer to the Lesser Antilles. Current Satellite and Wind Shear (The current tropical system is shown by the icon at lower right. Areas of strong wind shear, the difference in wind speed and direction with height, are shown in purple. High wind shear is hostile to tropical cyclones and those trying to develop.) Dry air is also plentiful ahead of Beryl and may also play some weakening role. Water Vapor Satellite Image (Dry air is shown by the progressively deeper orange and red colors. Progressively more moist air is shown by the gray, white, pink and blue colors.) While allowing Beryl to rapidly strengthen, its small size also makes it more fragile compared to larger systems. This should make Beryl's eventual weakening more rapid. The question is how fast will that occur. There is some chance Beryl may still be a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Lesser Antilles late Sunday into Monday. However, there's also a chance tiny Beryl may be ripped apart by the aforementioned combo of wind shear and dry air. Even if the system degenerates into a tropical wave, an uptick in shower activity, including some locally heavy rain, and gusty winds are expected in the Lesser Antilles late Sunday into Monday. (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of the tropical cyclone. It's important to note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding, winds) with any tropical cyclone usually spread beyond its forecast path.)

Tendai Marima,"Definite Tom, a primary school teacher, lives in Chimanimanim a town in Zimbabwe. Her home is still standing after the cyclone, but she is afraid to go back. Her grandmother died in the disaster.
Tendai Marima for NPR
The smell of death hangs in the air a mix of decomposing flesh and what I can only describe as the odor of pine-scented bleach.
Flies hover over sections of the long tall grass and clusters of fallen rock in Chimanimani, the town in the mountains of Zimbabwe's eastern border with Mozambique. Cyclone Idai made landfall here late on the night of March 14 into the 15th.
An unknown number of residents of the town still lie buried beneath those boulders and in nearby valleys, under rocks from the landslide triggered by the cyclone.
The storm first hit Mozambique then proceeded to neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi. The death toll so far is more than 500. It's thought to be one of the worst natural disasters to hit southern Africa since Cyclone Eline in 2000. The storm is over although it still rains off and on as the search for bodies continues. 
Some say that Chimanimani, at an altitude of 4,823 feet, is the town in Zimbabwe that has suffered the most from the cyclone. It's where most of the deaths in the country have occurred. 
Search groups put plastic bottles around plots of land as markers to indicate a search is ongoing. On Friday, in the rubble of a building destroyed during a rockslide, a team of locals led by Everlugisi Mudzidzi, 43, found the body of a small child 3-year-old Excite, the son of Mudzidzi's neighbors. They laid the small body on the grass, where flies buzzed around it. 
For the family and close friends like Mudzidzi, finding the child was a tragedy but at least brought closure after days of searching. 
""It really worried us where this child could be,"" Mudzidzi told NPR. ""We attend the same church as his father, we pray together and it was hard for him wondering where his child's body was. Now we can all finally find rest and have peace because we know the child is laid to rest now."" 
Gravediggers prepare the burial site for 3-year-old Excite, who died after the cyclone hit.
Tendai Marima for NPR
The little boy joins dozens of other buried in makeshift coffins at an extended section of the local cemetery. The area was specially demarcated for victims of the cyclone. They are buried side by side and sometimes two in a grave to make digging easier for the gravediggers, who had to bury 48 people in just one day. 
For more than a week Chimanimani has been inaccessible by road; the cyclone damaged roads and bridges connecting it to other parts of the country. Military helicopters as well as copters lent by wealthy people in the area have been used to fly in essential medicines and fly out the critically injured.
Slowly the government is clearing roads of obstructing branches. 
The Chimanimani Rural District Hospital mortuary, whose fridge can only hold three dead bodies at a time, was overwhelmed in the wake of the storm. 
Bodies that were discovered were kept in the churches until volunteer carpenters could craft coffins from timber planks. 
At one time, over 60 bodies were laid out in the town's Roman Catholic Church. 
Godwin Mundiripo, the local Roman Catholic priest, along with a Salvation Army priest, performed the burial rites, one by one. 
""We had to divide up the church with a curtain, we put the bodies on the benches and then people who were homeless or those who would come from another village looking for their relatives would sleep on the other side,"" he says. 
""There needs to be some sort of ceremony. Those who have lost family are hurt, and those who don't find their family members are just wondering where they could be. This cyclone was very traumatizing, we've tried to care for the dead, but now to always wonder where the body of one's family member is can be very disturbing.""
Moses Dudzai, 42, sits by an area where houses have been flattened by rocks falling from the mountain. His 19-month-old daughter has been missing since the storm and the landslide it triggered.
Tendai Marima for NPR
Moses Dudzai, 42, a security guard, still holds out hope the community search parties will find his daughter, 19-month-old Tanatswa, beneath the landslide. His wife and another daughter were injured during the rockfall and both are currently in a hospital in another town, receiving care for head and body injuries. 
Flies buzz around the rocks piled up near the now-destroyed home where he lived.
Dudzai can't be sure the body of his baby, Tanatswa, will ever be found. 
""We are failing to locate where she is,"" he says. ""My wife who tried to hold onto her [Tanatswa] survived, but she's seriously injured, she has deep cuts on her head and her legs. All my property was destroyed, all things with value were taken by the water. 
""I'm appealing if there's a machine out there that can detect where her decomposed body's lying, so it can be retrieved and we can give her a decent burial,"" he says. 
A stony pelt of rocks now covers the area where houses once stood in Chimanimani's Ngangu neighborhood. A few houses weren't damaged, but the inhabitants don't necessarily want to stay.
Definite Tom, 42, a primary school teacher in Ngangu, lost her 82-year-old grandmother. Her body was found after a three-day search at the bottom of the hill where the town is situated.
""My grandmother died in a very painful way, it's hard to deal with it,"" says Tom. ""So many in our community are lost, especially small children. Their bodies are hard to find, and we only know there's someone in a place if we smell something.""
""My children hear sounds at night and they think the rain is coming back again,"" she says. ""Even I'm scared to sleep in this house. My house was not destroyed, but I don't feel safe here. We sleep at the [Methodist] church next door, I just don't know how we'll get over this in future,"" she says.
As Zimbabwe mourns its dead, a shroud of white mist covers Zimbabwe's eastern mountains. And the smell of death still hangs over the town of Chimanimani.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast. But while the winds are generating headlines and there’s a lot of questions about what category it will be when it makes landfall, the real issue is the water. And there’s going to be lots of it. It’s not that Florence’s winds aren’t a big deal—they are likely to be extremely dangerous and produce deadly flying debris—but there’s going to be a potentially historic amount of rainfall inland and powerful storm surge along the coast. Together, they’re responsible for 76 percent of all direct hurricane deaths. “There’s an old saying that those that live near the water will eventually live in the water,” Stephen Strader, a geographer who studies disasters at Villanova, told Earther. So let’s talk about that water likely to inundate people. Florence is likely to be a copious rain maker owing to how it fast (or slow) it moves ashore. Unfortunately, the National Hurricane Center calls for it to slow down as it reaches the Carolinas and then crawl inland as the winds in the upper atmosphere steering it slacken. That means the storm will have more time to unload heavy rain over the entire area under its shroud. But the slowing also means the bands of the heaviest rain that swirl around the hurricane are likely to do what meteorologists call training, a phenomenon where rain bands pass over one location repeatedly. It’s essential a race track for rain and can cause massive amounts of water to pile up on the ground in a very short period. While the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting a wide area of 15-20 inches of precipitations, higher localized totals are likely because of training. Some model runs show upwards of 40-50 inches could fall, obliterating the rainfall record for wettest storm set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when it dropped 24 inches of rain as it strafed the North Carolina coast. Models are but one piece of putting together a forecast, but the guidance they’re providing right now is really worrisome. “When these environmental wind patterns weaken, there is no mechanism to continue moving the [tropical cyclone],” Sarah Griffin, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of Wisconsin, told Earther. “A similar set-up happened with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area last year, causing Harvey to move very little for about 2 days.” Harvey was, of course, the biggest rainfall event to ever hit the U.S. so this is an extremely worrisome comparison. Compounding the issue of flooding is the type of summer North Carolina has had. In a word, it’s been a rainy one. A number of weather stations right in the center of Florence’s cone of probability have had some of their wettest summers on record. That means soils are saturated and won’t be able to handle the deluge that’s coming. “A lot of regions are associated with soil that drains poorly to begin with,” Strader said. “One thing we do know is when you replace natural vegetation with parking lots and homes and impervious surfaces, you increase the runoff.” So the rain is a huge issue. But it will likely be compounded by powerful storm surge on the coast, which also has the potential to be exacerbated by the storm slowing down as it approaches land. “If it stalls offshore or near the coast, storm surge threat will increase dramatically,” Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Needham said the size of the storm will also play a big role. Right now, Florence is wrapping up an eyewall replacement cycle, a sign that the storm is re-intensifying and could grow larger. If it does grow, the bigger wind field will give it a wider reach to whip more water toward the coast. Since we’re more than two days away and surge is very localized, we don’t yet have specific forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. But again, there’s bad news preceding the storm. Areas in Florence’s path are already seeing floodwaters rising ahead of the storm and tides are projected to remain high in the run up to Florence’s arrival. You can in part thank sea level rise for that, as it makes sunny day floods more common. “Even if you don’t think you’ll have to evacuate, the best thing to do is treat this as a trial run.” We can’t talk about the potential impacts of this storm without talking about how many people now call the area in Florence’s path home. Strader pointed to the fact that since 1940, the population residing in Florence’s cone of probability grew 1,325 percent, including a large spurt in the wake of Hurricane Hugo—the last major hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas—in 1989. That includes growth ringing metro areas like Myrtle Beach and Wilmington on the coast and Raleigh-Durham inland. “I’m concerned people may be taken off-guard by a change in forecast track,” Needham said. “People need to think not only about their elevation but their evacuation route. I’m also concerned for people inland who may think they will not be impacted by this event.” All the growth also means there’s a lot more of the pavement, which increases runoff and flooding. “It’s a backhand forehand slap with this event with the removal of natural wetlands that protect cities and landscape,” Strader said. Both Strader and Needham urged residents to have a plan in place before the hurricane arrives and pay attention to local authorities. South Carolina has already ordered the evacuation of a million people, and residents in the Outer Banks and elsewhere in North Carolina being told to go inland, ideally out of the river flood zone. If you live in these areas or anywhere else evacuation orders pop up, follow them even if you don’t feel you’re in harm’s way.","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast.

DAN ELLIOTT and BOB MOEN / AP,"(LONGMONT, Colo.) — National Guard troops used specialized vehicles with tank-like treads to rescue stranded drivers in Colorado in the wake of a massive late-winter storm that unleashed heavy rain and snow on parts of the Midwest plains early Thursday.
South Dakota’s governor closed all state offices Thursday as the blizzard conditions moved in, while wind, blowing snow and snow-packed roadways also made travel treacherous in western Nebraska. Heavy rain caused flooding in eastern parts of both states and in Iowa.
Wednesday’s blizzard in Colorado caused widespread power outages, forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights and wreaked havoc on roadways as drivers became overwhelmed by blinding snow. A wind gust clocked in at 97 mph (156 kph) in Colorado Springs.
The storm also contributed to the death of Corporal Daniel Groves, a Colorado State Patrol officer who was hit and killed by a car as he helped another driver who had slid off Interstate 76 near Denver.
“It is a tragic reminder that people’s lives are at stake,” said Shoshana Lew, head of the Colorado Department of Transportation. “The best place to be is at home and off the roads.”
Lew warned drivers that conditions would remain precarious at least through Thursday.
About 200 vehicles were disabled on Interstate 25 near Colorado Springs, and many more drivers were being rescued on secondary roads, said Kyle Lester with the transportation department’s Division of Highway Maintenance.
One of the stranded drivers was Bria McKenzie, 22, who with her mother, brother and sister, was stuck in her car for more than two hours on a hilly road in Colorado Springs. She said the snow was so blinding and numbing, and the wind was whipping so hard, she didn’t feel safe walking to a hospital that was just down the road.
“It was just like every second you were out there, it felt like parts of you were just freezing,” she said.
McKenzie and her family were eventually rescued by her father in his pickup.
The window-rattling storm brought blizzards, floods and a tornado across more than 25 states Wednesday, stretching from the northern Rocky Mountains to Texas and beyond.
“This is a very epic cyclone,” said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Prediction Center. “We’re looking at something that will go down in the history books.”
Scores of motorists took refuge at truck stops in eastern Wyoming while blowing snow forced portions of major highways to close in Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota. Meanwhile, hundreds of flights were canceled at Denver International Airport, and nearly 40 were grounded in Colorado Springs.
The wind-whipped storm forced schools and government offices across the state to close for the day and cut power to several hundred thousand homes and businesses. Xcel Energy spokesman Mark Stutz said zero visibility made conditions difficult for repair workers, and it could take days to restore power to everyone.
The culprit was a sudden and severe drop in ground-level air pressure in Colorado, the most pronounced dive since 1950, Carbin said. It was caused by a combination of the jet stream and normal conditions in the wind shadow of the Rockies.
Air rushed into the low-pressure area and then rose into the atmosphere.
“It’s like a vacuum cleaner, really,” Carbin said. When that much air rushes higher into the atmosphere, it causes severe weather.
Meteorologists call the rapid change in pressure a “bomb cyclone” or “bombogenesis.”
Parts of seven states were under blizzard warnings, and 20 states were under some level of high wind alert, Carbin said.
A tornado in New Mexico ripped roofs from buildings in the small town of Dexter, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of Albuquerque. Authorities said five people were hurt, but none of the injuries was life-threatening. A dairy euthanized about 150 cows injured by the tornado.
Chaves County Sheriff Mike Herrington said the tornado “took out” about 10 homes on one street.
High winds knocked 25 railroad freight cars off a bridge into a mostly dry riverbed near Logan in northeast New Mexico. No one was injured, New Mexico State Police said.

Associated Press,"(HARARE, Zimbabwe) — Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi have been hit by a vicious cyclone that has killed more than 140 people, left hundreds more missing and stranded tens of thousands who are cut off from roads and telephones in mainly poor, rural areas.
U.N. and government officials report that Cyclone Idai has affected more than 1.5 million people in the three southern African countries.
Hardest hit is Mozambique’s central port city of Beira where the airport is closed, electricity is out and hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The storm hit Beira late Thursday and moved westward into Zimbabwe and Malawi, affecting thousands more, particularly in eastern areas bordering Mozambique.
Homes, schools, businesses, hospitals and police stations have been destroyed by the cyclone. Thousands have been marooned by the heavy flooding.

Carlos Cadorniga,"Weather is one of our big obsessions here at Mashable (just take a look at our Science page if you don't believe us). We've covered everything from incoming tornadoes in the midwest that contribute to climate change to our favorite cloud types (seriously). We even coined the phrase "" bomb cyclone "" to describe the storm that brought some epic snowfall back in January. Yup, we love the weather as much as we do Marvel movies and iPhones. If you're as obsessed with forecasts and weather warnings as we are, then a weather station should be high up on your shopping list. (Or if you know someone who loves all things weather and science, then a weather station could make a great gift for them.) If, however, you're new to the weather geek kingdom, allow us to bring you into the fold. Weather stations are devices that can collect weather data from the immediate environment using a variety of sensors. From a thermometer for temperature to barometers for atmospheric pressure and plenty of other features in-between, these geeky gadgets can basically tell you everything you need to know about the weather whenever you need it. SEE ALSO: Best dating sites for seniors: Dating over 60 doesn't have to suck You can typically read its various points of data on an LED display that comes paired with the station itself. Some can even connect to the internet or your computer so you can analyze your data using legit weather station software. And in this smartphone-driven age, you can even see the weather data on your favorite handheld devices. Despite its many functions, the average weather station doesn't take up that much space. Some are rooftop devices that are about the size of weather vanes, while some can be about the size of a remote control and stick to the the outside of your house. We've only covered the basics of what a weather station can do, but different models can do so much more thanks to a little thing called technology. To that end, we've hunted down some of the most highly-rated weather stations on Amazon so you weather geeks out there can talk shop and weather-watch with confidence. These are the weather stations worth your wallet: Classic design, modern convenience. Image: Ambient weather You can read the data from this Ambient Weather rooftop device on the LCD color display, so you can get accurate numbers to plan your day. You can also read the data on your smart device, and it's even compatible with Alexa, so you can ask Amazon's digital assistant for a detailed weather report at any given moment. Sure beats scrolling through a weather app. More than 76% of users have given this model 5 stars, with user Djhester saying: I wanted to upgrade to one that was wireless and easily connects to the internet. I called Ambient Weather and they recommended this unit but I had to wait for it to come into stock. It is PERFECT for my needs. I am very happy with it! We've seen it listed as low as $160, plus shipping. If you think the Netatmo looks fancy, that's because it is. Image: Netatmo Sleek and functional, the Netatmo weather station has earned the Amazon's Choice seal of approval. It includes an indoor and an outdoor sensor, which both offer real-time smartphone notifications on weather status. It even gives you ventilation alerts to remind you to air out the house. Plus, it wouldn't be Amazon-approved without Alexa compatibility. Cody K 's 5-star review of the Netatmo weather station says: I would recommend this for someone who wants an easy, set and forget way to keep tabs on basic conditions. Perfect to keep watch on a vacation house, or as a gift for someone with an interest in weather. We've seen the Netatmo on sale for as low as $136.99 The La Crosse weather station uses big, bright displays so you can see key info at a glance. Image: la crosse technology This weather station by La Crosse Technology doesn't feature a giant spaceship-looking contraption, but does come with a sensor to install on the outside of your house for weather readings. The the LCD screen inside to get real-time readouts, which are easy to read at-a-glance thanks to the big, bright display. The station will track everything you'd expect — humidity levels, temperature, and the upcoming forecast — and will also reset its own time at daylight savings. More than 60% of users have given this station a 5-star rating, with Amazon user ViperGeek calling the unit ""gorgeous and easy to view and understand."" Pick one up for only about $40. Image: Acurite Accurate, Alexa-compatible, and smartphone-friendly — this weather station is also an Amazon's Choice product. With the AcuRite station, you can set custom alerts and receive notifications on weather conditions. You can even connect it with up to seven different compatible AcuRite devices so that everyone in the house can stay up to date, weather-wise. Eric M. on Amazon says: I like that I can easily see the weather at my house from work or anywhere. Once the app is installed on your phone, it takes just a couple seconds to load the weather data, so it's fairly convenient. Get it for $149.99. Pastel colors help make the DIGOO weather station super friendly looking. Image: digoo This station from DIGOO is like the Swiss army knife of weather stations. Not only does it provide in-depth data on weather — including temperature, humidity, and wind pressure — but it also acts as a calendar and an alarm clock to keep you up to date and awake. It also uses a colorful screen to display current weather conditions with real-time updates. Mike on Amazon says: Being stuck inside all day, it’s nice to know what’s going on outside. The numbers are large and clear, easy to read. Instructions were simple to follow also. Get it for less than $50. Image: AcuRite The HD screen interface for this weather station by AcuRite lets you toggle through several different screens for accurate weather readings. It can even store up to one year of weekly high and low temperatures for your data-reading purposes. Personalize your notifications on differing weather conditions too, so you're always prepared for whatever Mother Nation throws your way. Many reviewers comment on how bright the display is (and that the ""dim"" setting is still pretty bright), making it easy to see data from across the room. Amazon reviewer Timothy Smith had this to say : This is my second weather station. I had an Ambient for several years. Worked great but the display on it sucked. Decided to give AcuRite a try. I've had this item up and running for three weeks, and added the PC controller the second week. I love the upgraded display. I like being able to walk downstairs and look at the display from any direction and see what is going on outside. I had no idea how much I loved this item till I didn't have one. The only negative was that it didn't connect to my PC/Internet until I bought the $70 addon. That isn't AcuRite's fault because it doesn't say anything about working with a PC on it; so that is on me. Now that I am on Weather Underground I see a lot of AcuRite 5 in 1's in the area. Very popular in my area. We've seen it listed as low as $129.99. Image: Ambient weather If you're someone who wants ALL OF THE INFO, then this station is for you. Seriously. You'll have so much weather data at the ready that you could basically step in for Al Roker if you needed to. The solar-powered outdoor sensor keeps track of outdoor temperature, humidity, dew point, rainfall rate, wind speed, wind direction, UV and solar radiation info — and that's not all of it. You'll also be able to check out neat graphs that track historical data so you can compare notes over time. It's also compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, which means you have it tell you what the weather was on a specific day, or have the AI of your choice read the current conditions. Some 68% of Amazon users have 5-starred this weather station, including NightThumper, who wrote: After pouring through hundreds of reviews and having owned a lower end ambient weather station which after four years is still going strong I decided on this model. I encountered no issues in installation or connecting to Wuderweather. I went with the WiFi version because I wanted NIST time/date updates. Several reviewers have mentioned losing Wifi connectivity when they turn their computers off at night. This is not a problem if your modem has Wifi and you leave it turned on. I occasionally turn off my computer at night and only occasionally reboot my modem. Installation and connecting to both the Internet and Wunderweather was a breeze. The unit came with 2.2.9 firmware installed. Location for your installation means everything for accuracy. However compromises sometimes have to be made. My ideal location was where I previously had installed a UHF/VHF antenna. However accessing the 5 in 1 outdoor unit would require using a 32 foot extension ladder which isn't practical. Having access is important to clean the rain bowl, in the unlikely event you get a defective unit that craps out in the first couple of months that needs replacing or general inspection etc. Image: acurite This rooftop weather device offers the same great weather service as other models in the AcuRite family, but with a smaller design. The indoor display can record daily, monthly, and all-time highs and lows and can display a history chart for any field of data. The screen display is illuminated and displays tons of weather information over the last 12 hours. More than 60% of Amazon users have given this station 5 stars. Ziggy on Amazon says it's easy to install. I didn't have to even read the instructions to set it up. It's very intuitive, just put the batteries in both parts and the color display showed the information within a minute. We've seen it listed as low as $85.91 with free shipping. Image: La crosse Technology The display for this weather station is simple, matte, and still as effective as the fancier types — but at a more moderate price point. You can set customizable rain alerts and the station itself is supposedly made from durable plastic that can withstand moderate light and rain exposure. It also features rainfall alerts and precipitation alarms, so you can make sure that you're keeping dry on those unpredictable showers. Darrell Fichtl on Amazon says: I've had either a weather station or a rain gauge all of my adult life and I'm 83 years old. This is the best weather instrument I've ever purchased. Well, we can't really argue with that. Buy it now for $30.82. Image: Davis Instruments This weather station offers plenty of bang for its buck, with a glow-in-the-dark keypad and real time updates every 2.5 seconds. It even factors in moon phases and sun movements in its readings. While the rooftop apparatus has lots of bells and whistles, the indoor display is definitely no fuss. Amazon reviewers seem to love it though — 72% of customers rated this weather station with 5 stars. Despite its hefty price, Jeffrey D. Hickey still found plenty of value to make up for it. While I have only had this a few days, it is clear the bar has been raised on home weather stations. It certainly costs more than the glut of other home units, but this is a case of getting what you pay for.",Weather is one of our big obsessions here at Mashable (just take a look at our Science page if you don't believe us).

BLAKE NICHOLSON / AP,"Blizzard warnings were posted from Colorado to Minnesota on Wednesday and wildfires were a concern in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma as the second so-called “bomb cyclone” storm in less than a month hit the central U.S., raising the prospect of renewed flooding in the already drenched Midwest.Heavy snow disrupted ground and air travel Wednesday. Roads became impassable and visibility was down to a few feet in northeastern South Dakota due to heavy snowfall. About half of the daily flights at Denver International Airport were canceled.
Up to 2 ½ feet (0.61 meters) of snow was expected to fall in parts of eastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) also were expected, creating life-threatening conditions.
“We’re calling it historic because of the widespread heavy snow. We will set some records,” said Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
Transportation officials closed Interstate 29 from east central South Dakota to the North Dakota border, as well as a 270-mile (434-kilometer) section of Interstate 90 between Rapid City and Mitchell, South Dakota.
Numerous traffic crashes were reported in northeastern South Dakota, and the storm knocked out power to thousands of homes and businesses in Sioux Falls.
Officials in Colorado closed a 150-mile (241-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 76 from just northeast of Denver to the Nebraska border, and Gov. Jared Polis activated the National Guard in case troops are needed to rescue stranded motorists.
Multiple crashes in Minnesota along a snowy stretch of Interstate 35 prompted officials to close about 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Minneapolis .
In Nebraska, the State Patrol was sending additional troopers into the state’s panhandle, and officials closed Interstate 80 in that region.
“This storm is going to be dangerous,” Patrol Maj. Russ Stanczyk said.
An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as “thunder snow” — snow accompanied by thunder and lightning — was reported in central South Dakota.
“It’s essentially a thunderstorm, but it’s cold enough for snow,” Connelly said.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem closed state government offices in 52 counties. Numerous schools around the state closed, along with several Black Hills National Forest offices in western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming.
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts extended five weather-related executive orders until May 15 to help communities gain fast access to the state’s emergency resources. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “the National Guard stands ready” to rescue any stranded motorists.
The weather service posted an ice storm warning into Friday morning for a portion of southern Minnesota, saying up to three-fourths of an inch of ice could accumulate on power lines, leading to outages.
To the west, the looming spring blizzard in the Rockies impacted flights, school classes, government functions and even baseball.
Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies postponed an afternoon game against the Atlanta Braves until August. Many school districts in Colorado and Wyoming canceled or shortened classes. Local governments, including in Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming, and state government in the Denver area closed offices early.
Strong winds associated with the weather system were creating dangerous wildfire and travel conditions in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The weather service issued a high wind warning for the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) were combining with low humidity and an unstable atmosphere to create critical fire conditions in the three states. Forecasters in New Mexico said the winds also would make travel difficult on north-south oriented roads such as Interstate 25. In southern New Mexico, the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range closed Wednesday because of the high winds.
The storm technically met the scientific definition of what’s commonly known as a “bomb cyclone,” said David Roth, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.
The weather phenomenon with a complex scientific definition essentially entails a rapid drop in air pressure and a storm strengthening explosively. What is more important than the term is the storm’s impacts, which are likely to be similar to last month’s storm , Roth said.
That blast dropped heavy snow and led to massive flooding in the Midwest that caused billions of dollars in damage in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota.
“Hopefully this time it will be a slow snowmelt,” Roth said.
Forecasters said this week’s storm will swell rivers again, though likely not to the levels seen last month due to the absence of a wet snowpack on frozen ground this time around.
Even moderate rises in the Missouri River will push more water into drenched Fremont County in southwestern Iowa, Emergency Manager Mike Crecelius said. Last month’s flooding swamped 455 houses and thousands of acres of farmland in his region.
“The problem is that we’re not getting any time for the water to recede and things to dry out, so the levees can’t be fixed; houses can’t be fixed; crops can’t be planted,” he said.

Kevin Loria,"When Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast on August 25, 2017, it made landfall as a Category 4 storm with 130-mph winds. Harvey was the first major hurricane to hit the US since 2005, but it weakened to a tropical storm over land, which hurricanes tend to do when they are no longer drawing warmth and energy from the sea. But then the storm did something different. It stalled. For days, Harvey dumped unprecedented amounts of rain on and around Houston. It sucked up more water from the Gulf and even reversed direction, setting records and causing more than $126 billion in damage and economic loss. Tom Di Liberto described it on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) website as the ""storm that refused to leave."" Instead of being anomalies, storms like Harvey might represent a sort of new normal, according to a new assessment published in the journal Nature. The analysis, done by by NOAA researcher James Kossin, shows that hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical storms are moving more slowly over the Earth's surface, especially over land. That doesn't mean these storms are any less powerful — in fact, they may be intensifying and developing into powerful hurricanes in a shorter time span, according to other recent research. Instead, moving at a slower pace gives storms even more time to dump rain and whip coasts with powerful winds, making them more destructive. The storm slowdown Storms have slowed by an average of 10%, according to Kossin's research. Over the time period he studied — from 1949 to 2016 — the average global temperature rose 0.5 degrees Celsius due to climate change. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, so when you take into account 1 degree Celsius of warming, a 10% slowdown could double the amount of rainfall and flooding that an area experiences. ""These trends are almost certainly increasing local rainfall totals and freshwater flooding, which is associated with very high mortality risk,"" Kossin said in a news release. Kossin found that the amount storms slowed down varied by region across the globe. The percentages show how much tropical cyclones have slowed in those regions in the past 70 years. Local tropical cyclone rainfall totals would be expected to increase by the same percentage due to the slowing alone. Increases in rainfall due to warming global temperatures would compound these local rainfall totals even further. NOAA/NCEI In general, cyclones in the western North Pacific — where these storms are known as typhoons — slowed the most, by 20%. But Kossin also looked at changes in the speeds at which storms moved over land: in the western North Pacific, storms slowed 30% over land, while in the North Atlantic, they slowed by 20%. Kossin thinks this cyclone slowdown is likely caused by changes in the circulation of Earth's atmosphere due to climate change. While the factors that drive atmospheric winds are complicated, one expected symptom of climate change — and something that's been observed over the time period Kossin studied — is that the atmospheric factors that drive cyclone movement are weakening. ""Tropical cyclones tend to 'go with the flow,' meaning that the direction and speed at which they travel are guided by the winds in the surrounding environment,"" Christina Patricola, a climate researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wrote in an article published alongside Kossin's new paper. She called current-day storms ""sluggish."" That means that in a warmer world, we should expect storms to become more intense, dump more rain, and move more slowly, causing more damage. Hurricanes Katia, Irma, and Jose churn their way through the Atlantic and Caribbean. NASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens and Jesse Allen A devastating impact The peak rain rates of storms have increased by 30% over the past 60 years. As we saw with Harvey, storms that move slowly can cause an incredible amount of damage. We saw the same destructive slow rainy patterns with Typhoon Morakot, which hit Taiwan in 2009, and Cyclone Hyacinthe, which looped by the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean several times in 1980, according to Patricola. One interesting wrinkle raised by Kossin's new research is that we don't know if storms like Harvey have been dumping more rain primarily because they're moving slowly or because they're holding more moisture due to atmospheric temperatures. It could be both. We need more research to know just how much more we should expect cyclones to slow in a warmer world, according to the new paper. But as hurricane season kicks off in the North Atlantic, slower storms are yet another thing to look out for.","Over the past 70 years, the speed of hurricanes and tropical storms has slowed about 10% on average, according to new research.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Super Typhoon Mangkhut (known locally as Ompong) as it approaches the Philippines. GIF: CIMSS While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention. Super Typhoon Mangkhut is the biggest, baddest storm on the planet, and it’s bearing down on the Philippines’ most populous island. After ripping apart houses in Guam like tin cans, Mangkhut—known as Ompong in the Philippines, which uses a different typhoon naming system—has continued its westward march across the Pacific. The storm is packing wind gusts up to 200 mph, taking the title from Super Typhoon Jebi for the strongest cyclone to grace our fair planet this year. Tropical storm-force winds radiate roughly 300 miles out from its center. The forecast indicates that the storm will likely make landfall overnight or early Saturday morning in the northeast corner of Luzon, an island that’s home to 43 million. The huge wind field means that even Manila, located 250 miles south, could still feel the impacts of Mangkhut. But those in the direct vicinity of Mangkhut’s landfall will have to contend with much more than that. The storm could produce nearly 20 feet of storm surge according to the Red Cross, creating deadly conditions along the coast. The Philippines meteorological service warned that all evacuations should already have taken place and that the “situation is potentially very destructive.” The group notes that trees could be uprooted, coconut plantations could be destroyed, and that the electrical system and homes and commercial buildings are likely to see “severe” damage. Mangkhut has drawn comparisons to Super Typhoon Haiyan, which is a really ominous sign. That storm tore through the Philippines in 2013, leaving 6,000 dead and obliterating entire communities. Mangkhut, however, isn’t quite as strong and is forecast to take a more northerly path through the island nation, passing over a less densely populated region. While there hasn’t been any work to attribute Mangkhut specifically to climate change, the warmer oceans and higher seas that are both hallmarks of our warming world are clear links. Mangkhut is passing over waters that are up to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above normal, providing the fuel it needs to stay strong. The Philippines is also a sea level rise hot spot, with waters rising five times faster than the global average. The Philippines is also a hot spot for typhoons owing to its tropical location. The nation has been hit by more tropical cyclones than any other country save China since 1970.","While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention.

"Randy Peterson, Des Moines Register","Sometimes a bit of a setback can go a ways in learning just who your friends are. Take Iowa State’s latest basketball commitment, Marcedus Leech, for example. He broke a leg while playing pickup ball with his younger brother in a gym last August. Many college coaches who were expressing more than passing interest started to back off. They were moving on from the 6-foot-5 wing player with the broken leg. Steve Prohm and his Iowa State staff hung with him. “You know who your friends are, when something bad happens to you,” Leech told the Register Wednesday. “They stayed loyal and true to me.” The three-star 2019 recruit committed on social media last May. Iowa State accepted the offer, first reported by the Ames Tribune, Wednesday. “Throughout my injury, Iowa State stuck by my side,” Leech said. “That was a big key for me. We had a great relationship, even when others were starting to back away.” He chose Iowa State over reported offers from such schools as Kansas, Miami, Texas Tech, Missouri, Tennessee and Vanderbilt, among others. His injury forced him to miss his junior high school season. His first competitive game was in AAU competition last weekend in St. Louis. “Played one game and it felt good to be back out there,” he said. “I had about 25 points, five rebounds and six assists. It was a good game for my confidence.” Leech can play three positions. “I like to score the basketball,” he said. “I think I can do that pretty well.” He’ll be scoring for his high school team again during his senior season. “Going down with the injury and seeing who would stick with me, really opened my eyes,” he said. “Iowa State was there with me every step of the way.” For more, visit the Des Moines Register","Marcedus Leech suffered a broken leg last summer, and his recruitment slowed down.

Hillary Leung,"A major cyclone the equivalent of a strong Category 2 hurricane approached the coast of Mozambique late Thursday, prompting residents to brace for what weather authorities have called a likely “worst case scenario.”
Cyclone Idai was forecast to make landfall just south of Beira, the nation’s fourth-largest city with a population of half a million, late Thursday night. It is now carrying sustained 110 mph winds gusting to above 130 mph, according to the Washington Post.
Flooding from Idai’s path inland has already killed 122 people in Mozambique and Malawi, making it the deadliest weather disaster this year.
The landfall will pose further threat to the African country, with authorities saying it could bring a “life-threatening” storm surge of up to 13 feet along Mozambique’s coastline, and close to 20 feet at the mouth of the Pungwe river, which runs to Zimbabwe. The surge could submerge thousands of homes and businesses, and potentially displace more than 1,000 residents, the Post reports.
Mozambique ranks third among countries in Africa most susceptible to weather-related hazards, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. In 2015, Cyclone Chedza killed 140, and in 2000, Tropical Cyclone Eline left 350 dead and 650,000 homeless across southern Africa. Cyclone Idai is predicted to be the strongest to make landfall in Mozambique since Eline.
Mozambican authorities have issued a red alert regarding Tropical Cyclone Idai and humanitarian response is ongoing in Malawi and Mozambique. The government, with support from local and international partners, is providing assistance to people already displaced by floods, but access is being impeded by road damage, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

LEIGH ELSTON,"But being better than coal is a low bar and is not enough for a stable climate, said Jonathan Gaventa, a senior associate at the sustainable development think tank E3G, who recently moved to Maputo. Both coal and gas power generation are also beginning to be challenged by low-cost renewable resources.
That doesnt change the fact that Mozambique needs the money. But will it really improve the lives of ordinary people?
I saw one attendee leave the presentation early. I had this awkward feeling with thousands of deaths and the emergency, and I am here discussing who gets the biggest piece of the cake, he told me later.
Weak state institutions and low government accountability make Mozambique vulnerable to the resource curse when a dependence on natural-resource revenues leads to higher rates of conflict and corruption and a decline in democracy and economic growth.
The conflict has already begun. Since October 2017, Islamist insurgents have been attacking villages, burning houses and decapitating residents in Cabo Delgado. Little is understood about the cause of this violence, but rising poverty and inequality are thought to be at its root. The gas projects will further disrupt the areas economic balance.
The government has cracked down with mass arrests. Human Rights Watch has reported that the security forces have allegedly arbitrarily detained, ill-treated and summarily executed dozens of people they suspected of belonging to the insurgency.
Since Cyclone Idai hit, the insurgency has dropped from the headlines, aided by the fact that the governor of Cabo Delgado has reportedly ordered journalists to stop covering the conflict. At least two journalists have been detained for doing so.",The money could make the country more resilient — if it’s not lost to conflict and corruption first.,2019-03-26T16:01:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Can Exxon Mobil Protect Mozambique From Climate Change?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/opinion/cyclone-idai-mozambique-climate-change.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/26/opinion/26elston1/26elston1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,cyclone,1
ANDREW MELDRUM / AP,"(JOHANNESBURG) — Rapidly rising floodwaters have created “an inland ocean” in Mozambique endangering scores of thousands of families, as aid organizations scramble to rescue and provide food to survivors of Cyclone Idai.
Mozambique’s swollen rivers have already flooded huge expanses of the country and continued rains are causing the waters to rise, endangering people on rooftops and clinging to treetops, said emergency workers.
“This is a major humanitarian emergency that is getting bigger by the hour,” said Herve Verhoosel of the World Food Program on Tuesday. Large numbers of people are “crammed on rooftops and elevated patches of land outside the port city of Beira” and WFP is rescuing as many as possible and providing airdrops of food, water and blankets, he said.
Mozambique’s Pungue and Buzi rivers have overflowed, creating “inland oceans extending for miles and miles in all directions,” said Verhoosel. Central Mozambique faces further flooding as dams have reached 95 percent to 100 percent capacity and heavy rains are expected to continue until Thursday.
“People visible from the air may be the lucky ones and the top priority now is to rescue as many as possible and ferry them to safety,” he said.
Four tons of high-energy biscuits are being air dropped Monday as part of 20 tons of food that WFP will distribute, he said.
A statement says the extent of the damage is not yet known as many areas remain impassible. With key roads washed away, aid groups are trying to get badly needed food, medicine and fuel into the hard-hit port city of Beira by air and sea.
WFP says the city could face a “serious fuel shortage” in the coming days and that Beira’s power grid is expected to be non-functional through the end of the month.
Cyclone Idai created massive damage as it swept across central Mozambique before dropping huge amounts of rain in Zimbabwe’s eastern mountains. That rainfall is now rushing back through Mozambique further inundating the already flooded countryside.
“It’s dire,” Caroline Haga of the Red Cross told The Associated Press from Beira. “We did an aerial surveillance yesterday and saw people on rooftops and in tree branches. The waters are still rising and we are desperately trying to save as many as possible.”
Satellite images are helping the rescue teams to target the most critical areas, said Haga.
“We’re in a very scary situation,” she said. Rescue operations are based at Beira airport, which is one of the few places in the city that has communications.
The waters have flooded a swath of land more than 30 miles wide flooded in central Mozambique, said the aid group, Save the Children.
The lives of more than 100,000 people are at risk from the overflowing rivers, said the group in a statement.
“The assessment emerging from Mozambique today is chilling,” said Machiel Pouw, Save the Children’s response leader in Mozambique. “Thousands of children lived in areas completely engulfed by water. In many places, no roofs or tree tops are even visible above the floods. In other areas, people are clinging to rooftops desperately waiting to be rescued.”
The statement says torrential rain is still lashing the region, adding that Buzi town could be entirely submerged within 24 hours.
Save the Children, which works in coordination with Mozambique’s government, says three trucks of relief items are on their way to Beira, the major city in the affected region which took “the full force” of the cyclone.
The flooding disaster is also affecting Malawi and Zimbabwe where hundreds are dead, many more are missing and thousands are at risk.
Mozambique’s President Filipe Nyusi has said the death toll could reach as high as 1,000. Although emergency workers warn they do not know whether the fatalities will reach that estimate, they say this is the region’s most destructive flooding in 20 years.
Hardest hit is Mozambique’s Beira port, a city of 500,000 where thousands of homes have been destroyed.
The city and surrounding areas have no power and nearly all communication lines have been destroyed. Beira’s main hospital has been badly damaged. The cities of Dondo and Chimoio in central Mozambique are also badly affected.
The medical charity Doctors Without Borders said its work in Beira and other local health centers had “ceased completely” but it was working to resume operations. The group anticipates that water and hygiene needs will remain high in the coming days.
In Zimbabwe the death toll has risen to 98, the government said. The mountain town of Chimanimani was badly hit. Several roads leading into the town have been cut off, with the only access by helicopter.
Malawi’s government has confirmed 56 deaths, three missing and 577 injured amid the severe flooding. Rivers have burst their banks, leaving many houses submerged and around 11,000 households displaced in the southern district of Nsanje.
Neighboring Tanzania’s military airlifted some 238 tons of emergency food and medicine to the three affected countries.

Zoë Henry,"Welcome to the 150 th episode of the Inc. Uncensored podcast, hosted by Inc. editor James Ledbetter. This week, staff writer Zoë Henry discusses the business of 'bombogenesis,' the scientific name for the superstorm that pummeled the Northeast this week. As gusts of 40 and 50 mph wind dumped inches of snow and sleet on coastal cities, companies that manufacture plows, blowers and salt spreaders prepared for a much-needed sales boost. Meanwhile, at least one snow removal service expects to see as much as $100,000 in net revenue per day from the storm. Then, Inc.'s executive director of editorial Jon Fine delves into the rise and fall of GoPro, the subject of a winter issue feature. Fine explores how founder Nick Woodman, at 42, has become a more seasoned executive, after being forced to fire a quarter of his staff in March 2017 thanks to an ill-advised pivot to media. Finally, for our executive interview segment, the group interviews Austin McChord, founder of the small business data recovery firm Datto.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months. Now the 900,000 people who settled in refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar are facing another threat: heavy rain and landslides as the monsoon season picks up. The monsoon has been dubbed one of the most important climate patterns in the world. The rains spread from southeast to northwest over the course of the summer, nourishing fields across South Asia that provide food for many of the 1.76 billion people who live there. But they also pose an existential threat to refugees. As the refugee camps swelled, the forests in and around them quickly vanished as people sought wood for housing and building fires to cook. Makeshift structures of bamboo and tarps sprung up. Ditches were also dug for sanitation. Now with the onset of monsoon season, the haphazard infrastructure and lack of ground cover has put people living in the camps in grave danger as the rains have picked up. “Last week there was a strong monsoon depression over North Bay of Bengal which cause heavy rains over Cox Bazar area,” Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, told Earther. The United Nations reported that more than 15 inches of rain fell between Sunday and Tuesday, the equivalent of what normally falls over 20 days in June. With no trees to slow the runoff, 37 landslides occurred that affected 11,000 people. The Guardian indicates at least three are dead following the rains. Aerial mapping done by the United Nations shows an estimated 200,000 refugees could be at risk of landslides and floods, and more than 41,000 of them are living in areas with a high risk of landslides. In addition to the physical dangers, waterborne diseases are a growing risk, particularly without adequate sanitation. Acharya said the forecast for the rest of the monsoon season indicates increased odds of more rainfall that normal. That increases the risk of landslides, which is why the United Nations is pushing ahead for what they’re referring to as “mid-term shelters” with concrete moorings built on flat ground that can withstand the heavy rains and some landslides. “We need government approval for mid-term shelters and in view of the current weather and urgency to quickly provide more shelters to relocate families most at risk of landslides, we are focussing [sic] on this right now,” Caroline Gluck, a senior public information officer with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in Cox’s Bazar, told Earther. The agency has also been working to help get families upgraded shelter kits including tarps, wire, rope, and bamboo. These kits have been supplied to more than 185,000 households. While they offer a modicum more security against the rains, they’re no match for landslides or winds that could come if a tropical cyclone hits the camp—a distinct risk. According to data maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 63 tropical systems have passed within 100 nautical miles of Cox’s Bazar. The most recent to make a nearby landfall was a tropical depression that hit in October 2011. One of the biggest impediments to speeding the whole process up is money. Earlier this year, the United Nations requested $951 million to “meet the immediate needs of more than 880,000 refugees and over 330,000 Bangladeshis in communities affected by the crisis.” Of that $136.6 million would be used for shelters. To date, only 13 percent of that funding has been provided.","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months.

BRET STEPHENS,"So maybe its time to acquaint (or reacquaint) ourselves with the original, and theres no better way of doing it than to read the historian Andrew Robertss Churchill: Walking With Destiny. A review last month in The Times called it the best single-volume biography of Churchill yet written, but its more than that. Its an antidote to the reigning conceits, self-deceptions, half-truths and clichés of our day. For instance: Being born into privilege is ipso facto a privilege. For Churchill who suffered as a child under the remote glare of a contemptuous father and a self-indulgent mother; fought valiantly in four wars by the time he was 25; and earned his own living through prodigious literary efforts that ultimately earned him a Nobel Prize the main privilege was the opportunity to bear up under the immense weight of inner expectation that came with being born to a historic name. Or: To be a member of the establishment is to be a creature of it. Churchill championed free trade to the consternation of Tory protectionists. He supported super-taxes on the rich and pensions for the old to the infuriation of his aristocratic peers. He called for rearmament before both world wars against the hopes and convictions of the pacifists and appeasers in power. His great, unfulfilled political ambition was to create a party of the sensible center. Being at the center of the establishment is what allowed him to be indifferent to and better than it. Or: To be a champion of empire is to be a bigot. In 1899, Churchill envisioned a future South Africa in which Black is to be proclaimed the same as white to be constituted his legal equal, to be armed with political rights. He denounced the 1919 British massacre of Indian demonstrators at Amritsar as a monstrous event. He promoted social reform at home so that Britain could be a worthy leader of its dominions abroad. Churchill was a patriot, a paternalist, a product of his time and, by those standards, a progressive. Or: The moral judgments of the present are superior to those of the past. One of the alleged crimes for which Churchill is now blamed is the perpetration of a genocide in India after a cyclone-caused famine in 1943. Evidence for this is that he used racially insensitive humor during the crisis. Except that Churchill did send whatever food he could spare, Japan was threatening India from Burma, the rest of world was at war, and difficult choices had to be made.","In this season of giving, get (and give) Andrew Roberts’s brilliant new biography.",2018-12-15T02:31:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",An Antidote to Idiocy in ‘Churchill’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/opinion/andrew-roberts-winston-churchill-book.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/14/opinion/14stephensWeb/14stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,cyclone,1
MICHAEL WILSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN,"But interviews with experts familiar with Kennedy’s operations this weekend, as well as with scores of passengers both inside that jampacked airport and others far away, hint at the complicated story to someday come, and offer a view from within the chaotic scene. The arrival of a severe winter storm on Thursday was not a surprise. With a snowstorm ominously described as a bomb cyclone bearing down on the New York area, the Port Authority started warning about airport disruption and flight cancellations on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, as the snow piled up and winds strengthened, the Port Authority announced that Kennedy would temporarily shut down. At 1 p.m., it was telling travelers that it intended to resume flight activity later that day. Around the world, airlines were reading that forecast as a green light to take off for long hauls to New York City. As late as 6:20 p.m., the Port Authority was still sending out tweets that it expected to reopen Kennedy that night. But an hour later, close to 7:30 p.m., the Port Authority decided to keep Kennedy closed until Friday morning. That meant that all of the flights bound for Kennedy had to divert to other airports or turn around. The sudden, unplanned detouring of all of those planes set off a chain reaction that stretched to various continents and left Kennedy tied in knots for the next few days, with passengers stranded in overcrowded terminals and on planes. “Virtually no foreign airline canceled any flights into J.F.K.” on Thursday, said Jason Rabinowitz, a freelance aviation blogger who tracked the cascading pileup as it played out. “They all launched their aircraft, but by the time they got halfway over the Atlantic, they found out they couldn’t land at J.F.K.” As an example, Mr. Rabinowitz cited Iberia Flight 6253, which got halfway to New York from Madrid before making a U-turn and going back to Spain: an eight-hour fight to nowhere. Norwegian Air Flight 7019 made a similar journey Thursday night en route to New York from France. “That was kind of weird,” said Mona Bismuth, 27, a passenger. “We turned around at the southern tip of Greenland.” A passenger on a different flight was sent back to Moscow — twice — because of what was happening in New York. When Kennedy gradually reopened on Friday, the airlines started sending their diverted planes on to Kennedy. The airport’s runways could handle the traffic, but some of its terminals were quickly overwhelmed with planes arriving faster than gates could be cleared for them. That mismatch continued into Saturday, as the airlines played catch-up on the flights they had sent elsewhere or had canceled.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"On October 16 last year, the Sun turned red over the southern United Kingdom. People across the country documented the strange phenomenon on social media. Meteorologists figured out the reason pretty quickly—plumes of dust from the Sahara desert and the Iberian Peninsula got caught in a cyclone from Hurricane Ophelia. The dust became negatively electrically charged on its way up to the UK, where it partially obscured the Sun, turning it a dim red-orange. New research presents the results from an analysis of the plume, and the findings might help improve weather forecasting in the future. The team from the University of Reading and University of Bath in the United Kingdom observed the dust cloud from several British weather observatories, which were able to sample the dust and measure how laser light bounced off of it. A lightning detector from one of the sites was also able to measure the increased electric charge of the cloud. First, how the dust turned the Sun red: “The reddening of the sun arises from preferential scattering of blue light, as light is attenuated within the optically thick plume,” according to the paper published in Environmental Research Letters. The dust prefers to scatter some colors of sunlight over others (and weakens the light), resulting in the redder-looking Sun. All of these combined elements could be important for trying to predict the weather (something that, as we’ve said before, is not easy). These particles may have influenced the clouds forming that day, according to the paper. Falling particles, as well as their observed electric charge, might accumulate more water molecules—water molecules are shaped such that they have a lot more charge on one side of the molecule than the other, so they have a tendency to cling to things. Indeed, one of the observation sites did measure a descending cloud during the period after the dust clouds arrived, though correlation is not causation. Plumes of dust commonly contain electrical charge due to collisions and friction between the particles, according to the paper. But considering the importance of aerosol particles like these to the weather (they can become the seeds of clouds), their electrical charge is something worth studying more. Even the Large Hadron Collider has an experiment that measures how different properties of dust particles, like their size and composition, can affect clouds. According to the new paper, “Whilst electrical properties of dust have long been observed, its electrical effects are not considered in atmospheric numerical models.” Ultimately, it’s a meteorologist’s job to predict the weather. But if there’s one thing you take away from any weather-related story, it’s that, well, the weather is often a very difficult physics problem. So be nice to your local weatherperson if they’re having trouble giving you a good forecast. Who knows what strange physics are getting in the way.

Timothy Gardner,"(Reuters) - Climate change played a hand in the deadly floods in the U.S. upper Midwest that have damaged crops and drowned livestock, scientists said on Thursday, while a Trump administration official said more homework was needed before making that link. 
The “bomb cyclone” that dumped rain on Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri and killed at least four people now threatens a wider region downstream of swollen rivers and smashed levees. 
Manmade greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the oceans and making the air above them more humid, scientists said. When a storm picks up and eventually spits out that moisture, it can be devastating for people caught below. 
“The atmosphere is pretty close to fully saturated, it’s got all the water it can take,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
Big storms like the bomb cyclone and Hurricane Harvey, which smacked Houston in 2017 with record downpours, are where the impact of climate change can most clearly be seen, he said, adding that climate change’s fingerprints were all over the recent storm. 
“I don’t think it’s a starring role, but it’s a strong supporting role,” said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally-funded office, of climate change’s role in the Midwest floods. 
He said the bomb cyclone was carrying vast amounts of moisture from the Pacific up to 1,500 miles (2,400 km) away. 
Wehner said the flooding was consistent with projections in a government report issued last November, the National Climate Assessment Volume II, that said climate change would boost costs in industries from farming to fisheries and energy production by increasing the frequency of powerful storms. 
That report, mandated by Congress, was compiled by 13 federal departments and agencies, but was called inaccurate by the White House. 
President Donald Trump has cast doubt on mainstream climate change science and announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement, an international accord to fight climate change, saying it is too costly. 
The White House National Security Council has also been considering the formation of a panel to assess science used in military and intelligence reports, which have angered Trump by concluding climate change poses a national security threat. 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the link between climate change and the storm. 
‘FOOL’S ERRAND’ 
Deke Arndt, chief of climate monitoring at the National Centers for Environmental Information, an arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that the type of heavy precipitation that immediately led to the upper Midwest floods is generally increasing over time. 
But trying to link the role of climate change to an individual event is a “fool’s errand” akin to trying to determine the cause of a car crash while the wheels are still spinning, he told reporters on a conference call. 
More research needs to be done to find a definitive answer on climate’s link to the floods, Arndt said. 
NOAA officials said on the call they expect the floods to continue through May and get more dire as snow melts and water continues to flow downstream. 
Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, agreed that climate change likely made the Midwest floods worse. 
But he said that investments in levees and other infrastructure to deal with changes have not kept up, making communities more vulnerable. 
“People have developed infrastructure for the way the climate was in the past, and haven’t really been able to evolve to the climate of now and the future,” said Wuebbles.
