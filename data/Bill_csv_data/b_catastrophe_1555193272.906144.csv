Vince Beiser,"The night before the mission, Kenji Matsuzaki could not sleep. For more than a year, Matsuzaki and a team of engineers had been developing their little robot—a bread-loaf-sized, red and white machine equipped with five propellers, a transparent dome, front and rear video cameras, and an array of lights and sensors. Nicknamed Little Sunfish, it was engineered to operate ­underwater, in total darkness, amid intense radiation. And after three months of testing, training, and fine-tuning, it was deemed ready to fulfill its mission: to find and photograph the melted-down radioactive fuel that had gone missing inside the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. More than six years had passed since an earthquake and tsunami hammered northeastern Japan and reduced the Fukushima facility to radioactive ruin. In all that time, no one had been able to locate the hundreds of tons of fuel inside the three reactors that had suffered core meltdowns. The uranium fuel had overheated, turned into lava, and burned through its steel container. That much was known. What happened after that was the big question. Did all the fuel flow out of the reactors, or was some still inside? Did it pile up in a heap, spread out in a puddle, spatter on the walls? Without knowing the answers to those questions, it was nearly impossible to devise a plan to get rid of it. And getting rid of it is imperative. Every day, as much as 165 tons of groundwater seeps into the reactors, becoming contaminated with radiation. And there’s always the possibility that another earthquake or some other disaster could rupture the reactors again, sending radiation spilling out into the air, sea, or both. Human beings couldn’t go into the heart of Fukushima’s reactors to find the missing fuel, though—at least not without absorbing a lethal dose of radiation. The job would have to be done by robots. But no robot had ever carried out such a mission before. Many had already tried and failed. Debris tripped them up. Yard-thick concrete walls threatened to block their wireless signals. Radiation fouled up their microprocessors and camera components. And so it fell to Matsuzaki, a shy-eyed, 41-year-old senior scientist with Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch, to help build a machine that wouldn’t end up as another one of the robot corpses already littering the reactors. Just getting the Sunfish and its support gear into position inside the enormous concrete building that housed one of the crippled reactors took two days. Four separate teams took turns setting up the control panel, cable drum, and other equipment the robot would need to function. Even in full protective bodysuits, each group of workers could spend only a few minutes inside the structure, working by the light of portable electric lamps amid a thicket of machinery, pipes, and catwalks. When one team absorbed its maximum permitted daily dose of radiation, it was replaced by another group. Matsuzaki himself made two forays inside to put the final touches on the Sunfish, sweating inside his face mask and bodysuit in the summer heat, his nerves jumping each time his portable monitor dinged to indicate he’d received another increment of his allowable radiation dose. The plan was for the Sunfish to spend three days mapping the debris and searching for signs of the missing fuel. Matsuzaki would monitor its progress from a control room about 500 yards away. He would be joined by a half-dozen top officials from his employer, Toshiba, and Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the mammoth utility that owns the plant. His success—or failure—would be broadcast daily around the world. Beyond the immediate danger, cleaning up Fukushima remains critical to repairing the image of Japan’s energy industry. In the wake of the disaster, Japan shut down every one of its dozens of nuclear plants, which had provided some 27 percent of the nation’s power. To cover the loss, it had to massively increase imports of expensive fossil fuels. A few nuclear plants have since been permitted to restart, following years of safety upgrades, but Fukushima cost the industry much of its public support. Polls consistently show that a majority of the public opposes nuclear power. Two of Japan’s former prime ministers, including the one in office at the time of the disaster, have flipped from supporting nuclear plants to calling for their elimination. The disaster also dealt a severe blow to the global nuclear industry, which had been gaining favor even among some environmentalists as a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. In the aftermath of the meltdown, Germany announced it would phase out nuclear power altogether, Vietnam dropped plans to build reactors, and the whole industry was thrown on the defensive. Every proposed new reactor now has to answer the question: How do we know this won’t be another Fukushima? Small wonder that in the nights leading up to the mission, Matsuzaki was feeling the pressure. “I’ve been having nightmares about failing,” he confessed to his boss, Akira Tsuyuki. “Me too,” Tsuyuki said. Late at night on July 18, 2017, the mission start time just a few hours away, Matsuzaki lay awake, wondering whether his team’s technology would be any match for Fukushima. The earthquake on March 11, 2011, was the biggest ever recorded in Japanese history, a 9.0 monster that devastated northeastern Japan and triggered a series of tsunamis that slammed into the coast, killing nearly 16,000 people. The tsunamis also knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, shutting down the pumps needed to keep cooling water circulating in the reactor cores. Over the next several days, as Tepco engineers worked by flashlight to regain control, the fuel in three of the plant’s six reactors—Units 1, 2, and 3—melted down. Gases unleashed by the damage exploded, sending plumes of radioactive particles like iodine, cesium, and plutonium into the atmosphere. The government ordered everyone within a 12-mile radius to evacuate, with about 165,000 people eventually displaced. Government officials originally estimated it would take about 40 years and $50 billion to clean up the plant, decontaminate the surrounding area, and compensate the disaster’s victims. In December 2016, they more than tripled that estimate to $188 billion. “We have never experienced a disaster as big as Fukushima,” Hiroshige Seko, the head of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, told reporters at the time, according to Bloomberg. “With our limited knowledge, it was very difficult to make the previous forecast.” The Fukushima cleanup is a project far bigger and more complex than those of even the world’s worst previous nuclear catastrophes. Chernobyl was literally covered up: The Soviets simply encased the whole thing in concrete and steel. Three Mile Island was tiny by comparison. Only a single reactor melted down, and none of its fuel escaped. “Fukushima is orders of magnitude more difficult,” says Lake Barrett, an American who oversaw the cleanup of Three Mile Island and who signed on as a consultant to Tepco and the Japanese government in 2013. The Hot Zone Following the meltdown, nearly 165,000 people had to evacuate the area surrounding the Fukushima plant to avoid radioactive exposure. Today, even after extensive cleanup efforts, 50,000 people still can’t go home. In the first chaotic weeks after the meltdown, with radiation levels far too intense for anyone to work inside the reactors, Tepco scrambled to deploy robots to assess and contain the damage. Tractor-treaded bots from iRobot, drones from Honeywell, and a prototype disaster-­response mech from Tohoku University scouted the rubble-­strewn facility and tried to measure the intensity of the radiation. A remote-­controlled concrete pumping truck was adapted so that its extendable spout could pour water into the reactors, cooling and stabilizing the overheated chambers. In the months and years that followed, Fukushima became both a market and a proving ground for ever-advancing robot technologies designed to operate in hazardous conditions. Remote-controlled front-end loaders, backhoes, and other heavy equipment were put to work breaking up radioactive debris and loading it onto remote-controlled dump trucks. A four-legged walking robot investigated the reactor buildings. Robots with 3-D scanners were sent in to gather imagery and map radiation levels. Swimming robots inspected pools where spent fuel rods were stored, taking pictures. But none of these robots were capable of penetrating the innermost areas of the reactors. In August 2013, the Japanese government assembled a consortium of public utilities and private companies, including Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Toshiba, to create robots specifically for the most challenging environments. Dubbed the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, it has developed some 20 machines that have been deployed onsite. Their ranks include a snakelike bot that crawled through a tiny accessway into Unit 1, then bent itself into a more stable U-shape to explore inside. Then there was the Scorpion, a tank-tread-driven machine with a camera mounted on an elevating “tail” that was sent into Unit 2. The Japanese government is bankrolling a $100 million, state-of-the-art R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant where robot operators train on digital models of the reactors in a giant 3-D Holo Stage and on life-size physical mock-ups. A robot undergoes testing at the government’s new $100 million R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant. But even with the massive government investment, many of the new robots still couldn’t hack it inside the reactors. The camera on one of them, sent to clear a path for the Scorpion, was shut down by radiation; the Scorpion itself got tripped up by fallen debris. The first version of the snakelike bot got stuck; the second did better but failed to find any melted fuel. “It’s very difficult to design a robot to operate in an unknown environment,” says Hajime Asama, a professor at the University of Tokyo who was one of the first roboticists the government turned to for help. “Until we send the bot in, we don’t know what the conditions are. And after it’s sent, we can’t change it.” Kenji Matsuzaki has worked in Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch for more than 10 years, and by May 2016, when he was assigned to the team developing a robot to explore inside Unit 3 of Fukushima, he was familiar with the plant’s basic architecture. All six of its reactors are boiling-water reactors, a type designed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and found all over the world, including in the United States. They generate electricity by circulating water through their infernally hot cores, converting it to steam that is used to turn turbine generators. Each reactor has three containers set one inside another like Russian nesting dolls. The smallest container, a steel capsule about the length of a tennis court, is called the reactor pressure vessel. That’s where the nuclear fission reaction takes place, powered by fuel composed of uranium dioxide baked into ceramic pellets. This capsule is enclosed inside a primary containment vessel, a concrete and steel structure shaped like a massive light bulb, designed to capture any radiation that might accidentally escape. The containment vessel in turn is housed inside the reactor building, a concrete and metal rectangle that offers only minimal protection from radiation. Technicians in protective gear can work for short periods inside the reactor building, but they can’t enter the far more radioactive containment vessel, which is where they were likely to find at least some of the missing fuel. Building a robot that could get inside and maneuver around the containment vessel presented several unique challenges. First, the containment vessel was only practically accessible through a 5.5-inch circular maintenance opening about 8 feet above the floor of the reactor building, so the robot would have to be small. Second, because the containment vessel had been pumped full of water to cool it down, the robot would have to be able to swim. Third, since the water and thick walls would defeat wireless signals, this small, swimming robot would need to be powerful enough to move under­water while dragging as much as 65 yards of electric cable behind it. It took months of research, experimentation, and testing in Toshiba’s labs and in an enormous simulation tank at the government-run Port and Airport Research Institute to balance all these capabilities inside the little machine. Matsuzaki’s team had to try different configurations of propellers, cameras, and sensors, boost the power of the propeller motors, develop a new type of coating to make the cable move more smoothly, and ensure the whole package could withstand a blistering level of radiation. Simulation facility at the Naraha Remote Technology Development Center. At midnight on July 19, the day the Sunfish was scheduled to make its first foray into the reactor, Matsuzaki’s alarm went off in his hotel room. He and his team were staying in Iwaki, the closest habitable city with a hotel, about an hour south of the plant. Starting their day in the dark of night was the only way to have enough time to drive to the plant, suit up in protective gear, and hold a last round of meetings before their start time. That would give them about eight hours; by noon it would be too hot inside the reactor building for the technicians monitoring the robot to do their jobs. At about 4:30 am, a group of Toshiba techs in full protective gear darted into the reactor building. They fast-walked to the outer wall of the containment vessel and climbed a step ladder up to the opening where the Sunfish and its equipment had been pre-positioned. They unsealed the valve over the opening, then pushed in a heavy guiding pipe, with the Sunfish at its tip, all the way through to the other side. Slowly and carefully, they angled the pipe until the bot slid into the water below. Inside, it was completely dark. On their monitors in the control room, Matsuzaki’s team, connected to the Sunfish’s controls via the electric cable, could see only a narrow swath cut through the turbid water by the Sunfish’s lights. Seated at a long table, one technician “drove” the Sunfish with a videogame-­type controller. Another reeled its cable in and out, keeping it taut so it wouldn’t get tangled as the bot swam this way and that. A third did his best to estimate the machine’s position using a 3-D software model of the containment vessel. Matsuzaki oversaw them all, trying to forget about the platoon of corporate officials watching over his shoulder. The Sunfish had to be able to swim (right), fit into the small opening of the containment vessel (top left), and withstand challenges that crippled an earlier robot, the Scorpion (bottom left). The first day, the Sunfish spent most of its time reconnoitering. The damage inside the containment vessel was worse than expected. Unidentifiable clumps of pebble-sized debris and pieces of half-destroyed equipment littered the floor. But there was no sign of the fuel, and after eight hours of searching, the team pulled the Sunfish back to the surface. They gave it a rest the next day while they discussed their findings and strategized their next steps. The following morning, they sent the Sunfish back into the water. The team drove it slowly and carefully, but time after time, the bot’s powerful propellers would stir up a blinding cloud of sediment, forcing them to wait until the water cleared again. After several hours of maneuvering, and with the noon deadline looming, Matsuzaki was growing nervous. Then, something startling appeared on the monitors. “What is that?” said Matsuzaki. Everyone began talking at once and pointing to what they saw on the screens: murky glimpses of what appeared to be stalactites of something dripping like candle wax from the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. They’d found the first signs of the missing fuel. They maneuvered the Sunfish around the area, documenting as much as possible, before pulling the bot out. When Matsuzaki declared the mission complete, the control room burst into applause. Kenji Matsuzaki, the lead scientist behind Little Sunfish. By now, much of Fukushima Daiichi itself, an expansive complex covering some 860 acres, is a lot safer than you’d expect. Most areas have been decontaminated to the point where full bodysuits are no longer required. The 5,000-plus workers tasked with cleaning the place up have cut down hundreds of the cherry trees that used to enliven the grounds, torn up and paved over once-grassy open areas, and scrubbed down buildings. They have covered the seafloor just off the coast with clay to seal in cesium that seeped into the mud after the disaster. Using an enormous, purpose-built fuel-handling machine, they have removed the hundreds of spent uranium fuel rods from Unit 4, a reactor that was damaged by an explosion but did not melt down. Still, when I visited the site last December with Lake Barrett, Tepco’s American consultant, we had to put on gloves, safety glasses, surgical masks, three pairs of socks, and plastic booties over our shoes, as well as a personal radiation detector, before being allowed inside the facility. At 72, Barrett is tall, fit, and astonishingly energetic. I first met him at the Narita airport outside Tokyo, where he bounced right off a 20-hour trip from his home in Florida, joined me in a car without stopping for so much as a cup of coffee, and talked cheerily for the entire two-hour drive to Fukushima prefecture. When Barrett heard the first news reports about the disaster, he “didn’t think much of it,” he says. “There’s always so much hype around these things.” Then he saw the picture of Unit 1 exploding. “I said, ‘Holy shit. I know exactly what that was.’ I knew they were in deep doo-doo.” When the call came to help out, he didn’t hesitate. “It’s personal for me,” he says. “Japan was the only country that helped us at Three Mile Island. We owe Japan.” Inside the Fukushima plant, each of these blue towers holds 100 personal radiation detectors. From atop a small hill, once covered with grass and now encased in concrete, Barrett and I survey the trio of hulking buildings outlined against the blues of the winter sky and the Pacific Ocean behind them. Remotely operated orange-and-white cranes lean over them like reverent metal giraffes. These are the reactor buildings: the intractable core of the disaster zone, the radioactive redoubts the robots must penetrate. Each poses a unique challenge. The amount and type of damage inflicted on each is different, as is the depth of the water flooding their bases. Of course, at the heart of each is a mess of melted fuel, presumed to have flowed in different ways to different places. Less than half a mile from these three reactors sits Unit 5, one of the three other reactors that had been shut down for regular maintenance when the tsunami hit. Since it escaped largely unscathed and is nearly identical to the damaged reactors, Tepco engineers use it to plan robot missions. Inside is a baffling maze of machines, ducts, cables, and catwalks. “You can see how hard it is to run the robots around in here,” Barrett says. We navigate our way through the building to the containment vessel. “That’s just like where the Sunfish went in,” he says, pointing up to an unassuming circular opening in the wall of the vessel. We enter the containment vessel and make our way through a narrow doorway into a chamber below the reactor pressure vessel. Control rod assemblies stud the reactor vessel’s underside; we have to crouch to avoid bumping our heads on them. Pointing out key areas and components, Barrett walks me through the current theories on what happened to the fuel in each of the meltdown units. “No one knows if the lava made a nice neat vertical pile or whether it flowed sideways,” he says. “Hot molten fuel could have fallen into the water and caused a steam explosion that would have blown it everywhere.” In Unit 3, at least, thanks to the Sunfish, Tepco is relatively certain about a few things. The pictures it took show that the control-rod mechanisms at the bottom of the reactor vessel disintegrated. Molten fuel mixed with melted metal dripped down through the openings they left behind, presumably creating the stalactites seen in the videos. The lava-like mixture burned through both the steel grate beneath the reactor pressure vessel and a refrigerator-sized machine used to insert the control rods, and some of it dripped down to the floor of the containment vessel. There also appear to be chunks of fuel on the vessel’s walls. Inside Unit 3 Each reactor is made up of three containers, one set inside another, that hold critical equipment. 1. Reactor Building: A large concrete and steel structure that acts as the last line of defense to keep radiation from escaping into the outside world. 2. Primary Containment Vessel: An airtight enclosure made of steel and concrete. 3. Reactor Pressure Vessel: A thick steel container that holds the uranium fuel, which powers the nuclear reactor. 4. Control-Rod Drive: A mechanical system that uses thin rods to speed up or slow down a nuclear fission reaction. The rods work by absorbing the stray neutrons that trigger a chain reaction. 5. Pedestal: A circular concrete structure that holds up the reactor. From inside, workers can access the control-rod drive. That still leaves an awful lot unknown. At the end of the day, “how much did we learn from the Sunfish mission?” Barrett asks. “It was a step, not a leap. We’re getting closer and closer, but we have a long, long way to go.” Tepco is continuing its efforts to scout the inside of the reactors. In January, a robotic probe using a remote­-controlled camera mounted on a long pole spotted for the first time what appears to be melted fuel inside Unit 2. There may be another Sunfish mission, though it won’t be the same robot that found the fuel in Unit 3. Despite emerging from the reactor undamaged, it had still absorbed a dangerous amount of radio­activity. Tepco engineers sealed it in a steel cask and interred it with other radioactive waste on the plant site. Limited and uncertain as the Sunfish’s findings are, they have helped move the ball forward. Engineers have now begun thinking about how to build the next generation of robots that will have to carry out the most complicated undertaking of all: removing the melted fuel. Their first challenge will be enabling the bots to reach their target. “These are cramped spaces filled with huge pieces of equipment that weigh many tons. You have to cut them up in pieces and pull them out,” Barrett says. One idea currently in favor is to build a massive 20-foot robot arm that would enter the reactor building on rails, reach into the reactor pressure vessel, and scoop up the fuel. Another is to send in a bot the size of a small refrigerator on tractor treads, equipped with cutting and gripping tools to wrangle debris. A second robot would lift the detritus into containers, seal it, and put it on a conveyor belt to the outside. Either system will take years to develop. Either or both might fail. Tepco has pegged 2021 as the target year to begin removing fuel debris. How long might the entire Fukushima cleanup take? “Good question. Nobody knows. No one in human history has experience with this,” says Naoaki Okuzumi, a senior manager with the decommissioning institute. “The government says 30 to 40 years. I think that is optimistic.” While the robots’ work inside Fukushima Dai­ichi drags on, human beings who once lived near the plant are waiting to go home. The national government has decontaminated several towns and urged residents to return. At the time of my visit in December, though, roughly 130 square miles of land was still off-limits, including the better part of a town called Okuma, perched in the hills a few miles from the plant. Yoshihiro Takada, a former resident who now works with the local government agency in charge of rebuilding, agreed to show me around. Takada spent almost his entire life in Okuma and had to escape with his wife, child, and parents when the disaster hit. They’ve relocated to another town 65 miles away. I met up with Takada in a parking lot just outside the exclusion zone, where we put on full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties over our shoes to protect us from the particles of cesium and strontium. Inhaling even a dust speck of one of those isotopes can be dangerous. That’s part of what makes radiation so terrifying : You can’t feel it, see it, or smell it. It can kill you without you ever knowing you encountered it. A few miles from the Fukushima plant, in the town of Okuma, visitors must wear full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties when walking along the abandoned streets. The desolation of the exclusion zone, in the town of Okuma. There was no one in the train station, the barbershop, the restaurants, or the stores. The modest houses and apartment buildings on the residential streets were all empty. The only sound I heard as we walked down the middle of the deserted main street was the chirping of clueless birds who didn’t realize they’d chosen to nest in a radioactive hot zone. “I remember this place—their pizza was so good,” Takada says, gesturing at a shuttered restaurant as we walk through town. Several shop windows have been smashed by wild boar that have come down from the hills to ransack the deserted town for food. Cars sit in driveways half-hidden by overgrown weeds. Takada only occasionally checks in on his own house. “Rats are running all over it inside. There are droppings and garbage all over,” he says. The area around Fukushima is mostly scenic farmland fringed with thickly wooded hills. But drive along practically any road and you pass fields filled with rows and rows of boulder-sized, black polypropylene bags. They are filled with contaminated earth; as part of the cleanup, a layer of topsoil is being scraped up from gardens, schoolyards, and fields all across the region. Roughly 20 million of the bags are scattered around the prefecture. Many of them will eventually be moved to the outskirts of Fukushima Daiichi itself for indefinite storage, along with an ever-growing array of tanks holding the radioactive water Tepco continues to pump out of the reactors. Ultimately, there is no technology that can simply fix what happened at Fukushima. The only certainty is that it will be a slow, incremental, frustrating process that may not even be completed in Kenji Matsuzaki’s lifetime. For now, all the scientists, engineers, and their allies can do is keep the radioactivity under control, track down its source, and try to capture it. But first, they need to create the robots to do it. Radioactive waste at the Tomioka contaminated waste facility. It will be buried for 200 years.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Such goals seem farther away than ever. Neither Mr. Netanyahu nor Mr. Trump has shown serious interest in a two-state solution that would give Palestinians their own country and resolve central questions about land, refugees, borders and security, even though Mr. Trump says a peace deal is a priority. Under Mr. Netanyahu, Israel has expanded its claims to land that Palestinians seek for their own state. Instead of easing tensions and resolving the political questions at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Trump has exacerbated the situation, most recently by unilaterally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in exchange for nothing, and declaring his intention to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. For decades, the international community, including the United States, has said Jerusalem’s fate should be decided in Israeli-Palestinians negotiations. Palestinian leaders have also failed their people. Hamas leaders who run Gaza have waged war against Israel, exploiting their people in the process. Their rival, the Palestinian Authority, has been feckless at pursuing peace with Israel and last year imposed its own punitive measures on Gaza, including cutting salaries, in a bid to end Hamas’s control. On May 15, Palestinians in Gaza plan to observe the 70th anniversary of what they call the “ nakba, ” or “catastrophe,” when 750,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel, by breaking through the border fence and marching toward their former villages. The demonstration will come the day after Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and the United States formally opens its embassy in Jerusalem. Unless someone steps up to end Gaza’s humanitarian disaster, ensure Israel and the Palestinians act with restraint during the protests and set a credible peace process in motion, both sides could face a new catastrophe.","Israel must temper its lethal response to protests in the Gaza tinder box, or risk an escalation neither it nor the Palestinian leadership can contain.",2018-04-02T20:02:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Editorial: Israel Courts Catastrophe in Gaza Protests,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/opinion/gaza-protests-israel-hamas.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/03Tue2/03Tue2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon,"Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. She is the author of ""The Dressmaker of Khair Khana"" and ""Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) Five letters have offered Syrians fleeing the Bashar al-Assad regime a safe haven: Idlib. An estimated 3 million people call the northern Syrian enclave home. It is the last remaining stronghold of the anti-Assad opposition. And more than half of those now in Idlib have fled their homes elsewhere in Syria as they try to escape the horror of a seven-year civil war that has extinguished the power of adjectives to describe its hell. There is no place else for civilians fleeing the regime to easily escape to safety. For weeks, UN officials have warned that an anticipated Syrian regime offensive to retake Idlib province would ignite a "" humanitarian catastrophe."" Turkey, which has backed anti-regime rebels, reinforced forces at the border and made clear it will not take in more than the 3 million Syrians already finding safety inside its border. Meanwhile, Syrian moms and dads prepared homemade gas masks in a desperate push to protect their children from possible regime use of chemical weapons against the rebels. Also in Idlib: what the UN Special Envoy for Syria calls ""an extremely high concentration of foreign fighters,"" noting that ""this amounted to approximately 10,000 Al Nusra or Al Qaeda members, who have been recognized as terrorists by the UN."" Now comes the deal between Russia and Turkey to stave off the Idlib offensive, create a "" demilitarized zone,"" and separate jihadists from ""moderate rebels."" At least, for now, those civilians who fled Assad remain safe. The resolution shows what might be possible when US public and private diplomacy is at work. It offers a glint of hope that this is the quiet start of US efforts to stave off a further humanitarian crisis. It also raises the faint hope that Idlib could, eventually, lead to Geneva, a peace deal, and a lasting end to the carnage of the Syrian civil war. It is a lot to hope for. But it is not impossible -- if political will and diplomatic determination exist. Indeed, the Idlib deal may be among the first signs that the new US envoy to Syria, Ambassador James Jeffrey, means to get serious about crafting US policy toward Syria. The former US ambassador to both Turkey and Iraq has come out of his thinktank world to take on the Syria portfolio and serve Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He has been traveling the region, visiting capitals -- and talking Idlib. Last week, Jeffrey noted that ""any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation."" Those words surely were translated into Russian. As Syria observer and Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy senior fellow Hassan Hassan wrote on Twitter, ""The US won't get credit, but it's actually played a central role in preventing the Idlib offensive for now. (Surely not a popular opinion for many). Just goes to show that the US can make a difference if there is a will."" Indeed, Jeffrey is one of the few US officials who has earned rare praise from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said it was ""an appropriate decision to appoint Jeffrey to the region."" As Turkey's Daily Sabah noted, the ""US statements last week echoed Turkish concerns and put the two countries in an alignment against the Assad offensive. Some in Washington considered it as a first step to calibrate Turkish-American relations in order to reach a coherent Syria policy that can maintain a working relationship."" Certainly, the US warnings against the Idlib offensive strengthened Turkey's hand in dealing with Putin, noted the paper, even if few thought the Americans would actually follow through on the ground ""as Putin had to consider possible US repercussions along with Turkish resistance."" Down the road lies another step: build upon the glimmer of good will to strengthen US-Turkey ties and possibly even rely upon them to secure Turkey's support for continuing US backing of the Syrian Kurds. The US has considered Syrian Kurds their reliable partners in the counter-ISIS fight, while Turkey has considered them terrorists. Russia has stepped in to fill this gap between the two and court Turkey. Maybe Jeffrey's naming can make a difference here and, in the process, bring more assurances of security to northeast Syria. The US has, for years, exerted minimal influence in Syria, as Russia controlled facts on the ground and Iran expanded its influence and its footprint. The big question now is whether America is ready to use the diplomatic muscle at its disposal to help bring an end to the bloodshed.

David Murphy,"A disaster from years ago still haunts this week’s Tech 911 letter-writer. She’ll explain the full details in a bit, but it makes me grateful for complicated backup setups. Anyway, let’s go put the world’s biggest Band-Aid on a potential technological catastrophe. Lifehacker reader Caroline writes: “Three or four years ago, my Macbook died, and because I was an avid user of Time Machine, I was able to retrieve virtually everything I cared about from my external hard drive, except my photos, because this tragedy happened to coincide with a software update, and thus the updated photos couldn’t access the old photo library that was stored on the other drive. Losing all of the photos from the first 27 years of my life still pains me, even years later, and I’ve kept the external hard drive with everything on it just in case I discover some miraculous way of retrieving this old iPhoto library (doubtful), but how can I prevent it from happening in the future?” Caroline: First, I just wanted to say that I completely sympathize with your issue on this one. I have folders and folders full of unorganized photos that I swear I’ll get to organizing someday—and possibly even backing up to something more than just my network-attached storage device. Regardless, if I were to lose them, I would feel absolutely horrible. And that’s just ten years or so of memories I care about. To lose 27 years’ worth of pictures, especially from the first 27 years of your life... that’s rough. I completely understand that this is something that still haunts you. That said, I’m glad you kept the hard drive, though, because I think there’s a solution to your issue. Though you’ve likely done a bunch of web searching for answers, I presume you haven’t stumbled across the main trick for getting elbow-deep in that library and pulling out all the photos it contains. As Macworld’s Glenn Fleishman wrote in a 2017 article, plug in your external drive, find the photo library, and try these steps: 1. Control-click the iPhoto Library. 2. Choose “Show Package Contents” from the contextual menu. 3. Drag (to move) or Option-drag (to copy) the Masters folder to the Desktop or to another drive. 4. Launch the latest version of iPhoto 9 and import that Masters folder. Or launch Photos and do the same. While this trick will cost you your photos’ metadata, you’ll ideally be able to import them at their full resolutions, which is much more important. Using a tool like this, if I’m right, will make the conversion process easy, but you’ll get lower-quality files. I think. It’s possible that doing the aforementioned trick might not actually show you a folder called “Masters.” That’s fine. As this Reddit post illuminates, you might instead see something called “Originals.” Try using that instead. This should hopefully allow you to import all of your old photos into your latest version of Photos. If you’re having trouble, write me another email and we can try walking through the process together. As for what to do going forward, I recommend synchronizing your photo galleries to the cloud. Whether you do that with Apple and iCloud—and pay for extra storage, I’m guessing, given how many photos you likely have—or a service like Google Photos, which is unlimited and free, is your choice. Dump everything to the cloud, and you’ll never have to worry about photos you can’t access ever again (unless Google or Apple go away someday, but I’m sure you’ll have ample warning for that). You’ll get a lot more peace of mind than just keeping your photos archived on a computer, even a Time Machine backup.","A disaster from years ago still haunts this week’s Tech 911 letter-writer.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After plowing into the North Carolina coast late last week, Florence lingered over Carolinas all weekend like an unwanted house guest. Though its winds had slackened to a tropical depression by Sunday, the record-setting rains it unleashed have created a flooding catastrophe that is still unfolding. The scale of that catastrophe is now becoming apparent in aerial photographs. The storm has set tropical rainfall records for both South and North Carolina. Multiple locations in North Carolina saw more than 30 inches of rain, making this the wettest tropical system to ever hit the East Coast. The relentless rain also helped Wilmington, North Carolina break its annual rainfall record with three months left to go in the year. As Florence stormed ashore, it backed up rivers with its powerful surge. It also dumped copious rain inland, leaving water with nowhere to go but over the banks of rivers and streams. More than two dozen rivers in the Carolinas are currently in a major stage of flooding, and they could take all week to recede. One of the big concerns with Florence was the storm’s potential to wreak havoc on industrial farms and coal ash sites. At least one coal ash site has started leaking, and more could be in danger as water continues to worm its way into the earthen dams that hold it back. All this is to say Florence was everything forecasters expected and more. And with climate change increasing the odds of extreme precipitation and raising sea levels, we’ll almost certainly see more storms that can cause this kind of destruction. Homes along the New River are flooded as a result of high tides and rain from Florence.

ALEXIS SOLOSKI,"A few weeks ago, I was watching a new show, me and the laptop scrunched into the corner of the sofa. It was late at night and everyone else had gone to sleep, when rounding the second episode, my sympathetic nervous system started working unpaid overtime: short breath, tensed muscles, pounding heart, the whole hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal shebang. The show wasn’t a thriller or a horror anthology or a true crime wallow. It was a Netflix comedy, a sweet Australian import called “The Letdown” about Audrey, a frazzled former speechwriter who joins a new mom’s group. Its second episode was about sleep training and even though my daughter, almost 5, and my son, almost 2, have been sleeping through the night for a while now, the physiological fear response came rushing. Cortisol or no, I binged all seven episodes — twice — and lived to tell. But for some new and newish mothers, “The Letdown” may feel so achingly familiar that it’s just about unwatchable. Speaking of aches, the title refers to the reflex that sends milk flowing through the breast, a reflex sometimes accompanied by knifelike pains. All the joys. “The Letdown” isn’t the only current show with a baby monitor trained on mothers and their young children. Joining trends in publishing and comedy (with Ali Wong the filthy-mouthed queen of the genre), this series is part of a mom-com cluster including “Motherland,” new to Sundance Now, and “SMILF,” which just wrapped a first season on Showtime. Amazon’s “Catastrophe,” renewed for a fourth season, also has some sharp observations on new motherhood. These shows are workplace comedies with the workplace redistributed to the home, rom-coms where the romance is maternal.","Series like “The Letdown,” “Motherland,” “SMILF” and “Catastrophe” are part of a new crop of comedies that find humor (and aches) in depictions of new mothers.",2018-05-31T08:00:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Mom-Coms Latch On to the Raw Reality of New Motherhood,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/arts/television/motherhood-comedies-smilf-catastrophe-the-letdown.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/arts/03MOM-TV-ILLO/merlin_138671088_02326c3e-33ed-4c4b-964e-ed34d53b119d-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
ERICA BERRY,"Every few weeks, I wake up clammy from a dream in which I have failed to prepare myself for calamity. A frequent one has me flying down the freeway on cruise control when, out of nowhere, I decide to crawl into the back seat to grab something. I realize my mistake only as I feel the car begin to drift toward the median, but when I try to return to the front seat, my legs go limp. I always wake up before the crash. These nightmares, I’ve come to believe, stem from my fear of that which I cannot control: earthquakes, drunken drivers, antibiotic-resistant superbugs. In my waking life, I fixate on what I can control, even when that means courting absurd fantasies: If I memorize the flight attendant’s safety demonstration, I tell myself, I can survive if the plane goes down. So, a few years ago, when I learned about International Asteroid Day — a holiday on June 30 meant to teach humans about the hazards of planet-destroying space rocks — I felt a flame of dread in my gut. I had always thought that fearing asteroids was a bit like fearing serial killers: They exist, sure, but the odds of encountering one are so low. But they’re not zero; far from it. Reading around, I learned that the chances of being killed by a meteorite — a fragment of an asteroid — are lower than being killed by lightning, but higher than being killed by a shark. NASA says it knows of no asteroids that pose a serious risk to Earth in the next 100 years, though there is a one in 714 chance of an impact in 2185. There is also a conspiracy theory circulating online that NASA is covering up a likely collision in 2019, apparently in an effort to stop global panic. NASA says the closest that rock, 2002 NT7, will come to Earth is about 38 million miles. But were it to hit Earth, it would supposedly do so at a speed of 17 miles per second and with a force 30 million times that of Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It’s nearly impossible to fathom figures so large, but the geological record offers a way of wrapping your mind around them. The asteroid that ended the dinosaurs struck like a pebble in a pond, landing with such force that it essentially liquefied the surface of the Earth at the point of impact. Within seconds, it had torn a hole more than 100 miles wide. The spewed rock climbed to a height as tall as Mount Everest before coming to rest. In 1908, an asteroid the size of a modest office building released the energy of hundreds of Little Boys over central Siberia, in what would come to be known as the Tunguska Event. The impact incinerated 800 square miles of forest and the reindeer within it and left enough dust in the atmosphere that, for several nights afterward, people in Europe could read newspapers until midnight.",It is the one holiday that grants permission to indulge in a spectacle of imagined global catastrophe.,2018-06-20T09:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Letter of Recommendation: Letter of Recommendation: Asteroid Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-asteroid-day.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/24/magazine/24LOR-1/24LOR-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"Yeah, Sharon says. You just have to take everything you ever wanted and put it in a box because you never but yeah! Its great!
The idea that falling in love and having kids isnt the start of a limitless adventure but a narrowing of life paths isnt a typical rom-com conclusion. But where is the lie? Catastrophe is smart and aware about the costs of commitment, especially for women. Its also the rare feminist TV comedy whose perspective is split evenly between male and female protagonists.
The perspective pays off especially well in the fifth episode. which I would call #MeToo-inspired, except that it hits themes the shows had since it began. Sharon has an uncomfortable encounter with a superior at her job and Rob may be the beneficiary of a sexist boss (Chris Noth) at his, two parallel stories that swing between the need to speak up and the difficulty of sacrificing ones self on principle.
Like the previous seasons, the final installment of Catastrophe is six short, neatly contained episodes. Its the rare series in this era of streaming binge marathons whose seasons actually feel too short. With less than three hours to play out, the emotional turns can feel abrupt and the resolutions sudden.
But it also finds the greatest emotional depths of the series in a story line that acknowledges the real-life death of Carrie Fisher, who played Robs mother, Mia, and the co-writers Delaney and Horgan maintain a tone of mordant optimism. Falling in love, this series suggests, is a sort of self-imposed extremity, like marooning yourselves on an island. Its never easy, but you survive by pulling together.
When is it all going to stop being such a slog? Sharon asks Rob at one point. Theres no answer, except the one that this show has acerbically given for four seasons.

MARK MAZZETTI and BEN HUBBARD,"Mr. Trumps words dealt a blow to Turkey, an American ally and fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that has demanded that Saudi Arabia be punished for killing Mr. Khashoggi last month inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. But Mr. Trumps message was warmly welcomed by other American allies in the Middle East who value close ties with Washington but want to be left to rule as they wish. Trump will be viewed as a very courageous president who stuck to his guns and went against the Washington consensus, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political scientist from the United Arab Emirates. Big thank you, Mr. President, from this part of the world. This firm stance will never be forgotten by Riyadh and the other Arab Gulf capitals, and will be reciprocated handsomely on many issues. Tuesdays statement also echoed the presidents past attempts to draw an equivalence between nations that use murder as a tool of power. During an interview with Bill OReilly on Fox News weeks after taking office, Mr. Trump played down President Vladimir V. Putins history of ordering extrajudicial killings comparing it to American history and saying that the United States was better off in the long run being Russias friend rather than foe.

SOMINI SENGUPTA,"Three key issues pit the United States and China against each other in the climate negotiations, where American negotiators are participating pending the countrys formal exit at the end of 2020. First, the United States wants robust rules across the board for all countries to account for their own emissions and be subject to outside scrutiny. China insists on different reporting rules for developing countries. China has India on its side on this demand, though not other vulnerable poor countries, who are wary of looser rules for China. We are basically designing, in Katowice, a whole set of rules that will bind China but that will not cover the United States, said Mr. Li of Greenpeace Asia. It creates a fundamental sense of unfairness in the Chinese mind. The rule book, as its called, is the centerpiece of the Katowice negotiations, which began Monday and run through Dec. 14.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","The worlds governments have reached a new agreement at the just-concluded international climate talks. The result could advance the fight to mitigate humanitys carbon dioxide emissions in order to slow climate change. But activists and scientists say that the negotiations didnt come anywhere near the significant global overhaul needed to seriously address our warming planet. The agreement was reached late on Saturday night local time in Katowice, Poland where delegates representing almost 200 countries have convened for the past two weeks. Their goal was to further the objectives set forth by the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while striving to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. While the Paris Agreement lays out the ambitions and countries made their first pledges toward cooling the planet, the talks in Katowice were intended to provide a more robust framework for the how-to part. They delivered that as something called the Paris Rulebook, but the process wasnt without drama. While attendees were moved to a standing ovation with the rulebooks approval, the agreed-upon rules for mitigating climate change are woefully insufficient for a conference that saw children literally petitioning delegates to consider their future. The process to get here over the final few days was also fraught, with Brazil nearly blocking a way forward on emissions accounting and important issues tied to pricing carbon left on the table for future climate talks. The rules adopted at COP24 are sound, and their transparency will enable us to know whether countries are on track to meet their targets under the Paris agreement, Jake Schmidt, managing director of the International program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. But thats not enough. Climate change is here and getting worse faster than expected, and thats why the world needs to move from slow-walking climate action to sprinting. The slog to the end is about right for a conference regularly marred by fossil fuel-producing countries. Last week, a group of oil allies comprising Kuwait, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. held up discussions by splitting hairs over whether the climate talks should welcome or note a key scientific finding from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Welcoming the findings is a much stronger acknowledgment of what they said: Namely, that carbon emissions must drop 45 percent by 2030 in order to have a chance to stop warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. In the final text, negotiators reached a compromise by welcoming the completion of the report but not the findings themselves. More embarrassing was a pro-fossil fuel event led by the U.S. and headed by Wells Griffith, a Trump administration climate and energy advisor and man who apparently cant read a room to save his life. May Boeve, executive director of nonprofit 350.org, said in a statement that it was maddening to see how the fossil fuel lobby was given free rein at the climate talks. The end result is underwhelming, signaling that not even the last IPCC report on 1.5°C was enough of a wake-up call for some of the biggest polluters on the planet. Even more troubling, the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have gone out of their way to block the official endorsement of the IPCC report, making it clear the low regard in which they hold both science and multilateralism, Boeve said. By refusing to acknowledge what needs to be done before its too late and making the tiniest of tiny baby-steps of progress, politicians have pushed this climate COP toward irrelevance. President Donald Trump and his administration have consistently questioned if not outright denied the existence and effects of climate change, even going as far as attempting to bury its own congressionally mandated climate report by releasing it on Black Friday. Further, the administration continues to spin pro-coal fairy tales any which way it can. The Trump administration and rogue states like Russia and Saudi Arabia forged an alliance of climate denial that poisoned this years negotiations, Jean Su, energy director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. The final rulebook is far too anemic to pull us back from the brink of climate catastrophe. As the future of our planet hangs delicately in the balance, climate action could increasingly rely on the efforts of activists, communities, and individual nations to shift the tide toward a more sustainable world in order to avoid, as Su put it, condemning the planet to suicide by fossil fuels.

GAIA PIANIGIANI,"ROME More than 100 African migrants who set off in a rickety, inflatable dingy have died in a wreck off the Libyan coast, humanitarian workers said on Saturday, in what was the deadliest such episode in recent months.
The scale of the catastrophe became clear after three survivors, two Sudanese and one Gambian, who were rescued by the Italian Navy and brought to shore in the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, told the aid workers that 117 migrants had died.
Survivors told us that they had about 10 women on board, and one of them was pregnant, Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said in a phone interview. There were also two toddlers, one of them was 2 months old.
The migrants were believed to have been from countries in West Africa and Sudan.
The dingy set out on Thursday from the coastal town of Garabulli, Libya, west of Tripoli, and in about 10 hours started deflating and taking on water, survivors told humanitarian workers.
When an aircraft from the Italian Navy on a security and surveillance mission spotted the craft 50 nautical miles northeast of the Libyan capital, the vessel had already started sinking, the Navy said in a statement, and roughly 20 people could be seen on board.
The rescue effort comes in a fraught political environment, with several European governments questioning the motives and behavior of independent rescue groups, and some bringing criminal charges against them.
The Italian Navy said that, after launching two inflatable rafts toward the migrants, it immediately called another helicopter to provide support, as their closest vessel was well beyond 110 nautical miles from the shipwreck.
The helicopter rescued the only three survivors and brought them to the hospital on the island of Lampedusa. They were suffering from hypothermia, had burn scars and were traumatized, humanitarian workers said.
The Italian Coast Guard said in a statement that it had immediately verified that the Libyan Coast Guard was aware of the event within their search and rescue area, ensuring the outmost collaboration.
It also confirmed that a nongovernmental organization, Sea Watch, had offered its help and that the message was passed on to the Libyan Coast Guard.
On Friday night, the Italian Navy said the rescue operations, coordinated by the Libyan Rescue Coordination Center, had concluded after the search for the dinghy proved fruitless.",The scale of the catastrophe became clear after three survivors who were rescued by the Italian Navy told aid workers 117 migrants had died in a wreck of an inflatable dingy.,2019-01-19T15:30:56Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",More Than 100 Migrants Die at Sea in Wreck Off Libya,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/world/africa/migrants-died-sea-wreck-libya.html,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,1
Kristen V. Brown,"Genetic engineering is often derided as “playing God.” No technology approaches that metaphor more closely than the gene drive. A powerful and controversial technology, a gene drive is a form of genetic engineering that allows researchers in a lab to override the rules of natural selection. The offspring of just about any sexually reproducing species typically inherits half of its genes from one parent and half from the other—a genetic Powerball drawing. A gene drive rigs the lottery, ensuring that a particular trait is passed down to all of one parent’s offspring. Now why would you want to do that? Scientists aren’t trying to create superhumans. They’re interested in gene drives as a solution to problems like disease and ecological devastation. Gene drives could be a revolutionary technological tool, capable of allowing scientists to engineer problematic invasive pests out of an environment, or change their genetic makeup permanently so that they don’t carry diseases like malaria. It works like this: Say an overpopulation of stoats, a predatory mammal related to weasels, is driving out endangered birds, as is the case in New Zealand. In the lab, scientists tweak a specific gene to, say, make stoats only produce male offspring, and then they engineer a gene drive to force that gene to be passed along to all the offspring, usurping nature’s 50-50 inheritance mix. They would then release those lab-engineered stoats to mate in the wild, eventually causing the wild population to crash as the gene drive ensures that only male stoats are born. Effective, but impossible to control once the altered stoats have left the lab. (Watch the video above for more on stoats.) The technology comes with some pretty major asterisks, though. First off, it’s yet to be tested in the wild, so it might not work outside of lab conditions. And scientists have suggested that if it does, the genetically altered species could wind up becoming an invasive species itself—even spreading globally, in a worst-case scenario, sparking domino effects that could be more harmful than the original problem.

Tom McKay,"Pressure has been mounting on Facebook and its leadership to make big privacy changes in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal—in which it lost control over extensive data on what it now says are 87 million users —and after weeks of hedging and minor tweaks around the margins, the company has begun to make other concessions like vaguely committing to EU-style privacy rules. On Friday, in what feels like a ploy to reassure the public they’ll have a plan on the related issue of foreign election interference before the 2018 midterms, Facebook detailed how it will make political advertising more transparent. The stakes are high here. While the extent to which an alleged Russian operation to flood Facebook with disinformation and propaganda before the 2016 elections actually swayed them in favor of Donald Trump is unclear, the PR fallout from it is not. If Facebook doesn’t prevent the Russians from reaching an alleged 126 million users again during the 2018 midterms or a future election, it could compound its ongoing issues and be forced to deal with angry legislators. Facebook VPs Rob Goldman and Alex Himel wrote in a post to the company’s blog that in addition to their previously announced plan to only let verified users run electoral ads, that requirement will now be extended “to anyone that wants to show ‘issue ads’—like political topics that are being debated across the country.” Additionally, they wrote, all issue ads will be marked “Political Ad,” with a “paid for by” box next to it. The VPs added that they are testing a feature to make all ads paid for by a page searchable, as well as “release a public, searchable political ads archive.” They wrote said archive will contain “additional information like the amount spent and demographic audience information for each ad.” Finally, the company will require pages with large followings to verify their identities. “These steps by themselves won’t stop all people trying to game the system,” Zuckerberg wrote in a separate post to his wall. “But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads.” These are all productive changes, but let’s remember that Facebook operates on a huge scale, and its plan to verify ad buyers relies on mailing them postcards. It’s not going to be hard for potential bad actors or pseudonymous parties to slip through—just kind of inconvenient. Verifying pages may not do all that much to prevent them from running non-paid propaganda, and in fact less than 10 percent of the alleged Russian operation in 2016's reach was derived from paid ads. This system can only work if Facebook is stringent about identifying and removing bad actors from their systems, which is already a gamble with the high-profile problem of US election interference given their extreme delay in acknowledging any problem at all. It’s certainly one you should feel very skeptical about working elsewhere, away from the prying eyes of the US press. And in any case, saying an advertisement was paid for by a specific page or individual verified by Facebook is not true transparency, though concerned citizens can trace the real roots of the dark money problem to decisions made by the government. As for the transparency rules? These are similar to the rules that already exist for non-digital political advertising that Facebook has long fought to be exempt from. As the New York Times noted, before the events of the past few weeks, the company actively resisted changes to its exempt status with the excuse that identifying which ads were political or not would require too much manpower. But in December 2017, the Federal Election Commission said that it planned to make Facebook comply by disclosure rules without giving a timeline for implementation. So to the extent that Facebook and crew have made a sudden 180, it’s probably getting ahead of a decision they eventually would have been compelled to make by regulators.",Pressure has been mounting on Facebook and its leadership to make big privacy changes in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal—in which it lost control over extensive data on what it now says are 87 million users—and after weeks of hedging and minor twe…,2018-04-07T16:40:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Here Is Facebook's Dubious Plan to Prevent Its 2016 Election Catastrophe From Happening Again,https://gizmodo.com/here-is-facebooks-dubious-plan-to-prevent-its-2016-elec-1825072042,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--WJC5Y555--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/fg3joduucqa7udyxgv5s.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,catastrophe,0
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","A record-setting heat wave is the latest weather catastrophe to beset Japan. On Sunday, a weather station outside Tokyo reached the hottest temperature ever recorded in the island nation, and emergency responders have been swamped with requests for help in the searing heat. This summer has been one of catastrophe for Japan. The heat arrived in mid-July, following record rains that killed at least 200 people and a typhoon that strafed the country’s southern islands. Things really began cooking this weekend, though, and reached a fever pitch on Monday. Kumagaya, a town located about 40 miles northwest of Tokyo, suffered through temperatures of 41.1 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. That set a new all-time heat record for Japan, besting a 2013 reading of 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Tokyo also set an all-time record for the city, reaching 40.8 degrees Celsius (105.4 degrees Fahrenheit). But the heat has hardly been confined to the metro area. According to Kyodo News, nearly 70 percent of weather stations monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency have recorded temperatures in excess of 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). At least 241 of the 927 stations in the network have cracked 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). Only Hokkaido to the north has managed to keep its cool. Nighttime has provided little relief. Overnight lows have hung around the upper 20s Celsius (low to mid-80s Fahrenheit). The relentless nature of the heat has led to a number of deaths and hospitalizations. At least 77 have died from heat-related illness since July 9, including 11 people who died on Saturday alone, according to Kyodo News. The news agency also reports that more than 30,000 people have been sent to hospitals over that period. On Sunday alone, the Tokyo Fire Department dispatched a record-setting 3,125 ambulances, largely due to people suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion, according to AFP and Kyodo News. All this has prompted dire warnings from the country’s weather service. “This heat is a threat to life,” the Japanese Meteorological Agency warned. “We recognize it as a natural disaster.” The atmospheric source of Japan’s misery is a wavy jet stream. The fast-moving river of wind in the upper atmosphere keeps weather moving around the planet, but kinks have formed in it recently, causing weather to essentially get stuck in place, like eddies in a watery river. The kink that’s formed over Japan has allowed high pressure to build over the past couple weeks, and with it, the dangerous heat. While the heat wave certainly has natural roots, it’s impossible to talk about what’s happening in Japan without including climate change. The heat that’s built up on our planet has made heat waves more common and more intense. “It’s easier to set extreme heat records when the baseline is pretty darn warm,” Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with Wunderground, told Earther. He also pointed to the wavy jet stream as another potential link to climate change, noting that previous research has shown patterns like this could become more common. The all-time heat record in Japan is an outlier for the country, but it’s hardly alone this year. We’ve seen freakish heat waves in Greenland, Pakistan, the UK, Scandinavia, and North Africa. Something just isn’t right. No specific analysis has been done to determine how climate change has affected this heat wave. But what we’re witnessing in Japan right now—the deaths, calls for ambulances, Japan’s famously on-time trains reportedly running slow because people are suffering from heatstroke—is exactly what climate change looks like. And if we don’t start to curb carbon emissions soon, it’s going to look a lot worse, and the poorest among us will suffer the most.","A record-setting heat wave is the latest weather catastrophe to beset Japan.

Jon Evans,"You know everybody loves Tesla-the-company. But did you know that a whole lot of smart people hate Tesla-the-business? “ From a return-on-investment-capital standpoint, Tesla is a catastrophe.” “ The electric-car maker has been burning money at a clip of about $8,000 a minute (or $480,000 an hour.) ” “ Tesla is losing a massive amount of money with no competition, and yet massive competition is coming.” Jim Chanos summarized all of the reasons why nicely: “If you wouldn’t be short a multi-billion-dollar loss-making enterprise in a cyclical business, with a leveraged balance sheet, questionable accounting, every executive leaving, run by a CEO with a questionable relationship with the truth, what would you be short? It sort of ticks all the boxes.” A lot of people think bankruptcy looms in Tesla’s future. Of course, Tesla bears have been saying this for years, and they’ve consistently been wrong — but this time, are they right? Maybe; maybe not. Either way, a far more interesting question, if (like me) you have no financial interest in the business’s success or failure, is: does it matter? I’m entirely serious. We tend to assume that a company’s purpose is to make money for its shareholders, or at least “not go bankrupt,” because money is how we measure success. And this is in fact true of most companies. But it is not true of Tesla. “ When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure,” and this is as true of money as it is of any other measure. The purpose of Tesla is not to make money; it is to pioneer fleets of smart mass-market electric cars, and the infrastructure to support them, and battery technology which is not limited to cars. Making money is ancillary. And whether or not they are making money, they are succeeding at their purpose. They are building the world’s largest factory — in fact, the world’s largest building ; it’s still under construction, but parts of it are already up and running. They all but own the luxury electric car market, and are on course to dominate the mass market as well, while also manufacturing power packs. I’m sure Elon Musk would like to do this while turning a sweet profit. Which is of course also, technically, his fiduciary duty. But if he fails to do so, is that really so tragic? For those of us who aren’t shareholders or bondholders, I mean. (Don’t you worry about Elon, he won’t be missing any meals.) Maybe it wasn’t even possible to do so — in which case Musk will have used the capital markets to essentially subsidize Tesla with free money. (And, interestingly, open-source the resulting patents.) In which case, you know what, more power to him for managing to fund a loss-making investment in what is not so much a car company as it is infrastructure for our shared future. After all, even if Tesla stock goes to zero, and its bonds default to pennies-on-the-dollar, its factories and software repositories and human capital will all be there, and no Chapter 11 court or committee will be blind to the fact that they’re worth far more as a coherent unit than they would be as separate assets. The analogy I like to draw is that of the Channel Tunnel, which was privately dug and built, and a complete financial debacle for its investors — “a wonderful thing from which we’ve all benefited, apart from the people who paid for it to be built who lost substantially all their money.” That quote may yet apply to Tesla. Does it sound unfair to stockholders and bondholders? Not at all: this is capitalism in action, you pays your money and you takes your chances. But if you’re not a stockholder, and not a bondholder, maybe don’t worry so much about headlines screaming about Tesla’s financial unviability. This time, for once, the rest of us win either way.","You know everybody loves Tesla-the-company.

George Dvorsky,"This past Saturday, a tanker transporting oil from Iran to South Korea collided with a freighter about 160 miles off the coast of Shanghai. The tanker, filled with 130 tons of highly volatile condensate crude, has been burning for the past three days, raising fears of an environmental catastrophe. As Reuters reports, the tanker, named Sanchi, collided with a Hong Kong-registered freighter off China’s eastern coast. The tanker’s crew of 32 are missing; one unidentified body has been recovered. The freighter, which was carrying U.S. grain, experienced little damage, and all 21 of its crew members have been rescued. The Sanchi, owned by National Iranian Tanker Co, was en route to South Korea when the collision happened. The tanker has been burning for three straight days as rescue crews struggle to bring the blaze under control. It’s filled with 136,000 tons (about 1 million barrels) of highly volatile condensate oil worth about $60 million, reports Reuters. If a spill happens, it would be the worst oil spill since 1991, when 260,000 tons of oil spilled off the Angolan coast. Officials don’t yet know whether condensate has leaked from the tanker. Officials with China’s Ministry of Transport and Maritime Safety did not say when the fire might be put out. Bad weather and toxic fumes are making it difficult for crews to access the tanker. As noted, the ship is filled with an ultra-light crude condensate— a type of oil that condenses into a liquid after it’s extracted (the condensate in the Sanchi came from crude oil). Condensates are used to produce products like petrol, jet fuel, and heating fuels. It’s colorless and odorless, but more flammable than conventional oil. “Gas condensates represent the ‘light ends’ of oil—that is, the low molecular weight compounds that are highly volatile and flammable, and very similar to gasoline,” Peter Hodson, a professor in the Department of Biology and School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University, told Gizmodo via email. “The hazards from a spill include fire and explosion (the circumstance at the site of the accident) and rapid mortality of any surface animals (marine birds and marine mammals), or fish and invertebrates just underneath the surface (top 10 meters of water).” Hodson says that, as long as the condensates continue to be released from the ship, the risk of these effects will be very high. But once the ship stops leaking (when it’s emptied of oil), these risks will decrease quickly. That’s because condensates evaporate and are diluted in air, and the condensates dissolved in water will be rapidly diluted to below the threshold of toxicity. “The risk to oil spill responders is obviously high during the spill and fire, and if there is no one left on the ship, it may be simplest to let it burn out,” added Hodson. “However, the heat of the fire may destroy the hull, allowing heavy fuel oil in the ship’s tanks to leak. The heavy fuel oil is also flammable, and could burn if exposed to the condensate fire—surface slicks at the Deepwater Horizon spill were treated with burning agents to reduce their size. If the heavy oil leaks, it will create the typical conditions that we associate with traditional ship wrecks, i.e., a heavy black oil slick, oil coating of birds and marine mammals, and a residue that may ultimately contaminate shorelines or sink and contaminate bottom sediments.” Babatunde Anifowosem, a senior lecturer in petroleum and environmental technology at the University of Coventry in the UK, told CNN that an explosion would be the worst outcome. After a blast, the oil would seep out beneath the surface of the water, making cleanup much more difficult, he said. An explosion would also spread more toxic fumes, which could spread inland and trigger respiratory problems among vulnerable populations. According to Reuters, China has sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, while South Korea has sent a helicopter. U.S. Navy military craft have also been brought into help with the rescue operations. The cause of the collision is still not known, but the Sanchi was traveling in waters not frequently traversed by large vessels, which typically travel closer to the Chinese coast or nearer to Japan.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Billy McFarland, the organizer of the spectacular clusterfuck that was Fyre Festival, was sentenced Thursday to six years in prison for fraud. Lets just do it and be legends, man, a marketing executive for the festival reportedly said as the events imminent catastrophe became increasingly evident. His reported divination came true, man, but not for the glory they had apparently hoped for. A federal judge found 26-year-old McFarland guilty for selling phony tickets and for misleading investors, the New York Times reported. McFarland pleaded guilty in March to two counts of wire fraud and for two more counts of fraud in July. McFarland allegedly presented fake documents to induce investors to put over a million dollars into his company and the fiasco called the Fyre Festival, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Joon H. Kim said in a statement last year when he announced the charges against McFarland. According to the New York Times, prosecutors characterized McFarland as the consummate con artist. They added: He betrayed and deceived his investors, customers, and employees while he was living the high life at his luxury apartment, traveling to exclusive locales, staying at luxury hotels, being chauffeured in his Maserati, and entertaining himself and his friends at restaurants, bars, and casinos. McFarlands deception reached jaw-dropping levels of misadventure when a bunch of rich people showed up to a music festival in the Bahamas only to find themselves stranded on the island with non-functioning accommodations and sad cheese sandwiches. The event, the disgraced Fyre Festival, cost $1,200 a ticketat minimumand was shilled by the likes of models Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski. McFarland and Ja Rule, a co-owner of Fyre Media, sold 8,000 tickets. The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism issued a statement last year after the debacle, calling it total disorganization and chaos, adding that clearly they did not have the capacity to execute an event of this scale.

Michael Bociurkiw,"Michael Bociurkiw is a global affairs analyst, at work on his first nonfiction book on screen and social media addiction. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinions on CNN. (CNN) About 41 million Americans live in areas that have a chance of flooding -- and the number exposed to serious flooding is as much as 3.1 times higher than previous estimates. Time is clearly not on our side. Sea levels are rising faster than predicted, and homeowners in particularly vulnerable areas, such as South Florida, could see their properties literally under water within their lifetimes. Relative sea levels there are roughly four inches higher now than in 1992; various projections, including by the Army Corps of Engineers, see rises in South Florida of 12 inches by 2030 and between 2 to 3 feet by 2060. What's more, ""rare events are going to become more common in the future strictly due to sea level rise,"" William Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told The Guardian. And so it would make some sense that as officials tally the damage from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas, with 41 dead and insured losses estimated at $2.5 billion, coastal homeowners and businesses might conduct their own tallies of the cost of continuing to live in places vulnerable to flooding and high winds. Yet, national and local leaders appear to be sleepwalking toward climate catastrophe. Based on my own exchanges over the years with municipal mayors from both inland and coastal jurisdictions, my sense is that few view it as a top priority -- especially those in places such as South Florida, where the property tax base is the main source of income. Rather than curbing building in vulnerable areas or returning flood-prone areas to nature, jurisdictions such as Miami Beach have opted to spend millions on flood abatement projects. And for their part, financial markets deflect reality. Climate change ""is a very slow-moving disaster that may last decades before it has any effect on the markets,"" Wall Street investor Michael Popow told me. ""In the meantime it is another negative in the macro-economic environment which will, sooner than later, cause the markets to crash."" But this disaster is not so slow-moving. Monster storms are coming faster and with more ferocity (last year was the f irst time in over a decade t hat four hurricanes made US landfall in one season), and a growing number of coastal dwellers have now lived through multiple storms, with some not even fully recovered from the last one. By one estimate, from Seattle-based Zillow Research, based on current projections by NOAA of ocean levels rising six feet by 2100, almost 2 million properties -- or roughly 2% of US housing stock, worth $882 billion -- could be under water in a little over 75 years. Close to half of that loss in value would occur in Florida alone, where 1 in 8 properties, worth a total of $400 billion, are threatened. As Zillow points out, given the insatiable appetite for waterfront properties, these numbers could be on the conservative side if development is allowed to continue in vulnerable areas. In fact sea-level rise is already swamping coastal property values: research b y the First Street Foundation has tabulated a home value loss of $14.1 billion across eight coastal US states since 2005. Ironic, is it not, that some of the most coveted and expensive property in the US is also becoming the most vulnerable -- and is on a depreciation cycle. In my frequent trips to South Florida, I encounter more and more people who are contemplating moving away from the waterfront -- especially in flood-prone Miami Beach, where even on clear days during high tides, and even with billions spent on flood alleviation measures, residents can encounter so-called blue-sky flooding. According to one study, such high-tide flooding there has increased by more than 400% in the last 12 years. In short: if you're a young to middle-aged homeowner near water in South Florida, there is a chance that your property will be under water by the time you are a senior - or more likely when the time comes to sign the title over to little Jane or Johnny. John Hilliard's approach towards rising sea levels is probably typical of many of those who reside on the Venetian Islands. The elevation of his new waterfront home in Miami Beach is at about nine feet above sea level. ""That's reasonably high,"" he told me. ""I do see larger rain events due to the greater water-holding ability of a warmer atmosphere. But that rain should run off my island into the sea,"" instead of flooding and staying. ""After 2100 we will be wishing we took this issue seriously as the loss of property will be enormous."" What will be the trigger to cause mass panic or a collapse of the waterfront property bubble? The former mayor of Coral Gables, James Cason, offers a stark scenario: when water levels in that tony community rise to the point where the masts of sailboats are unable to pass under its main bridge, that is when people will ""suddenly see their property values go down because they can no longer get a boat out. So that will be one of the first indicators (of sea level rise) and a wake-up call for people."" Of course, outward migration from places like Coral Gables will translate into a slimmer property tax ledger for the seaside town, which in turn creates challenges for such municipalities to provide essential services. And municipal bonds, already in a precarious state, could sink even further when they are issued by jurisdictions known to have massive flooding problems. While it would take a lot for cities like Miami Beach to be abandoned, rising tides and more frequent monster storms are becoming, like the ravaging forest fires in California, a new normal. One study predicts there will be as many as 13 million ""climate refugees"" in America by the end of the century -- with the hardest-hit county being Miami-Dade. Even with inaction by a White House that prefers to ignore or deny climate change -- withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and activating rollbacks on the Clean Power Plan -- there are localized measures that could defer a crash of the US coastal property bubble due to rising sea levels. Mayors need to step up to the plate and use the tools and policies at their disposal. One, which has already been implemented in many developing countries in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, is to return vulnerable areas to nature. That happened in the US, in flood-prone Mastic Beach, New York, after Superstorm Sandy, where damaged homes were bought back and the land transformed into wetlands. Sea walls and strict building codes can force people to build away from vulnerable areas. ""Part of the solution is being smart about where we continue to develop,"" said Steven McAlpine, an analyst with First Street. Waiting to see what happens from this slow-moving disaster is not an option. Once Donald Trump, his supporters in the fossil fuel industry and others accept what is happening it's going to be too late and too expensive for a fix.","In vulnerable areas, such as South Florida, homeowners could see their properties literally under water within their lifetimes, writes Michael Bociurkiw.

Reuters Editorial,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A formal U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would cause catastrophe and lead to new conflict in the Middle East, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Youth hold their prayer shawls as they stand in front of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest prayers site in Jerusalem's Old City May 17, 2017. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, Bozdag, who is also the government spokesman, said Jerusalem’s status had been determined by international agreements and that preserving it was important for the peace of the region. “The status of Jerusalem and Temple Mount have been determined by international agreements. It is important to preserve Jerusalem’s status for the sake of protecting peace in the region,” Bozdag said. “If another step is taken and this step is lifted, this will be a major catastrophe.” Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. It later annexed it, declaring the whole of the city as its capital -- a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians want Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. On Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump’s adviser and son-in-law said Trump had not yet made a decision on whether to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a move that would break with decades of U.S. policy. Past U.S. presidents have insisted that the status of Jerusalem -- home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions -- must be decided in negotiations. On Saturday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan held a phone call with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in which they discussed the status of Jerusalem, sources in Erdogan’s office said. The sources said Erdogan told Abbas that preserving the status of Jerusalem was important for all Muslim countries, adding that international laws and United Nations decisions should be followed on the issue. Any move by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital would fuel extremism and violence, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said on Saturday. A senior Jordanian source said on Sunday that Amman has begun consultations on convening an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation before Trump’s expected declaration this week.

Tom McKay,"The U.S. military’s stockpile of nuclear weapons is one of the most existentially terrifying arsenals ever assembled, and a conflict involving the detonation of even small percentage of those weapons could potentially destabilize the entire world. With a commander-in-chief who has shown a fairly incredible misunderstanding of how nuclear strategy works as well as a hair-trigger temper, it’s not surprising that some people are slightly concerned about a possible catastrophe. Calm down, U.S. Strategic Command chief and Air Force General John Hyten told attendees at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada on Saturday. Strategic Command, which controls nuclear weapons in the event of a war, won’t let the president just lob nukes willy-nilly at anyone who angers him. It’ll only let the president legally lob nukes at enemies willy-nilly. In response to a question about an “illegal” nuclear launch, Reuters reported, Hyten responded “I think some people think we’re stupid. We’re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?” “I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,” Hyten said. “And if it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I‘m going to say, ‘Mr. President, that’s illegal.’ And guess what he’s going to do? He’s going to say, ‘What would be legal?’ And we’ll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that’s the way it works. It’s not that complicated.” Later, he added, “If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life.” Hyten’s remarks come after both speculation about the president’s mental state and the ongoing possibility of some kind of nuclear exchange between the U.S. and North Korea, which has already developed nuclear weapons but is still developing longer-range missiles to launch them on. It’s also likely intended as pushback against recent reporting emphasizing that the president has nearly total control over how the nuclear arsenal is used. While Hyten is correct that he and other senior defense officials would have the opportunity to consult on any launch if the president followed protocol, per Slate, the actual formal chain of command for nuclear launches is direct from the president to a one-star general at the National Military Command Center. Officials trying to interfere in that chain of command could probably be, uh, dealt with. As the Washington Post emphasized, once it gets to that one-star general, determining what is or is not an illegal order is not really a launch officers’ prerogative. Were it to even be so, as Slate noted, experts say the military has “devised legal rationales to justify almost any sort of nuclear attack that a president might want to order.” Perhaps legal concerns could prevent the president from an unprovoked nuclear attack on Pyongyang tomorrow, but one couched as a pre-emptive strike on the North Korean nuclear program could probably pass muster. And nuclear war would still potentially result in the deaths of millions of people, legal or otherwise, which is not really all that reassuring. Gulp.

Mike Butcher,"The flood underinsurance problem is arguably the largest unsolved problem in insurance. Over the last ten years, an average of $41bn per year of flood damage has gone uncovered by insurance, leaving people, businesses and governments to pay the bill. It’s estimated that there are $50bn of losses caused by floods around the world. Currently, only $9bn of these are covered by insurance. FloodFlash, an insurtech startup that offers a way for customers to insure their property for flood risk, even in high risk areas, by employing an internet-connected water-sensor has raised £1.9m in seed funding from LocalGlobe, Pentech Ventures and InsurTech Gateway. They previously secured a pre-seed/Angel round in 2017 (Hambro Perks Insurtech Gateway and one private investor). When a flood happens, it triggers an internet-connected water-sensor and the payment is made immediately to the policy holder. A FloodFlash policy pays out a pre-agreed, fixed sum as soon as a pre-defined level of flooding occurs. A slice of the premium goes to FloodFlash in return for installing the sensor, plus automated underwriting and claims services. Founders, Adam Rimmer and Ian Bartholomew, created the company after looking at “parametric catastrophe bonds”. These are typically used by large corporations or governments to recover large sums in the event of a catastrophe, but many of the benefits they confer were previously unavailable to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Rimmer says: “Every year tens of thousands of business owners lose their livelihoods because they have been unable to take out an affordable policy that protects their business. In the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic flood, people care less about dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for damages and more about whether their business will survive at all. We believe FloodFlash’s event-based insurance is absolutely the best way for insurers to cover higher-risk areas.” FloodFlash is regulated by the FCA and is currently carrying out a live pilot for its policies with a select group of SMEs in parts of the UK with significant flood risk, including Carlisle. Insurance capacity for FloodFlash policies is provided by Everest Re through their syndicate at Lloyd’s of London. The startup has been working as part of the InsurTech Gateway, the InsurTech focused incubator since mid 2017. Tara Reeves, partner at LocalGlobe, said: “Climate change is leading to more extreme weather events, but these are often hard to insure. Parametric insurance dramatically reduces underwriting and loss adjustment costs, and those savings can be passed on to the consumer. Adam and Ian’s background in risk modelling and hydrology is uniquely suited to this challenge.” Eddie Anderson, partner at Pentech Ventures, said: “FloodFlash is a business that has global potential. There is no country on the planet where severe or freak weather does not cause havoc, whether it is flood or hurricane. We think markets around the world will welcome this innovative, cost-effective way to sell insurance that has been adapted to take into account the way we live today.”","The flood underinsurance problem is arguably the largest unsolved problem in insurance.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Photo Honoring victims of a Dec. 17 suicide bombing attack at a church in Quetta, Pakistan, in which at least nine people were killed and more than 35 others wounded. Credit Banaras Khan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Any hope after the ouster of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in July that his successor, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, would assert some civilian sway over Pakistan’s powerful security establishment has evaporated, as terrorism claims new civilian victims and the army uses Islamist extremists to stage what has all the hallmarks of a velvet coup. On Dec. 17 two suicide bombers burst into a church full of worshipers in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province, killing at least nine people and wounding more than 35 others. The bombing is the latest in a string of bloody attacks on civilians across Pakistan since the Taliban besieged an army school in Peshawar three years ago, killing 148 people, including 132 uniformed students. But instead of bringing known terrorist masterminds to justice and protecting vulnerable religious minorities and other civilians from attacks, Pakistan’s security establishment is actually promoting Islamist extremism by freeing terrorist leaders and by clamping down on civil society groups that it accuses, falsely, of being fronts for foreign spies. As many as 29 international nongovernmental organizations — many doing vital development work in Pakistan for years and employing thousands of Pakistanis — were informed this month that their registration applications had been rejected due to nonapproval by intelligence agencies. Last month, Pakistan’s army showed where the real power in the country resides when it brokered an end to protests by Islamists in the country’s capital, Islamabad. The Islamists had accused Law Minister Zahid Hamid of blasphemy over changes in the oath taken by incoming lawmakers and demanded his resignation, something Mr. Abbasi’s government rightfully refused to do. Pakistan’s army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, then stepped in and engineered an agreement, signed by the prime minister, that not only ousted Mr. Hamid, but even thanked General Bajwa for “saving the country from a big catastrophe.” The real catastrophe in Pakistan is the cynical use of Islamist extremism by the country’s security establishment to hold democracy hostage and to foment the insecurity it needs to maintain its grip on power. Until that changes, there is scant hope Pakistan will take control of the terrorism that threatens its citizens’ lives and the stability of the region.

Sue Hawkes,"October 25, 2018 7 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Female business leaders are seen as tough, confident women who can handle anything. This is true, but what happens when a true catastrophe happens in your life? I had this experience in 2008. The economy had crashed so my two businesses were failing, my house was in foreclosure, my marriage was falling apart and in quick succession my mother, brother and father passed away. My grief was affecting every aspect of my life, including my work. This is quite common ; the ""Grief Index: Hidden Annual Costs of Grief in America's Workplace"" study found that 85 percent of management-level decision-makers surveyed said that their decision-making ranked from ""very poor"" to ""fair"" in the weeks or months after a grief-inducing event. Related: 'We Had a Feeling of Failure And Guilt' Says This Founder Who Shut Down Her Company and Relaunched With the Help of Her Mentor Dealing with circumstances like these can feel especially difficult as women because we are often also the ones who run the household. In fact, a new study by Springer journal found that ""Canadian women of all ages still tend to do more household chores than their male partners, no matter how much they work or earn in a job outside the home."" As I worked to get through these situations, I realized that I couldn't perform at my best while my personal life was in turmoil. Leaders must be at their best mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually in order to bring their best to the workplace. When I was in my darkest place I realized that I needed to make some serious changes in my life or they would start happening without my consent. The practices below helped me conquer my catastrophe and get back to a whole, healthier self. Lower the bar. We've all heard over and over again that we should exercise three times a week. But, does anyone really do this when they have a family and big career? I started to question this advice, and that is when the philosophy of lowering the bar first came to me. It may sound trite, but as someone whose identity is wrapped up in achieving and always raising the bar, this was a foreign concept. Life was giving me more than even I could handle, and I realized I needed to pare back to a goal I could actually hit, even if it meant doing less than the suggested amount. Lowering the bar helped me re-wire my brain to dedicate that time to myself each week, and every week that I got my one workout in I felt like I was winning. This feeling of accomplishment was necessary when it felt like I was failing at everything else. After a time, I began hitting my goal consistently and often felt so successful after having hit it that I'd add a second workout into my week. Now I have a healthier lifestyle than ever and am committed to still improving. This time in life also taught me how necessary exercise is as a stress reliever for leaders. Now I exercise just as much for the mental and attitude benefits as I do for the physical. In fact, ""physical activity is the best way to improve cognitive function,"" says certified personal trainer and fitness nutrition specialist Shay de Silva. For me, it's not optional; I need exercise in order to be a better leader and stay focused. Related: Here's Why Women Take Less Vacation Time Than Men -- and What to Do About It Gain perspective. Going through such a challenging time allowed me to have better perspective for the rest of the challenges I've come across. In reality, health catastrophes are the only problems that are fully out of our control. Unlike illness, business or financial problems can be solved or at least mitigated through action and resources. I was recently the victim of a phishing scandal and had over six figures of income stolen from me. This could have been debilitating for our small business, but as an entrepreneur, I knew that I would earn my way out of it and find a solution. Because I had experienced so much worse during the sickness and death of my family, I was able to quickly go into action mode. I also experienced incredible support from my peer group, which I recommend all business leaders find. Beth Miller, leadership advisor and coach, echoes this, stating ""Peer advisory groups... create an environment where individuals can find and give support, solve problems and achieve their goals among like-minded people who face similar challenges."" Simplify. When catastrophe hits, all of your energy is consumed by that event and trying to mitigate it. You don't have extra energy to spend on difficult people or additional tasks and activities that leave you feeling drained. Simplify your life by removing the people, things, activities and negative messages around you. Recognize that you can't do it all and that cutting back will leave you with more energy to spend on healing yourself. Related: It's OK to Not Be OK Learn to ask for help. The most important and difficult thing you can do during a catastrophe is to ask for help. Coincidentally, it's when we feel most helpless that we want to ask for help the least and need the most help! Leaning on others and getting support (emotionally, financially or with chores/errands) will help create space for you to work on healing yourself and overcoming the catastrophe. As leaders we are used to helping others but not great at asking and accepting help. Over the years I've realized that denying help from someone else robs them of the good feeling they would get by supporting me. Next time someone asks, ""How can I help?"" be honest and tell them what you need. Start a gratitude journal. During times of catastrophe it can feel that there is very little to be grateful for. This is when you must practice gratitude the most. Keeping a gratitude journal is a great way to do this, especially because it takes the effort out of journaling -- no more wondering what to write about! Each night before you go to sleep or every morning when you get up, write down 20 things you are grateful for. Doing this practice either starts or ends your day in a positive state. This state is what your actions flow from and is what keeps you happy and healthy. If you don't like to write, try a talk-to-text option on your mobile phone. You won't believe how much your perspective changes in just a few weeks and how that enables you to move forward. Delegate and elevate. Delegating and elevating allows you to identify what tasks you 1. love and are great at, 2. like and are good at, 3. don't like and are good at and 4. don't like and are not good at. Dividing everything you do (both at home and at work) into these four quadrants will give you a good picture of how you spend your time and what tasks you need to delegate. The goal of the practice is to get to only doing things you either love and are great at or like and are good at. This practice is incredibly useful for any leader, but for those dealing with catastrophe it is crucial. Delegating the tasks that you do not enjoy will allow you to feel less stress and free up time to focus on moving forward and doing the things that are your highest and best use. We leaders need to understand that self-care is not a selfish act, especially amidst a catastrophe. While it may be tempting to simply put on your CEO face and push through what's going on, catastrophes don't work that way. You must invest in yourself so that you can take care of others and become your whole self again. This may take a little while, so be patient with yourself. Conquering my catastrophe was a year-long process where I felt just a little bit better every day; that encouraged me to stay strong and keep going.","When a catastrophe happens in your life, it's important to take care of yourself so your business can thrive.",2018-10-25T17:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How to Handle a Personal Crisis as a Female CEO,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321915,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181018194339-GettyImages-95011734.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,catastrophe,0
Eric Mack,"We're still living in the most perilous times since the end of World War II, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and its trademark Doomsday Clock, which remains set at just two minutes to midnight for the second year in a row.
The clock is a kind of metric -- midnight represents doomsday -- that the organization contrived decades ago to warn ""the public about how close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making.""  The Bulletin makes periodic announcements updating the current ""time"" on the clock, indicating how close we are to some sort of existential catastrophe.
It's two minutes before midnight for the second year in a row.
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
In its seven decades of existence, the clock has never been closer to midnight than it is right now. It was also at two minutes before midnight in 1953, at the beginning of the Cold War and a nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.
""We have in fact entered a period we call the 'new abnormal',"" Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin, said at a press conference Thursday at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.
In a lengthy statement released at the same time on its website, the Bulletin laid out how this period is defined by a ""devolving state of nuclear and climate security"" and ""a qualitative change in information warfare and a steady misrepresentation of fact that is undermining confidence in political structures and scientific inquiry."" 
A series of panelists at the press conference decried the erratic nature of relations between the United States and other nuclear powers like Russia and North Korea, which have often played out on President Trump's Twitter feed.
""Journalists, you love Trump's tweets,"" Jerry Brown, former California governor and the Bulletin's executive chair, told reporters. ""You love the leads that get the clicks ... but the final click could be a nuclear strike.""
In addition to the threats of nuclear arms, climate change and fake news, Bronson cited risks from nascent technologies like artificial intelligence and synthetic biology.
""The velocity of change across these and other technological fronts is extremely high; the international effort to manage these rapid advances has been, to date, grossly insufficient,"" reads the new statement from the Bulletin.
The panel also focused on the threat of climate change and the renewed rise in global greenhouse emissions following a plateau in recent years.
Susan Solomon, a professor of environmental studies at MIT, said the US failure to stop a rise in carbon emissions is ""simply an act of gross negligence.""
While the clock did not advance closer to midnight this year after two years of inching toward the brink, Bronson and the other panelists were clear to keep the focus on doom and gloom.
""[The 2019 time] should not be taken as a sign of stability but as a stark warning,"" Bronson said.
But rather than despairing and retiring to the family fallout shelter to Netflix-and-chill our lives away, the Bulletin lays the task of turning back the clock at the feet of the public.
""Today, citizens in every country can use the power of the Internet to fight against social media disinformation and improve the long-term prospects of their children and grandchildren. They can insist on facts, and discount nonsense. They can demand action to reduce the existential threat of nuclear war and unchecked climate change.""
Naturally, the Bulletin even includes a hashtag, because what better tool to save the world, right?

The Conversation,"The Great Firewall of China is the largest-scale internet censorship operation in the world. The Chinese state says the firewall is there to promote societal harmony within an increasing population of billions of people. It considers the internet in China as part of its sovereign territory. Have you visited TNW's hype-free blockchain and cryptocurrency news site yet? It's called Hard Fork. Eight years ago, Google withdrew from China, pulling its search and other services out because of country’s limits to freedom of speech. But it is now planning to relaunch a heavily censored version of its services in China, according to a whistleblower who spoke to online news website The Intercept. This project, named Dragonfly, will encompass a new, heavily censored version of Google’s search services, including mobile apps, that will be run in partnership with a local company in China. Censorship in China includes returning no results for searches that depict Chinese police or military brutality (such as the Tiananmen Square massacre), pro-democracy sites, sites linked with the Dalai Lama, and anything related to Taiwanese or Tibetan independence. The whistleblower who spoke to The Intercept cited ethical concerns over this project – and rightly so. There are several ethical dilemmas with Google’s move back into China. Should large Western companies such as Google give up ethical values to make money in China? Is it okay to design technology to assist the Chinese government in restricting the human rights of their citizens? Where does “respect for Chinese values” turn into “assistance in oppressing Chinese people through censorship”? Is Google being hypocritical by making money on the freedom of information available in most societies but then selling it out when they go into China? The largest professional organization for computing, the Association of Computing Machinery, recently updated its code of ethics, which includes some specific provisions that we can use to think through these issues. Many Google employees are members of the ACM, meaning they have agreed to abide by this code. Some of these employees may be working on Project Dragonfly, so they will need to evaluate their work in terms of the code. An initial analysis using the code (and this complex case requires more than space allows) offers three insights. First, the primary goal of technology development should be to benefit the public good, “to contribute to society and to human well-being”, “promoting human rights and protecting each individual’s right to autonomy” (principle 1.1). Taking part in censorship at the Chinese state’s behest and censoring the topics mentioned above would appear to be inconsistent with this principle. Individual freedom is heavily curtailed in China, and this is reflected in the censorship of the internet there. But, despite what the Chinese government argues, promoting social harmony doesn’t require the restriction of freedom or violation of human rights. Digital oppression. (Credit: Shutterstock) Second, there are specific provisions within the code against assisting in the oppression of a population within the code. “Computing professionals should take action to avoid creating systems or technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people” (principle 1.4). In developing technology to censor sites related to democracy and Chinese-committed atrocities, Google employees would arguably be violating this as well. But surely this is a case for respecting “local, regional, national, and international laws and regulations” (principle 2.3)? The code of ethics expects computing professionals to challenge unethical rules – and break them if a rule “has an inadequate moral basis or causes recognizable harm”. It’s also one thing to respect local customs and laws, and another to actively implement them, as Google will be doing. By collaborating, Google, as a large Western company, stands accused of giving credence to these oppressive laws. providing the Chinese state with political weight and propaganda for their policies. It would be highly hypocritical of Google to take advantage of the values that have allowed it to grow to the behemoth it is today in much of the world – democracy, freedom of speech, personal autonomy == and then drop these when moving into the Chinese market. Instead of being a values-driven company, it seems from this move that it is purely profit-driven. So what should Google do? One way of responsibly dealing with this would be to open up project Dragonfly to input from the rest of the company, not just the hundred or so working directly on it. Let the Google employee base and other non-shareholder stakeholders decide where the red lines for Google’s values should be. Research has indicated that ethical companies are more profitable, retaining employees who are proud to work for the company, and earning respect and loyalty from the public. Standing up and showing China the value of democratic participation in company value identification will likely earn Google more respect both home and abroad.

Megan Farokhmanesh,"The Rock is starring in a monster movie loosely based off of a video game series, which is just about the most The Rock thing The Rock could do. In the latest trailer for Rampage, the man now known as Dwayne Johnson rocks out with a big ol’ friendly gorilla who — after being infected with an interstellar mutation — is swept up into a city-leveling conflict. An adaptation of Rampage has been in the works since 2011. The Midway game series lets you control a giant lizard, ape, or wolf as you destroy a city and fight off helicopters and their guns. Honestly, Rampage doesn’t have a whole lot of plot to base a movie on, which is probably why the trailer’s leap from “The Rock has a signing gorilla friend” to “Oh hey, flying wolves” doesn’t quite work. But perhaps the film’s official description can help: Primatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth. But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size. To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals. As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.

Colin Dwyer,"Displaced Yemeni children stare through a hole in the wall of a half-destroyed house in Taez, where they have been staying with several families since violence drove them from their homes in Hodeidah earlier this year. Ahmad al-Basha/AFP/Getty Images The United Nations' humanitarian chief warned a month ago that war-torn Yemen was on the brink of a ""massive loss of life"" a famine-fueled catastrophe that may spell the complete collapse of an already failing country. Since then, he says the dire situation has only gotten worse. ""The toll is unbearably high,"" Mark Lowcock told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. ""The immune systems of millions of people on survival support for years on end are now are literally collapsing, making them especially children and the elderly more likely to succumb to malnutrition, cholera and other diseases."" Last month, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said eight million people were desperately dependent on aid and some 3.5 million more risked joining them. But Lowcock said Tuesday that even as stark as those numbers were, they did not do justice to the crisis now ravaging Yemen. Based on new surveys and analysis, his office said as many as 14 million people or about half the whole country's population could soon be ""entirely reliant on external aid for survival."" And with violence still raging in the key port city of Hodeidah, where Saudi-backed Yemeni forces launched an offensive on Houthi rebels earlier this year, the international aid operation risks disruption in its own right. A Yemeni woman and her child sit outside a school set up for displaced persons in the capital, Sanaa. The pair fled the port city of Hodeidah after Saudi-backed forces launched a large-scale offensive there, years into Yemen's devastating civil war. Hani Mohammed/AP ""In the absence of a cessation of hostilities, especially around Hudaydah, where fighting for more than four months now has damaged the key facilities and infrastructure on which the aid operation relies, the relief effort will ultimately be simply overwhelmed,"" Lowcock said. ""The time, surely, has come for all the parties to heed these warnings."" None of the parties in Yemen's complex war has heeded those warnings yet. The Houthis, a Shiite rebel militia, seized the country's capital and northwestern regions from its internationally recognized government in 2014. The next year, a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched an airstrike campaign against the Houthis, which for their part are backed by the Saudis' regional rival, Iran. In the years that followed, a complex web of combatants with an even more tangled skein of interests have carried on the war in Yemen with few hopes of resolution. In fact, one of the few firm answers to emerge from the violence is its effect on the country's civilians: More than 17,000 killed or wounded in the fighting. More than one million suspected cases of cholera last year alone. At least three million internally displaced by violence. Toward the end of last year, the charity group Save the Children estimated that about 130 children were dying of hunger or disease every day in Yemen. The conflict has prompted an outcry not just from humanitarian groups but international organizations which have accused all sides of possible war crimes and politicians in the U.S., as well. The U.S. has supported Saudi Arabia's military campaign in the country support that has come under renewed scrutiny in recent weeks, compounded by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Lowcock, the U.N.'s humanitarian chief, did not single out any one country for criticism. Instead, he directed his urgent pleas to ""all stakeholders to do everything possible to avert catastrophe."" That includes not only an end to the violence, but also increased funding for humanitarian efforts and better protection of the food supply. A failure to follow those steps, Lowcock said, would be ""the death knell for countless innocent civilians most of them women and children."" ""There is now a clear and present danger of an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen,"" he added, ""much bigger than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives.""","The catastrophe now looming over Yemen is ""much bigger than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives,"" says the United Nations' humanitarian chief.",2018-10-24T16:12:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Yemen In 'Clear And Present Danger' Of Massive Famine After Years Of Violence,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/24/660153096/yemen-in-clear-and-present-danger-of-massive-famine-after-years-of-violence,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/10/24/gettyimages-1043500400_wide-9f785380ca0bc5146f258fb0b56ddf32c24e5a0c.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,catastrophe,0
Peter Page,"October 8, 2018 4 min read The United Nations has sternly warned civilization to end its addiction to fossil fuels within a decade or so to avoid a long “or else” list that includes submerged coastal cities, acidic oceans, devastating cycles of drought and flood upending agriculture and... oh come on, how long does the list need to be for you to get the picture? The report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the latest and shrillest -- or perhaps just the least understated -- of periodic IPCC scientific assessments issued since the 1990s. However, and perhaps not entirely coincidentally, the same day as the depressing IPCC report was issued the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to two U.S. economists, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer, who have argued for many years that economics is both the cause and the cure of the global environmental crisis. Related: 'This Is Climate Change' Tells an Urgent Message Via Virtual Reality Nordhaus, 77, has taught and researched economics at Yale University since 1967. He built the first economic model that combined data and theory from chemistry, physics and economics that “describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate,” according to the Swedish academy. Norhaus was the first person to advocate for taxing carbon emissions to combat climate change, an idea now widely embraced by economists (if not politicians). Romer, 62, has worked for decades modeling the interplay of economic growth and regulation. According to the award statement, “Romer showed that unregulated markets will produce technological change, but tend to underprovide R&amp;D and the new goods created by it.” Governments can offset this tendency through “well-designed government interventions, such as R&amp;D subsidies and patent regulation. [Romer’s] analysis says that such policies are vital to long-run growth, not just within a country but globally. It also provides guidelines for policy design: patent laws should strike the right balance between the motivation to create new ideas, by giving some monopoly rights to developers, and the ability of others to use them, by limiting these rights in time and space.” Related: Can Corporates Save the World from Climate Change? Although the two economists work separately, the prize committee awarded them jointly because, in the words of committee member Per Krusell, a Swedish macroeconomist, they are both thinking about “long-run, global” issues. Taxes, regulations and even the science of climate change (and perhaps science generally) are currently far out of vogue politically in the U.S., but a carbon tax is broadly favored by business leaders. One idea advocated by the fossil fuel industry is a U.S. carbon tax with the proceeds refunded directly to taxpayers. The proposal has been met with suspicion by climate activists because it would also end the many lawsuits that have been (and likely will be) filed against the coal and oil industry for damages from climate change, eliminate regulations on the theory they are redundant and preclude government using the revenues for crucial R&amp;D, infrastructure upgrades and everything else needed to adapt to higher oceans and extreme weather. What does all this mean for entrepreneurs? Tough to say, though a few things are good to keep in mind, not least is that millennials are deeply concerned about climate change. It also seems increasingly clear that taxes are not invariably bad and that the market won't solve every problem, including most obviously those that are not profitable. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that taxes and policies that treated climate change as an existential threat would create huge new industries and save trillions of dollars in avoided damages (to say nothing of social upheaval from forced migration ). It might be that for entrepreneurs, climate change is more a question of what to do as a citizen than as a business person.",The latest and most pessimistic warning about climate catastrophe came the same day as the Nobel Prize committee honored two economists for their work exploring potential solutions.,2018-10-08T18:52:17Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}","UN Warns Climate Change May Doom Us, but Nobel Committee Suggests Taxes Might Save Us",https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321324,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181008184524-GettyImages-641897856.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,catastrophe,0
"Dave Levitan on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency published a report titled Can We Delay A Greenhouse Warming? It ran through the latest predictions on climate change, and analyzed the feasibility of several policy options, from taxes to fossil fuel bans, that could slow the coming catastrophe. It is one of the earliest EPA reports dedicated to the issue, and one of several pieces of evidence that experts were very much on top of the problem nearly 40 years ago. The report predicts a warming of 2 degrees Celsius by the middle of this century, which isnt so far off from what scientists are predicting today.
In spite of the reports prescience, looking back on it now is an exercise in frustration. The shift away from fossil fuels perhaps could be instituted more gradually and therefore less expensively if energy policies were adopted now rather than several decades later, the authors wrote. This was blasted by Reagan administration officials as being unnecessarily alarmista reprimand we continue to hear decades later. 
The reports warnings, obviously borne out by the subsequent 36 years of inaction, will leave many readers banging their heads against the wall. And if it frustrates the rest of us, what must it be like for the actual author of that report?
Stephen Seidel was the 1983 reports primary author, along with consultant Dale Keyes. With a background in economics, urban studies, and law, he was working in EPAs Office of Policy and Resources Management; now retired, he spent decades at EPA and elsewhere working on everything from ozone pollution controls to Obama Administration efforts at greenhouse gas emissions reductions. After a Twitter thread on his report seemed to strike a collective nerve, we spoke about his work at EPA, if he thinks we might finally be turning a corner on climate, and what it is like to have had his warnings ignored for almost four decades.
This conversation has been edited lightly for clarity and length.
Earther: Tell me a bit about how you ended up working on global warming at EPA in the early 80s.
Seidel: I started at EPA at the end of the Carter administration, so it was about 1980. I was working first on what was probably the earliest version of emissions trading, it was called the Bubble Policy at the time. I spent a couple of years working on that with a colleague, John Hoffman. [Editors note: Along with his work on warming and ozone depletion, John Hoffman created the Energy Star program for energy-efficient consumer products and appliances.]
And then John decided, with the change in administration, that he would move on to some other issues, and he actually was the one who began looking at global warming. He invited me to join him in this project, and that was sometime in 82, early 83.
Earther: The EPA was only a decade or so old at that point. What was it like to work there in those relatively early years?
Seidel: There were a lot of very committed people back then, and I think thats probably true today also. There was a mix of old-line engineers who had come over from the federal [agencies] that were pieced together to create EPA. But then a lot of very bright young folks [joined], all of whom had just attended their first Earth Day celebration, and were very committed.
Earther: Was climate change a significant part of the EPAs work back then?
Seidel: No one, to the best of my recollection, was looking at climate change at that point at EPA. It wasnt on anybodys radar screen at the agency.
I believe this was the first report EPA put out on climate change. Im positive its the first policy report, maybe somewhere in the bowels in the office of R&amp;D somebody was looking at it, but I certainly dont remember seeing such a report.
Earther: Did you receive any political pushback at the time, as you were working on it?
Seidel: Thats an interesting story, because it came out under the Reagan Administration, and Anne Gorsuch. [Ed. note: Anne Gorsuch was the EPA Administration from 1981 to 1983. She dramatically cut her agencys budget, mingled industry operatives into the EPA staff ranks, and tried to cut regulations at every turn. She eventually resigned amidst a growing scandal regarding management of the Superfund toxic site cleanup program.]
Interestingly enough, our assistant administrator at the time was very supportive. He read the report, thought it made good sense, thought it was an important issue, and was very very supportive of the effort. It was a guy named Joe Cannon. In fact, he was the one who first provided a copy of it to Philip Shabecoff of the New York Times. They ran it as a front page story.
A Ban on Coal Seems Economically and Politically Infeasible EPA, 1983
That article on the front page resulted in a press conference EPA held that day, and probably a couple of weeks of constant press attention, worldwide. That was the classic 15 minutes of fame.
Earther: In that article, your report was contrasted with one from the National Academy of Sciences. The Reagan Administration seemed to hate yours and love theirs, maybe because you included more urgent warnings about the need to act sooner rather than later.
Seidel: If you look at the underlying basis between the National Academy report and the EPAs report, they are probably 98 percent identical. The difference was, we took the further steps and looked at policy options. And of course a National Academy report wouldnt do that. But projections, climate sensitivity, the whole range of sort of foundational information is probably the same.
Earther: What, if any, was the fallout at EPA after that?
Seidel: There was a rumor at the time, but Ive never confirmed it, that there was an effort by the administrators office to somehow take action against us for the report. But that never went anywhere, I never actually saw any clear evidence that that existed. And certainly, when Ruckelshaus came on board, things were clear sailing. [Editors note: Gorsuch was administrator for the bulk of time that the report was being authored, but William Ruckelshaus, the EPAs founding administrator, had taken over for his second run in the office several months before its final release.]
Nothing seemed likely to be used at the time.
I continued to work on it for a while, but then both John Hoffman and I got sidetracked on this other little issueand that was the ozone layer, and chlorofluorocarbons. So in 85, maybe as late as 86, our attention really shifted to what became the Montreal Protocol.
Earther: You modeled out these policy ideasfossil fuel taxes, fossil fuel banswhy were you focusing on those ideas? Did they seem likely at all to be used, or were you just presenting options?
Seidel: Lets be clear: nothing seemed likely to be used at the time. But they were the obvious policy levers. A carbon tax, bans, those are the things that jumped out at you then, and theyre still the things that, to some extent anyway, are considered today.
Earther: Well, we do finally have some policy proposals starting to take shape, in the form of the Green New Deal and surrounding ideas. Does it surprise you at all that some of those same policy proposals are still out there, only with 36 fewer years to implement them?
Seidel: In terms of the policy levers, I think there is a more robust set of possible tools which can be used. Many of them still do come down to a price on carbon. The good news is that the alternatives [to fossil fuels] are way cheaper than certainly we anticipated in the report. If you look at the things that the report got wrong I couldnt find the term wind in there anywhere. The good news is, weve come a long way in terms of cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels. The bad news is, we have much less time, climate change is already on top of us.
Earther: Are there particular messaging approaches to try and sell those policies that you think are better or worse, given your experiences?
Seidel: We used to talk about it as something that would impact our grandchildren, and now you can point to the wildfires, you can point to the extreme events and the huge costs associated with themthat has made it so much more real for people today. In the end, that should really help policy makers in terms of taking actions.
I still think putting a price on carbon is the way to go. I was heavily involved in the Waxman-Markey first-term Obama administration efforts that died in the Senate. Whether that approach is better going forward, or a tax-and-dividend approach makes more sense, that will be for others to sort out.
Earther: How do you feel about the fact that you, and others, were warning about this so long ago, and were more or less ignored up until today?
Seidel: I think there is a common thread among all of my colleagues who work on climate changeyou have to be optimistic. I think that helps quite a bit.
I also had the experience where a couple of years after that report came out I dug into ozone layer issues, and there we had tremendous success. Globally, with a treaty that all nations of the world signed on to; technology has changed dramatically, the costs were far less than expected. So, we demonstrated early on, back in the late 1980s, that in fact we could tackle these global environmental problems. There are reasons why climate has been a tougher issue to make progress on, but those are problems that can be overcome.
Earther: So it doesnt keep you up at night, that you wrote this so long ago and we ended up here.
Seidel: When I used to give talks on climate change, I would describe it as the worst-case public policy issue you can imagine. It is global in nature, it cuts across all sectors of the economy, there are lag times involved, the science is challenging; you couldnt create a more challenging problem.
There are legitimate reasons why this has been so hard to tackle. But I am still optimistic that it will be [tackled]. And I felt we were on a pretty good path up until a recent election.
In the early years, there was bipartisan support for action on the ozone layer, and action on climate change. Some of our strongest supporters on those issues early on were Republican senators, like Senator John Chafee, and others. To see this devolve into a partisan issue, that I do find very frustrating, because this should be science- and economics-based, not partisan-based.","In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency published a report titled “Can We Delay A Greenhouse Warming?” It ran through the latest predictions on climate change, and analyzed the feasibility of several policy options, from taxes to fossil fuel bans, that c…",2019-03-07T17:40:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Author of 1983 EPA Report on Global Warming Explains Why He's Still Hopeful After 36 Years of Being Ignored,https://earther.gizmodo.com/author-of-1983-epa-report-on-global-warming-explains-wh-1833127786,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--3-gnu-Bo--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/fdbfpyvfnhonoi7tmurz.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,catastrophe,0

Suzanne Barlyn,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurers are bracing for what could be $20 billion in losses as Hurricane Florence barrels toward the Carolinas and Virginia, bringing punishing rains and potentially deadly flooding. Hurricane Florence, on track to become the first Category 4 storm to make a direct hit on North Carolina in six decades, howled closer to shore on Wednesday, as schools and factories were being shuttered and authorities ordered more than 1 million people in the region to evacuate. Losses from Florence could be on par with those from two previous storms: Hurricane Hazel, which ravaged North Carolina in 1954, causing $15 billion in losses, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which caused $20 billion, according to a report from risk modeling firm RMS on Tuesday. “As we look back at previous events, although hurricanes making landfall in the Carolinas are rare, the losses through this triple-threat of storm surge, wind and inland flood, could also be significant,” RMS said in the report. The firm will have a better estimate for total insured losses after Florence makes landfall. The slow-moving storm could dump between 20 and 30 inches of rain in the Carolinas after making landfall, according to a report on Wednesday by risk modeler AIR Worldwide. More than 758,000 homes in the Carolinas and Virginia are at risk, according to risk assessment service CoreLogic. Liberty Mutual Insurance and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company write the most commercial property insurance coverage in North and South Carolina, according to a report on Wednesday by Moody’s, citing data from SNL Financial. Other top commercial property insurers in the region include The Travelers Companies, Chubb Ltd. and a U.S. subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group, Moody’s said. The S&amp;P Composite 1500 Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Index fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday, with shares of insurers including Travelers Companies Inc, Allstate Corp, American International Group Inc and Chubb Ltd trading down less than one percent. “Stocks tend to fall in front of a storm because of uncertainty,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome. They typically rebound once insurers and risk modelers get a clearer picture of actual losses and whether individual companies have enough capital in place to cover them, Newsome said.

 Roger McNamee in ZUCKED.
I can't stop reading my just-out-today hardcover copy of Roger McNamee's new book, 'Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe.' I pre-ordered 'Zucked' last week on my phone when I was out for coffee with my friend Mike Backes (buy his book!), who was so enthralled with it he couldn't put his pre-release copy down, and he carried it with him that day. I'm a couple hundred pages in to 'Zucked' now. I get it. 
The book drops as Facebook is once again in headlines for privacy, ethics, and security lapses with catastrophic consequences on our world and our lives.
Here's a 'Zucked' excerpt I highlighted in my copy that seems so relevant to this week's Bad Facebook News...
The people at Facebook live in their own bubble. Zuck has always believed that connecting everyone on earth was a mission so important that it justified any action necessary to accomplish it. Convinced of the nobility of their mission, Zuck and his employees seem to listen to criticism without changing their behavior. They respond to nearly every problem with the same approach that created the problem in the first place: more AI, more code, more short-term fixes. They do not do this because they are bad people. They do this because success has warped their perception of reality. They cannot imagine that the recent problems could be in any way linked to their designs or business decisions. It would never occur to them to listen to criticsHow many billion people have the critics connected?much less to reconsider the way they do business. As a result, when confronted with evidence that disinformation and fake news had spread over Facebook and may have influenced a British referendum or an election in the U.S., Facebook followed a playbook it had run since its founding: deny, delay, deflect, dissemble. Facebook only came clean when forced to, and revealed as little information as possible. Then it went to Plan B: apologize, and promise to do better.
Appearing with host Ali Velshi on MSNBC earlier today, McNamee was asked about those changes and improvements Facebook seems to be announcing just about every day now -- they're largely cosmetic, said McNamee, who cited the recent story about that research app that spied on everyone, grabbed data off iphones,and was accused of breaking in illegally around the app store.
Most of the victims in that Facebook error were under 18, minors, and just last week Facebook was busted in a lawsuit designed to trick kids into running thousands of dollars up on their parents credit cards.
The problem, McNamee said, is that the incentives of the company are misaligned with the needs of the people who use it, and our democracy.
McNamee mentored Mark Zuckerberg, as a recent TIME cover story headline read. McNamee is a longtime technology investor and co-founder of Elevation Partners, and isn't suggesting that everyone unplug and run to the hills to off-grid Unabomber cabins. 
We, the humans formerly known as users, have way more power than we realize, said McNamee on MSNBC today. 
We don't have to spend as much time on Google and Facebook. I'm not saying to delete them, but spend a lot less time there. Work your senators and your congresspeople and let them know more change is required.
Roger will be on a book tour, and if you're as obsessed with this story as I am, it's worth going. Dates below, and updated here.

MICHELLE GOLDBERG,"Talk of popular control of the means of production is anathema to many older Democrats, even very liberal ones. It plays a lot better with the young; one recent survey shows that 61 percent of Democrats between 18 and 34 view socialism positively. The combination of the Great Recession, the rising cost of education, the unreliability of health insurance and the growing precariousness of the workplace has left young people with gnawing material insecurity. They have no memory of the widespread failure of Communism, but the failures of capitalism are all around them. The D.S.A. alone neither claims nor deserves sole credit for the victories of candidates it endorses. Many groups came together behind Ocasio-Cortez, including the populist Brand New Congress and local chapters of the resistance group Indivisible. Nor was the D.S.A. the prime mover behind the Fiedler, Lee and Innamorato wins, though it helped in all of them. Indeed, while there’s a lot of talk about an ideological civil war among Democrats, on the ground, boundaries seem more fluid. In Pennsylvania recently, I met with moderate suburban resistance activists who’d volunteered for Innamorato, thrilled to support a young woman who could help revitalize the Democratic Party. Barry Rush is a 63-year-old retiree who used to vote for both Democrats and Republicans, but who, horrified by Trump, now devotes himself full time to a liberal group called Progress PA. His main concern is electing Democrats — “I’m gonna pull the Smurf lever till this gets fixed,” he says of voting blue — and he knows that the Democratic Party needs young people. He was heartened by all the millennials at Innamorato’s victory celebration: “There were 500 kids there!” he said. It gave him hope for his grandkids. The young members of the D.S.A., meanwhile, are hopeful because their analysis helps them make sense of the Trump catastrophe. They often seem less panicked about what is happening in America right now than liberals are, because they believe they know why our society is coming undone, and how it can be rebuilt. “The Trump disaster is that everyone feels threatened individually, and feels like they have to fight Trump and fight this administration,” Arielle Cohen, the Pittsburgh D.S.A.’s 29-year-old co-chair, told me as I sat with her and two other chapter leaders in a small coffee shop in the city’s East End. “And socialists are saying, this has actually been going on for a long time. It’s not just Trump. It’s not just who’s in office.” There is a strange sort of comfort in this perspective; the socialists see themselves as building the world they want to live in decades in the future rather than just scrambling to avert catastrophe in the present.",Part of the blue wave is red.,2018-06-30T15:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Millennial Socialists Are Coming,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/opinion/democratic-socialists-progressive-democratic-party-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/01/opinion/sunday/01goldberg/01goldberg-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
Elizabeth Lopatto,"Hello! It’s your local friendly science editor, coming up on the end of the year. Typically, I like to think back on the stories that impressed me — and consider how I can learn from what set them apart to create excellent journalism in the following year. I asked my writers to name some of their favorite stories, and came up with a few of my own. Using this list of our favorites, I’ve created an arbitrary round-up of the stories that impressed us this year — our favorites. Because it’s my show, my rules, The New York Times and The New Yorker have been excluded. (I assume you read them already, but if you don’t, they’re well-represented on other year-end reading lists.) Without further ado, here are some stories we loved that you might have missed: PTSD in black women needs attention, study of South Side group says The Chicago Tribune reports, movingly, on a study about black women who’ve survived traumatic experiences — but aren’t getting access to care for their post-traumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately, in many neighborhoods there aren’t enough mental health providers to provide the assistance that’s badly needed. Scientists are building an animal fart database Does what it says on the tin. The Washington Post has had several massive and important scoops this year on federal science funding, but like most science writers, I retain a love for the more puerile end of things. Puerto Rico’s environmental catastrophe Vann R. Newkirk at The Atlantic has done so many excellent pieces that cover the intersection of science and politics this year that it’s hard to pick just one. But if I had to, I’d pick this one, written in the wake of Hurricane Maria’s catastrophic hit on Puerto Rico. Citizen groups are trying to make the island a better, more sustainable place to live — can they succeed? Inside the firestorm Well before California burned this fall, High Country News was writing about the scientists who study wildfires. Here’s a terrifying fact: 1 percent of fires account for 90 percent of land burned in the Western US. It’s very difficult to predict the behavior of these fires — so some scientists are risking life and limb to find out how they work. When disability tech is just a marketing exercise While vaporware is a problem in basically every area of tech, The Outline explores how promised projects for people with disabilities disappear after an initial bout of good press. The story of Toyota and the iBOT, a wheelchair that can climb stairs, is a fairly representative example of how vaporware gets people’s hopes up — and then lets them down. A Nevada woman dies of a superbug resistant to every available antibiotic in the US There are so many flavors of apocalypse that it seems hard to pick just one — but if I wanted to put my bets on anything, I’d put them on bacteria, which will pick off survivors in basically every form of catastrophe.

Earth’s orbiting junkyard threatens the space economy So there’s a lot of space trash — and Bloomberg explores what that means for the burgeoning private-space effort.

Emails show how an Ivy League prof tried to do damage control for his bogus food science You might not know Cornell University professor Brian Wansink, but you’re likely familiar with his work: for instance, that people pour more wine when they hold the glass rather than leave it on the table, or that naming vegetables in a more attractive way gets kids to eat more of them. Unfortunately, a lot of that work was bunk — three papers have been retracted and seven corrected, Buzzfeed reports. By running through how these papers came to be contested, this story gives us a view of the ugly problem in science: bad data. How much does it hurt? Pain is one of the most stubborn problems in medicine — a problem composed partly of the body and partly of the brain.

This Mosaic feature explores the other routes scientists are taking to try to help people who hurt. NASA calls bullshit on Goop's $120 'bio-frequency healing' sticker packs Goop is essentially a clearinghouse for “wellness,” which is to say, an entire industry that targets healthy people by scaring them into thinking they have to buy expensive nonsense to stay healthy.

Judy Berman,"The happily-ever-after montage is a romantic comedy cliché—a way to end a fairy-tale courtship with the spectacle of a lavish wedding while reassuring viewers that many joyous vacations, births, McMansion purchases and other upper-middle-class luxuries await the central couple. So it figures that You’re the Worst, a cult FXX dramedy about two irreparably broken millennials in love that aired its series finale on April 3, would conclude with not only abortive nuptials, but also a subversive flash-forward montage of its own.
When the wordless sequence begins, Gretchen (Aya Cash) and Jimmy (Chris Geere) are dancing at a wedding; it just isn’t their wedding, which explains why they look so blissful. A series of tableaus shows them awaiting their first child, then Jimmy reading him an inappropriate bedtime story, then the family sitting serenely at a bar, then the new parents having sex as the baby giggles in noise-blocking headphones a few feet away, then chronic depressive Gretchen bawling in bed next to her crying son as an oblivious Jimmy sleeps. Scoring these images of contentment and despair is The Mountain Goats’ “No Children”—a sort of indie-rock standard about a codependent couple who will never break up despite their mutual misery. The refrain: “I hope you die/I hope we both die.”
It’s a poignant and, at times, funny denouement. But is it happy? After four seasons of love, rage, self-destruction and battles with their own and each other’s demons, it may well be the happiest possible ending that’s true to these characters. “Who wants to lie in front of everyone they know that they’re gonna love each other forever? How can you know that?” Jimmy howls, as their already-in-progress wedding falls apart. In a final reminder that they can both be monsters, they ditch their guests to eat pancakes at the diner where they’ve shared many hungover breakfasts and vow to simply keep making the daily choice to be together. That’s an old saw of couples who refuse to marry, of course. Yet for Gretchen and Jimmy, this acknowledgment of uncertainty serves the paradoxical purpose of giving two commitment-phobic self-saboteurs space to create a stable future.
They may be a unique pair, but You’re the Worst isn’t the only beloved TV romantic comedy to go out on an ambiguous note this year. Taken together, these unorthodox finales suggest an awareness that the classic marriage plot—as deployed by Shakespeare, Austen and, yes, Sex and the City before the first movie made enough money to demand a sequel—oversimplifies long-term relationships. In reality, not all soulmates can be life partners. Love doesn’t always last forever. And if it does, it may not be enough to inoculate two people against unforeseeable circumstances or their own personalities.
In March, fans of Amazon’s beloved British import Catastrophe watched 40-something parents Rob (Rob Delaney) and Sharon (Sharon Horgan) weather the sudden death of his mother, fight viciously about the prospect of an intercontinental move and finally reconcile, improbably excited to welcome their third unplanned baby, while wading into metaphorical oblivion at a beach where signs caution: “Rip currents. No swimming.” They’re already married, and they’re much kinder, more conscientious people than Gretchen and Jimmy will ever be. But Rob will always be a recovering alcoholic; Sharon will always be reckless and selfish. Like the pregnancy that turned their one-week stand into a lifelong commitment in season 1, the years ahead are sure to bring surprise crises they’ll need to stick together to survive. Even then, they run the risk of drowning.
The recent final episode of Comedy Central’s Broad City—a show best understood as a nonsexual romance between two women and the city they love—was more upbeat. After years of aimless frolicking through the streets of New York, high on weed, friendship and the precarity of their broke urban existences, Abbi (Abbi Jacobson) and Ilana (Ilana Glazer) go their separate ways. In an arc that feels true to both characters, Ilana is preparing for grad school in the city she can’t imagine leaving. But Abbi, who turned 30 in the season premiere, realizes that if she keeps struggling to survive in such an unforgiving place, she’ll never get serious about her art career. So she uses a residency in Colorado as an opportunity move across the country. Once Ilana gets over the shock of her departure, they keep in constant contact via phone; this is how they grow up without growing apart. In the lovely closing shot, a parade of femme best friends of all races, ethnicities and gender identities streaming out of the subway to start their own youthful love affair with New York and each other.
Ultimately, these finales succeed (and by “succeed,” I may or may not mean “made me tear up”) for the same reason the shows themselves did: they revolve around unique, vividly drawn characters and relationships. From Bridget Jones to Crazy Rich Asians, most romantic comedies are designed to fulfill the one-size-fits-all fantasies of millions of women around the world who’ve absorbed a lifetime’s worth of propaganda from the wedding-industrial complex. That means down-to-earth heroines just flawed enough to be relatable, and just bland enough for the viewer to project her own qualities onto. Not everyone can identify with Ilana or Sharon or Gretchen, but after four or five seasons, they’re as familiar as old friends. I know them all well enough to be proud of the strides they’ve made and lament how far they still have to go—and to care how they end up.
Yet, barring untimely death, modern romances don’t necessarily have a clear result. Now that it’s possible to take or leave marriage, child-rearing, polyamory, serial monogamy or perpetual singledom, realistic love stories can’t all culminate in a wedding—or even a breakup of Eat, Pray, Love proportions. Raised after the normalization of divorce, then thrust into adulthood amid two decades of political, social and environmental chaos bracketed by the Clinton-Lewinsky saga and Donald Trump (not to mention ongoing economic flux that has rendered home ownership and other trappings of stability impossible), TV creators in their 30s and 40s seem to understand that the only certainty that awaits most couples in the far future is uncertainty. Now that happily ever after is a lie, messily ever after has begun to look like the best-case scenario.

The documentaries Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe, Man Made Epidemic, and Shoot' Em Up: The Truth About Vaccines were previously available on Amazon's streaming service. But on Friday, journalists from CNN and BuzzFeed began noticing you could no longer find them.

The takedowns occurred after US Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos on Friday about the e-commerce giant promoting products and content from the anti-vaccination movement.
""The algorithms which power social media platforms and Amazon's recommendations are not designed to distinguish quality information from misinformation or misleading information and, as a result, harmful anti-vaccine messages have been able to thrive and spread,"" reads his letter.
Image: amazon
So far, Amazon hasn't commented on the congressman's letter or the documentary removals. But the company has continued selling DVD versions of the same documentaries on Amazon's online store, as well as books containing anti-vaccination views.
Schiff's letter demands to know what Amazon is doing to stop vaccine misinformation from circulating over the company's online stores, and whether the e-commerce giant is accepting advertising dollars from activists with the anti-vaxxer movement. ""Every online platform, including Amazon, must act responsibly and ensure that they do not contribute to this growing public health catastrophe,"" his letter adds.
Last month, Schiff also urged Facebook and Google to stop pushing anti-vaccination content to parents. In response, Google's YouTube has pulledadvertising from videos that promote anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, Facebook said it's preparing more measures to reduce health-related misinformation over the platform. Nevertheless, anti-vaccination groups and content remain available on both platforms, which have tried to balance free speech against charges of censorship.
Pinterest, on the other hand, has reportedly taken more drastic measures and decided to block all searches related to vaccinations over the platform until it can come up with a better strategy to filter out anti-vaccination content.

(Deleted account),"Amazon is under fire again for helping spread anti-vaccine conspiracies.
Four major anti-vaccination groups National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), Age of Autism, Learn the Risk, and Physicians for Informed Consent are raising money through the Amazons charity fundraising program, AmazonSmile, according to a report
 by The Guardian. 
Other anti-vaccine organizations such as American Citizens for Health Choice (ACHC), A Voice for Choice, Informed Consent Action Network, and the National Health Freedom Coalition are also included in the program.
Through AmazonSmile, customers can choose to donate 0.5 percent of their purchase price to a charitable group of their choice when shopping with Amazon. The fundraising initiative has donated more than $100 million
 to organizations such as St. Judes Childrens Hospital, Doctors Without Borders, and the ASPCA since it launched in 2013. 
SEE ALSO: Amazon pulls anti-vaccination documentaries from Prime Video
Its unknown just how much anti-vaccination groups have raised through the program. As the Guardian points out, many of these organizations have an operating budget in the five to six figures. NVIC, the largest of these nonprofits, had more than $1 million in revenue in 2017.
These groups have promoted dangerous conspiracy theories
 about the safety of vaccinations, such as the belief that vaccines cause autism, which have thoroughly been debunked by scientists and medical professionals.
The Guardian report also uncovered how individuals within the anti-vaxxer movement are also raising money through Amazons Influencer program
.
Amazon has recently undergone similar scrutiny
 over documentaries promoting the anti-vaxxer movement found on Amazon Prime. Last Friday, United States Rep. Adam Schiff sent a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos blasting the company for spreading misinformation about vaccines. In his letter, the congressman demanded to know what the company was going to do about the anti-vaccination content.
Anti-vaccination documentaries, such as Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe, were later removed from Amazon Prime.
""Every online platform, including Amazon, must act responsibly and ensure that they do not contribute to this growing public health catastrophe,"" stated Schiff in his letter.
Last month, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms faced its own issues with the anti-vaccination movement. 
A recent report uncovered how anti-vaccination conspiracies were proliferating on Facebook
 through private groups. A separate report also exposed a similar rise in anti-vaxxer content on YouTube. The company responded by demonetizing anti-vaccination
 videos on the platform.
Pinterest has possibly taken the most extreme measures against the anti-vaxxer movement of any major social media platform. The company recently started blocking searches

Nick Douglas,"If I was setting up curriculum at a university, says engineer Foone Turing, Id make an entire semester-long class on the Challenger disaster, and make it required for any remotely STEM-oriented major. Because, says Foone, the disaster was a lot less random or simple than people tend to think. In a thread of 102 tweets, which you can read in essay form here, Foone explains the real reason behind the Challenger disaster, the 2003 Columbia disaster, the sinking of the Titanicand the last time you melted down from anxiety.
The Challenger disaster wasnt a single mistake or flaw or random chance that resulted in the death of seven people and the loss of a two billion dollar spaceship, says Foone. It was a whole series of mistakes and flaws and coincidences over a long time and at each step they figured they could get away with it because they figured the risks were minimal and they had plenty of engineering overhead. And they were right, most of the time. Then one day they werent.
Normalization of deviance
Foone describes the specific cascades of shortcuts and mistakes that led to these famous disasters, and the similar cascades that lead to horrific car crashes on supposedly safe roads. The common factor is that a system is built and stress-tested for one set of circumstances, then stretched a little further in regular use, then finally stretched so far, in a non-optimal situation, that something reaches a breaking point. And all the fudges and allowances fall apart in catastrophic failure. Foone calls this Normalization of Deviance.
A certain road, for example, is built for a 50 MPH speed limit. But because drivers will always push it, the engineer makes sure the road is safe all the way up to 70 MPH under normal conditions. Inevitably, drivers end up taking it at 60 MPH, since everyone knows thats still safe. And then a few people figure it must be safe to drive a little faster than the normal 60 MPH. And a few go even faster. And then it rains, and someone still goes 80 MPH and they crash and die.
Everyone designing a system is constantly fighting against normalization of deviance. And the more things are designed to accommodate misuse, the more the users misuse it. Were in an arms race. And not just designers and engineers, but all of uswere all designing our own lives with a normalization of deviance.
Personal disaster prep
Weve all been there at some point: failing a test because we pulled too many all-nighters, or missing a deadline because we couldnt find those extra hours we thought wed have on the weekend, or having a huge fight because we piled up too many tiny grievances with our partner, or going bankrupt for a medical bill because we spent as much as we earned and tried to live inside a rapacious capitalist system.
When it comes to following standard financial advice, how many of us can say we actually have three 
Read more Read
Yes, the systems around us build in certain stressors and failure points, and until those systems are fixed, we have to try not to stack too many other stressors on top of them. Personally, as the father of a three-month-old baby, Im quite freshly aware of this! Before, if the laundry or dishes or grocery shopping didnt get done, enough other stuff was going smoothly that the household could function fine until the weekend. Raising a baby puts a lot more stress on the system, and it becomes crucial to run the dishwasher, or to load the laundry in time to get everything dry and folded before bedtime. A baby is a series of little catastrophes, so theres less room for the others.
Catastrophe-aware empathy
The second personal lesson (another big one for a new parent): everyone around you is also managing a whole system of pressures and impending disasters, sometimes a lot more than you are, so you should be patient and empathetic with them.
In less personal terms, this is why asking someone for just five minutes of their time or just a few bucks is a bigger ask than you think. Its why whenever you want something from someone else, you should think about every possible obstacle and sacrificetravel time, opportunity cost, incidental expensesand take them on yourself. Meet someone near their workplace, pay the tab, secretly pad out deadlines so a delay wont be a catastrophe.
In close relationships, look for each others normalizations of deviance, and help them de-escalate. Take things off each others plate, swap errands or appointments, combine resources, cover for each other during stressful periods. And give yourself that same empathy.
And then, of course, get ready to adapt, because normalization of deviance comes for us all. The best we can do is give it fewer chances to cause a disaster.

Sources told Time that the aim of the petro was to erode the power of US sanctions. Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has previously referred to the petro as “kryptonite” and the US government as “Superman.” An executive at a Russian state bank told Time that senior advisers in the Kremlin oversaw the development of the petro and that Russian president Vladimir Putin signed off on the project in 2017. “People close to Putin, they told him this is how to avoid the sanctions,” the executive told Time. “This is how the whole thing started.” Earlier this week, the Trump administration issued an executive order prohibiting US citizens from purchasing the petro, which Maduro hopes will raise $6 billion and help shore up the country’s failing economy. Venezuela’s currency, the bolívar, has suffered from hyperinflation as a result of government mismanagement and US sanctions. The US has also frozen assets of four current and former officials of the Venezuelan government. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Monday : “President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis. Instead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency — a ploy that Venezuela’s democratically-elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned US persons to avoid.” Cryptocurrencies could be an effective form of skirting sanctions. Time reports that Russia floated the idea of creating a digital version of the ruble, but Russia’s central bank said it would risk destabilizing the ruble itself. “So Russia made its stronghold here in Venezuela,” Armando Armas, an opposition member of Venezuela’s parliament, the National Assembly told T ime. “Now they are using Venezuela as a guinea pig for their experiment.”",Venezuela’s petro cryptocurrency is reportedly a “half-hidden joint venture” with Russia.

The port is the main entry point for humanitarian aid into Yemen. More than seven million people in the war-torn country are dependent on food aid. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), part of the coalition, had earlier given rebels a final ultimatum to withdraw or face imminent attack. UAE Junior Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash told the BBC that the coalition had run out of patience with diplomatic efforts after a previous 48-hour deadline expired. He said the coalition wanted the UN to take control of the port but it was prepared to take military action if the Houthis refused to withdraw.

Thomas Colson and Adam Bienkov,"LONDON — Theresa May should call a second Brexit referendum to avoid the potential ""catastrophe"" of a no-deal Brexit, the former head of the UK civil service has told Business Insider. Lord Kerslake, who led the civil service between 2012 and 2014 and now advises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, told BI that the UK should be offered a two-choice referendum which includes the option to remain. ""I've changed my view and now back a second referendum,"" he told BI. He explained that ""a combination of poor negotiations and poor choices have left us in an unenviable place, and that's why we've got to re-open this question, even at this late stage,"" Kerslake added that ""no one could have imagined"" the public would be facing the ""stark choice between a poor deal or the catastrophe of no deal."" ""Had the negotiating process gone better, we wouldn't be having this debate. It's possible the government will get a deal and be able to secure support for it in parliament, but that's looking pretty difficult to achieve now, as some very intractable issues like the Irish border have not been resolved."" Downing Street has repeatedly ruled out the prospect of a second referendum, with Theresa May suggesting it would be a "" gross betrayal of our democracy."" But anti-Brexit campaigners who support a so-called ""People's Vote"" believe that the prime minister could be forced to legislate for such a scenario if MPs reject her deal in parliament. Kerslake said the government should consider seeking an extension of Article 50 — the two-year EU exit process which will see the UK leave the EU in March next year — by several months to provide time for a second referendum. ""Pushing back the exit date is something that must now seriously be considered,"" he said. ""If the government is unable to produce a deal and secure the vote in parliament, we are definitely into extension territory."" In another development, senior EU sources have also told Business Insider that they now believe the prospect of a second Brexit referendum is becoming increasingly likely. ""We were initially sceptical of [the possibility of a referendum] but it's looking much more likely than ever before,"" an EU Commission source told BI. ""If the meaningful vote fails in parliament then we believe the option of a second vote could come into play."" A ""People's Vote"" march Alex McBride / Getty Kerslake told BI that May's government should remove the option of a ""no-deal"" scenario from the ballot paper, and offer voters a simple choice between remaining in the EU and accepting the terms of Theresa May's Brexit deal. He said that a no-deal Brexit was ""not tenable"" because it would wreak havoc on the economy and because the civil service was unable to prepare for such a radical change in policy at short notice. ""Pursuing a no-deal Brexit, or even contemplating it when you know the damage it could do to ordinary people is frankly irresponsible,"" he said. ""We shouldn't really consider it as an option, because its consequences are so enormous,"" he said. ""The economic shock would be very significant."" He branded trade secretary Liam Fox ""irresponsible"" for suggesting that leaving the EU would not have a significant economic impact, and criticised Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has repeatedly called for the UK to leave without a deal. ""Those people who are saying ""Let's not worry about it, let's crash out of the EU, it'll be much easier than you think,"" are people of means on the whole,"" he said. ""Jacob Rees-Mogg is not going to be proved wrong on this point. But the vast bulk of the British population are living much closer to the edge than people like that. They cannot withstand an economic shock without real consequences to them.""","Theresa May is urged to call a fresh Brexit referendum by the former head of the UK civil service.

Alex Lockie,"North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un speaks during the Inter-Korean Summit at the Peace House on April 27, 2018 in Panmunjom, South Korea. Korea Summit Press Pool/Getty Images President Donald Trump is set to make history on June 12 in Singapore as the first sitting US president to meet a sitting North Korean leader with peace and denuclearization are on the table. But if the summit fails, it could end in catastrophe, and that may be the point. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo makes trips to probe North Korea's willingness to go through with denuclearization, something it has promised and reneged on multiple times in the past, Trump's stance on Pyongyang has emerged as very hardline. Pompeo has demanded the ""complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization"" of North Korea before the US offers any easing of economic sanctions on Pyongyang. So far, North Korea has appeared amenable to these requests, but experts remain highly doubtful. The end result could be a mediocre outcome sandwiched between two possible catastrophes A view of the newly developed intercontinental ballistic rocket Hwasong-15's test that was successfully launched, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang November 30, 2017. Reuters ""There are two extremely unlikely outcomes"" for the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un, said Vipin Narang, a North Korea expert at MIT. The first unlikely outcome, Narang told Business Insider, is that ""Trump walks away with Kim's nuclear weapons,"" and the second is""catastrophic failure."" Narang said that more likely, Kim and Trump will partake in a photo shoot with handshakes and kind words. In that scenario, the US would accept some mixture of half measures to slowly wind down North Korea's nuclear programs while providing them with sanctions relief — much like the deals that have previously failed. Narang called this outcome ""kicking the can down the road,"" because it would likely only delay a serious confrontation between the US and North Korea over real denuclearization. But Narang said that one theory is that Trump, or Kim, intended the summit to end badly. Great expectations, extreme consequences Korean War veterans react as they shout slogans to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during a parade to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of a truce in the 1950-1953 Korean War at Kim Il-sung Square, in Pyongyang July 27, 2013. North Korea celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Korean War truce on Saturday with a massive military parade trumpeting the revolutionary genius of three generations of leaders that gave it ""Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War"". REUTERS/Jason Lee A major element of Kim's pivot toward diplomacy appears to be swaying public opinion. Meanwhile, Trump's administration also touts his achievements on North Korea as evidence of his presidency's successes. But both parties come to the talks with seemingly impossible expectations. North Korea reportedly asks virtually nothing of the US, while the US asks North Korea to disarm completely and immediately. Joshua Pollack, a North Korea expert and senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, tweeted that the summit's ""biggest problem"" was ""overinflated expectations."" The US wants North Korea to lay down its arms before a US dime heads to Pyongyang, and Kim wants US and international tensions to thaw to kick-start its stalled economy. Both parties want what they want fast, and only one party can get its way. ""Whatever exactly the North Koreans hope to get out of the June summit, it doesn't sound like it overlaps very much with what Mike Pompeo is outlining,"" Pollack tweeted. If both parties go in with flawed expectations for the summit, as it appears from public statements they have, the talks could end very badly. ""Kim's strategy is smart,"" Narang said, referring to the vague promises of denuclearization from North Korea. ""If it looks like Trump is the one walking away, then it looks like Kim wins."" If Kim leaves the summit saying Trump spoiled the deal, then the temperature on the Korean Peninsula goes up ""astronomically,"" Narang said. Victor Cha, the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies with knowledge of Trump's thinking on North Korea, recently told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that the worst-case scenario for the talks would be for the US and Pyongyang to ""walk out of this thing angry at each other, with deflated expectations — and then there's no place left to go, there's no more diplomacy, because you've used your biggest card right up front."" If both parties exit the talks with no deal and no progress, Trump and Kim could easily find themselves going back to nuclear threats, but this time without the prospect of talks to keep them from the brink of military conflict.","President Donald Trump is set to make history on June 12 in Singapore by meeting Kim Jong Un in a high-stakes diplomatic summit — but it could be destined to fail.

Jon Evans,"Let’s talk about the side effects of the creeping apotheosis of solar power. I mean, don’t get me wrong, we’re a ways away yet — but we’re definitely heading in that direction. “Renewables are about to become our cheapest form of energy,” Wired UK observes. “We expect $7.4 trillion to be invested in new renewable energy plants by 2040 – 72% of the total spent on power generation worldwide,” reports Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Don’t believe them: How about Bank of America, who “see oil demand peaking by 2030 as electric vehicles boom.” Or Germany’s Mercator Energy, in Nature Energy, who suggest that photovoltaic solar power “could potentially provide fully half of global electricity by 2050.” You can see it beginning to happen, and its repercussions beginning to hit, in America today. Tesla just signed a deal to sell its PowerWalls and solar roofs in 800 Home Depots. A few days ago in Maine, Central Maine Power responded to four Quakers protesting its opposition to a pro-solar-power bill by having them arrested for criminal trespass. I’m biased — one of the arrestees is a close friend — but it seems hard to interpret CMP’s response as anything other than pathologically dumb and counterproductive. But what about the new solar-panel tarfif? you might ask. Won’t that be disastrous to the industry? Not so much. An annoyance, not a catastrophe; a speed bump in the way of exponential growth. As renewables guru Ramez Naam (who’s putting his money where his mouth is ) says : 5. Utility scale solar is ~70% of US solar, so that's what I've talked about first. But at commercial/industrial and residential scales, this matters even less. At residential scale, panels are maybe 1/8th or 1/10th of total price. This tariff will raise prices by a few %. — Ramez Naam (@ramez) January 23, 2018 Obviously this transition is extremely welcome — and obviously it won’t come without repercussions that will be negative for some people and some entities. You don’t upend the entire energy status quo without bankrupting a few dinosaurs. The most effective way to become a dead dinosaur, though, is to kick angrily at the pebbles twitching on the ground, or to pretend that they’re not moving, because you’re wilfully blind to the fact that they’re harbingers of an unstoppable locomotive of change … until it’s too late to get off the tracks and evolve. Don’t be like Central Maine Power, or like whoever’s advising Trump on solar tariffs. Massive changes are coming. Stay ahead of the shockwaves, or, better yet, be part of them.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Wildfires cause devastation in Greece The search for survivors is continuing in Greece, where at least 74 people have died in wildfires near the capital Athens. High winds spread the fire, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the sea as they tried to escape the flames. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning. On Tuesday, the bodies of 26 adults and children who apparently died embracing each other were found on a cliff top. ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced, "" Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said. On Monday night, hundreds of firefighters battled the flames, which were fanned by winds of up to 100km/h (60mph). Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who managed to reach harbours or beaches. Rescuers are now searching houses, cars and the coastline for survivors and victims of the fires, amid fears the death toll will rise. Image copyright EPA Image caption Rescuers continue their search of the area Relatives of those reported missing have been posting photographs on a website in the hope of tracing their whereabouts. Prime Minister Tsipras has declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services have been mobilised. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, while Spain and Cyprus have also offered assistance. 'Biblical catastrophe' The seaside resort of Mati, in Attica, is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Survivor Kostas Laganos said: ""It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'"" George Vokas, whose family also escaped by sea, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. ""We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,"" he said. Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. What caused the fires? Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. ""Fifteen fires had started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,"" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to ""detect any suspicious activity"".

It was developed by stem4, a UK-based group that describes itself as a teenage mental health charity. More apps in the same vein are available for both platforms, each offering a slightly different approach to support. Calm Harm seems to be a favorite because it offers so many different options—you can tap buttons for comfort, distraction, and more—and it keeps a log of when you felt the urge and what triggered it. When you want help, you tell the app whether you’d like to try five one-minute exercises or a single 15-minute session. Some typical prompts: “Think of a comforting place and in your mind run through all the comforting things you do when you are there.” “Stick some fake tattoos where you hurt yourself. Remind yourself to do one comforting thing every time you see them.” “Think of the lyrics of a song you know really well. Try reciting it from back to front.” “Ring someone you know who will be comforting and talk it out.” Besides Calm Harm, check out: My Shiny Thing (iOS): This app specializes in distraction. It asks how much you want to hurt yourself, and then shows you pages and pages of funny and cute YouTube videos. Self-Heal (iOS and Android): The app gives you a randomly chosen activity to do, either now (“write words on yourself with a red marker”) or long term (“plan for the future: holidays, weekends away, job or study plans.”) There’s also a button that takes you to a library of motivational memes and cute pictures, and another for information on managing self-harm urges. Moods (iOS): This one isn’t just for self-harm, and it doesn’t help you manage your moods. It just asks you what they are. Select whether you’re feeling “good,” “okay,” or “bad,” and then you can tag your mood (“lethargic,” “furious,” “😡,”etc) and add a note if you like. The app compiles a report of the moods you feel most often, and it can remind you at a set time of day to log your moods. Android has plenty of mood apps as well, or try Daylio, which tracks moods and daily activities on both platforms. What’s up ( iOS and Android ): This is an app meant for all types of mental health crises. If you tap the “help right now” button, you can choose between a breathing exercise, a random “name 5 things” game (for example, name five things around you that are green), and a “catastrophe scale” where you can evaluate what’s bothering you on a range from “everything in life is perfect” to “everything has fallen apart and it feels like it’s all your fault.” There’s also a link to forums where you can talk to others.","iOS/Android: The urge to self-harm, the Calm Harm app tells us, is like a wave.

Nick Douglas,"In another stellar win for the Trump administration, today the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists pushed the Doomsday Clock forward to 2 minutes from midnight. The last time the Bulletin got this grim was in 1953, after the US and USSR tested their first hydrogen bombs. What’s the Doomsday clock? Since it began in 1947, the Doomsday Clock has become the best-known measure of humanity’s risk of global catastrophe. Until 2007, it only tracked the danger of nuclear weapons; since then it’s also incorporated the effects of climate change. Who sets the clock? The nineteen members of the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board, including national security experts, physicists, climate scientists, a public health expert and a cybersecurity expert; and the Board of Sponsors, including 15 Nobel laureates. Each year the Bulletin decides whether to move the clock or leave it as-is. (Until 1973, the Bulletin’s editor set the clock.) How has the setting changed over time? The clock was set at 7 minutes to midnight in 1947, kind of accidentally—it was originally just a cover design for the Bulletin, and artist Martyl Langsdorf said this setting “looked good to my eye.” In 1949, when the USSR tested its first atomic bomb, Rabinowitch moved the hand to 3 minutes to midnight. Since then the Bulletin has changed the setting 22 times. The high mark was 17 to midnight, set in 1991 after the US and Russia signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The low mark is 2 to midnight, reached in 1953 and again today. Why did it change this time? In today’s announcement, the Bulletin blamed rising tensions between the US and Russia, the US and North Korea, and the US and China. It’s not entirely our fault; the announcement also mentions the continuing arms race between India and Pakistan, and Iran’s quest for nuclear capability. The announcement also discusses the persistent threat of climate change and even references fake news and election tampering, as they degrade the public’s ability to push for sane nuclear and climate policy. How do we push it back? The Bulletin has some ideas! They listed several bullet points, and we’re slightly paraphrasing them here but: Trump should calm the fuck down. The US government should open up “multiple channels of communication,” which sounds a lot like “go behind the administration’s back.” China should step up and whip North Korea into shape. The US should stop being so dramatic about Iran. The US and Russia talk. None of this nuclear bullshit matters if the US, and everyone else, keep pumping carbon into the air. The “international community” should find a way to make people believe facts again, because Facebook sure won’t. Nobody make any Terminators or new Ebolas please The announcement ends with the reassurance that we could all step away from the brink of destruction, if we just somehow magically stop doing all the bad things we’re doing.

Jennings Brown,"Russia launched the world’s first floating nuclear power plant on Saturday. The 70-megawatt vessel, christened the Akademik Lomonosov, was towed away from St. Petersburg by two boats. It is currently coasting through the Baltic Sea to the town of Murmansk for fuel, and is then supposed to embark for the Arctic town of Pevek in 2019, according to a release from the state-run firm that built the rig. Greenpeace has referred to the vessel as “ Chernobyl on ice ” and a “ nuclear Titanic ” bound for catastrophe. The environmental activist group’s nuclear expert Jan Haverkamp says one of the major concerns with the power plant is that it has a flat-bottomed hull—so that it can get close to the shoreline—and it has no self-propulsion, making it more vulnerable to storms. Greenpeace ran a petition campaign that stopped Russia’s original plan to stock the power plant’s nuclear reactor in St. Petersberg, then send it straight to Pevek. The company that built the vessel, the Rosatom Corporation, decided to instead make an extensive pit stop in Murmansk, so that all the nuclear-related activity will take place in the Arctic, in less populated areas. But that has done little to assuage the fears of Greenpeace. “Nuclear reactors bobbing around the Arctic Ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already under enormous pressure from climate change,” Haverkamp said in a release. Once the vessel gets to Pevek, it is intended to help power the port town, replacing the 44-year-old Bilibino power plant and the 70-year-old Chaunskaya Thermal Power Plant, according to the release from Rosatom. Other countries have floated the idea of a natant nuclear plant—namely China and the US. Construction on the floating power plant first began in 2007, but hit many snags along the way.

CHARLES M. BLOW,"So please forgive me if I don’t rise in applause simply because Comey’s revelations are giving Trump agita. Nor expect the dampening of my condemnation of Comey because Trump World seeks to defame him. Then there is Trump, who, in the same week that Comey was on television saying that he could not be sure if the president was in a Russian hotel room with prostitutes peeing on each other, announced that we and a couple of allies had initiated a military campaign in Syria over its use of chemical weapons. To be sure, the situation in Syria is a humanitarian crisis and has been for years. The last report on the Syrian death toll by the United Nations came from 2016, when an official said 400,000 people had been killed. The U.N. said at that time it was virtually impossible to accurately verfiy how many people had died. In addition, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are 5.6 million Syrian refugees and as of July 2016 “6.5 million people, including 2.8 million children, displaced within Syria, the biggest internally displaced population in the world.” Neither the United States nor the international community has developed a sufficient policy and response to this catastrophe. People simply seem to be hoping and praying that it soon comes to an end and trying to ensure that the fighting doesn’t spill out of Syria’s borders. The Trump administration, for its part, says that it has drawn a line in the sand on the use of chemical weapons, but that seems to be, at best, randomly enforced. On Friday, Nikki Haley herself said at the U.N. that “the United States estimates that Assad has used chemical weapons in the Syrian war at least 50 times. Public estimates are as high as 200.”","James Comey testifying before Congress in June, left; President Trump in the Oval Office in January.",2018-04-16T00:08:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Op-Ed Columnist: Dislike Comey, Despise Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/opinion/dislike-comey-despise-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/opinion/15blowWEB/15blowWEB-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
ARTHUR LUBOW,"Because of tightened protections on informed consent, it is unlikely that such photographs as well as Avedons work at East Louisiana State could be made today, at least in the United States. That is true, too, of the pictures that are the closest precedent to Arbuss Untitled series: Peter Hujars little-known but excellent photographs at residences for developmentally disabled children in Southbury, Conn., and for spastic children in Florence, Italy, made from 1957 to 58 while he was in his early 20s. Hujar, too, zeroed in on kids playing games and having fun. But unlike Arbus, who abstracted and softened her scenery so it resembles stage flats, Hujar employed in his square-format pictures all the tricks of Henri Cartier-Bresson: strong diagonals (of slides, swings and supporting rails) ; inventively off-kilter angles; and asymmetric groupings. Hujars youthful pictures are empathetically grounded; Arbuss mature ones are unearthly.

Erik Sherman,"Facebook has hit a new company high -- which means a low -- in an ongoing PR crisis. Yesterday afternoon, Brian Acton, co-founder of WhatsApp -- Facebook bought them for $19 billion -- suggested that people delete Facebook from their phones and computers, using the hashtag, #DeleteFacebook, because of privacy issues. Hardly what CEO Mark Zuckerberg would want to hear. The criticism is harsh and not isolated. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over the company's data-sharing policies is reportedly in the works. Facebook's chief security officer effectively said that the company can't police users because it's too large -- not at all reassuring from a company that has this kind of access to massive amounts of personal data. And a former Facebook vp says the company is 'destroying how society works'. This is a growing PR and branding disaster that makes anything Uber faces seem like public chastisement over littering in comparison. Not to minimize Uber's trials. But the criticisms of that company have always been about how it runs the business. Facebook is under fire for what it is. To put it differently, Uber has the unenviable task of changing the corporate structure and all its practices. The amount of work necessary is titanic, even as new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi fights to find a path to profitability. (Losing billions a year is an enormous problem in its own right. Facebook is profitable and will likely to continue as such, given how many people worldwide are locked into the platform because of network effects. Even now I see professionals I know who want alternatives but face the reality that all their contacts won't be in a new system. But the magnitude of alarm, particularly in the wake of the 2016 election, is existential in nature. As just one example, Timothy Summers, director of innovation, entrepreneurship, and engagement at the University of Maryland, had an article today titled Facebook is killing democracy with its personality profiling data. And this is from someone who also discloses that he owns shares in the company. The problem, he argues, is that Facebook has gone far beyond the type of demographic profiling that is stock in trade for virtually any advertising. Advertisers haven't begun to leave the network. Getting data on people's personalities and ideologies, particularly through popular social media quizzes, is addictive to marketers. Particularly when the access also comes with troves of personal data. Here's how Summers describes it in the context of the ""academic"" research that was sold as an election marketing tool: In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own. Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information, including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you've ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you're tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you've ever liked; and information about the device you're using including your web browser and preferred language. Adding to what Summers said, here's how potent this information can be. Your picture and other data can let companies find you in many other contexts, tying them all together. Friends lists to into developing social graphs that further pinpoint who you are and what you do. Images increasingly can be analyzed, particularly when faces are shown. Everything you've ever liked becomes a history of your preferences. The more people start to learn this, the increasingly upset they can get. Facebook is quickly becoming radioactive for politicians. Conservative Republicans are sure the company has discriminated against them. Democrats on the left will find it hard to embrace the network when claims of helping to their opponent into the White House -- whether accurate or not -- have become a dominant public narrative in the press. Even in the face of repeated past criticism over privacy (or lack of privacy) practices, Facebook has avoided increased regulation. However, the pressures it is starting to feel, and will continue to face, dwarf anything before. No amount of spending or lobbying can keep it out of trouble. When almost the entire political spectrum is set against you, avoiding punitive actions is like trying to stand your ground against incoming waves at the seaside. Additionally, Facebook is bungling the crisis PR aspects right, left, center, up, and down. Neither Zuckerberg nor COO Sheryl Sandberg has made a public statement, as Bloomberg noted. This is not a case where the word of those lower down will make any difference. In the meantime, Facebook shares have lost more value -- $60 billion -- than the entire market cap of Tesla or three times that of Snap. This is bad, and inept actions will only make it worse.",This public relations catastrophe is epic and years in the making.,2018-03-21T14:39:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Even Facebook Former Insiders Are Turning Against the Company with #DeleteFacebook,https://www.inc.com/erik-sherman/even-facebook-former-insiders-are-turning-against-company-with-deletefacebook.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_935015080_350227.jpg,,Inc.com,catastrophe,0
Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,"The Camp fire, which killed 86 people and burned the Northern California town of Paradise to the ground in November, was last year’s most expensive natural disaster worldwide, according to a report from German-based global reinsurance company Munich Re. 
The fire, which was the deadliest and most destructive in the state’s modern history, tore through nearly 14,000 homes around Paradise, a rural community about an hour and half north of Sacramento. 
Now the blaze holds another devastating record, according to the report released Tuesday: the costliest natural disaster in 2018. Each year the reinsurer tracks major natural catastrophes and estimates the losses incurred, including to insurers, in its natural catastrophe loss database. 
Natural disasters worldwide in 2018 cost a total of about $160 billion significantly higher than the average over the last 30 years of about $140 billion (adjusted for inflation).  
The Camp fire was the costliest last year, at $16.5 billion in losses, including $12.5 billion of insured losses. The next most expensive disaster was Hurricane Michael, which barreled through Florida in October, killing nearly four dozen people and wrecking entire communities. 
“Our data shows that the losses from wildfires in California have risen dramatically in recent years,” Ernst Rauch, Munich Re’s head of climate, said in a press release. “We have experienced a significant increase in hot, dry summers, which has been a major factor in the formation of wildfires. Many scientists see a link between these developments and advancing climate change.”  
The Camp fire was just one of several record-breaking natural disasters around the world last year that were an indicator of climate change’s effects coming home to roost. 
Multiple hurricanes in the U.S. last year including Michael and Florence hitting within a month and typhoons tearing through Japan and the Philippines were among the major catastrophes that came at a high cost in 2018, according to the Munich Re report.
The Camp fire could come at a serious cost to power company PG&amp;E. Dozens of Camp fire victims have sued the utility for its alleged role in the blaze, saying it did not properly maintain its power lines. Their lawsuit points to PG&amp;E documents that indicated a failing transmission line was in the area where the massive blaze was believed to have started. 
Last month California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the company could face charges as serious as murder or manslaughter for its alleged role in the blaze as well as other wildfires it may be connected to around the state over the past couple of years, The Sacramento Bee reported. 
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump threatened to cut off wildfire aid to California from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said in a now-deleted tweet that state officials had to “get their act together, which is unlikely” and improve forest management.",The state’s deadliest fire ever was also the world’s costliest catastrophe in 2018.,2019-01-10T22:02:30Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",California’s Camp Fire Was The Most Expensive Natural Disaster Worldwide In 2018,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-camp-fire-costliest-disaster-2018_us_5c37b1b4e4b045f6768a484f,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c37b3f72500003600c5829b.jpeg?cache=TjriN2afqD&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,catastrophe,1

ABC News,"Blaine Harden spent decades reporting across Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia, but for the former Washington Post East Asia bureau chief, covering North Korea has been unlike any other assignment. Interested in Uncomfortable? Add Uncomfortable as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Uncomfortable news, video, and analysis from ABC News. “It was hard slogging. It still is hard slogging,” Harden told ABC News. “North Korea is, you know, the longest-lasting totalitarian state in the history of the planet. Seventy years almost. And there’s nothing like it.” Harden has not only visited and reported on the country, he has written three books focused exclusively on nonfiction narratives uncovered through his years of work there. Now, his latest book, “King of Spies,” lays out the largely unknown story of Donald Nichols, an unlikely yet effective American spymaster. Nichols arrived on the Korean peninsula in 1946, carefully constructed an intricate network of spies, and became a brutal “one-man war machine” as a young man in his 20s. For Harden, examining the barbarism and trauma of the Korean War in which Nichols played such a crucial role held important lessons about the history of U.S.-North Korean relations, particularly after the U.S. began its brutal bombing campaign. “They destroyed virtually every city, every town in North Korea. General Curtis LeMay who was head of the Strategic Air Command at the time estimated that the Americans killed 20 percent of the civilians in North Korea,” Harden said. “So that bombing was a fact. It’s a historical experience that the grandparents of the current people of North Korea all experienced.” The Kim family has leveraged that loss of life into a powerful anti-American message to this day, Harden said. “They perceive the fundamental war, the only war North Korea’s ever fought, to be a different war, one where the Americans and the South Koreans sneakily attacked, and the Kim family brilliantly won,” said Harden. “It’s almost as if the war ended last Thursday, if it ended at all,"" the author added. ""And now, that fact-based narrative has found some real zip, because of what Donald Trump is saying.” For all the talk about North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un as unpredictable or unstable, Harden said the regime has been largely consistent over the years. “They are really consistent, and their track record is they’re getting better at what they do,” said Harden. “The threats, the bloodcurdling rhetoric that you could hear from North Korea, it hasn’t really changed for decades. What’s new and what is confusing to the North Koreans is they’re starting to hear echoes –- reverse echoes -- of that rhetoric from America’s president.” Amid conflicting statements from President Trump and his cabinet, and headlines about North Korea’s advanced weapons capabilities, even Harden said he is nervous about the possibility of war. “The behavior of the Trump administration is making it more complicated to implement the least bad solution, which is to talk because [North Korean officials] don’t know who to talk to, whether to believe what they say, because the president can undermine it the next day with a tweet,” said Harden. “I’m more concerned than I was before. But then you know, it’s the Kim family that’s pushing the nukes and the long-range missiles. That’s not the fault of Donald Trump,"" Harden added.

Andrew Winston,"Shana Novak/Getty Images This week brought some sobering news on the near future of our planet and species. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued an important new report about how dire the consequences of climate change are becoming, and how fast we need to move to avoid the worst. The report’s beginnings trace back to 2009, when the annual UN global climate conference resulted in an agreement that the world should hold warming to 2.0°C (3.8°F) — a level that seemed politically feasible, but still leads to vast damage, including the death of all coral; even more deadly storms and heat; and rising oceans covering low-lying island nations and major coastal areas. By the time of the Paris climate meeting in 2015, which resulted in the more robust global agreement now supported by every country in the world except the United States, it was clear that we needed to consider a more ambitious target, 1.5°C (2.7°F). The UN then asked the IPCC to study what it would take to achieve that goal. This week, the report came back, and it’s not pretty. The scientists put out a helpful document with FAQs, but in short, the primary takeaways are these: While the world has already warmed 1.0°C (1.8°F) since pre-industrial times, holding the world to 1.5°C (2.7°F) is still technically Keeping the world at 1.5 degrees will still result in devastation (e.g., 70-90% of coral dying), but is far better for us than 2 degrees (both in terms of overall well-being and economic impacts). Getting to 1.5 degrees will require “rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems” and this transition will need to be “unprecedented in terms of scale…and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors.” We will need to cut CO2 emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, the report says, and get to no emissions by 2050. Keep in mind that this would need to happen as the world most likely adds a couple billion people, with a billion or more entering the middle class. We will need to produce a lot more stuff to feed, house, clothe, and entertain everyone, but with drastically lower emissions. So, what should companies take away from this latest warning? What should they do ? First, companies must accelerate ongoing efforts to decarbonize their businesses. The list of actions companies take is well-developed and documented, and most large companies do the following: Slash energy use and emissions in operations. This includes investing in more efficient lighting and HVAC systems; using new software and AI to make buildings and operations more efficient; improving fleet logistics and introducing greener vehicles; and reducing packaging and product weight. Engage employees, through awards and incentives, to innovate, find operational savings, and develop products that cut customers’ emissions as well. Embrace renewable energy. More than 150 big brands that have already committed to use 100% renewable energy in their electricity. Set science-based carbon reduction targets for operations. Nearly 500 companies have signed on to set emission reductions in line with science. Work with suppliers on systemic reductions across the value chain and set big goals for them as well. Set internal prices on carbon to incentivize reductions, preferably imposing an internal tax that collects funds or using “shadow” prices to influence investment decision making. These actions are becoming the norm because they’re just good business. But what this new report is saying, loud and clear, is that it’s not enough. With a few exceptions, most companies are only doing the things that pay off in traditional return-on-investment terms — for example, when solar and wind get cheap enough, they buy it. Really sticking to the latest science, however, requires an accelerating pace of carbon reduction. So, let me suggest four somewhat uncomfortable actions that companies must take to truly shake things up and accelerate climate action. Lobby for aggressive pro-climate policies at all levels of government. Today, most companies use their significant lobbying influence (on their own and through trade groups) to fight regulations and defang government. But that has to change in the face of this crisis. The first priority — which the IPCC makes clear — is to put a price on carbon. Companies must lobby for escalating prices on carbon everywhere. In parallel, the way companies approach all regulation should shift. Consider the example of the U.S. auto industry. As soon as the 2016 election was over, an auto industry group asked the new administration to give them some more wiggle room on aggressive fuel efficiency standards established by the Obama administration. The current administration gave the auto companies way more than they wanted and froze the fuel efficiency levels. It puts companies in a weird position where they want to make improvements, but have no regulatory pressure that moves the whole sector upward. But imagine if auto companies approached the issue not through a lens of “how do we structure regulations to help us?” but through a lens that recognizes an urgent global climate crisis. They could say to government, “We need much higher fleet efficiency to help the world hold warming to 1.5 degrees. But we’re having some trouble selling the mix of cars that would get us there (people are buying too many big vehicles). What policies can we put in place to make it much more attractive for buyers to get the EVs and smaller cars? Can the government help build the charging infrastructure? Provide aggressive tax breaks for EVs and good incentives for trading in older cars? Can we invest in public-private R&D to bring the cost of batteries down even faster? Could the government commit to buying EVs in all of its fleet? Or, even more radical, how can we work together to greatly increase the availability of all public mobility and transport?” But even if companies come to the table with an outside-in, climate-change-first approach to their policy goals, a conversation requires two sides. So, to go even further, companies need to also consider who they support for political office. Candidates that don’t advocate for action on climate are not allies, no matter what other issues they support. Publicly and loudly support truth, science, and scientists. In the era of claims of “fake news,” and attacks on science, companies must help support a key pillar of a working democracy and economy. Most companies let it be known clearly that racism or sexism is unacceptable — why not send a similar message to employees and suppliers about anti-science behavior? They could also support efforts like Let Science Speak and call out government or any institutions that reduce the role of science in policy and decision-making. Use all available platforms to engage consumers. Within companies, the level of internal conversation about sustainability and climate change is rising. But how many big brands use their advertising, social media, or their packaging to talk directly to consumers about climate change? Besides a few messages around Earth Day, not many. It’s time to break some taboos on what mainstream companies can talk about; they can and should encourage consumers to make better day-to-day choices that reduce their footprint. Rethink investment decisions and heavily bias them toward carbon reduction. This could mean different things depending on the business, but we have to release ourselves from the arbitrary two-year hurdle rates and capital return ratios that hamstring more aggressive action. Solar and wind power are becoming easy investments, but there are always new efficiency techs that may not be “in the money” yet, like on-site power storage. And what if companies and governments retired some energy-hogging assets before their asset life was up? In the end, governments and companies have a basic choice: One, move very quickly with large-scale investment in deep transitions across all sectors of the economy, investing trillions to reduce energy costs, improve health, and avoid many other risks. Or two, ignore these warnings and decarbonize the economy at the pace of change that simple-ROI economics allow, not retiring any existing assets early, and transitioning technologies at the pace they would naturally shift under normal market conditions. Pathway two is what we’re doing now, and it sounds so tranquil and market-based. But it has one heck of kicker: that path will require spending some indeterminate future amount, and soon, on greater levels of adaptation, on resettling people away from coasts, on reduced health, and on managing extreme weather impacts on our communities and supply chains. Pathway two also likely takes us beyond the 2.0°C mark, leading to the non-trivial chance that the world will become uninhabitable by humans. None of this is easy, but the IPCC report shows we’re truly out of time now. We’re not talking about theoretical models on a computer, but larger versions of the weather horrors we’re already seeing around the world. Business can take the lead here. It has the tools, resources, and the responsibility to help make this rapid transition happen. The improvement in long-run economics and human well-being is more than worth the effort.",There really is no time to waste.,2018-10-09T20:24:27Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",The Scale of the Climate Catastrophe Will Depend on What Businesses Do Over the Next Decade,https://hbr.org/2018/10/the-scale-of-the-climate-catastrophe-will-depend-on-what-businesses-do-over-the-next-decade,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/oct18_9_951634066.jpg,,Hbr.org,catastrophe,0

As philosophy YouTube channel The School of Life puts it (video below), there’s this collective assumption that for love to be real or genuine, it must be eternal. “True love,” as they say, is endless, everlasting love. And any relationship ending before someone perishes is a failure and should be considered an emotional catastrophe, right? Wrong. There’s no pass or fail when it comes to love, only beginnings and endings. It’s like saying one failed at their career because they decided it was best to leave a particular job to see if there might be a better fit elsewhere. We champion this concept of the life-long love story, making it the ultimate goal, but many of us rush to get there. We don’t grant ourselves the freedom to find out what truly makes us feel content—partially because we know compromise is essential, but also because we don’t actually know what we want out of a partner (or if we want one at all). Short relationships teach you that. You get together, you learn things, and it either continues because it’s right, or it comes to an end because it’s not.

LIAM STACK,"As far as New Jersey is concerned, Ms. Moxley said she thought “there really is no difference now” between the Democrats and the Republicans. That sentiment is not shared by Democrats and Republicans, but at the Green Party convention Ms. Moxley was not alone in that belief. Even in the age of President Trump — whom they concede may be uniquely hostile to their principles — there are many Greens who squint to see the difference between the Democratic and Republican parties. “They are not different enough to save your job, to save the climate, to save the economy and to save the peace,” said Ms. Stein. “The reality is we are going further and further over the edge here, whether it is a Democrat or a Republican, and it’s not as if Hillary would have stopped this slide into catastrophe.” The Democratic Party loomed large over the Green conference, where attendees ruminated over the many ways they claimed the Democrats had slighted or sabotaged them over the years. There was the ongoing legal challenge mounted by Democrats in April to remove the Green Party from the ballot in Montana, where a vulnerable Democratic senator, Jon Tester, is seeking re-election in a state President Trump won by 20 points. And last November, the Senate Intelligence Committee requested documents from the Stein campaign as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the election.

Marcus Gilmer,"As we crawl to the finish line of 2017 while Trump plays golf behind a white truck, it's still hard to grasp how this year managed to be even more surreal than the tire fire that was 2016. And, yet, here we are, at the end of a year that felt like ten. Remember when James Comey testified before a congressional committee in what was a must-see television event? That was in June. Now, in the frozen grip of late December, Axios has published the below chart, using search data made available from Google Labs, that proves it wasn't just you. 2017 really did go on forever. Image: axios As you can see, there was literally always something going on with Trump that generated huge interest, starting with the inauguration crowd size in January and lasting all the way until this month when Michael Flynn was indicted and Trump attacked the FBI on Twitter. Looking at this chart, it's easy to see how we forgot some of the crazier moments, like Trump staring at the eclipse or the short, brightly burning supernova that was Anthony Scaramucci. Also notable: the general year-long interest in the allegations of sexual harassment made against the president with a spike in the later months as the reckoning against abusive men in multiple industries gained steam. Nothing about Trump's behavior throughout the last 12 months reflects any kind of genuine, thoughtful strategy of deflection and distraction and this chart proves it. Rather, it confirms that the Trump Presidency is much more akin to that famous scene in Boogie Nights where a guy wanders around flinging lit fireworks while a coked-out drug dealer waves around a loaded gun and we all barrel on to the next thing while chaos and noise swirl around us and we all start to lose our minds as we become numb to the catastrophe that is slowly unfolding.

"Fred Kaplan, Fred Kaplan","Venezuelan soldiers take part in a military exercise in Puerto Cabello on Sunday.
How Did Roger Stone Know What Trump Told Mueller?
The Trump Administration Will Let Adoption Agencies Turn Away Jews and Same-Sex Couples. Thank SCOTUS.
The Nonsense Trump Spewed During the Shutdown Wasnt Oblivious. It Was Tactical.
The Trump Administration Quietly Changed the Definition of Domestic Violence and We Have No Idea What For
The conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt said on Meet the Press on Sunday that a nice little war in Venezuela would bring us togethera laughable remark, except that President Donald Trump has been musing about sending troops there since his early days in office and as recently as two weeks ago.
Certainly, Venezuela is a ripe candidate for what used to be called humanitarian intervention. In the past five years, under the corrupt, repressive rule of its fraudulently elected president, Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelaonce among South Americas most prosperous nationshas descended into misery: Its economy has shrunk by half, inflation approaches 1 million percent, health care and other services have crumbled, food is a scarce commodity, nine-tenths of the people are impoverished, and manyestimates range from 2 million to 4 millionhave fled to neighboring countries.
Trump raised the stakes on Wednesday when he formally recognized Juan Guaidó, the democratically elected president of Venezuelas National Assembly and the leader of the anti-Maduro movement, as the interim president of the country. In an unusual move for an administration ill-disposed to consult with allies, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo persuaded the leaders of other nations in the hemisphereincluding Canada, Brazil, Peru, and Colombiato follow suit.
But now what?
Venezuelas top military officers are still backing Madurowho, no coincidence, has given them perks of wealth for their support. Russian President Vladimir Putin has done the same, denouncing the recognition of Guaidó as a destructive act of outside interference that blatantly violates basic norms of international law. China, Turkey, and Iran joined Putin in his support for the status quo.
And so we see an alignment of forces, similar to what weve seen in the Middle East, replicated in the Western Hemisphere. The domestic politics behind Trumps move also give off a whiff of neoCold War dynamics. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, from Florida, has been the main force rallying other politicians, and leaning on Trump, to do something about the chaos in Venezuela. Rubio, whose constituents include many Cuban exiles, also led the calls for fiercer pressure on the Castro regime beforeand, to some extent, sinceBarack Obama opened relations.
Its important that Trump doesnt follow his preferred M.O. of jumping in, blowing up some stuff, declaring victory, and jumping out.
Shannon ONeil, the chief Latin America specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted, in an email, the striking parallels between the past movements against Castro and the current movements against Madurothe same set of actors, the same set of approaches.
Still, although a few neighboring states have followed Trump in recognizing the opposition leaders, it is unlikely that any of them would support, much less join, a military intervention. The spectacle of American troops on Venezuelan soil would raise memories of Yankee imperialism across Latin America and could even bolster support for Maduro.
Lets say the U.S. military could oust Maduro from power. Venezuelas capital, Caracas, is perched on the northern coast of the country. If Trump ordered the Pentagon to come up with a plan, one could imagine warships dispatched to the Caribbean, launching airstrikes against Maduros command and control targets and landing Marines on the shores.
But this would almost certainly be only the first step of a long occupation. Venezuela is a large countrytwice as large as Iraq and only slightly less populous. Lets say much of the Venezuelan military could be wooed over to the oppositions side; Guaidó has been holding talks with some officers, and the Venezuelan military attaché in Washington recently defected. The rest of the military might still stay put with Maduro. We could be wading intoand to a large extent, promptinga civil war. And this leaves out the 1.6 million members of an armed civil militia, whose pro-Maduro leaders say they are poised to repel an invading imperialist force.
In short, war is not the way to gobut that leaves several courses of action on the table. Stepping up sanctions, against Maduro and his entourage, could have an impact. Prying away the military, even offering key officers a better deal under the new regime, could make the regime go wobbly. Good old-fashioned diplomacy, including talks with Russia, China, and Turkey, is worth trying. None of those countries leaders have a vital interest in propping up Maduro, and its unlikely that theyd want to tangle with the United States in the Western Hemisphere just to keep him in power. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, quotesa senior Canadian official who, after speaking with the Kremlin, said that the Russians were looking to find a house for Maduro in Cuba.
Whatever Trump does here (and it looks like hes going to do something), its important that he doesnt follow his preferred M.O. of jumping in, blowing up some stuff, declaring victory, and jumping out. Venezuela is a mess, and even if Maduros ouster comes fairly peacefully (say, if the Russians do find that house in Cuba), the place is likely to turn messier. Someone will have to restore services and stability; something will have to be done about those armed militias. Aid and expertise will have to flow to the ministries in Caracas; sanctuaries will have to be found for the millions of exiles.
The tragedy of Venezuela is far from over. Its repair will require a prolonged effort by lots of agencies from lots of entities that have more interest in doing this sort of thing and more talent at doing it. Trump should keep a very low profile. Its unclear whether hes capable of doing that.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"At least eight people have been killed and dozens more injured after a blast triggered a fire at a community centre in northern Portugal. The fire in Vila Nova da Rainha started when a heating boiler in the building exploded, the mayor said. More than 60 people were at the centre for an amateur card tournament or were watching football on TV. The fire reportedly ignited material in the roof and spread quickly, causing panic. Vila Nova da Rainha is close to the town of Tondela and is about 260km (160 miles) north-east of Lisbon. The mayor of Tondela, José António Jesus, told the Público newspaper that the fire quickly created a large amount of carbon monoxide. He said the recreational and cultural centre was ""very active and at the heart of the community"". At least 35 people were hurt, six of them seriously, according to local media, with most suffering burns or smoke inhalation. Some of the injured were taken to hospitals in Lisbon and Porto, the Diário de Notícias website reported. The newspaper said glass wool in the roof may have contributed to the spread of the fire in the two-storey building. The dense smoke may have disoriented people as they tried to escape. One of those at the centre, Rui Abreu, told Jornal de Notícias that some people had fallen on top of each other on the stairs. Dozens of fire-fighters were deployed and the flames were extinguished in about an hour.

Hayley Miller,"The University of Notre Dame will cover up a series of murals depicting Christopher Columbus amid backlash over the paintings’ stereotypical and inaccurate portrayal of Native Americans and their relationship with white European explorers, the school announced.
The 12 murals, painted by Luigi Gregori in the 1880s, adorn the entrance of the university’s Main Building, a busy throughway that houses administration offices and some classrooms, in South Bend, Indiana. 
At the time of their creation, the paintings were intended to empower Catholic immigrants in America, but their message whitewashes the catastrophic impact European explorers had on native peoples, Notre Dame President John Jenkins wrote in a letter to members of the school’s community on Saturday.
“They reflect the attitudes of the time and were intended as a didactic presentation, responding to cultural challenges for the school’s largely immigrant, Catholic population,” Jenkins wrote. “In recent years, however, many have come to see the murals as at best blind to the consequences of Columbus’s voyage for the indigenous peoples who inhabited this ‘new’ world and at worst demeaning toward them.”
In an effort to preserve the murals, which Gregori painted directly onto the building’s plaster walls, woven covers will be mounted over them, which allow the paintings to be viewed on occasion, Jenkins said. The school intends to create a permanent display featuring high-resolution images of the murals alongside proper historical context in a different location on campus.
“Gregori’s murals focused on the popular image of Columbus as an American hero, who was also an immigrant and a devout Catholic,” Jenkins wrote. “The message to the Notre Dame community was that they too, though largely immigrants and Catholics, could be fully and proudly American.”
“For the native peoples of this ‘new’ land, however, Columbus’s arrival was nothing short of a catastrophe,” he continued. “Whatever else Columbus’s arrival brought, for these peoples it led to exploitation, expropriation of land, repression of vibrant cultures, enslavement, and new diseases causing epidemics that killed millions ... The murals’ depiction of Columbus as beneficent explorer and friend of the native peoples hides from view the darker side of this story, a side we must acknowledge.”
Notre Dame’s pledge to conceal the murals follows mounting backlash from students and faculty. In 2017, hundreds of people signed a letter penned by a Notre Dame Ph.D. candidate calling on Jenkins to remove the paintings.
“Columbus’ fortune, fame, and wealth came from the destruction, mutilation, and transaction of Native American and African persons,” John Slattery wrote in the letter. “In this era of political divisiveness and a renewed rise of dangerous nationalism, it is time for Notre Dame to remove its own version of a Confederate Monument.”
The Native American Student Association of Notre Dame applauded Jenkins’ “thoughtful and wise decision” in a Facebook post Saturday.
“This is a good step towards acknowledging the full humanity of those Native people who have come before us,” the group wrote. “We sincerely hope that Father Jenkins and his administration will continue to prioritize Native issues on our campus in the coming weeks and months as there is still work to be done.”","For Native Americans, the explorer's impact was ""nothing short of a catastrophe,"" said John Jenkins, the university's president.",2019-01-22T17:04:06Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Notre Dame To Cover Up Christopher Columbus Murals,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/notre-dame-christopher-columbus-murals_us_5c471653e4b0bfa693c71e29,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c4746bd250000ed00c591f4.jpeg?cache=8EnCS9sp4E&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,catastrophe,0
Clive Thompson,"1816 is famous for being the year that Mary Shelley began to write Frankenstein. But it's also infamous for being ""The Year Without A Summer"". One of the hugest volcanic eruptions in recorded history emitted a sun-obscuring ash cloud, and temperatures worldwide plummeted -- destroying crops and ushering in several years of brutal famine. It provoked massive social disorder. So while Shelley was writing her novel, she may have had her mind on the hordes of starving Europeans desperately migrating across the nearby countryside in search of food, and being utterly rejected by the elites well-off enough to feed themselves. In a terrific essay, Gillen D’Arcy Wood argues that we could read Frankenstein as an allegory not just of technology run amok, but a climate spun out of control : [Our] too-easy version of Frankenstein — oh, it’s all about technology and scientific hubris, or about industrialization — ignores completely the humanitarian climate disaster unfolding around Mary Shelley as she began drafting the novel. Starving, skeletal climate refugees in the tens of thousands roamed the highways of Europe, within a few miles of where she and her ego-charged friends were driving each other to literary distraction. Moreover, landlocked Alpine Switzerland was the worst hit region in all of Europe, producing scenes of social-ecological breakdown rarely witnessed since the hellscape of the Black Death. Shelley’s miserable Creature, in the context of the 1816 worldwide climate shock, appears less like a symbol of technological overreach than a figure for the despised and desperate refugees crowding Switzerland’s market towns that year. Eyewitness accounts frequently refer to how hunger and persecution “turned men into beasts”, how fear of famine and disease-carrying refugees drove middle-class citizens to demonize these suffering masses as subhuman parasites, and turn them away in horror and disgust. Two hundred years on, in a summer of more record temperatures, and worldwide droughts, when refugees once again stream across the borders of German-speaking Europe, can we really afford to ignore this reading of Frankenstein as a climate change novel? The novel is a cultural treasure, but it doesn’t belong behind a glass case. It’s alive, like the monster itself. It’s on the loose in our world and our minds, stoking our darkest terrors. Shelley’s untameable tale of human pathos, suffering, and destruction is headline news: on the TV and internet, in a million images, filling well-fed, well-housed citizens with horror. [snip] In Frankenstein’s Creature, Mary Shelley offers us the most powerful possible incarnation of the loathed and dehumanized refugee. I'm a bit more doubtful that Mary Shelley really had the plight of the countryside in mind while she was writing; in her own account of how she came up with the story of Frankenstein (very fun to read, and free here ), she notes only that it was ""a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house"". Nonetheless! This a very intriguing way to think about the novel. And the second half of D'Arcy Wood's essay is devoted to Baroness de Krüdener, who wrote a searing account of the plight of the climate-refugee hordes; it's intense, gripping stuff.

Hayley Miller,"It’s been nearly 11 months since Hurricane Maria terrorized Puerto Rico, decimating the island’s farmlands, power grid and homes ― and likely claiming hundreds and hundreds of lives in its wake. Independent investigations conducted separately by The New York Times, Penn State University and Harvard University estimated Maria’s death toll could be in the thousands. The official death count has remained at 64, though Puerto Rican officials quietly conceded this week in a report to Congress that over 1,427 deaths may be directly or indirectly linked to the historic storm. In the months since Maria, President Donald Trump has been remarkably silent about Puerto Rico’s struggle to recover. Trump, a notoriously prolific tweeter, hasn’t mentioned the hurricane on social media since November, and he hasn’t visited Puerto Rico since October. The only time Trump publicly addressed the death toll was during his only post-Maria visit to the island, in which he suggested Puerto Ricans were lucky Maria wasn’t a “ real catastrophe ” like Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left over 1,800 dead. At the time, the official death toll was 16, though Puerto Rican leaders, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz repeatedly and publicly warned that the number of fatalities was exponentially higher. In mid-October, Trump conceded that he believed Maria was actually “worse than Katrina,” but still gave his administration “a 10” out of 10 in its response to the storm. So why hasn’t Trump publicly acknowledged the likely staggering number of deaths? Or personally provided updates on Puerto Rico’s monthslong struggle to restore power to its residents? Or met with any of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Puerto Ricans? HuffPost asked the White House on Thursday if Trump would care to comment on Puerto Rico’s death toll, given the growing indication that hundreds or thousands had died. In response, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley provided a statement: There’s only one official count and the actual counting of disaster related fatalities is the local responsibility of Puerto Rico. We have been supportive of Governor Rossello’s efforts to ensure a full accounting and transparency. Those grieving deserve no less. The whole of government remains focused on ongoing recovery and preparedness for the current Hurricane season. When asked in a subsequent email whether Trump still believes the federal response was adequate, Jessica Ditto, deputy communications director for the White House, responded that “the entire federal response was massive, historic and unprecedented.” But many activists and lawmakers disagree with the White House’s assessment. Some expressed sorrow on Thursday over the Puerto Rican government’s discreet death toll concession, and others tore into Trump for spending millions of dollars on the creation of a new armed service known as the Space Force instead of sending more aid to Puerto Rico. Tragically, the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is far higher than the official count. The federal gov't hasn't done enough to assist or force accountability. I’ve called for a bipartisan commission to investigate the Trump Admin’s response. https://t.co/zWTq84Z882 https://t.co/wSBPcOUKCs — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) August 9, 2018 Trump’s public concern over Puerto Rico’s recovery appeared to subside following a wave of self-congratulatory statements from his administration on what it deemed a successful hurricane response. Just nine days after Maria made landfall, then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke called the government’s relief efforts “ a good news story,” sparking outrage among lawmakers such as Cruz. “This is a people-are-dying story,” Cruz told CNN in response to Duke’s comments. “This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water.” For months, Cruz pleaded with the Trump administration to send additional aid to help the millions of lives uprooted by Maria, the most powerful storm to hit the the U.S. territory in at least 80 years. “I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying,” Cruz said in televised remarks days before Trump’s October visit to the island. “If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy.” Trump responded to Cruz by claiming she was simply playing politics and accused Puerto Rican workers of not doing their part to help in relief efforts. “Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor,” he tweeted on Sept. 30, adding later that she exhibited “poor leadership.” ""Dammit, this is not a good news story"": San Juan mayor slams acting DHS Secretary Duke's comments about Puerto Rico https://t.co/Lx5pOp6iFs — Joshua Chavers (@JoshuaChavers) September 29, 2017 Days later, Trump and first lady Melania Trump would arrive for their first and only post-Maria visit to Puerto Rico, where the president would downplay the devastation. “Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump had said, comparing Maria’s death toll to Katrina’s. “You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what’s taking place in Puerto Rico.” Following his remarks at the briefing, Trump made a few other stops in San Juan, including at a church where he made headlines by throwing paper towels to Puerto Ricans displaced by Maria. Trump also took several opportunities during and after Maria to remind Puerto Ricans that their government was $74 billion in debt, and that despite the historic storm, they would still have to deal with their financial woes on the other side. “When Mr. Trump suggested that Puerto Rico’s plight had thrown the federal government’s budget out of wack, and that Katrina was a worse disaster, well... that hit hard,” Wanda Acosta, the 56-year-old owner of a boutique hotel in Rincon, Puerto Rico, told HuffPost in an email Friday. “Saying that Puerto Ricans want everything done for them was outrageous!” she added. “Everyone was out in the streets, on their farms, in their yards, repairing their businesses, cleaning and clearing, helping and cooking and just surviving without power and water.” By the end of October, Trump’s tweets about Puerto Rico had ceased. He had tweeted about Maria roughly two-dozen times ― about the same number of times he’s tweeted attacks ( one as recently as Friday ) against NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality. By comparison, he’s tweeted about special counsel Robert Mueller ’s Russia investigation over 85 times since Maria. There have been significant developments related to Puerto Rico’s recovery ― studies on the number of fatalities, government corruption charges, the extraordinarily prolonged restoration of the island’s power. Trump hasn’t publicly addressed any of them. A Politico investigation published in March found Trump had reacted far more aggressively to Hurricane Harvey than to Maria. He visited Houston twice within the first eight days after Harvey struck the Gulf Coast, killing over 100 people. He waited 13 days to visit Puerto Rico. It took 10 days for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to grant permanent disaster aid in Texas, compared to 43 days for Puerto Rico, Politico reported. I am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying. And you are killing us with the inefficiency and bureaucracy. Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan “After witnessing first hand the horror &amp; devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!” Trump tweeted at the time. Two days later, he declared Sept. 3, 2017, a national day of prayer for the victims of Harvey. Nearly every indication suggests Hurricane Maria was responsible for close to ― if not more than ― the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. President George W. Bush ’s legacy was, in part, defined by his administration’s widely panned response to the natural disaster, which left over 1,500 people dead in Louisiana alone. Bush’s approval rating dramatically dropped in the wake of Katrina. Bush eventually took “ full responsibility ” for the federal failures, though not before the then-head of New Orleans’ emergency operations called the federal government’s slow response a “national disgrace.” Despite significant backlash, Trump emerged relatively unscathed from Maria’s destruction. His response to it didn’t appear to have much of an impact on his approval rating, as it continued to hover around 36 percent in the months after. It has since climbed to 41 percent in recent weeks, according to the Pew Research Center. Despite public pressure, Trump did not further inject himself into the national conversation about Puerto Rico’s fight to recover. A George Washington University study commissioned by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in December to scientifically determine the excess deaths related to Hurricane Maria is expected to be completed in the coming weeks and could finally provoke a statement from Trump. A spokeswoman for the university told HuffPost that the study was expected to be released “this summer.” It was initially slated for completion by late May, though the school said in a statement that data collection had taken longer than expected. “We owe it to the people of Puerto Rico to have a precise number, along with the data we need to make better preparations for future disaster situations,” Héctor Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico’s Department of Public Safety, said in a statement Thursday. “With this information, we can understand what procedures need to be in place in Puerto Rico to prevent such a high loss of life from ever happening again.”","In October, the president suggested Puerto Ricans were lucky Hurricane Maria wasn't a ""real catastrophe"" like Katrina in New Orleans.",2018-08-11T11:01:37Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Will He Ever Acknowledge The Massive Loss Of Life In Puerto Rico?,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-puerto-rico-death-toll_us_5b6c41c8e4b0ae32af95c6bb,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b6c42e619000014035017be.jpeg?cache=7AUiaoKuEa&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,catastrophe,0

Having struggled for many years with alcoholism, Delaney writes in a post shared to Instagram and Twitter that he's ""grateful"" for his sobriety.
""Sobriety allowed me to be a reasonably good dad, husband and worker through it all,"" Delaney writes. ""Sobriety allows me to grieve fully, and grief is an expression of love.""
Delaney adds that had he not been sober, the grieving process would have been ""far worse.""
Delaney has previously explained on Twitter that the reason he has chosen to speak publicly the loss of his son is ""de-stigmatise grief."" 
I speak publicly about Henry in an effort to destigmatize grief. My family is sad &amp; in pain because our beautiful 2 yr old boy died after a long illness. Why wouldnt we be sad? Why wouldnt we be angry and confused?

TIME Staff,"On Wednesday, February 6th, join TIME and Betaworks Studios as they co-present a conversation with early Facebook investor and advisor, Roger McNamee about his new book Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. Zucked is McNamee’s intimate reckoning with the catastrophic failure of the head of one of the world’s most powerful companies to face up to the damage he is doing.
In an adapted excerpt of Zucked that ran in the January 28 issue of TIME, McNamee writes, “It took me a very long time to accept that success had blinded Zuck and Sheryl to the consequences of their actions. Even at this writing, I still own shares in Facebook. My criticism of the company is a matter of principle, and owning shares is a good way to make that point. I became an activist because I was among the first to see a catastrophe unfolding, and my history with the company made me a credible voice.”
The conversation will be moderated by Laurie Segall, senior technology correspondent, CNN.
The event is free and open to the public and will be held at Betaworks Studios, a membership club in New York, NY, from 6:00PM – 8:30PM on February 6. For more information and to RSVP, visit: https://zuckedwithrogermcnamee.splashthat.com/

MIKE HALE,"Seven entirely new situation comedies were added to the schedules of the major broadcast television networks this fall, and The New York Times did not review any of them. (That doesnt include the not-quite-new sitcoms The Conners and Murphy Brown, which we did review, and Last Man Standing.) This has mostly to do with numbers the ever-growing crush of shows on broadcast, cable and streaming versus critics personal algorithms of time and sleep. Its been a while since The Times and other outlets reviewed every new fall show from the networks. But it also has to do with the particular circumstances of the network sitcom, which as recently as four seasons ago seemed ready for a renaissance with the premieres of black-ish, Fresh Off the Boat and Jane the Virgin. That promise hasnt been fulfilled (The Good Place aside), and the balance of power in half-hour comedy for years the networks last bastion in prime time, along with pro football has swung decisively to cable and streaming, home of adventurous and hilarious shows like Atlanta, Barry, Better Things, Catastrophe, Casual, Insecure and Silicon Valley.","While everyone was talking about the revived “Murphy Brown” and “The Conners,” there were seven brand-new comedies this fall.

ROGER COHEN,"“Every personal relationship is unique,” Macron said. “I have my own style and your president has his own style, I would say. So there’s a marriage of these two styles and if we are very different, um, and I think we have something in common, which is that we are definitely, probably, mavericks of our own systems. Look, I think for my people, for French people, they are very proud of that. I mean French people are very happy when France is considered, respected.” This is a very Macronesque utterance — the “definitely” and “probably” juxtaposed — but, come on, here’s a French president speaking, with refreshing frankness, in English (how the unthinkable becomes commonplace!) about the bet he’s placed on Trump and the pleasure France gets from finding itself once more center-stage. Britain has gone AWOL in its Brexit funk. Angela Merkel of Germany has passed the zenith of her power. Macron is what Europe’s got to sway Trump, reinvent the trans-Atlantic bond, and keep him from trashing the American-led multilateral order that has held humankind from world war since 1945. Did Macron fail in Washington? His main goal was to stop Trump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, which has reversed Tehran’s push for bomb-making capacity, on May 12. Macron said his view was that Trump “will get rid of this deal on his own for domestic reasons.” He added, “There is a big risk he will leave.” He had protested to the president: “You will replicate past mistakes, because what is your perspective, you want to make war against Iran?” But, Macron suggested, to no avail. Trump, he said, “is very predictable.” He calls the deal “a catastrophe.” He’ll shred it. Trump’s North Korean experience has inclined him to think his erratic braggadocio works.

Wonbo Woo,"With August 14 approaching fast, fans of World of Warcraft are eagerly awaiting the release of Battle for Azeroth, the seventh expansion in the mega-hit MMORPG. WoW was first released in 2004, and in the fourteen years since, expansions and patches have introduced iconic features like flight ( Burning Crusade ), the dungeon finder ( Wrath of the Lich King ), transmogrification ( Cataclysm ), garrisons ( Warlords of Draenor ), and artifact weapons ( Legion ). Battle of Azeroth will introduce two new continents, as well as gameplay features like island expeditions, in which players can compete against artificial intelligence bots in fulfilling objectives. World of Warcraft: Battle of Azeroth Cinematic Trailer “Each new expansion we add to the game, we're looking to expand the core of the game the players have come to know and love over all these years, but also add brand new ways of playing the game, new features, new types of gameplay, new challenges to undertake, and a fresh look at a game that seeks to reinvent itself every couple of years,” says Ion Hazzikostas, the game director on World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment. But that’s not always easy to do. Take flying, which the team introduced in the game's first expansion, The Burning Crusade. “That was huge, it really changed the way we built zones and different landscapes and design visually the landscapes too,” says Jimmy Lo, the game’s visual development supervisor, in the video above. We now had to actually think about transition zones and how one landscape transition into the next one.” Changing those landscapes presented all sorts of challenges, as the team learned when developing 2010's Cataclysm. “ Cataclysm set out with a massive undertaking of actually breaking the world,” Hazzikostas explains. “So it told the story of this great dragon, Deathwing, who burst forth from within the Earth and unleashed chaos and catastrophe across Azeroth. Areas were flooded, areas were broken apart, massive crevices appeared, but what this did, what this provided was a vehicle to remake the original world that had been crafted in 2004.” Changes needed to be implemented while people are still players are still actively playing the game, which is where engineers come in. “How do we sunder the world out from under the players, make it believable and not mess everything up in the process?,” asks Patrick Magruder, WoW ’s lead gameplay engineer. “Because when they logged out, they were above the ground, and when they log in, this exact same position is now inside of a mountain or inside of a fire pit, or they're high up in space because there's now a crater where they were.” “That was, even to this day, I would say probably the single largest task the World of Warcraft team has ever undertaken,” says Hazzikostas. Watch the video above to hear from Hazzikostas, Magruder and Lo about the evolution of World of Warcraft and every expansion, from The Burning Crusade through Battle of Azeroth.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright ONT TV Image caption State TV warns of an 'ecological catastrophe' An onslaught of bark beetles is threatening to decimate the mighty pine forests of Belarus. The ravenous insects destroyed more than 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of woodland in Brest, the country's westernmost region, last year alone - ""almost the area of a small town"", says state TV's ONT channel. Viktar Ambrazheichik, the forestry chief of Drahichyn district, told ONT he hasn't seen anything like it in 30 years, and warned that the ""problem is only just beginning"". Pinsk, Stolin and Luninyets districts are already affected, and the beetles are now spreading into Drahichyn. It takes the tiny insects less than six months to destroy several hectares of forest, both saplings and mature trees, and it's a race against time to save the healthy pines. ""The beetles are dormant for now, so we have to get rid of them and the trees they've infested before they wake up with the spring,"" said Ambrazheichik. Image copyright ONT TV Image caption Felling and burning are the only way of stopping the beetles Frost resistant Even the strong frosts Belarus has seen in recent weeks won't help. The hardy insects can survive temperatures of minus 36 Celsius, which the country hasn't seen since the famously harsh winter of 1941. As if this weren't bad enough, Forestry Minister Mikhail Amyelyanovich said global warming has lowered the water table so much that the ministry is considering having to irrigate the woodlands to save them from drying out. He assured viewers that the ""situation is under control,"" despite ONT's constant on-screen caption about ""ecological catastrophe"". He acknowledged that the mass felling of 80-year-old trees might seem extreme, but ""we have to stop these bark beetle outbreaks, or else all we'll be left with is woodchip"". Pesticide worries Meanwhile, forest rangers are working seven days a week to clear the infested trees, which will be used as sawn timber and chip for wood burners. They are also going to plant more resistant silver birch among the pines. As for the next step, Vyachaslau Zvyahintsau of Brest Technical University said the only way to prevent further outbreaks is to ""improve the monitoring system, and catch the infestation early"". ""Otherwise, the beetle lives unnoticed under the bark until it's too late, and the amount of pesticide needed to eradicate it would also damage the whole forest eco-system,"" he warned.

LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES,"What he is left with is a grief etched so deeply into him — and into this room that was their haven — that he doesn’t trust his own impulses when he invites a woman, Arisa (Maho Honda), to visit him there. He is attracted to her, he says, but maybe he is pursuing her out of weakness: his inability to get through life alone. “Time’s Journey” is a response to the Fukushima disaster, and the striking sensory evocation that begins the performance (lights by Amith Chandrashaker, sound by Mikaal Sulaiman, set by Anna Kiraly, all excellent) ensures that we make the connection. The translation, by Aya Ogawa, helps with that, too; fluid as it is, it does not feel like American speech. This is part of what makes “Time’s Journey” — the third work by Mr. Ogawa that Dan Rothenberg has directed for the Play Company — feel very different from the most recent of those collaborations, “ The Sonic Life of a Giant Tortoise,” in 2014. So does the casting. The actors in “Time’s Journey,” all based in New York, were born in Japan. “Time’s Journey” is more than a reflection on a single catastrophe, though. Told in fragments that come together gradually, it is a chronicle of healing, with all its pain and awkward humor and halting steps. We know from the beginning, because Arisa tells us, that she will become Kazuki’s girlfriend. We watch it happen incrementally, in stilted conversation and silent tableaus. Yet still there is Honoka, weaving gracefully through the room, gently demanding her husband’s attention. “I know you can hear me,” she says.

Rayne Ellis,"There is a version of the near future where antibiotic resistant bacteria become more deadly than cancer. A study released back in 2016 predicted that, if left unchecked, these types of bacteria could claim more than 10 million lives a year by 2050. Cancer currently kills 8 million people annually. In the U.S. alone, antibiotic resistant bacteria already kills 20,000 people per year and infects millions more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). SEE ALSO: In the fight against measles, UNICEF has found an unexpected ally – mobile phones It’s obvious that something needs to be done to mitigate the potential catastrophe, but so far an answer has been out of reach. But a team of scientists, led by David Brenner of Columbia University, believes they have found a partial solution, and it’s been hiding in plain sight. “We’ve known for a long time that UV [ultraviolet] light has the potential to reduce surgical site infections, because UV can efficiently kill all bacteria, including drug-resistant bacteria and even so-called superbugs,” Brenner said in a interview. However, conventional UV light is a direct health hazard because of it's ability to cause skin cancer and other health problems. Because of that, UV's germicidal properties have been largely dismissed until now. In February, Brenner's team released a study that found a small range within the ultraviolet spectrum that might be safe around humans and also kill at least some harmful bacteria. According to Brenner and his team, this wavelength is too short to penetrate even the outermost layer of skin while still possessing all the same germicidal qualities as conventional UV light. If proven safe, the research team envisions three potentially life saving applications of the light. They hope it could kill “airborne viruses such as influenza, in public spaces,” Brenner said. Though the light wouldn't be able to fight all diseases, it would be very effective in the battle against more common viruses such as influenza, measles, tuberculosis bacteria, or pandemic-causing viruses like the Asian flu. A second use would be to reduce surgical site infections, one of the most common ways superbugs spread. “The idea is to kill [the airborne superbugs] as they float down onto the wound,” he said. The third way is to disinfect highly susceptible parts of the body, like where catheters are inserted. It's not a cure-all While the new research is promising, this type of light doesn’t completely eliminate the superbug threat by any means. Many of the most deadly superbugs aren’t airborne, CDC infectious disease specialist Alexander Kallen explained. This infographic explains the purpose of the AR Lab network Image: CDC ""There are always going to be challenges when developing new technology,"" Kallen said. Brenner's research could help protect people from their environment, but how do we treat them once they are infected? ""It's just too early to know,"" he said. While the battle continues in developing new ways to combat tricky pathogens, groundwork needs to be done to see that we are minimizing infections now. The CDC is funneling its efforts into providing hospitals with the funding to ensure that all suspected superbugs are tested in a lab, free of charge through what is known as the Antibiotic Resistance Lab Network. But another really important factor to combating antibiotic resistance is convincing people that something can be done. “Buy in,” Kallen said. ""Before it was, 'We are never going to get rid of AR [antibiotic resistance].' But now people are starting to realize that we can reduce the impact that it has and reduce the mortality rates,."" There is a huge difference between now and eight years ago, and Kallen believes that's because people like Brennan feel empowered to do something.","There is a version of the near future where antibiotic resistant bacteria become more deadly than cancer.

Elyse Wanshel,"Comedian Rob Delaney got candid about grief on Christmas.
In February, the 41-year-old “Catastrophe” star announced that his 2-year-old son Henry had died in January after being diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016. In 2017, doctors successfully removed the tumor, but the cancer returned.
On Wednesday, Delaney wrote a heartbreaking thread on Twitter about spending the holidays without Henry for the first time, and he didn’t sugarcoat his feelings.
“Our first Christmas without Henry came &amp; went,” wrote Delaney, who has two other sons with his wife, Leah. “The day itself was okay, maybe because there were so many horrible, painful days leading up to it; we must have hit our quota or something. We talked about him a lot &amp; included his memory throughout the day.”

BARRY MEIER,"But it is also an uncomfortable truth that public officials and plaintiffs lawyers, by failing to use lawsuits to hold the opioid industry to account, have allowed a containable crisis to mushroom into catastrophe. Repeatedly, they ended lawsuits quickly for the sake of political and financial expediency rather than digging out information that would have alerted the public to the dangers of these drugs.
Consider the case of Florida, which in 2001 became one of the first states to investigate Purdue Pharma. Its attorney general at the time, Robert Butterworth, pointing to a growing number of overdose deaths, declared that he would discover when Purdue Pharma first knew about OxyContins abuse.
That never happened. Instead, state investigators interviewed only a single former OxyContin sales representative, and Mr. Butterworth, who was running for a State Senate seat, ended the case soon after it was filed.
He lost his election and the cases settlement proved empty. While Purdue Pharma agreed to pay $2 million to fund a system that would monitor how Florida doctors prescribed opioids, state legislators blocked its creation. David Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, told me that nearly all of the $2 million was returned to the drug company and Florida went on become a major center of the opioid crisis.
The decision by Justice Department officials in 2007 to forgo felony charges against the executives of Purdue Pharma also resulted in the loss of a critical chance to slow the epidemics trajectory. Without a public trial, doctors remained unaware about the extent of Purdue Pharmas deceptions and increasingly prescribe opioids. During the five years that followed the Justice Department settlement, 80,000 people died from overdoses involving pain pills, federal data shows.",State and local governments are giving up opportunities to hold the drug industry accountable for Americans’ overdose deaths.,2018-12-26T11:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Opioid Makers Are the Big Winners in Lawsuit Settlements,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/opioids-lawsuits-purdue-pharma.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/26/opinion/26meier/26meier-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0

Meanwhile 
The Geneva show, dating from 1905, is among the last of a dying breed: a truly glamorous and fantastical display of nearly a million square feet of automotive flights of fancy. Other shows in Frankfurt, Detroit, New York and Paris have evolved into somewhat more utilitarian displays of automotive ideas for the masses.
Geneva offers no such pretense; if the world is headed for climate catastrophe in the foreseeable future, the Geneva show will go down, like the band on the Titanic, playing for time. For now, business remains brisk.
Though no match for the Bugatti stand which included two other vehicles presold for multiple millions of dollars the shows other exhibitors feature a plethora of seven-figure offerings. The Italian design house Pininfarina unveiled its first branded road car, the 1,900-horsepower Battista, named for its founder. The company claims it, too, is presold, despite an asking price of $2 million. More could be available by 2021, a news release noted.
Other so-called hypercars were unveiled by the likes of Pagani, Koenigsegg, McLaren, Aston Martin, Zenvo and Ferrari. Exclusive special editions were shown by Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini and a host of others. There was also a concept of a flying car.

Cory Doctorow,"Last week's catastrophic EU vote to censor and surveil the whole internet to catch copyright infringers isn't a local affair; the same corporations who were willing to sacrifice the internet to eke out a few percentage point gains in licensing revenue are busily at work in Canada, where a rewrite of copyright laws is underway. Canada's copyright extremists have revived their longstanding call for an ""Ipod tax"" -- a tax on phones, hard drives, and other devices capable of storing copyrighted works that will be used to subsidise the arts (an arts subsidy is a terrific idea, but paying for it by levying devices that are vital to participation in 21st century life on the grounds that they're sometimes used for entertainment purposes is a really shitty way to go about it). They've got a new demand: that the monopolistic Canadian telcoms sector would create a national censorship board that would unilaterally block websites that the entertainment industry disliked, without court oversight or due process. Don't count on Trudeau's Liberal Party to get internet policy right: the party has a long, shameful history of ignoring experts in favour of US lobbyists on copyright, and Trudeau himself presided over the lowest moment in Canadian internet history. The government is also in the messy process of renegotiating NAFTA, where U.S. officials are pushing for numerous overreaching copyright regulations. These include extending Canada’s copyright terms by up to 25 years—a change that experts estimate would cost the Canadian economy millions of dollars every year—and forcing a new notice-and-takedown system that would compel Canadian Internet service providers (ISPs) to block entire websites from the Internet for alleged copyright infringement without proper judicial oversight. Finally, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is expected to issue its decision any day now on a widely criticized proposal from Bell to create a government-backed censorship committee that would force Canada’s ISPs to block websites, again without court oversight. (Maclean’s is owned by Rogers, a competitor to Bell.)

MARK LANDLER,"Mr. Trump delighted in his role as the dismantler of Democratic legacies: he boasted of eliminating a very unpopular provision of Obamacare, withdrawing the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, and renegotiating the catastrophe known as Nafta.
As for how the Republicans and Democrats might work together, Mr. Trump revived his proposal for infrastructure legislation, calling it not an option but a necessity. But he offered no details and breezed through the proposal, which is less popular among Republicans, in barely three lines, half as much time as he gave his campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs.
Even Mr. Trumps conciliatory phrases carried a partisan sting. He said, for example, the agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda, using a shortened form of Democratic that some Republicans favor as a mild slur against the opposing party.
For a president whose party lost 40 seats in the House three months ago, and who just lost a battle with Ms. Pelosi over the 35 day government shutdown, Mr. Trump behaved like the insurgent who rode into Washington two years ago with a Congressional majority and a mandate to upend the establishment.
He claimed credit for a long list of economic and national security achievement, some of which were almost comically exaggerated. If I had not been elected president of the United States, he said, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.
In addressing Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump found himself in an identical position to his three predecessors, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton facing a hostile Congress after a devastating midterm defeat.

Catie Keck,"Following a catastrophic fire in September that destroyed millions of priceless items at the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, Google has unveiled a project that preserved some of those precious artifacts and can now be explored through Google Street View. Googles Arts &amp; Culture team began collaborating with the museum on taking its collection digital back in 2016, Program Manager Chance Coughenour wrote in a Google blog on Thursday. That catalog is now available online for users globally to revisit some of the rich cultural heritage that was housed in the museums massive collection. The fire that tore through the museum earlier this year devastated 200 years of precious items. Among the those lost in the fire were dinosaur bones, remains of the oldest human found in the Americas known as Luzia (some of which were able to be recovered ), Egyptian artifacts, and numerous other scientifically and culturally significant items. Luiz Duarte, a vice director at the museum, described the incident at the time as an unbearable catastrophe. President Michel Temer of Brazil tweeted that the loss of the museums collection was incalculable for Brazil. Since the fire in September, more than 1,500 items have been recovered from the debris, and plans for beginning the slow process of restoring the museum are reportedly already underway. The museums director Alexander Kellner said its important to stress that the National Museum, despite having lost a significant part of its collection, has not lost its ability to generate knowledge.

Taylor Hatmaker,"The newly minted social media star congresswoman is wasting no time in tearing into tech companies.
In a recent letter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Maine representative Chellie Pingree in calling out tech companies for supporting an event they believe to be inconsistent with big tech’s ostensibly climate-friendly attitude. Ocasio-Cortez is a noted champion of a Democratic package of sweeping environmental reforms called the Green New Deal a term we can expect to hear a lot more leading into 2020.
The letter, addressed to Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai, expresses that the representatives were “deeply disappointed” to see that these companies sponsored a recent D.C. conference that featured a talk “denying established science on climate change” at a recent libertarian conference called LibertyCon.
LibertyCon appears to have hosted at least one group on the wrong side of the scientific consensus around climate change. That group, the CO2 Coalition, reportedly promoted the “good news” about carbon emissions with handouts promoting the supposed positive effects of the noxious gases on agriculture. A member of the group, Caleb Rossiter, spoke on a panel titled “Lets Talk About Not Talking: Should There Be No Debate that Industrial Carbon Dioxide is Causing Climate Catastrophe?”
As the letter reads:
“We understand that sponsorship of an event or conference is a common occurrence and that these sponsorships do not automatically indicate that the company endorses the variety of political viewpoints that may be presented at these events. However, given the magnitude and urgency of the climate crisis that we are now facing, we find it imperative to ensure that the climate-related views espoused at LibertyCon do not reflect the values of your companies going forward.
As you are well aware, the spreading of misinformation can be dangerous to our society. Today’s coordinated campaign to deny climate change, or put a positive spin on its effects, is not unlike that of the tobacco companies which once sought to discredit their product’s link to cancer… We cannot afford to make the same mistake again with climate change.
We look forward to hearing from you in the hope that we can continue to count on you as allies in the fight for a more sustainable future.”
As Mother Jones reported, Google contributed something in the ballpark of $25,000 for the event, with Facebook and Microsoft chipping in around $10,000 each.","The newly minted social media star congresswoman is wasting no time in tearing into tech companies.

Cory Doctorow,"The Internet of Things morphed from a ridiculous answer in search of a problem (""why do I want my fridge connected to the internet?"") to a source of Black Mirror-style modern absurdities (""someone pushed a load of internet porn to my fridge"") to an existential threat (""my fridge just joined a world-killing botnet""). As these problems have manifested, they've spawned manifestoes, by designers, security experts, privacy activists, and other concerned parties tried to steer the phenomenon to better outcomes. In Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos, a CHI 2019 paper from Irina Shklovski, Rachel Douglas-Jones and Ester Fritsch of Copenhagen's IT University ( Sci-Hub mirror ), a trio of researchers trace the evolution of 28 of these manifestos, from 1991 to the present, and analyze their trajectory as an example of the burgeoning field of computer ethics. Finally, what are the less ons here for HCI? The manifestos analyzed in this paper share a common purpose: to find ways to relate to an intangible and rapidly developing technological world they are themselves part of creating. Their social imagination forms an important source of data for HCI research, and a lively point of engagement between academic and practitioner discourse. IoT manifestos emerging from design communities create IoT as a matter of care [2] for practitioner communities, with the authors of these documents assembling for diverse and overlapping concerns, loudly sharing their uncertainties. Th is amplificatory tone makes public a space for caring for the future, clears the ground to make innumerable crossroads visible: choices of the everyday concerning connectivity, security and privacy, but also crossroads that face new geographies of exclusion. Authors of manifestos hope to see their words become actions – they are closely attentive to the “how” of their exhortations. If there is a revolution, its character appears in these manifestos as one of responsibilities. There is opportunity here for HCI to follow the circulation both of manifestos and their authors, attending to the spaces they make in order to express their concern and create spheres of care (whilst attending to the politics of responsibility and responsibilisation). As Light et al. [20] suggest HCI scholars need to expand our boundaries for caring and attending to our relations. As these manifestos move through the world, it is a task of our own future work to engage the communities that create them, and to remain attentive to their post-publication lives as they are circulated, and deployed in sites where their manifesto commitments meet the complexities of the world. Manifestos offer a way in for action research and a multitude of roadmaps for how HCI scholars might theorise about and design for responsibility while attending carefully to the perils of responsibilisation.

Nick Stockton,"Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, Donald Trump flew to Puerto Rico, toured a relatively affluent neighborhood there, and expressed his relief that the storm had not been “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina. He jokingly chided Puerto Ricans for throwing the federal budget a “little out of whack.” In reality, Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, and the federal disaster response on the island was, at that point, a fraction of what residents of Florida and Texas had received during the same hurricane season. The government of Puerto Rico recently published a report estimating the storm's death toll at 1,427 people, more than 20 times the previous estimate. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the storm and its aftermath ultimately killed more than 4,000. If the federal government’s response to Maria was a scandal, the tech industry’s initial reaction seemed, comparatively, like a source of hope. In the days after the disaster, a small groundswell of private tech enthusiasm furthered the notion that Puerto Rico ought to become a test bed for renewable, distributed, climate-­resilient infrastructure. Companies like Alphabet and Tesla, which were already working on the island, looked like they might be poised to make this idea a reality. Later, a different set of tech entrepreneurs descended on Puerto Rico as well, enticed by tax breaks to advance other, more esoteric techno-​utopian visions. Here’s a progress report on how tech has, and hasn’t, managed to come to Puerto Rico’s rescue. Alphabet For years, Alphabet’s X (formerly known as Google X) has been working on a project called Loon, which provides cell service to remote areas via giant balloons. And it just so happened that one of the company’s two launch facilities for those signal-­slinging balloons was located in Ceiba, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast. So the company deployed a handful of the floating antennas, blanketing the island with text and data service for more than 250,000 customers of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T for four months while parts of the electrical grid were down. Tesla Two weeks after the storm, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla had a track record of building decentralized electrical infrastructure—independent solar and battery systems—on small islands. “There is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” he said. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” Since then, updates have come mostly in the form of more tweets. In April, Musk reported that “Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at 662 locations in Puerto Rico.” Then in June he tweeted, “We have about 11,000 projects underway” on the island. Tesla has declined to clarify what that means or how many Puerto Ricans are served by those projects. The Blockchain Crowd Over the past year, about 150 cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have settled on the island, according to Giovanni Mendez, a tax lawyer who has helped many of them. They’ve been drawn in part by incentives, passed in 2012, that give tax exemptions for capital gains and passive income to individuals who spend at least half their year on the island, and by an amendment, passed just months before Hurricane Maria, that eased requirements on US companies to hire Puerto Rican residents. One of the new arrivals was the cryptocurrency guru and former child actor Brock Pierce, who promptly said he was setting out to build a utopian community—perhaps even a whole new city—on the island, to the ire of many Puerto Ricans.

Jason Schreier,"When Final Fantasy XIV first launched, in 2010, it was such a disaster that publisher Square Enix made the unprecedented move of taking it offline and launching a brand new version three years later. What was it like to be there? Today on Kotaku Splitscreen, we discuss. Michael-Christopher Koji Fox, who heads up the translation department for the Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, joins the show to talk about how he joined Square on the day it became Square Enix way back in 2003, his work on both Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, and what it was like being part of the catastrophic launch and subsequent rejuvenation of Square’s biggest MMORPG. Listen here: Get the MP3 right here, or read an excerpt: Michael-Christopher Koji Fox: Getting to work on the original [ Final Fantasy ] XIV was for me really exciting at the beginning, because when I joined [ Final Fantasy ] XI, all the groundwork had been done. The style had already been decided, the characterizations had already been decided, the world was already built. I was just hired to translate the text. Whereas with [ Final Fantasy ] XIV, it was my opportunity to get in from the ground floor, and work with the world-building team, and the scenario teams to create this world and create things like the dragon language, which I got a chance to create from the ground up, or create the naming conventions for the characters and languages and backgrounds and things like that. Getting a chance to decide on characterizations, and the directions some of these stories might go was really exciting to me. But at the same time, being there and seeing how the game development was going, and kinda realizing that, ‘OK this might not be good,’ and then fully realizing, ‘OK this is not gonna be good.’ But then coming to that realization that ‘OK, it doesn’t matter what the project is doing right now, I need to concentrate on my section,’ so trying to get at least a great localization out there. Then comes the launch, then comes the blowback from fans, then the change in leadership over here. It was a whirlwind. People were frustrated, some people were leaving the project, some people were depressed about what had happened, they’d put two or three years of their lives into this and it’d come to this. And then [ A Realm Reborn director Naoki] Yoshida-san comes in and gives us all a new hope, he gives us this vision, takes the reigns and turn things around. I’d never been part of anything like that, where you’re so dedicated to something, you see it come crashing down, and then you see someone come in and bring it back up. And it wasn’t just him bringing it up, it was him telling us that we could do it, and us believing in that, and following him, and really bringing it back. There were major ups and downs. Literally very depressed for a long amount of time, going home on the last train, so I’d take a train at 12:30, go home at maybe two in the morning, and literally be back on a train five hours later, coming into work for the next day, times three or four weeks of crunch, only to see the worst reviews you’d ever seen, and thinking ‘Oh my god,’ but then getting a second chance. Doing the exact same thing, staying late, but not feeling bad about it knowing that you’re taking things in the right direction. Just getting a chance to do that has been exciting, and it’s been a growing experience for me. No longer can I take things for granted, because I know that the minute you stop putting 100% in, the same thing could happen again, so you’re always on your toes now.

Tom McKay,"Earlier today, a flight that had left Dubai in the United Arab Emirates landed at JFK International Airport in New York with 549 passengers and crew on board—and was promptly quarantined due to a mysterious ailment spreading throughout the cabin. In the neighborhood of 100 people on board showed symptoms including coughing, fever, and vomiting, though only 11 ended up being taken to hospitals for evaluation. Centers for Disease Control staff, working with regional authorities and Customs and Border Patrol officials, later said it had “completed health evaluations (including taking temperatures)” of all on board and cleared the vast majority to move forward with their days. Apparently among those given the green light was none other than recording artist Robert Matthew Van Winkle, who is almost certainly much better known under his stage name Vanilla Ice. Ice tweeted updates from the plane as emergency personnel converged around it on the tarmac at JFK: Ice had previously tweeted he was going to Dubai. One of his tour managers, Chuck Quon, confirmed to Gizmodo via email that Ice was on the plane but exhibited no symptoms: I can verify that he was on the plane, and was released with all the other passengers that did not exhibit any symptoms. I have no other information about the situation beyond that. Also, he is not in NY any longer. He has already flown home. Ice is widely familiar as the one-hit-wonder rapper behind the 1989 song “Ice Ice Baby” and his subsequent career on reality TV, the latter of which resulted in his arrest for burglary in 2015. So his presence on the flight triggered lots of jokes that Ice could be JFK’s unlikely protagonist in the event the mysterious ailment was a world-ending plague or some other catastrophe: Health officials are still attempting to determine what the cause of the symptoms exhibited by the passengers was. But according to CNN, they have pinned the most likely contagion as a form of influenza. Passengers told the network that numerous individuals on the plane were exhibiting symptoms prior to boarding, contesting Dubai officials’ belief that it was food poisoning. Authorities are also considering the possibility it was a more serious ailment like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) “out of an abundance of caution,” CNN wrote. The CDC wrote on its website that only two MERS-CoV cases have previously been confirmed in the U.S. and it has mostly spread in health care environments, though warned that “most people infected with MERS-CoV developed severe respiratory illness.” The condition can be fatal, so for the sake of everyone, let’s hope that this is just the flu.","Earlier today, a flight that had left Dubai in the United Arab Emirates landed at JFK International Airport in New York with 549 passengers and crew on board—and was promptly quarantined due to a mysterious ailment spreading throughout the cabin.

A promising program designed to remove big money from politics and increase the impact of small donors on elections may be careening toward catastrophe in the courts.
Last Monday, the Washington Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Seattles democracy vouchers, an innovative public financing scheme thats already spreading to other cities. The measure has already allowed more young people, women, racial minorities, and low-income voters to contribute to candidates. But state courts have taken the constitutional challenge to the program seriouslyand the U.S. Supreme Court may eventually conclude that the law violates the First Amendment. Indeed, this case could test how much damage the courts decision in Janus v. AFSCMEwill do to campaign finance reform.
Passed in 2015 via ballot initiative, Seattles Democracy Voucher Program marks an effort to amplify the voices of nonwealthy Americans in city elections. The law imposes a tax on Seattle homeowners (which costs the average household about $11.50 a year), then places the money in a pot used to fund campaign finance vouchers. Each election cycle, every voter receives four $25 vouchers that they can contribute to certain candidates. (Citizens and green card holders who do not vote can also obtain vouchers.) To qualify for voucher funding, a candidate must first gather $10 donations from at least 400 Seattle voters to prove their candidacy is viable. They must then commit to accepting no cash donation over $250. (Candidates who eschew voucher funding can take donations up to $500.)
The purpose of the program is to democratize campaign spending without running afoul of the First Amendment. Thanks to Supreme Court decisions like Citizens Unitedand McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, affluent citizens and corporations can flood elections with huge sums of cash, leading lawmakers to prioritize their interests over those of ordinary Americans. Reformers hope that democracy vouchers will make politicians more responsive to average voters, since everyone in the electorate is a potential contributor.
So far, the program has been a moderate success, according to a study by the pro-voucher nonprofit Every Voice. In 2017, the first election cycle using the new scheme, 18,000 Seattle residents gave candidates about 70,000 of the $25 vouchers. The number of new donors skyrocketed: 84 percent had not donated to a campaign in the previous two elections, and among the new donors, 71 percent used vouchers. At least 25,000 Seattleites provided donations, about three times more than the 8,200 residents who donated in 2013. Women, young people, people of color, and non-affluent residents were more likely to contribute through vouchers. The only hitch is that an enormous number of voters96.7 percentdid not use their vouchers, suggesting that the city needs to do a better job educating residents about the program.
If its allowed to continue, that is. In June 2017, the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit in state court to block the measure, asserting that it infringes upon the First Amendment. A superior court dismissed the suit in November 2017, but PLF appealed. In an unusual move, the appeals court declined to rule, instead sending the case directly to the Washington Supreme Court, declaring that it presented a fundamental and urgent issue of broad public import requiring swift resolution. The justices agreed and took the case, Elster v. City of Seattle; they will hear arguments in the new year.
The Washington Supreme Courts apparent desire to decide Elster ASAP should be troubling for reformers. As one of the PLF attorneys on the case, Ethan Blevins, has noted, it seems likely that the justices are concerned that the U.S. Supreme Courts Janus decision could render the vouchers constitutionally suspect. In Janus, the court ruled that states may not compel non-union members in the public sector to help finance collective bargaining. These mandatory dues, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, compel nonmembers to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern in violation of the First Amendment.
PLF asserts that Seattles Democracy Voucher Program similarly compels property owners to bankroll speech they do not wish to support. It adds that the law disfavors minority viewpoints by distributing money at the whim of majoritarian interests. And, PLF insists, the law discriminates against voters who support candidates who will not or cannot accept voucher funds.
These arguments have a major flaw: In 1976s Buckley v. Valeo, the U.S. Supreme Court held that public finance systems are constitutional, since they enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process, First Amendment values that are vital to a self-governing people. The court permitted a plan that, like Seattles, gives more money to candidates with robust grassroots support. Since then, federal courts have upheld comparable city and state laws that provide public financing to candidates who meet a donation threshold independently and agree to certain conditions, like refusing large contributions. No court has ruled that such a scheme disfavors minority viewpoints.
That doesnt mean Seattle is off the hook. In Janus, after all, the Supreme Court overturned a precedent nearly as old as Buckley. And PLF clearly wants to frame Elster as a Janus-like attack on public financing. The group claims that the Democracy Voucher Program compels landlords to subsidize the speech of renters, much like the law in Janus compelled nonmembers to subsidize the speech of unions. A majority of Seattle residents rent their property, yet only landlords must pay the tax that funds the voucher scheme. As a result, PLF writes, Seattle imposes the burden of funding renters political speechin the form of voucherssolely on the shoulders of landlords and other property owners.
The conservative justices could use Elster to chip away at public financing much as they used Janus to kneecap labor rights.
There are, however, key distinctions between the Seattle law and the union dues cases. In Janus, nonmembers had to pay money directlyto the union; here, the government collects a tax, then lets voters decide how to use the funds. And while the dues in Janus exclusively subsidized union representation, the voucher tax subsidizes a broad array of political speech. The Seattle program does not favor or disfavor any viewpoint; all voters obtain the same number of vouchers, and all candidates are free to compete for them. If the Seattle law is unconstitutional, then so is any public finance scheme that awards money to candidates whove demonstrated more popular support. That includes the presidential public finance law, which matches small contributions a candidate receives during the primary and gives more money to major party nominees than third-party candidates.
But this Supreme Court is not afraid to overturn precedent, no matter what Susan Collins thinks. Just days after deciding Janus, the court indicated that it might overturn a unanimous 1990 decision allowing private bar associations that regulate the legal profession to collect dues from lawyers. If the progressive Washington Supreme Court upholds the Democracy Voucher Program, PLF will surely appeal to SCOTUS, where theyll have better odds. The conservative justices could use Elster to chip away at public financing much as they used Janus to kneecap labor rights, preserving wealthy Americans ability to drown out small donors with a torrent of cash.
The First Amendment was meant for better things. Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Austin, Texas, are already planning to implement democracy vouchers via ballot initiative, and reformers have embraced the idea as a response to big money corrupting politics. Voters who use the vouchers seem to like them; one told the Seattle Times, It feels like Im more a part of the system. People like me can contribute in ways that we never have before. The Democracy Voucher Program isnt about discriminating against landlords. Its about improving self-governance by helping more Americans participate in elections. If the Supreme Court thinks thats unconstitutional, it has forgotten why the First Amendment exists in the first place.

"Opinion contributor, Jan Brewer, Opinion contributor","President Donald Trumps warning that U.S. border crossings with Mexico may need to be closed to allow our law enforcement professionals a chance to regain control of the border has finally gotten the attention of Democrats and the mainstream news media.
Where was this interest when the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the men and women on the front lines spent months trying to get peoples attention?
Where were Democratic politicians like Jeh Johnson, the Obama DHS secretary, when the first so-called caravans of illegal aliens began throwing themselves against our border?
Johnson was busy telling us that there was no emergency, that President Trump was just reaching for exercises in presidential authority and trying to send a message to voters, even while  admitting that he once oversaw the same practices his co-partisans spin as family separation.
Where were CNNs liberal commentators when border  crossings started rocketing out of control?
They were busy mocking the situation,  claiming there was no crisis and accusing administration officials of responding inhumanely to the disaster.

Now, both  Johnson  and CNNs Chris Cuomo see that there is a crisis after all. Its not a moment too soon; the system is cracking under the strain and, with ever-larger caravans marching north, there is no sign of respite.
Yet, some evidently think the extraordinary thing isnt that our immigration system is on the verge of collapse, or that bad policy is  forcing us to release thousands of aliens into our communities, but that President Trump would consider shutting down the border until he can get commitments from Congress and his counterparts in Mexico and Central America to help him address the crisis.
Of course the president should consider shutting down the border. If denying crossings finally emphasizes the seriousness of this humanitarian catastrophe and spurs those  enabling it to take action, it cant come soon enough.

The president’s tweets are often misogynistic, can drip with racial animus, and single out private citizens for intimidation. According to the White House, Trump’s utterances are “official statements” even when he’s retweeted murder videos and threatened North Korea with nuclear annihilation (“… they won’t be around much longer!”). Twitter says it allows the president to stretch its terms of service because he’s “newsworthy” and “of public interest.” Or maybe it’s because, by one analyst’s estimate, Trump’s twitter account is worth $2 billion in market value to the struggling company. Trump and his intrigues—Russia, women, taxes, court picks—are certainly social-media catnip. Let’s hope disaster doesn’t follow.

Hussein Ibish,"Violence is intensifying in Gaza as the United States opens its new embassy in Jerusalem, a convergence of current politics and long-simmering tensions in the region. Israeli forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing dozens and wounding hundreds more, Palestinian officials said. May 14 marks the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding; May 15 is a day Palestinians know as their nakba, or “catastrophe,” the traumatic expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in 1948 by Israelis. This event both defined their future of statelessness and occupation, and now forms the basis for their distinct national identity. Many of the chief consequences of the nakba, including the displacement of most Palestinians from their ancestral lands and ongoing statelessness, remain unresolved to this day. This helps explain the enduring violence between Israelis and Palestinians, which flared up most recently on the border with Gaza. Beginning on March 30, a series of Friday protests billed the “Great March of Return” have seen thousands of mainly unarmed young men confront Israeli forces and border guards. They are blocking these men from the nearby villages, located in what is now Israel, from which many of their families were displaced in the 1940s. At least 37 protesters have died, and over 4,000 injured, in the unrest. These demonstrations, which will culminate on the 15th, combined with the opening of a U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, may well become yet another historic flashpoint. And even if the worst does not come to pass this time, sooner or later, it will. Until we come to grips with the political and cultural legacy of the nakba, calm, stability, and normality will elude Israel and the rest of the Middle East. To understand the nakba is to first confront its sheer scale and totality. Before the nakba, there was a large, deeply rooted, and essentially ancient Arab society in most of what, within a few months, became the Jewish state of Israel. In effect, one day it was there, as it had been for living memory, and the next day it was gone. An entire society, with the exception of relatively small groups in a few places, simply vanished. After World War I, the League of Nations broke the Ottoman Empire up into territories assigned to different colonial powers. The lands that today constitute Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories were placed under British rule, but with two explicit and incompatible purposes: Britain was already committed to supporting the recently established Zionist movement that sought to create “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. The mandate reaffirmed that goal, but did not define what a “national home,” such as a Jewish state, meant in practice. Yet the terms of the Covenant of the League of Nations held that the purpose of mandates was to secure the “well-being and development” of the people living in those territories. The problem was that just under 90 percent of the population of Palestine in 1922, when the British mandate was formally initiated, were Arab Muslims and Christians, with Jews, in many cases recent arrivals, constituting 11 percent. In other words, the project of providing “tutelage” to the people of the territory and preparing them for independence was at stark odds with the project of transforming Palestine into a “national home for the Jewish people,” however that was defined. In both Britain’s 1917 Balfour Declaration and the Palestine mandate, the overwhelming Palestinian majority was simply referred to as “existing non-Jewish communities,” with “civil and religious rights,” but not political ones. This meant the British colonial overlords were almost always at odds with both the local Arab population, and also frequently with Jewish leaders. But by the time the British Mandate began to fall apart after World War II, the population of the territory had been transformed: 68 percent were Arabs and 32 percent were Jews (about two-thirds of whom were born abroad ). The fledgling United Nations proposed to partition the territory between Arabs and Jews, but even in the proposed Jewish state, gerrymandered to include the maximum number of Jews, there was a virtual Arab plurality. Even after decades of immigration, it still wasn't possible to carve out a significant portion of Palestine with a solid Jewish majority. The Arabs, and especially Palestinians, angrily rejected partition on the grounds that the overwhelming majority of the people of the country did not wish to see their land divided and more than half of it given to the sovereignty of the Jewish minority who, at the time, made up one-third of the population. Many others were expected to arrive at some future date, all against the wishes of the large majority. Violence between the two communities, and between both and the British authorities, grew common throughout the 1930s and ’40s, including a fully fledged Arab revolt from 1936 to 1939. But as it became clear that Britain was simply going to leave Palestine in 1948, both sides began jockeying for position. Communal violence broke out into open warfare in the fall of 1947. This set the stage for the nakba. Fighting intensified in January 1948, and the Palestinian exodus began. Up to 100,000 Palestinians, mainly from the upper and middle classes, fled the cities and towns which were the epicenter of the fighting. Until then, expulsions were rare. But in April 1948, the Jewish forces launched a more concerted campaign of massacre and forced displacement, including the notorious Deir Yassin massacre of about 100 Palestinians on April 9. This spread panic among Palestinians, encouraging them to flee. When terror didn’t do the trick, Palestinians were forced out by Jewish militias. Early April saw the launch of the “ Plan Dalet ” military campaign, which sought, in part, the ethnic cleansing of most or all of the Arab inhabitants from areas claimed for a Jewish state. As the British withdrew from Palestine in early May 1948, Israel declared its establishment, and the war intensified with the intervention of several Arab armies. The process of Palestinian displacement also intensified. Yitzhak Rabin, then a young Jewish commander, would later write in his memoir of how he was ordered by David Ben-Gurion—literally with the wave of a hand—to “drive out” the 50,000 civilians in the towns of Lydda and Ramla on June 10 and 11. When the dust settled, the overwhelming majority of Palestinian Arabs, perhaps 700,000 to 800,000 people, had either fled or been expelled. The Palestinians who remained in what was now a Jewish state made up around 18 percent of the population of Israel, and for the next 20 years lived under martial law. The society the Palestinians had composed over the centuries was, for the most part, now gone. Towns and villages were renamed or bulldozed. Property was expropriated en masse through various legal mechanisms. And, most importantly, whether Palestinians fled or were expelled, virtually none were allowed to return. Most Palestinians who left their homes in 1947 and 1948 believed they would one day come back when the fighting stopped, no matter what the outcome. This was a complete delusion. They were gone, and the new Israeli state regarded their absence as the godsend that allowed a Jewish-majority country to suddenly emerge. This, in brief, is the Palestinian nakba, the collapse and disappearance of an entire society that was politically, militarily, and culturally unprepared for the collision with Zionism, colonialism, and war. But the nakba defined, and continues to define, Palestinian national identity. At the time of the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Arab nationalism was running strong. The Muslims and Christians in the territories that were about to become mandatory Palestine overwhelmingly identified as Arabs, but not yet as an ethno-national Palestinian community. They had warmly welcomed the creation of the first, short-lived, pan-Arab state in 1920, before it was crushed by the French. At that time, many if not most Palestinians saw themselves as Arabs and essentially “southern Syrians.” But once that early Arab state ended, they were, in effect, on their own. They had little choice but to begin defining themselves chiefly as Palestinians. While Palestinians do have cultural features that distinguish them from other Arabs, it is their history and, above all, the nakba and its never-ending aftermath, that firmly separates them from all other Arabs. All Palestinians, including those left behind in Israel, shared this experience. And given that most Palestinians today are either exiles, refugees, or living under Israeli occupation—or, at best, live as second-class citizens of Israel itself—their collective social, political, and historical identity centers almost entirely around the shattering experience of the nakba. No other group of Arabs endured this. Historians can and do debate who is at fault for this debacle. But it’s irrefutable that Palestinians didn’t merely lose their putative state and political power. At an individual and familial level, they lost their homes and property, in almost all cases for good. Collectively, they lost their society, and were condemned to live as exiles or stateless subjects under the rule of a foreign military. They had a society, and then they didn’t. The rupture of the nakba cannot be mended. The state of Israel is a reality that will not disappear. Most Palestinians fetishize the right of return, and from a moral and legal perspective, their case is irrefutable. But politically, there is no chance of any such return, except in tiny, symbolic numbers. After decades of fruitless struggle and brutality on all sides, Palestinians have somewhat bitterly come to accept that the nakba cannot be reversed or even really redressed. They accepted that a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state based in the territories Israel occupied in 1967 living alongside the Jewish state, was the only available outcome. But even that has proven unattainable. The trauma of the nakba cannot be addressed until the rest of the world, and particularly Israel, recognizes its validity and importance. The event does not compare to the Holocaust—very little else does. But Jews and Palestinians are two peoples both marked by definitive historical traumas that define their worldviews. The difference is that the Jewish and Israeli narratives continue to an epiphany of redemption in the founding and flourishing of the state of Israel, while for Palestinians, permanently dispossessed and living in exile or under occupation, the trauma is enduring and still unfolding. This is especially true in Gaza, which has become a wretched open-air prison for almost 2 million densely packed residents. The humanitarian crisis and pervasive despair there are so dire that even Israeli security officials regard Gaza as a ticking bomb of human misery. If it does not explode on May 15, it will soon. Hence the nakba is not so much a historical memory for most Palestinians, as a daily, lived experience.

AHMED ABU RATIMA,"What has happened since we started the Great Return March is both what I hoped and expected — and not. It was not a surprise that Israel responded to our march with deadly violence. But I had not expected this level of cruelty. On the other hand, I was heartened by the commitment to nonviolence among most of my own people. A couple of years ago, people here would have dismissed the idea that peaceful demonstrations could achieve anything significant. After all, every other form of resistance has produced nothing concrete. What amazes me is the transformation we are seeing in the way we resist. Our struggle previously was between armed Palestinian fighters and Israeli snipers, tanks and F-16s. Now, it is a struggle between the occupation and peaceful protesters — men and women, young and old. The Great Return March reminds the world about the origin of the conflict — our uprooting from our lands and our lives, beginning in 1948 and sustained since then. We have chosen May 15 as the culmination of our protests because that is the day that Palestinians mark the “nakba,” the Arabic word for catastrophe, which is what we call the expulsions from our homes 70 years ago. Whatever solution we negotiate in the future to allow our two peoples to live together peacefully and equally must start with a recognition of this wrong. Still, despite the response from Israeli snipers, I continue to be committed to nonviolence, as are all of the other people “coordinating” this march. I use quotation marks because when a movement becomes this large — attracting what we estimate to be as many as 200,000 people on Fridays — it cannot be completely controlled. We discouraged the burning of Israeli flags and the attachment of Molotov cocktails to kites. We want peaceful, equal coexistence to be our message. We have also tried to discourage protesters from attempting to cross into Israel. However, we can’t stop them. It is the action of an imprisoned people yearning for freedom, one of the strongest motivations in human nature. Likewise, the people won’t go away on May 15. We are intent on continuing our struggle until Israel recognizes our right to return to our homes and land from which we were expelled. Desperation fuels this new generation. We are not going back to our subhuman existence.

Katharine Schwab,"It’s a terrifying thought that’s on its way to becoming reality, with the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets melting ever more each year. A recent study found that from 1979 to 2017, the rate of melting increased by six times.
Catastrophic sea level rise is inevitable by the end of this century, and the impact of the rising oceans on coastlines is neatly encapsulated in a striking new typeface by the Berlin-based designer Johan Elmehag.
[Image: courtesy Johan Elmehag]
Using data from the website Flood Map and data on sea level rise from National Geographic, Elmehag mapped out how the world’s coastlines would be impacted by melting ice. That map was unrecognizable, the new coasts resembling strange squiggles. While his project had originally been to create a fictitious guide for climate refugees in the year 2100, Elmehag had a surprising reaction when looking at the map.
“I started to see different letterforms in particularly exposed coastal areas,” Elmehag says. As the As and Js and Ts began to pop out at him, Elmehag began to hunt for every letter on the map, eventually creating an entire typeface, called Coastline, out of the futuristic geography.
[Image: courtesy Johan Elmehag]
It’s an entirely unorthodox way of capturing climate data. The letters don’t entirely stand alone, which makes a QR code that is placed next to the letters when using the typeface particularly helpful. Without their context, each letter looks partially shriveled and misshapen, but when you learn that Q is an island archipelago that’s been formed now that parts of northwestern India are underwater, and that F represents how the low land levels in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, will be taken back by the sea, each form takes on a perilous significance. The letter A was created from a bay in northern Italy that once held the city of Venice. The letter T is formed by Egypt’s new river delta, where Alexandria is now under water. U represents the new coastline of Mexico, which is divided in two by water.
“There are uncountable stories embedded in these letterforms,” Elmehag says. “It’s important to remember that the environment doesn’t care for borders.”
Elmehag has created a website where you can read more about the different letters and download the typeface to use yourself. If people encounter the typeface, they can use their phone camera to learn more about the typeface and rising sea levels. He’s also created 50 copies of a zine called A-Z:Coast to Coast Shore to Shore that acts as an ABC book, with each page dedicated to a letter, its description, and a corresponding map.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","During an event at the White House honoring Native American World War II veterans, President Trump referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren as 'Pocahontas.' Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said it's not a racial slur.
 USA TODAY
President Donald Trump mocked Elizabeth Warren's nearly two-week-old Instagram Live video in a pair of Sunday night tweets, again using a racially insensitive nickname to describe the Massachusetts senator.
The video, which Trump labeled a ""beer catastrophe,"" was streamed by Warren on New Year's Eve, the day she announced that she was forming an exploratory committee for a presidential run. In the video, Warren drank a beer and hugged her husband.
""If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!"" Trump said in his first tweet.
Later, Trump added, ""Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is, to her husband, 'Thank you for being here. Im glad youre here. Its their house, hes supposed to be there!""
The tweets are the latest in Trump's series of attacks against Warren, a fierce critic of the president who has called his nickname ""recycled racist name-calling.""
In response to criticism of her Native American ancestry claims, Warren released DNA test results in October, which Trump called ""bogus"" and ""phony."" The Cherokee Nation slammed her decision as ""inappropriate and wrong.""

AMY SCHOENFELD WALKER and BILL MARSH,"In his 1989 campaign for the presidency, Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, promised to be the environmental president. He vowed to strengthen the Clean Air Act and to find common ground between economic and environmental interests. After taking office, he appointed a professional conservationist to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Paradoxically, a major environmental catastrophe, and one of the largest oil spills in American history, occurred during Mr. Bushs tenure in the White House. In March 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground on Bligh Reef, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska. The spill damaged 1,500 miles of coastline, killed hundreds of thousands of marine mammals and birds, and devastated local communities. This $20 bill, dirtied with the oiled fingerprints of a worker on the cleanup effort, is just one of hundreds of objects linked to the spill that the Valdez Museum has collected. Exxon was held responsible for the disaster, and Mr. Bush was mostly spared criticism. While Congress was initially critical of the administrations slow response, the president subsequently sent many high-level officials to Alaska, including the head of the E.P.A., the transportation secretary, the commander of the Coast Guard, the interior secretary and the vice president. Ultimately, the spill is thought to have worked in his favor, as it is credited with encouraging lawmakers and the public to support amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990. But for some who were hit directly by the effects of the spill, the federal governments response was lacking. The Bush legacy in Prince William Sound is oiled beaches, sick wildlife, sick former cleanup workers, and a lot of hardships that the towns survived all costs of Americas oil dependency that have been swept under the carpet, said Riki Ott, a local resident and marine toxicologist.","Items from family, friends, college and the White House that influenced the 41st president.",2018-12-01T06:15:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",George Bush’s Life in 13 Objects,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/obituaries/george-bushs-life-in-13-objects.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/29/us/rgb1-yale-glove/rgb1-yale-glove-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0

That could put Trump in hot water, potentially amounting to a ""knowing and willful"" violation of election law. The payment, of course, being intended to persuade Daniels from detailing an alleged affair with Trump she says occurred in 2006.

BERNIE SANDERS,"The administration defends our engagement in Yemen by overstating Iranian support for the Houthi rebels. But the fact is that the relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only strengthened with the intensification of the war. The war is creating the very problem the administration claims to want to solve. The war is also undermining the broader effort against violent extremists. A 2016 State Department report found that the conflict between Saudi-led forces and the Houthi insurgents had helped Al Qaeda and the Islamic States Yemen branch deepen their inroads across much of the country. As the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, said in a recent interview, The winners are the extremist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS. Above and beyond the catastrophe that this war has created, there is the fact that American engagement there has not been authorized by Congress, and is therefore unconstitutional. Article I of the Constitution clearly states that it is Congress, not the president, that has the power to declare war. Over many years, Congress has allowed that power to ebb. That must change. In February, along with two of my colleagues, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 54, calling on the president to withdraw from the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

If its to open the border, it is an honest form of political suicide. If its more trade and foreign aid for Central America, thats a solution for the too-long term. The truth is that there is no easy fix to the challenge of the caravan, which is why Trump was so clever to make the issue his own and Democrats have been so remiss in letting him have it. The secret of Trumps politics is to mix fear and confidence the threat of disaster and the promise of protection like salt and sugar, simultaneously stimulating and satisfying an insatiable appetite. Its how all demagogues work. I have written previously that the real threat of the Trump presidency isnt economic or political catastrophe. Its moral and institutional corrosion the debasement of our discourse and the fracturing of our civic bonds. Democrats should be walking away with the midterms. That they are not is because they have consistently underestimated the presidents political gifts, while missing the deeper threat his presidency represents. Theres a lesson here worth heeding.

Eric Holthaus,"This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage. Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas. There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when. The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “ The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans—an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today. To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines—partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.” The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable. “Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.” In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century—much more quickly than previously thought. Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen. Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.) Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise. Antarctica is a giant landmass—about half the size of Africa—and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges. Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped. A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees. All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years—much too quickly for humanity to adapt. “With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says. A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica. Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole. Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed. Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of US cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios. At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map. At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings. DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior. Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today. Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path—meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years. Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode. “It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.” Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice. The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in. In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age. The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island. But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn. Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too. “If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge. This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.” And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts. Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets. Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened. “There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?” Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat. Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the US and UK governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years. Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says. Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard. He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica. “It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.” Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago. He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight. “Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.” There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives. “The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”",Rapid collapse of Antarctic glaciers could flood coastal cities by the end of this century.,2017-11-30T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Two Melting Antarctic Glaciers Could Decide the Fate of Our Coastlines,https://www.wired.com/story/two-melting-glaciers-could-decide-the-fate-of-our-coastlines/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a1f4e7f0cb1f52c24d06716/191:100/pass/glacier-TAFA.jpg,wired,Wired,catastrophe,0
THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"That absurd figure, and that condescension, are what make the study by independent researchers from Harvard and other institutions, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, so needed. After surveying random households across the island and comparing mortality rates they encountered to those before Maria, they came up with an estimated 4,645 additional deaths through the end of the year — a third of them people who died for lack of medical care. Puerto Rico has now commissioned its own study. But the very fact that the official toll was so obviously wrong reflects the disdain that has permeated the response to Maria. A death toll is a critical measure of the scale of a catastrophe, shaping both the public and official response. There is no telling how many lives could have been saved had the federal government been aware of the carnage rather than patting itself on the back. As Mayor Cruz, a sharp critic of the Trump administration’s response, said in an interview in March, Hurricane Maria opened Puerto Rican eyes “to our inequity — and our inequality.” The island, a commonwealth of the United States whose people are American citizens, remains in need of help. Parts of the island are still without electricity, thousands of residents lack shelter, and much remains in ruins. As many as 135,000 Puerto Ricans have left for the states. As reporters for The Times wrote in a major report in early May, after Maria and a preceding hurricane called Irma, “Puerto Rico all but slipped from the modern era.” When confronted with the Harvard study, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, responded with more self-congratulation, claiming that the government had responded to Maria with the largest Federal Emergency Management Agency effort ever. Yet what Puerto Rico really needs to recover is the sort of generous, urgent and long-term assistance that would come with a recognition by the states that a great calamity has befallen their fellow Americans, that these people dying from a lack of the most basic services are their countrymen, their responsibility.","A new study points to a far higher death toll from Hurricane Maria, more evidence of the Trump administration’s neglect.",2018-06-03T23:45:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Shame in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/opinion/puerto-rico-hurricane-deaths.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/04/opinion/04mon2sub/04mon2sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
"Opinion contributor, Doug LaMalfa, Opinion contributor","Firefighters battle flames at a burning apartment complex in Paradise, north of Sacramento, Calif. on Nov. 09, 2018. A rapidly spreading, late-season wildfire in northern California has burned 20,000 acres of land and prompted authorities to issue evacuation orders for thousands of people. As many as 1000 homes, a hospital, a Safeway store and scores of other structures have burned in the area as the Camp fire tore through the region. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) Wildfires will occur. The question becomes what can we do to minimize the size and effect. Recent fires have become exponentially more destructive. Fires of this size and intensity are an incredibly serious threat to our lives, property and environment, and should not be accepted as the new normal. Several factors may be at play, but improper forest fuel management is a clear problem. There is now a nearly limitless supply of fuel dead trees, drybrush and vegetation making our forests combustible as ever. There are 129 million dead trees in California. A healthy forest should have an inventory of 60 to 80 trees per acre ; ours have several hundred per acre. Common-sense forest policies that will treat overgrown lands and prevent a manageable wildfire from turning into a catastrophic inferno are long overdue. We need a streamlined process to responsibly thin forests, especially public lands. Our forestry professionals need to be out in the forests, assessing and doing their work, not spending half their time filling out paperwork, responding to activist-funded environmental litigation. We also need to reverse the loss of forest product infrastructure critical to restoration efforts, including timber harvest, hazardous fuel reduction, salvage logging, prescribed burning and the mill capacity to handle it. Trees are going to leave the forest one way or another. We can remove them responsibly ourselves, or theyll become fuel for the next catastrophic wildfire. Forest waste can become the renewable fuel that powers the electric grid and provides the wood and paper products that we use daily. These jobs should be right in our backyard. Its time to reassert our ability to limit the impact wildfires have on our communities. These fires have caused unthinkable yet, unfortunately, predictable tragedies. Allow us to be good stewards of our land once again it will save lives. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican, represents Californias 1st Congressional District, encompassing the fire-ravaged city of Paradise. You can follow him on Twitter: @ RepLaMalfa.

Cory Doctorow,"Oklahoma spent eight years under full GOP rule, with Republicans controlling the governorship and the legislature, passing a fully ALEC-compliant slate of laws that benefited the wealthy at the expense of the poor; the result has been a catastrophe for the party's fortunes in Oklahoma, to say nothing of a catastrophe for Oklahomans, whose schools are running four day weeks so teachers can made ends meet by getting a day's work at Walmart (no wonder they're on the verge of striking ); while Republican lawmakers have run amok, introducing bills demanding that creationism be taught in schools; or that protesters be bankrupted for peaceful assembly; and making the state a haven for forced-labor camps masquerading as drug rehab centers. Now the party is in total disarray as they scramble to patch the enormous holes in the state's budget without upsetting their friends in big business, especially the fossil fuel industry. The ""compromise"" position that the least reality-denying faction has come up with is to increase taxes on poor people, which will leave their corporate donors intact. That isn't playing with state Democrats, and the GOP can't pass those tax hikes without them (or without convincing Tea Party purists to hold their noses and vote for a tax hike). Meanwhile, in nearby Minnesota, a suite of redistributive, semi-socialist policies have created an economic miracle of growth and prosperity. It's true: reality has a well-known left-wing bias. Although the candidates represent different wings of the party, all of them agree about the depth of the problem. And while none of them want to use the word “tax,” several talk about replacing some of the revenue that has been cut in recent years. That replacement money could scarcely come from any other source except taxes. The only GOP candidate for governor who openly advocates for a tax hike is Auditor and Inspector Gary Jones, an accountant and former chairman of the state Republican Party. He’s been particularly critical of the Legislature’s decision to make permanent a generous tax incentive on new oil and gas production. Fallin signed that bill just before the price of oil plummeted in 2014. The price drop dealt another major blow to the energy-dependent economy. The drilling industry now pays an effective tax rate in Oklahoma that is far lower than in any other state, a factor cited by the teachers threatening a strike. “We’ve got to face the truth,” Jones said. “We need somebody who’s willing to tell the truth about how we got here, where we’re at and has a plan to get out.” GOP confronts another failed tax experiment in Oklahoma [AP] ( via Late-Stage Capitalism ) Trump is an excellent businessman and the Republicans are really good with money: if you doubt it, just take a gander at the Urban Institute's report on the costs and effects of Trumpcare: the US government will spend $33 billion more as a result of GOP policies, and cover 8.9 million fewer Americans, and those […] Anti-Semitic attacks rose faster in 2017 than any time in the past 40 years, The Anti-Defamation League today said.

Alex Halderman (@jhalderm) August 11, 2018 Do you see a theme here? We assume that everything is fine, that the world in which we live rests on solid foundations, that competent grown-ups are in charge of the fundamental infrastructure on which our society rests, which have been constructed as fault-tolerant, resilient systems. We assume somebody somewhere is at the switch, keeping a sharp eye on things. In some cases, such as aviation, that does indeed seem to be the case. In others, the infrastructure is too decentralized and disconnected to be seriously at risk. But in far too many others, our we have constructed a perfect-storm-in-waiting of tightly coupled networks, zero oversight, and laughable attempts at security. Authority without responsibility, in other words. And in those cases, the assumption that our structural foundations are fine is a laughable pipe dream. Reminders of this state of affairs come every month, with every infosec conference, every excited burst of news coverage following the discovery of a new high-profile hole. We patch the holes — maybe — but we don’t change our approach. At last week’s Black Hat conference, its creator Jeff Moss mused: “attackers have strategies, but defenders only seem to have tactics.” This is tacitly deliberate. We could have a strategy of hardening our collective infrastructure to improve its security, but the daunting list of upgrades (or downgrades) that would require would be ruinously expensive. This isn’t a problem unique to information security: for instance, 54,000 bridges in America need repair, too. Are we going to repair all 54,000 anytime soon? Don’t make me laugh. I’ve observed while travelling that one of the most striking differences in quality of life, between nations with comparable wealth, is simply what’s culturally acceptable. (A famous example: in Japan it is not culturally acceptable for trains to be late. In wealthier America … not so much.) The only way we’re going to harden our infrastructure, and fix our bridges, if it becomes culturally unacceptable for them not to be fixed. I don’t see that happening. Instead, in a wealthy world of increasing economic disparity, I expect us to increasingly see two-tier infrastructure; stable, secure, reliable infrastructure for the 20%, and a haphazard, kinda-mostly-functional, vulnerable tier for the 80%. “Natural monopolies” such as power grids will be replaced by e.g. private solar power and PowerWalls. At some point one of the US mobile phone provides may well decide that it’s strategically worth it to become the Apple of phone service, charging twice as much for far better service and security. Etcetera. Unless, of course, some kind of perfect storm arrives first, and our security problem turns into a genuine crisis, or even catastrophe. I’m an optimist; I don’t think that will happen. But it’s increasingly hard to ignore the possibility.","So, to recap: Satellite communication systems worldwide are “protected” by easily cracked hard-coded passwords.

SHARON OTTERMAN and ELISABETTA POVOLEDO,"To address what he called a “moral catastrophe,” Cardinal DiNardo called for a Vatican-led investigation into the abuses of Archbishop McCarrick and questions surrounding them. He also called for improved channels to report complaints against bishops, including new review bodies that would be able to operate with independence, and “substantial leadership by laity.” American Catholics have been deeply shaken by the recent abuse revelations, which come after years in which the church insisted that the problem of clergy sex abuse had largely been dealt with after reforms passed in 2002. “I’m hopeful that they will follow through with everything, but we’ll see what happens,” said Ian McMeans, 32, a churchgoing father of four who lives outside of Pittsburgh. The revelation that Cardinal McCarrick, who was first removed from ministry on June 20 after a substantiated complaint of abuse against an altar boy, was able to rise to the highest levels of the church in America despite repeated warnings that he was routinely sleeping with seminarians generated deep anger among American Catholics. Then a man, known only as James, came forward to accuse Cardinal McCarrick, a close family friend, of molesting him over two decades, beginning when he was 11. Compounding the sense of hypocrisy, Cardinal McCarrick had been a prominent voice for adopting the 2002 reforms. When the clergy sex scandal broke 16 years ago, some staunch Catholics defended the church, calling the outpouring of abuse stories anti-Catholic. This time, Catholics across the political spectrum in America are united in the belief that something must be done, prominent Catholics said. Brian Burch, the president of Catholic Vote, a Catholic organization for supporting conservative social causes, said that conservatives “understood there was a problem, and we knew that it hadn’t been totally resolved since 2002.” “But having now seen the evidence of how bad it really is, it is even worse than we thought. And this has caused an unbelievable amount of discouragement and despair on the part of the laity about what the future holds for the institution of the church.”","Responding to a grand jury report on sex abuse by clergy in Pennsylvania, the Vatican called for accountability for both abusers and those who permitted abuse to occur.",2018-08-16T23:11:13Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Vatican Calls Abuses by Pennsylvania Priests ‘Criminal and Morally Reprehensible’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/us/catholic-church-abuse-vatican-statement.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/17/us/17vatican-alpha/17vatican-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0

Rob Delaney is a father again and it's a rush of ""mixed feelings,"" he said.
The ""Catastrophe"" star told the U.K.'s ""The Sunday Times Magazine"" that his wife Leah Delaney gave birth to a son in August. The baby boy's birth came seven months after his 2-year-old son, Henry, died of brain cancer.  
""We likely wouldve had a fourth anyway, said Delaney, 41. ""But I mean, theres mixed feelings. Its sort of like they (Henry and the new baby)  touch each other a little bit, but they almost exist in separate lanes.""
Rob Delaney has revealed that his toddler son Henry died in January after battling brain cancer since 2016
 Time
Henry was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016, after his first birthday. He underwent surgery and treatment and died in January 2018.  In September, Delaney wrote a heartbreaking essay to let parents of other sick kids know they weren't so alone.
""A regular babys smile is wonderful enough,"" he wrote. ""When a sick baby with partial facial paralysis smiles, its golden. Especially if its my baby.""
Henry was the first person he told about the pregnancy, Delaney said. To the rest of the world, Delaney announced his wife was expecting another child on Twitter in June. 
The birth of another child doesn't negate the pain of losing one, he added.
""Having another child in no way, shape or form eases the grief of Henry dying. But also having Henry dying doesnt make our new son any less magical. I want to gobble him up and he deserves our full attention and love, and he grew in the same womb as Henry.""
Here's wishing the little one creates some magical moments for the Delaney family in 2019.

Associated Press,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Latest on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (all times local): 10:25 p.m. Israel says the military has delivered eight trucks full of humanitarian aid and medical supplies to the Gaza Strip, where Israeli troops firing from across the border killed nearly 60 Palestinians at mass border protests on Monday. Cogat, the military body for Palestinian civilian affairs, said Tuesday it has transferred 53 tons of medical equipment to Gaza this week, including medical fluids, bandages and physical therapy treadmills. It says fuel will be distributed later. The trucks entered Tuesday, as medical facilities in Gaza were struggling to treat hundreds of people wounded by Israeli fire the day before. Monday was the bloodiest day in Gaza since the 2014 war between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers. Dozens of people were killed and 2,700 were wounded. The protests were directed at a crippling blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007. Israel says it is defending its border and accuses Hamas of trying to carry out attacks under the cover of the protests. ___ 9:40 p.m. The Palestinian envoy to Washington has been recalled to Ramallah in protest over the U.S. relocating its embassy to Jerusalem. Husam Zomlot confirmed to The Associated Press on Tuesday that he is returning home. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki said President Mahmoud Abbas instructed Zomlot to return to Ramallah. Malki said “When they (the U.S.) opened their embassy in Jerusalem there was a need for a decision from our side and this was our decision.” The U.S relocated its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday. The fate of Jerusalem is a deeply emotional issue at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem for their future capital. They are outraged by the move and say it invalidates Washington’s role as an impartial peace broker. ___ 8:35 p.m. Israel has asked the Turkish Consul General in Jerusalem to temporarily leave the country. The move Tuesday came after the Turkish foreign ministry temporarily expelled the Israeli ambassador to protest the use of deadly force on the Gaza border and the U.S. decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem. Erdogan tweeted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “has the blood of Palestinians on his hands.” Netanyahu retorted in a statement: “Erdogan is among Hamas’s biggest supporters and there is no doubt that he well understands terrorism and slaughter. I suggest that he not preach morality to us.” ___ 8:25 p.m. The Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors at the United Nations are accusing each other’s countries of violating international law a day after Israeli troops killed more than 50 Palestinians and wounded over 2,700 at a mass protest at the Gaza border. The envoys spoke at a U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday. It ended without any joint statement or action. Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour addressed the council: “How many Palestinians have to die before you take action? … When are you going to act?” Israel says it is defending its border and accuses Gaza’s Hamas rulers of trying to carry out attacks under the cover of the protests. Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon told the council: “You must tell Hamas that violence is not the answer.” ___ 8:10 p.m. Palestinian health officials in the Gaza Strip say two Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire during protests near the border. The shootings come amid growing international uproar over the Israeli military’s use of deadly force against unarmed protesters. Over 100 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded by live fire in a series of weekly protests led by the ruling Hamas militant group. On Monday alone, nearly 60 people were killed in the deadliest day of violence since a 2014 war. Palestinians resumed their protests Tuesday, but only dozens turned out. The Health Ministry says the deaths occurred in separate incidents in central Gaza. Israel says it is defending its border and accuses Hamas of using demonstrations as cover to carry out attacks against Israeli targets. ___ 7:15 p.m. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says that Monday’s killing of more than 50 people on the Gaza border shows the need for a political solution to the conflict. The U.N. chief said during a visit to the organization’s European Union headquarters that the way out of the standoff is “a two state solution allowing Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security together.” Guterres said it was “a terrible tragedy” and said “this only shows how important it is to have a political solution ___ Chancellor Angela Merkel has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Germany feels bound by the nuclear deal with Iran — as long as Tehran upholds its side of the bargain. U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week that Washington was withdrawing from the 2015 accord, citing as one reason alleged evidence presented by Israel of Iran’s nuclear program. In a phone call Tuesday with Netanyahu, Merkel said Germany too has concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile program and its destabilizing role in the region. She condemned recent Iranian attacks against Israeli positions on the Golan Heights. Merkel also expressed concern at the violence in Gaza, but said “Germany understands Israel’s security needs.” According to her office, she added that the right to peaceful protest and assembly in Gaza shouldn’t be abused to provoke unrest. ___ 6:25 p.m. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley is telling the U.N. Security Council that no member “would act with more restraint than Israel has” in its confrontation with Palestinians at the Gaza border. Haley says the violence that left 59 Palestinians dead Monday had nothing to do with the opening of a U.S. embassy in contested Jerusalem. She says the Islamic militant Hamas extremist that rules Gaza has been inciting violence there for years. Palestinians condemned the embassy opening as taking Israel’s side in their conflict. Kuwaiti Ambassador Mansour Al-Otaibi says Israel was violating international law and that the council needs to step in to protect unarmed Palestinians. Kuwait called for the session after Monday’s deadly clash between Israeli troops and Palestinians marching on the Gaza. ___ 6:10 p.m. Thousands of people have gathered in Lebanon’s Beaufort castle near the border with Israel to mark the Jewish state’s creation 70 years ago that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes. The mostly Lebanese and Palestinians waved Palestinian flags during the ceremony outside the castle that was occupied by Israel until it withdrew in 2000 from southern Lebanon. Arabs are marking the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call their “nakba,” or catastrophe — the uprooting of hundreds of thousands in the Mideast war over Israel’s 1948 creation. Senior Hezbollah official Mohammed Raad told the crowd that the Palestinians “are not alone in the confrontation. We will continue to be with you in the battlefield and will not leave you alone.” They flew green, white, red and black balloons — the colors of the Palestinian flag — toward the Israel border. Tuesday’s protest came a day after Israeli troops killed nearly 60 people in Gaza in bloodiest day since a 2014 war with Israel. In addition, more than 2,700 people were hurt, among them 1,360 by gunshots. ___ 6 p.m. Israel’s military says at least 24 of the Palestinians killed in a mass march a day earlier at the Gaza border were militants. It said Tuesday that the gunmen had a “documented terror background” and were members of the Islamic militant Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group. It said eight Hamas operatives In one incident attempted to breach the border fence using Palestinian civilians as cover. It said they threw grenades and shot at troops who had rushed to the scene, and that its troops returned fire and killed the militants. The military said its forces prevented a “significant” attack, but did not specify how many of those it killed were armed. It released photos of grenades and a gun it said were from the scene. Israeli forces killed 59 Palestinians in Monday’s clashes. It was the bloodiest day in Gaza since the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas that rules the territory ___ 5:55 p.m. A U.N. Security Council meeting on the violence along the border between Israel and Gaza has begun with a moment of silence for the more than 50 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces on Monday, the bloodiest day there since a 2014 war. Poland’s ambassador, Joanna Wronecka, called for the gesture of remembrance in her role as current council president. Kuwait called for the session after Monday’s killings. Israel said its troops were defending its border. The Palestinian envoy wants the council to condemn the killings. Israel’s ambassador is calling for condemnation of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules the coastal strip and led the protests. ___ 5:30 p.m. South African Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has condemned the killing of Palestinians by Israeli troops as a massacre. The retired Anglican archbishop, 86, issued a statement from his Cape Town home on Tuesday about the killing of Palestinian protesters. “I am deeply distressed and broken hearted by the massacre perpetrated by the State of Israel in Gaza yesterday,” said the statement. “I pray to God to open the eyes and hearts of all citizens of the Holy Land — and of political and religious leaders across the world — to assist them to recognize our common humanity and membership of God’s family. People who recognize the humanity in others do not author or perpetrate massacres.” Tutu, who has been treated for prostate cancer and has been hospitalized several times for infections, occasionally issues statements on issues he believes are important. Last year he criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Tutu said that “God was weeping” at Trump’s decision. ___ 5:20 p.m. Belgium’s foreign minister Didier Reynders is summoning the Israeli ambassador after she indicated that all Palestinians killed in Monday’s violence were “terrorists.” Prime Minister Charles Michel said he was “shocked” by the interview with RTBF in which ambassador Simona Frankel said that those who died in Monday’s clashes “are terrorists, 55 terrorists.” Reynders said that “the comment that consisted of saying that all killed or hurt were terrorists — that we can obviously not accept.” He also took offense to the Frankel’s comment that Israeli soldiers had to act before their were casualties on their side. “There were two statements I could not accept: One on proportionality of force by saying they could not wait for Israeli casualties — there were none,” he said. ___ 4:45 p.m. Turkey’s official news agency says the country has asked Israel’s ambassador to temporarily leave Turkey. Anadolu news agency said Tuesday the Turkish foreign ministry notified Eitan Na’eh, the Israeli ambassador that “it would be appropriate for him to return to his country for some time.” The ministry summoned the ambassador to protest Israel’s use of deadly force on Palestinians and the U.S. decision to relocate its embassy there to contested Jerusalem. Turkey has also called home its ambassadors to Washington and Tel Aviv for consultations. ___ 4 p.m. Turkey says it is prepared to take in wounded Palestinians after Israeli fire killed dozens and wounded hundreds during Monday’s Gaza border protests. Speaking Tuesday, Health Minister Ahmet Demircan said Turkey’s emergency agency and the military had prepared an “air bridge” to transport wounded Gazans and were waiting for negotiations to conclude. He says the wounded are at high risk due to insufficient health care in Gaza, which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade for more than 10 years. Demircan’s comments were carried by Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency. Turkey has strongly condemned the U.S. decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and Israel’s use of deadly force on Palestinians protesting the move. The new embassy was inaugurated on Monday. ___ 3:50 p.m. Germany says it supports calls for an independent investigation into the killing of dozens of Palestinians by Israeli forces during protests in Gaza. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert says the violence “concerns us greatly and it’s terrible that so many people lost their lives, including minors.” Seibert told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that the right to peaceful protest should exist in Gaza too, but blamed the Palestinian group Hamas for firing up tensions on the day the United States unveiled its new embassy in Jerusalem. He said: “Hamas is trying to escalate the violence. That is cynical.” The U.N. Security Council is planning to meet Tuesday to discuss the violence. Germany isn’t currently a member, but it is seeking a seat in the coming term. ___ 3:40 p.m. Belgium is calling for an international investigation into Monday’s escalation in violence along the Gaza border, where Israeli soldiers shot and killed more than 50 Palestinians during mass protests. Prime Minister Charles Michel on Tuesday linked the violence on the border with the Trump administration’s decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy to contested Jerusalem despite international and Palestinian protests. Michel said the violence and killings would be moved onto the calendar of the European Union summit in Sofia on Wednesday and Thursday. Michel called the Israeli actions “unacceptable violence,” saying “there is a clear lack of proportionality and we are asking for an international investigation.” He said he was outraged by the violence, especially in contrast with the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem on the same day. He said “we knew that there was a great risk, that this decision to move the embassy would bring less security, bring tragedies, and sadly we were right.” ___ 3:30 p.m. The U.N. human rights office says Israel has repeatedly violated international norms by using deadly live fire to repel protesters from its border with Gaza, suggesting its forces should arrest anyone who reaches the fence. Office spokesman Rupert Colville reiterated calls for an independent investigation into Israel’s use of lethal force in border demonstrations in recent weeks, including the deadliest incident on Monday, when dozens were killed. Colville said rules under international law “have been ignored again and again.” He told a U.N. briefing Tuesday in Geneva: “It seems anyone is liable to be shot dead or injured: women, children, press personnel, first responders, bystanders…” Israel says it is only targeting “instigators.” Colville acknowledged Israel’s right to defend its borders, but said lethal force should be a “last resort.” “If people reach a fence: Arrest them.” ___ 2:55 p.m. South Africa has recalled its ambassador to Israel, and its international relations minister Lindiwe Sisulu is condemning Israeli troops’ use of deadly force against Palestinians. Pro-Palestinian marches were set to take place Tuesday in Cape Town, in front of the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg and in the capital Pretoria amid some calls for the South African government to expel Israel’s ambassador. Sisulu said she had phoned U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to voice South Africa’s unhappiness with the violence. South Africa’s three largest political parties — the ruling African National Congress, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters — joined the government in condemning the violence at the Gaza border ___ 2:15 p.m. Gaza health officials are casting doubt on initial claims that a 9-month-old baby died from Israeli tear gas fired during mass protests on the Gaza border with Israel. A medical doctor said Tuesday that the baby, Layla Ghandour, had a pre-existing medical condition and that he did not believe her death was caused by tear gas. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of he was not allowed to disclose medical information to the media. Layla’s family claimed Tuesday that the baby had ended up in the area of the protest as a result of a mix-up. The Gaza Health Ministry initially counted her among several dozen Palestinians killed Monday. A Gaza human rights group, Al Mezan, says it is looking into the circumstances of the infant’s death. ___ 1:45 p.m. Ireland’s foreign ministry has summoned the Israeli ambassador to express “shock and dismay” over the latest bloodshed in the Gaza Strip and is calling for an independent investigation. Gaza health officials say Israeli forces killed 58 Palestinians, most by gunfire, and injured more than 2,700 in border protests Monday. Ireland says that during Tuesday’s meeting with the Israeli ambassador, it also said it was “very disturbed” by injuries to more than 200 health workers in Gaza. “The ambassador has been informed of Irish demands for an independent international investigation into yesterday’s deaths lead by the U.N.,” a statement said. ___ 1:40 p.m. Palestinians are clashing with Israeli troops in the West Bank a day after deadly clashes killed dozens in the Gaza Strip. Thick black smoke billowed from burning tires as Palestinians threw stones at Israeli troops, who responded with tear gas. About 200 Palestinians were protesting in the biblical city of Bethlehem while another 100 were demonstrating in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. Palestinians are marking the anniversary Tuesday of what they call their “nakba,” or catastrophe, a reference to the uprooting of hundreds of thousands who fled or were expelled during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Israeli forces killed 58 Palestinians in Monday’s clashes in Gaza. Organizers say the weekly protests are meant to bust a decade-old blockade on the territory. Israel says Hamas is using the demonstrations as cover to carry out attacks. ___ 1:30 p.m. Palestinians in the West Bank city of Ramallah have marked the 70th anniversary of their mass displacement with a 70-second siren. People stood at attention and traffic stopped in parts of the city Tuesday to mark the moment, though in some areas, the sirens appeared to malfunction and could barely be heard. Palestinians mark May 15 as their “nakba,” or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of people either fled or were expelled from their homes. This year, the occasion was especially sad for Palestinians, coming a day after the U.S. opened its new embassy to Israel in Jerusalem and 58 Palestinians were killed in Gaza during protests along the Israeli border. ___ 1:10 p.m. The World Health Organization says the number of protesters wounded in border clashes with Israel was “very overwhelming” for Gaza’s health system. Citing figures from the Health Ministry and a group of aid agencies, WHO official Mahmoud Daher told The Associated Press Tuesday that 2,771 people were wounded in Monday’s unrest. Of those, 1,360 were wounded by live fire, 400 from shrapnel and 980 from gas inhalation. He said the majority of those wounded by live fire were struck in their lower limbs. Daher says that nearly 1,800 of the wounded sought hospital care, putting additional pressure on Gaza’s already stressed hospitals, which endure equipment and medicine shortages and face power cuts like the rest of the territory. Daher says the numbers were comparable to wartime situations. “It is really massive in terms of numbers,” he said ___ 12:55 p.m. Turkey has lowered flags to half-mast to mark three days of mourning for the Palestinians killed and wounded in the Gaza border protest. The gesture comes as the government invites members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation for an extraordinary session Friday. Speaking late Monday, the Turkish government’s spokesman announced the official mourning period after Israeli forces killed 58 Palestinians, most by gunfire, as they protested the Gaza blockade and the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Bekir Bozdag slammed Israel for the “massacre” and said “the U.S. now has Palestinian blood on its hands.” He said the day would be remembered as “bloody Monday.” ___ 11:45 a.m. China is calling on Israel to exercise restraint along its border with Gaza a day after 58 Palestinians were killed in a protest. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Tuesday that China “opposes violent acts targeting innocent people” and urges all sides to avoid escalating tensions. Lu said China believes in a two-state resolution and that the status of Jerusalem should be resolved through dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have rallied in recent weeks near Israel’s border fence to protest a blockade of Gaza and the move of the U.S. Embassy to contested Jerusalem. China has long championed the Palestinian cause while also maintaining close economic, diplomatic and military relations with Israel. ___ 11:40 a.m. The government of Muslim-majority Malaysia says the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem will jeopardize efforts toward finding a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian-Israel conflict. Its foreign ministry said in a statement that security in the region will be undermined and sentiments inflamed, hampering any future peace negotiations. The statement said, “Malaysia wishes to reiterate its firm position that a two-state solution, in which the Palestinians and the Israelis live side by side in peace, based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine is the only viable solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” ___ 9:25 a.m. The Israeli military says its aircraft have struck a number of Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip in response to mass border protests. The military says Tuesday it struck 11 “terror targets” in a Hamas military compound. Tanks targeted another two Hamas posts in the Gaza Strip. The military says that protesters used 10 explosive devices and firebombs against troops and that shots were fired at soldiers positioned along the border. While there was no breach of the border fence, the military says many protesters attempted to enter Israel. Israeli fire killed 58 Palestinians in Monday’s protest. On Tuesday, Palestinians mark the 70th anniversary of their uprooting during the war surrounding Israel’s creation, known as their “nakba,” or catastrophe ___ 8:45 a.m. Palestinians will be burying their dead Tuesday after 58 people were killed by Israel during Gaza border protests. Khaled Batch, the head of the grassroots organizing committee of the protests, says Tuesday will be a day for funerals, suggesting there were no plans for border marches. Israeli media reported some tents where protesters have been gathering have been taken down at the border. Tuesday is what Palestinians call their “nakba” anniversary, or catastrophe marking the creation of Israel 70 years ago. Gaza health officials say the Palestinian death toll from a day of mass border protests Monday has risen to 58, including 57 people killed by Israeli fire and a baby who died from tear gas inhalation.","The Mercury News The Latest: Israeli military sends aid to Gaza The Mercury News Palestinian students walk down a closed shopping street in Jerusalem's Old City during a general strike, Tuesday, May 15, 2018.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"The cost is enormous. Horses grazing private pastures are projected to cost taxpayers $1 billion overall. Adding the rest of the excess horses on the range would cost another $3 billion-plus. The bureau doesn’t have the money to do this, so it has urged lawmakers to consider options long banned. One would sterilize 98,000 mustangs in the wild. Another would put about that number of captive mustangs up for sale “without limitation,” meaning they could go to slaughter. Given past experience, most probably would. Other proposals include paying people $1,000 to adopt a horse. None of these costly options would be a lasting fix. Wild horse advocacy groups have blasted the plans and are preparing for a legal fight. In all likelihood, though, none of these ideas will make it out of Washington. Particularly unlikely is the slaughter option. No one in Congress wants to vote to turn an American symbol into sausage. This inertia leaves one other possibility that is becoming increasingly likely: starvation. If the herds grow too large, they will exhaust the land’s ability to sustain them. A drought or harsh winter will lead to a die-off. It has happened before. A recent die-off in Arizona suggests it is starting to happen again. Good, some might say; let nature take its course. But the conditions leading to a die-off would have an impact well beyond wild horses. If herds have exhausted the land, everything else suffers: native wildflowers and lizards, sage grouse and butterflies — as well as ranchers who rely on the same range and hunters who want to see thriving populations of deer and bighorn sheep. Lions may be the best way to avoid such a catastrophe. Despite what the bureau says, a working predator-prey relationship could thrive if we would let it. Lions hunted wild horses in North America for millions of years, and they still do. Biologists studying mustangs have had their research upended by lions eating their subjects. One University of Nevada study found that in several mountain ranges of the state, horses made up the majority of lion’s diets. Some lion mothers who were collared and tracked feasted almost entirely on mustangs, and taught their young to do the same. Another study found that during the summer lions kill a horse every other week. Biologists have documented valleys where just a few lions keep a herd in check. That kind of balance could be a boon not just for the wild horse program but for the entire Western ecosystem.",Wild mustangs are overrunning parts of the West. The government has failed to control them. Maybe the big cats can do a better job.,2018-05-12T18:30:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",News Analysis: Let Mountain Lions Eat Horses,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/sunday-review/let-mountain-lions-eat-horses.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/opinion/sunday/13philipps/13phillips-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
"Anne C. Mulkern, E&E News","Climate change is the biggest threat to the planet, the World Economic Forum said yesterday in a sweeping catalog of global risks.
The institution’s annual analysis of economic dangers worldwide named extreme weather, natural disasters, man-made environmental disasters, biodiversity loss and failure to adapt to climate change as the chief perils to society.
Of all the risks to the globe, “it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” the WEF said in its Global Risks Report. “The results of climate inaction are becoming increasingly clear.”
The report noted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s October analysis that “bluntly said ... we have at most 12 years to make the drastic and unprecedented changes needed to prevent average global temperatures from rising” 1.5 degrees Celsius, roughly 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Limiting global temperature increase to that amount is the goal of the international Paris Agreement.
Meeting that goal “will require unprecedented action to drive decarbonization of agriculture, energy, industry and transport,” the WEF report said. However, “it appears increasingly unlikely that the world will meet even the 2 C upper limit identified by the Paris Climate Agreement.”
The Trump administration’s Fourth National Climate Assessment in November, meanwhile, said that “without significant reductions in emissions,” average global temperatures could rise 9 F by the turn of the century.
The risk report pointed to the “accelerating pace” of biodiversity loss as a particular concern. Species abundance is down 60 percent since 1970, it said. That affects the human food chain, health and socio-economic development, “with implications for well-being, productivity, and even regional security.”
Climate change as well is increasing strain on the global food system through changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events, along with higher carbon emissions. The last four years have been the hottest on record, it said.
Sea-level rise is another peril. An estimated 800 million people in more than 570 coastal cities are vulnerable to oceans rising 1.6 feet by 2050.
Higher waters are already hitting home in the United States, the report said. Cities like Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore; Charleston, S.C.; and Miami experience flooding on sunny days due to rising sea levels. Rising water threatens roads, railways, ports, sanitation systems, tourism, agriculture, power plants and underground cables that connect the internet.
That puts pressure on cities as they decide where to put housing, it noted.
“As sea levels rise and urban vulnerabilities increase, the urgency of the need to respond to these changes is going to intensify,” the report said. “Beyond adaptation measures, addressing urban vulnerability to sea-level rise will require households, businesses and governments to avoid exacerbating dangers. There is little point putting new flood defences in place, for example, if existing defences are undermined through continued development of homes and businesses in coastal areas and on floodplains.”

Josh K. Elliott,"A suicide bombing in the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan threatens to draw the two nuclear-armed neighbours into bloody conflict, igniting fears of another Indo-Pakistani war.
The bombing killed 40 paramilitary police in India-governed Kashmir on Feb. 14. A Pakistan-based militant group claimed responsibility for the attack, sparking outrage in India that its neighbour would allow such a group to operate within its borders. India retaliated against the militants by launching an airstrike on one of the group’s camps inside Pakistan on Tuesday, violating the Pakistani governments airspace in the process.

India drops bombs in Pakistan as tensions rise over Kashmir militant attack
Politicians in both countries are now vowing to stand up to foreign aggression, while Pakistani and Indian newspapers run headlines warning about the potential for war.
I vow that I will not let the country bow down, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a gathering of former soldiers after the airstrike on Tuesday. Modi is up for re-election later this year, and his Hindu nationalist government has vowed a “jaw-breaking response” to the bombing.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has denied any involvement in the attacks and offered to help investigate. He has also authorized the military to respond decisively and comprehensively to any aggression or misadventure from India. Pakistans president, Arif Alvi, warned on Tuesday that rhetoric can lead to war.
Heres why the two sides are butting heads again in a conflict as old as Pakistan itself.
Kashmir caught in between
The British gave up control of India in 1947, and the country was split into two states: the Hindu-majority nation of India to the south, and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the north. More than 14 million people were forced to migrate across the border during the partition process, which was marked by ethnic and religious violence on both sides of the new border. Between 1 and 2 million people are estimated to have died in the process.

Caught in the middle of the partition was Jammu and Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state on the border between Pakistan and India. The Brits allowed the state, commonly known as Kashmir, to decide which country it would join. The case sparked war between Pakistan and India, and Kashmir’s status has been in dispute ever since.
Both India and Pakistan claim to own Kashmir entirely, and two of their three wars have been over control of the region. India currently governs the central and southern parts of Kashmir, while Pakistan controls the northwestern area and China holds sway along its northeastern edge.
The disputed state is a mountainous region spanning approximately 225,000 square kilometres, making it roughly the same size as Idaho and half the size of the Yukon. India governs 45 per cent of the region, while Pakistan administers 35 per cent and China controls 20 per cent.
Although India holds the largest share of the territory, many of the citizens under its control are not happy with the state of affairs.
India-administered Kashmir has faced decades of conflict and violent insurgency from Muslim groups who seek independence or closer ties with Pakistan. More than 68,000 people are thought to have died since the insurgency broke out in 1989.
WATCH BELOW: Police fire tear gas at protesters ahead of 2014 India elections
The Indian government has staged a series of crackdowns against these rebels over the years. The latest campaign rounded up approximately 400 suspected Kashmiri leaders and activists. Human rights groups say India has been responding to public protest with disproportionate force.
The Indian- and Pakistan-administered parts are split by a UN-monitored boundary called the Line of Control (LoC), where both sides are expected to obey the terms of a ceasefire. However, the two sides have fought several skirmishes over the years, and frequently accuse one another of violating the terms of the ceasefire.

India has also accused Pakistan of supporting Muslim insurgents in Indian-administered territory. Pakistan denies the accusations, saying that it offers only political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.
Both countries field thousands of troops along the border.
The suicide bomb that reignited tensions
At least 40 paramilitary police officers were killed in Indian Kashmir on Feb. 14, when a suicide bomber drove a car into a military convoy. The Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based Muslim militant group, claimed responsibility shortly after the bombing. It was the worst attack since the Kashmir insurgency began in 1989.
WATCH BELOW: Dozens of police killed in suicide attack in Kashmir
The Pakistani government condemned the bombing and denied any involvement. However, India and the U.S. have suggested that Pakistan must do more to prevent such groups from flourishing within its borders.
Pakistan must crack down on JeM and all terrorists operating from its territory, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton tweeted on Feb. 16.
I expressed condolences to NSA Doval yesterday for the reprehensible terrorist attack on India. Pakistan must crack down on JeM and all terrorists operating from its territory. Countries should uphold UNSC responsibilities to deny safe haven and support for terrorists @nsaajit
— John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) February 16, 2019
Indias first public reaction to the attack was to withdraw the most-favoured nation trade status given to Pakistan and take all possible diplomatic steps to ensure the complete isolation from international community of Pakistan. India has also halted a key bus service with the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir.

New Delhi said incontrovertible evidence is available of (Pakistan) having a direct hand in this gruesome terrorist incident.
Pakistan’s foreign secretary rejected the allegations, saying it was part of India’s “known rhetoric and tactics” to divert global attention from its human rights violations.
The two sides have recalled their ambassadors and traded threats and insults since Feb. 14. Meanwhile, citizens in India were clamouring for revenge.
India strikes back
India announced on Tuesday that it had launched an airstrike against a JeM camp inside Pakistan, near the town of Balakot.
The incursion into Pakistani airspace marks the deepest cross-border raid by India since the last of its three wars with Pakistan in 1971.
In the face of imminent danger, a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary, India Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters.
“The existence of such training facilities, capable of training hundreds of jihadis, could not have functioned without the knowledge of the Pakistani authorities.”
Pakistani military officials disputed Indias account of the strike, saying that the Pakistani Air Force chased away the Indian warplanes and forced them to release their payloads “in haste, while escaping.” Pakistan also denied harbouring JeM.
Indian aircrafts intruded from Muzafarabad sector. Facing timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force released payload in haste while escaping which fell near Balakot. No casualties or damage.
— Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (@OfficialDGISPR) February 26, 2019
Pakistan military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor shared photos allegedly showing where the Indian bombs fell in a forested area. “No casualties or damage,” he tweeted.
Ghafoor previously warned India against taking military action against Pakistan.
“We have no intention to initiate war, but we will respond with full force to full spectrum threat that would surprise you,” he told reporters in Pakistan on Feb. 22. “Don’t mess with Pakistan.”

By evening Tuesday, India said Pakistani soldiers fired mortar shells and small-arms fire along the LoC.
Lt. Col. Devender Anand, an Indian army spokesman, said they fired at the Nowshera, Poonch and Akhnoor sectors, prompting Indian troops to strongly and befittingly respond.

Shakir Ahmed, a resident of Poonch in Indian-controlled Kashmir, said people were hearing loud sounds of shelling.
People are afraid, its getting dark, he told The Associated Press. We pray it doesnt escalate into war.
Water war
In addition to its military response, India says it’s preparing to divert its share of the rivers that flow into southern Pakistan. The two nations share control of the rivers under the Indus Water Treaty.
“We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab,” Nitin Gadkari, India’s minister of water resources, tweeted on Feb. 21.
The construction of dam has started at Shahpur- Kandi on Ravi river. Moreover, UJH project will store our share of water for use in J&amp;K and the balance water will flow from 2nd Ravi-BEAS Link to provide water to other basin states.
— Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) February 21, 2019
Pakistan, a country of 200 million people with a largely agriculture-based economy, fears that India may tamper with the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, which has lasted despite wars between the two nations.
In recent years, India has begun ambitious irrigation plans and construction of many upstream dams, saying its use of upstream water is strictly in line with the treaty.
Following an attack on security forces in the Kashmir town of Uri in 2016, India began to fast-track development of some of the dam projects, escalating tensions between the arch-rivals.
Pakistan has opposed some of these projects, saying they violate the World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of the Indus waters, upon which 80 per cent of its irrigated agriculture depends.

Rayne Ellis,"Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control. But as communities in places like Texas and Puerto Rico are learning, disaster relief that only alleviates physical wants is not enough to put their communities back on their feet. After first responders have done their jobs to secure personal safety, an emotional recovery has to begin as well. Organizations like UNICEF are acknowledging that the damage to communities can last long after the repairs to homes are completed. Canned goods and other basic need items are given out in a disaster relief station in southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images “When the reality of the disaster sets in, the emotional and psychological responses that are seen community-wide are tremendous and overwhelming,” Center for School Behavioral Health director Janet Pozmantier said. “People simply don’t have the wherewithal to cope effectively.” That's where organizations like UNICEF are stepping in. Called psychosocial disaster relief, this kind of help comes in the weeks and months after a disaster in order to help people recover emotionally. If UNICEF can help it, these recovery efforts will be implemented after every storm. Psychosocial relief in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and Harvey are currently ongoing, and UNICEF knows that the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas will also require this kind of help in the near future. Other organizations like the Red Cross have also been championing psychological first aid measures for years, and with good reason. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century Research suggests that those who have survived catastrophe tend to start showing signs of trauma roughly three months after the event took place. Those signs can look like anything from anxiety and depression to constant irritability and anger or even complete dissociation and inattention in both children and adults. In order to combat these symptoms, Pozmantier and other staff at the center working under Mental Health America in Greater Houston developed free workshops to teach others how to effectively help people struggling in the aftermath of traumatic disaster-related events. Damaged furniture and personal belongings sit on a flooded curb in Southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images The workshop focuses on helping educators identify signs and symptoms of trauma in children while also including other useful tools like mindfulness training and how to self-regulate emotions. After Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, UNICEF reached out to the center and offered to fund a Harvey-specific trauma training workshop, which the center named Hope for Harvey. In the months after Harvey made landfall in Texas, Pozmantier would drive through neighborhoods and see the entire contents of homes in a pile on the curb — family photos and clothing laying on top of piles of water damaged furniture — all ready to be collected by waste management. She said it was easy to understand why people would be traumatized. So when the center developed Hope for Harvey, aside from training people to deal with trauma in children, they also added some training on how to deal with adults. “Going through something like this, I realized more than ever that if we can take care of the adults, the kids are going to be okay for the most part too,” Pozmantier said. Nine months later, when UNICEF approached the center again to help Puerto Rico recover, the message was the same. The center developed a workshop, completely in Spanish, to help curb the emotional impact Hurricane Maria had on the people of Puerto Rico, focusing again on children — but also providing help to adults. First, UNICEF sent hygiene kits, water, and helped with shelter. But what UNICEF President Caryl Stern said she’s most proud of is the collaborative work that UNICEF and the Center for School Behavioral Health were able to put into action.

Image: unicef usa “Now classrooms are catastrophe stations the every time it rains in Puerto Rico. The children are worried that their home is destroyed. Or they’re wondering 'Is my mother okay?'” Stern said. Even seeing adults in distress can trigger the children, Stern said. Once Stern experienced this, she said she know that the training workshops would be incredibly important. In addition to the workshops, UNICEF sent a few hundred college students from State University of New York and City University of New York to pair up with member of various Puerto Rican communities to help rebuild the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico. Through this, people were able to come together and repair their communities themselves — something that can have a strong positive effect on the psyche. Stern says everyone who has ever dealt with disaster relief knows that the psychosocial recovery is the most import aspect of relief that is widely ignored by the public. Pozmantier agreed, adding that if she could, she would mandate that all educators go through training in mental health, trauma, mindfulness, and self-help strategies. “They are the first line of defense. It’s like any other kind of illness. You wouldn’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to try and strengthen your immune system,” Pozmantier said.","Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control.

KURT ANDERSEN,"Rice is the most compelling character. Allie pities poor Condi, who seemed to have spent a lifetime offering graciousness as a kind of microwaved substitute for actual warmth. Barbara Bush reckons Rice wanted her real personality to break through; she was merely afraid of it as opposed to Hillary who despised her own real self. But Rice has an authentic center, knows that if she ran for office every compromise and stifling and self-suppression to be performed would devour her with shame.
At an Army base in Germany, preparing to address the troops outdoors, she unbuttons her coat so it will blow open and reveal a pair of knee-high boots tightly encasing two legs whose several inches of exposed thigh had been made shapely by uncountable hours on the elliptical. Our Miss Brooks morphing into Lucy Lawless. Dominatrix? Who, me? Three hundred pages later, shes in bed with the named, real Canadian foreign minister, a man 11 years her junior. Condi admired the forearm flexors of Canadas Sexiest Male M.P., and later proudly thinks I got laid, but also recognizes that their lovemaking resembled the U.S.-Canadian relationship affectionate; not especially dramatic; and unlikely to evolve.
As for Bush, Im willing to buy that he really is kind, particularly to the women in his life; emotional about the wounded and displaced; sickened by corruption more than any dovishness; and realized after being re-elected how much he already wanted the whole thing to be over. And he might have the dark, funny thought that if the plane aiming for the Capitol dome on September 11 had actually hit it, he could imagine his vice president muttering No loss through that sly slit of a mouth.
But the W. of Landfall is unbelievably wonderful. He makes charming fun of his reputation for ignorance and then disproves it again and again. Hes fluent geopolitically, historically, philosophically. He knows minutiae, like the Iraqi village where Saddams regime executed over 140 people in 1982, and hes smart about the bigger picture, understanding that his war to incite regional democratization was, hed come to realize, his own domino theory, a reversal of the L.B.J. version. When Rumsfeld and Rice have a spat, he angrily asks: What would you call that? A dialectic? His born-again Christianity, he figures, gives him more in common with, and more insight into, the most radical Muslim who read his Quran than the unbeliever who never opened his Bible. And Mallons Bush is this much of a brainiac mensch: Hes trying to finagle a happy ending for Allie and Ross because hed failed in Iraq and New Orleans, and thus felt required to amalgamate the miniature and the giant. If he could help to solve their problems, writ small in the ink of a double catastrophe, maybe that could lead him toward a solution for the catastrophes themselves.
His flaws are barely flaws. Dole rags on him for always choking up and Kissinger, likewise, for possibly being the sincerest man Ive ever met. In this book his biggest problem, which Mallon diagnoses well, is a fundamental uneasiness, the lack of an even keel. Young Laura worries how long it would be before the quick, constant movements between overindulgence and athletic self-punishment broke the spring of her husbands metronome. When Allie first beholds him, she remarks on the fake good humor Hes actually pissed off. I can see it in his eyes and three decades later still sees the bipolarity: Half the time he was without self-confidence; the other half he spilled an excess of it. But this is such a mature and self-aware Bush that he knows he had to fight it, the sudden shift from merriment to irritability, from runners high to cramp, the flight and crash he experienced a dozen times an hour. He wonders at one point if he is getting as paranoid as Nixon, and then decides that maybe President Ford was the only normal guy to have occupied the place, including himself and his father.
I was surprised how little space such a thoughtful writer devotes in this long novel to the awful particulars of its central catastrophe. Hes too easy on everyone. The action starts nearly two years into the war, well after the administration made its big, terrible decisions. The profound bungling and cynicism and deception behind those decisions is elided, practically ignored, eclipsed by Bushs present-moment sincerity and idealism. Dick Cheney is generally absent, as are any real discussions of waterboarding or renditions or Guantánamo. Rices predecessor, Colin Powell, who warned the president in 2002 that if we broke Iraq wed own it, is recalled as a self-righteous ass. The war years Mallon has chosen to focus on, 2005 and 2006, perfectly stack the moral deck in Bushs favor after breaking Iraq but before committing to trying to put it back together. In fact, the military surge that started in 2007 reduced the chaos the United States had unleashed. The one main character in the war zones is likable, lovable Allison, whose work doesnt involve killing or torturing, and the Iraqi (and Afghan) characters we meet still welcome the Americans as liberators, years into the wars.
Rosss government job also consists of doing nice things. The most Republican opinion he expresses isnt very right-wing annoyance at P.C. colleagues in his department with their theory-ridden view of American history as a sort of ongoing atrocity.

BEN RHODES and JAKE SULLIVAN,"Second, Democrats should challenge the president on his approach to the forever war. Despite running on a pledge to withdraw from military conflicts, Mr. Trump has escalated every conflict he inherited largely behind a cloak of secrecy and without a clear strategy. Congress can insist on greater transparency around American military deployments, forcing the administration to specify which terrorist organizations the United States is at war with and the military objectives. Democrats should also push for a plan that removes our troops from harms way in Afghanistan, while insisting that a war against Iran cannot take place without congressional authorization. As Mr. Trump faces political setbacks at home, Democrats must be vigilant in checking military adventurism abroad. Congress can also work to end United States support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has precipitated the worlds worst humanitarian catastrophe. Rather than fuel the war, we should be driving the parties toward a diplomatic solution and increasing assistance to stem the spread of famine. This is even more pressing in the aftermath of Mr. Trumps shameful statement on Saudi Arabia last week that signaled that American foreign policy is for sale and that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can act with impunity. The House should demand all of the information that our intelligence community has developed about this terrible crime, and provide a public accounting of the facts including when Mr. Trump and his closest aides had information that the crown prince was responsible for the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This should inform a broader review of our relationship with Saudi Arabia that looks at possible sanctions, arms sales and all Saudi actions that run counter to American interests. More broadly, Democrats can signal a shift in priorities. On defense, expensive administration plans to modernize the nuclear arsenal and establish a space force should be scrutinized. And while Mr. Trump may have vacated American leadership on climate by leaving the Paris accords, Democrats should fight to restore United States funding to mitigate the effects of a warming planet, including mass migration and armed conflict, while pressing for the planning necessary to deal with those problems as they worsen. Third, evidence of corruption in the Trump administration demands oversight. Never in our lifetimes has there been such a glaring concern that a president and his associates could be mixing personal financial interests with the nations business. We still dont know the depth of the Trump familys conflicts in dealings with countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia and China. Why has the administration given a blank check to the Saudi crown prince?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Queensland is battling more than 100 fires across the state The first ever ""catastrophic"" bushfire warning in Queensland, Australia, prompted a large-scale evacuation on Wednesday. The main town under threat was spared, but the intensity of fire conditions has caused concern. As the sky blackened and her horses whinnied in the smoke, Fayleen Zemlicoff debated the ""very last minute"" she could remain at home. Ferocious winds were flicking embers from a bushfire towards her. The smoke was so intense it was ""like a volcano had gone off"", she said. But she and her adult daughter, Anja, were trying frantically to load the horses into a vehicle. Unsettled, the animals were resisting. Ultimately the pair, along with three elderly relatives, made a choice to leave. Image copyright FAYLEEN ZEMLICOFF Image caption Fayleen Zemlicoff, pictured with daughter Anja, said Ms Zemlicoff put her phone number on slips of paper, and tied them to the horses' manes. ""To drive away and not know what we would come home to, whether the animals would survive... it was a heartbreaking decision,"" she told the BBC. Fortunately, all of the horses survived. The family were among as many as 8,000 locals who evacuated from the Queensland town of Gracemere late on Wednesday, after receiving an evacuation order. ""This fire was just something that's never happened to us before,"" Ms Zemlicoff said. ""But we are in drought, and everything around us is dry, dry, dry."" Lance Jones, a farmer, said he had never witnessed such panic in the town in his 30 years living there. Three years ago, Gracemere was among the towns battered by a powerful cyclone which left widespread damage. But Mr Jones said that natural disaster had not ""scared us to the point of evacuation"". 'Not over yet' Ms Zemlicoff and her family stayed at a motel in nearby Rockhampton, as fire crews battled through the night. ""We have saved the town of Gracemere,"" Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk declared on Thursday morning. The success has been attributed, in large part, to the efforts of firefighters and computer modelling of the blaze's path. The threat to Queensland was not over, however, the premier said. More than 100 fires remained burning across Queensland on Thursday, fuelled by strong winds, a heatwave and a long dry spell. Authorities have called the conditions ""unprecedented"" in Queensland. The evacuation of Gracemere was the first time a ""catastrophic"" fire warning - the highest level - had been issued in the state. ""What we experienced yesterday was off the charts,"" Ms Palaszczuk said. ""Nobody has recorded these conditions any time in the history of Queensland. And we are still not out of the woods."" Why is this unusual? Unlike in Australia's drier south, intense fire conditions are unusual in central Queensland in late November - typically the start of the wet season. But existing ideas about threat periods are being challenged, experts say. ""There is always an amount of variability in fire seasons each year, but research is showing that fire seasons are lengthening,"" said Dr Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazard Cooperative Research Centre. ""[It is] now to the extent that we are now seeing a year-round fire season in Australia."" Image copyright GRACEMERE POLICE Image caption Thousands evacuated their homes in Gracemere on Wednesday Dr Samantha Lloyd, manager of the South East Queensland Fire and Biodiversity Consortium, said central Queensland had experienced fires ""around this time"" previously. But what's concerning, she said, was that ""we just don't generally see this intensity of fire weather"". Dr Lloyd noted that climate change modelling had pointed to increasingly frequent and severe weather events. ""We usually only have one to two extreme fire days in a year, and now we've had something like three to four in just a few days,"" she said.","A mass evacuation in Gracemere, Australia, has magnified worries about ""historic"" bushfire conditions.",2018-11-29T06:57:10Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Queensland bushfires: The town spared an 'uncharted' catastrophe,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46380414,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06t2mfy.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,catastrophe,0
Quinta Jurecic,"Editor’s Note: This article is one of 50 in a series about Trump's first two years as president. Unlike pornography, a constitutional crisis is not always obvious when you see it. The question of whether the nation is in the grip of such a crisis first surfaced within weeks of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and it has never really gone away. After the first travel ban was issued, in January 2017, stories emerged of Customs and Border Protection agents disobeying court orders to halt implementation of Trump’s executive order. Although the disobedience in question turned out to be more the product of confusion than systematic overthrow of the rule of law, the term constitutional crisis was thrown around quite a bit. Those two little words again took over headlines after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, and when he seemed poised to dismiss Special Counsel Robert Mueller or even pardon himself. Former Secretary of State John Kerry suggested that a crisis had arrived in response to the anonymous New York Times op-ed by an administration official supposedly working to stymie the president’s wilder impulses. A recent Supreme Court filing challenging Matthew Whitaker’s replacement of Jeff Sessions at the Justice Department referred to Whitaker’s appointment as a “constitutional crisis.” There is no standard definition of what makes a constitutional crisis as a matter of law or history. Under the Trump administration, suggesting the arrival of such a crisis evokes a mood more than anything else—a sense of ineffable, fractured dread. Keith Whittington writes that constitutional crises entail “circumstances in which the constitutional order itself is failing”; Sanford Levinson and Jack M. Balkin similarly define such a crisis as “a potentially decisive turning point in the direction of the constitutional order, a moment at which the order threatens to break down.” Most people seem to agree that if Trump were to fire the special counsel in an effort to shut down the investigation into his conduct, the term constitutional crisis could fairly be applied. Despite the dire predictions, however, that may never come to pass. As Jack Goldsmith has argued, the Justice Department has proved resilient to the president’s most egregious assaults. The president has not succeeded in removing Mueller; the Russia investigation appears to have continued on course even under Whitaker’s uncertain supervision. Meanwhile, an independent investigation into campaign-finance violations committed by Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen appears to be circling closer and closer to the president. And yet, a sense of dread remains. To be overly sanguine about the health of the republic because the one obviously crisis-triggering event has not occurred risks following the circular logic of Republicans who have refused to act to protect the Mueller investigation because the president has not yet shut it down. “If there were an occasion, I would be rising to it,” the humor columnist Alexandra Petri wrote in a devastating description of this reasoning. It may be wiser to focus less on crisis than on constitutional rot, what the constitutional scholar John Finn describes as the slow erosion of faith in the underlying ideals of the republic, even as legal structures seem to remain in place. Rot is not grand. It is the patient assault of base creatures like fungus and bacteria. But at some point, the floorboards fall apart.","The health of the republic may seem imperiled, but this is in many ways a slow-moving catastrophe.",2019-01-14T02:37:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",You Know You're in a Constitutional Crisis When...,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/what-makes-constitutional-crisis/580057/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/01/Trump_50_14/facebook.jpg?1547414207,,Theatlantic.com,catastrophe,0
"Joshua Keating, Joshua Keating","Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after their joint press conference following the talks, in the Bocharov Ruchei residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in Sochi on September 17, 2018. It’s not exactly a moment for celebration, but perhaps one for cautious relief in a conflict that has had all too little of it. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed today after talks in Sochi to work together to create a 9–15-mile buffer zone between rebel and pro-government forces in Syria’s Idlib province, with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu saying the agreement means there will be no new offensive into Idlib by the Syrian military and its allies. According to Putin, the zone will be established by Oct. 15. U.N. officials have warned that an all-out assault on Idlib could create the “worst humanitarian crisis of the 21 st century.” The area, one of the last major rebel-held strongholds in the country, is home to about 3 million people, more than a million of whom are displaced from other parts of Syria. Over the last few weeks, as regime forces have been stepping up airstrikes and mustering reinforcements, residents have been preparing for an all-out attack and held a mass rally Friday against the looming assault. The crisis had implications beyond Idlib itself. Turkey already hosts 3.5 million refugees from the Syrian conflict and has no desire to take in more. Under a 2016 agreement with the European Union, Turkey has worked to prevent the historic flow of refugees that has roiled politics in several European countries, but Erdogan has hinted that deal may no longer be sustainable in the face of mass displacement from Idlib. Reports that Syria was planning to use chemical weapons in Idlib have also led the U.S. to warn of another round of airstrikes against the Assad regime. Obviously, it’s too early to assume that all of these scenarios are off the table. The agreement calls for “radically minded” jihadist groups to leave the de-escalation zone. This includes Tahrir al-Sham, the rebranded new incarnation of al-Qaida’s Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, which has become militarily dominant in the area and is often intermingled on the ground with more “mainstream” rebel groups backed by Turkey and others. What happens if the jihadists don’t pull out ? If they launch attacks, it could give Syrian forces pretext to attack them—as well as other rebel groups. Russia and its allies have also frequently violated other de-escalation zones. In fact, of the zones agreed to by Iran, Turkey, and Russia last year, Idlib is the last one left. As Daniel Serwer writes, “To be effective, civilian protected zones would require the presence and active assistance of impartial military forces, which simply don’t exist in Syria.” Washington has been quietly ramping up its diplomatic efforts in Syria, though primarily aimed at blunting Iranian influence rather than pressuring Assad himself. President Trump did tweet on Sept. 3 that “President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province,” warning of a “potential human tragedy.” But the primary actor here is increasingly Turkey. Erdogan has not only been rallying world opinion against an Idlib invasion; he also he has the boots on the ground to back them up. Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria in 2016 aimed mainly at containing the spread of the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia, and in the process Turkey has built a significant level of influence in Northern Syria, including 12 military observation posts around Idlib—with the tacit agreement of the local jihadists. And while Turkey and Russia have been on opposite sides of the Syrian war, increasingly cordial relations between Moscow and Ankara also gave Erdogan more leverage. Some observers are now even discussing the possibility of a Turkish-backed protectorate in Northern Syrian, akin to the semi-independent Turkish-backed Republic of Northern Cyprus. That presents its own complications—for one, it could drive the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds even further into an alliance of convenience with the Assad regime. For now, if this deal really does indefinitely delay a full-scale assault on Idlib, it may be the best outcome we can hope for. But seven years into the ever-mutating war in Syria, the situation is unlikely to stay static for long. Bashar al-Assad has vowed to retake “ every inch ” of Syrian territory. And although he remains heavily dependent on Russian support, he’s likely to view today’s agreement as a delay rather than a defeat. If you think Slate’s work matters, become a Slate Plus member.

Lauren Weber,"The World Health Organization announced Friday that it hopes to deploy an experimental vaccine against the developing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, even as the agency plans for the “worst case scenario.” There have been 32 probable and suspected cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever reported since April 4, including 18 deaths, according to WHO. Ebola takes sophisticated lab tests to confirm, so only two cases have been confirmed thus far. Three affected patients, one of whom has died, were health care workers. That’s especially worrisome to experts because medical professionals come into close contact with many people. During the major Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016, local health care workers were instrumental in alerting authorities to the outbreak but also played a role in spreading the disease early on. That outbreak ultimately killed some 11,300 people and infected 28,600 across West Africa. WHO was deeply criticized for its “ egregious failure ” to respond sooner to the large-scale tragedy. WHO and the DRC are taking a multi-pronged approach to contain this new outbreak in a remote northwestern part of the country, including moving vaccines at sub-zero temperatures. They’re also monitoring for any signs that the disease is spreading along the Congo River and across borders. WHO and the DRC are taking a multi-pronged approach to contain this new outbreak in a remote northwestern part of the country, including moving vaccines at sub-zero temperatures. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has worried global health experts by proposing to rescind agencies’ Ebola funding left over from the last major outbreak and ousting his top global health security adviser the same week as the new outbreak was declared. A Logistical Nightmare Cases are clustered at three locations within a roughly 37-mile area near the town of Bikoro, said Peter Salama, WHO’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, during a United Nations briefing on Friday in Geneva, Switzerland. It’s been described as a “dire scene,” he said. “This is going to be tough, and it’s going to be costly to stamp out this outbreak,” Salama warned. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, is traveling to the DRC this weekend to oversee the response. The global health organization is looking to establish an “air bridge” to move supplies by plane into the affected area. Helicopters are also being deployed to get experts and medical care to the scene. All of that, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told HuffPost, is expensive, with the agency announcing Friday that the cost of the estimated three-month operation could run to $18 million. To that end, WHO has already approved $1 million of funding through its Contingency Fund for Emergencies. The London-based Wellcome Trust, a global health charity, has also pledged 2 million pounds ― about $2.7 million ― which will be matched by another million pounds from the British government. The U.S. has not announced any standalone contributions as yet. Trying To Transport A Vaccine WHO is talking with the DRC government about using the still-experimental Merck vaccine, which showed great promise during a trial conducted amidst the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak. Health Minister Oly Ilunga said health care workers would be a priority if the vaccine is deployed, according to Reuters. The DRC government had previously approved use of the vaccine during a small Ebola outbreak last year. But by the time officials were ready to go, the infection had been contained by traditional measures such as quarantine and contact tracing. For Ron Klain, who served as Ebola czar under President Barack Obama during the last major crisis, the question is why there aren’t already “standing arrangements in place” between WHO and the DRC to deploy the vaccine following last year’s outbreak. “The fact that, in two consecutive outbreaks, in two consecutive years, this process is starting from scratch is problematic, and puts health care workers particularly at risk,” Klain told HuffPost in an email. After all, vaccine deployment is a logistical feat in itself. The Ebola vaccine needs to be kept at extremely cold temperatures of negative-60 to negative-80 degrees Celsius at all times in order to be effective ― a tall order when transporting it to a remote area without much electrical or other infrastructure. It takes 15 hours by motorbike to arrive at the outbreak area from the nearest town outside that area, according to Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow for the Washington-based Center for Global Development who previously led parts of the 2014 Ebola response for the Obama administration. Salama said that WHO is working to mobilize the “cold chain” logistics by the weekend and that Gavi, the public-private international Vaccine Alliance, will pay for the vaccine’s deployment if the DRC approves its use. Even when the proper logistics are in place, effective distribution will require extensive tracing of the individuals the infected patients came in contact with. The goal is to vaccinate a “ring” of protected people around the patients and their contacts. That tracing can take a week or two, according to Salama. “This is not a simple logistical effort ― this is a highly complex, sophisticated operation in one of the most difficult terrains on Earth,” Salama said. Along The Congo River While WHO says the risk of Ebola spreading internationally is low, experts worry that the location of Bikoro on the Congo River could lead to outbreaks elsewhere, the STAT news site first pointed out. “The biggest thing to watch is just the location around the Congo River because it’s the superhighway of Central Africa,” Konyndyk told HuffPost. “If you start to see disease spread to other cities up and down the river... and if it were to hit a major population, then we’d be in real trouble,” he added. The Congo River creates a possible pathway for the disease to reach the DRC’s capital, Kinshasa, which is home to over 12 million people. To the immediate north, there’s the capital of the Republic of the Congo, Brazzaville, whose population is 3 million. And then there’s the capital of the Central African Republic to the north, Bangui, where 730,000 people live. WHO also warned of the risk to Mbandaka, the capital of the DRC’s Equateur province, which is home to nearly a million people and located just a few hours north of Bikoro. Gambia, Guinea and Nigeria said they’re on the lookout for the virus, according to Reuters, and Kenya’s Health Ministry is thermo-scanning travelers at its airports for fever. An Unclear Timeline While there were some reports about suspected cases with Ebola-like symptoms in December and January, WHO has pushed back on the implication that those were linked to the current outbreak. Many diseases manifest with the same symptoms ― fatigue, fever and vomiting ― that accompany the early stages of Ebola, including malaria and other hemorrhagic fevers. WHO said it was tracking the count for this outbreak since April 4. Konyndyk echoed doubts that the DRC outbreak could have begun in December or January. “If it had been floating around for 5 months [in the DRC], then it would have [already] spread up and down the river,” he said. However, Klain cautioned against simply accepting WHO’s neat timeline. “The mistake WHO is making is providing overly reassuring communications about the status of its information, the outbreak, and the response,” Klain said. “All that we know right now is that we don’t know: we don’t know when the outbreak started, if the response is timely, and whether early communication from the DRC was accurate.” Playing Politics In The U.S. All this news comes at the same time Trump is seeking to cut the remaining $252 million in Ebola response funds for U.S. agencies and has disbanded the global health security division within the National Security Council. Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed Trump’s rescissions proposal in a Friday statement. She said that the Republican president was essentially making global health “foot the cost for their GOP Tax Scam” and that his plan “eliminates life-saving funding for responding to outbreaks.” Global health experts noted that Trump has consistently pushed for spending reductions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Global Fund. A National Security Council spokesperson defended the rescissions proposal on Wednesday, telling HuffPost that USAID had sufficient funds to respond to an outbreak and that the State Department could move funds among its own programs if needed. The spokesperson also stressed that other donor countries would be expected to chip in. Global health experts also decried the loss of Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, who oversaw global health issues at the National Security Council, and the disassembly of his division. Beth Cameron, who previously held that job under Obama, said Ziemer’s departure leaves the U.S. without a clear point person to tackle pandemics. “It’s critical that we know who will have the lead for handling the coordination of a U.S. government response during an actual global health emergency here or overseas,” said Cameron, who now works for the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative. Klain said the decision to collapse Ziemer’s division and reportedly move it under the weapons-of-mass-destruction portfolio at the National Security Council was a mistake, arguing that the White House needs a team “focused on epidemic and pandemic prevention and response.” And Konyndyk echoed that view, saying the dismantling of the global health section was “a bad idea in a normal week and a week like this just highlights how bad an idea it is.”",The World Health Organization is proposing to deploy the experimental Ebola vaccine against the new outbreak.,2018-05-12T00:07:57Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Ebola Is Back And World Health Officials Are Racing To Stop Another Catastrophe,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-world-health-officials-racing-to-stop-catastrophe_us_5af5fac7e4b0e57cd9f972fa,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5af601b41a00002800cde761.jpeg?cache=FAQytWN44R&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,catastrophe,0
THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"When a cautious, science-based and largely apolitical group like the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world must utterly transform its energy systems in the next decade or risk ecological and social diaster, attention must be paid. The panel, created in 1988, synthesizes the findings of leading climate scientists, an undertaking for which it received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. It is not in the habit of lecturing governments. But its latest report, issued near Seoul on Monday, is very different. One United Nations official described it as a deafening, piercing smoke alarm going off in the kitchen an alarm aimed directly at world leaders. Frankly, weve delivered a message to the governments, said Jim Skea, a co-chairman of the panel and a professor at Imperial College, London. Its now their responsibility to decide whether they can act on it. Unfortunately, no alarm seems loud enough to penetrate the walls of the White House or the cranium of its principal occupant. President Trump had nothing substantive to say about the report, preferring, his staff said, to focus on celebrating the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Having already announced that he would withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, having also rolled back a suite of Obama-era efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Trump thus reaffirmed his sorry role as an outlier in the global struggle against climate change a struggle few believe can be won without the enthusiastic participation of the United States. The report, written by 91 scientists from 40 countries, came about at the request of several small island nations that took part in the Paris talks, where 195 countries pledged their best efforts to limit increases in global warming to 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) below preindustrial levels. Fearing that their countries might someday be lost to rising seas, they asked the intergovernmental panel for further study of a lower threshold, 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). The panels report concluded that the stricter threshold should become the new target. The alternative is catastrophe mass die-offs of coral reefs, widespread drought, famine and wildfires, and potentially conflict over land, food and fresh water.",New research has found that wildfires are likely to worsen if steps are not taken to combat climate change.,2018-10-09T22:35:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘A Deafening, Piercing Smoke Alarm’",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/opinion/climate-change-ipcc-report.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/09/opinion/09climateWeb/09climateWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The pink colour is caused by bacteria used to digest the pig waste Aerial photographs of a North Carolina farm have highlighted growing concerns about pig waste stored in ponds. Floodwaters continue to rise after Hurricane Florence, and authorities are closely monitoring any potential leaks from what are called pig waste lagoons. The state's Department of Environmental Quality released data on Tuesday saying at least 13 lagoons have overflowed and 64 more are at risk. Environmental groups have warned people not to swim in the waste. North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality has an updating dashboard on its website recording known issues with the 3,300 lagoons in the state. As the New York Times reports, the agency depends on farmers self-reporting incidents of overflowing lagoons - and since many have left their farms to escape the floodwaters, the number could well be higher. However, the North Carolina Pork Council - the organisation for pork producers in the state - says there are fewer overflowing lagoons than the Department of Environmental Quality is reporting. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A pig stranded on top of a car after Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina in 1999 North Carolina has more than nine million pigs, many which live in the hurricane-devastated counties of Sampson and Duplin, south-east of state capital Raleigh. Pig waste on the farms is run off into the lagoons and then mixed with water and anaerobic bacteria to treat the excrement. This bacteria is what gives the pools their pinkish hue. There are growing fears that leaks from these pools could cause an environmental catastrophe - with waste polluting rivers, lakes and groundwater, and causing numerous medical problems. After Hurricane Floyd hit the state in 1999, pig waste drowned animals and caused mass fish deaths. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pig waste lagoons overflowed after Hurricane Floyd in 1999 Residents who live near the pig farms have often complained about their effect on lives and wellbeing. Local media reported on recent attempts to curtail nuisance laws in North Carolina allowing neighbours to sue pig farmers. ""Our laws must balance the needs of businesses versus property rights,"" state governor Roy Cooper reportedly said. ""Giving one industry special treatment at the expense of its neighbours is unfair.""

View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies. As the storm nears and intensifies, so too does the stress of preparing and planning. Tuesday morning, my blood began prickling underneath my skin; I felt a nervous-energy in my gut, as though I were perched on the starting blocks before a race. We are not in the clear, and the current information cannot tell us how Florence will behave once it approaches the coast. Projected track lines across the Carolinas look as though a toddler has scribbled all over the map. Charleston sits on the edge of the cone of uncertainty. The schools, the college campus where I work, all the city offices are all closed. My family is leaving our house on the Charleston peninsula to go inland -- the third time in three consecutive falls. Florence threatens, and yet it's beautiful here right now. After the 5 inches of unprecedented snow and ice that glazed the camellias and gave us an actual winter, after a long summer of rains, after an eye-blink of a spring, our front yard garden is ripening. The sages and salvias, the bee balm and zinnias are drawing in a cast of bees and butterflies. The promise of less humid days is visible in the resurrection ferns browning on the live oaks, in the sky's dynamic mixture of high and low altitude clouds. With the school year in full swing, we were just feeling settled into our weekly routines. Last year, Irma interrupted this exact same week of the school year, and the year before Matthew arrived not far after. I ask myself -- did I plant our winter vegetable garden before or after Irma, before or after Matthew? September and October have new meanings for me now. Time moves strangely when a hurricane eyes you from the ocean. You reside in a surreal pre-storm space. The closest comparison I have to this altered time-space is caring for a newborn in the first weeks. You try to concentrate on other things. There's a constant pressure behind your eyes; you do not sleep well. You go hour-by-hour reassessing with every forecast update. You never feel you are making the best choices. You exist in a mixed state of hyper-vigilance and fret; you go back-and-forth discussing the storm's probabilities and what gambles you're willing to take. You might put up plywood; you might not. You might evacuate, if you can. You might not. Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait -- that's the pre-storm mantra. Then the storm arrives, and you wait. As I wait, I talk to my neighbors, colleagues and students about their thoughts: Will you stay? What's your plan? In Charleston, you can often tell a South Carolina native from a transplant, like me, based on how they react to these storm threats. Charleston natives, long seasoned by storms and near misses, will joke about how they plan to go to the bars downtown, now that there's plenty of parking with all the tourists gone. They will remind you about Hurricane Hugo -- the measuring stick of what disaster means here. Many will say that if it's a Category 4 or higher, then they will go, but only then. I do not feel seasoned by these storms yet. But I know what will likely happen here: The peninsula's outermost roads will be inundated with saltwater; the downtown Market will flood. Some of the majestic old trees, heavy with rot, will crack and fall. Every intersection notorious even for sunny-day flooding will fill up all the faster; the crosstown will become a stream. The bridges that link the peninsula and the sea islands will close. Trucks delivering food will be delayed. Once in the clear, people will venture outside; others will arrive back to their houses to clean up what puddles or debris they find. Threads on our neighborhood Facebook feed will ask what restaurants are open and serving -- gosh darn it, they say, they need to get out of the house, they're stir crazy. At the College of Charleston, we'll have to re-create our syllabi and fit in make-up classes. My summer garden will be toppled, flattened in spirals. It'll be a nuisance -- at least that's what I'm most hopeful for -- a repeat of what has happened twice before. I'm lucky that I can entertain the thought of Hurricane Florence as a nuisance, but even this is overshadowed by certain catastrophe to the north where the impacts won't be merely bothersome but biblical. Rain there is measured in feet and not inches; the color scale indicating rain accumulations grows a deeper gray as all the more alarming colors were spent further down the scale. As I sit here pitched on the edges of the cone of uncertainty, I'm reminded how much of our lives -- if we are fortunate -- unfold at the edge of a catastrophe that is always striking somewhere and striking hard, sometimes on a scale distant and unimaginable.","Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","Ken Jennings became famous the easy way—through an unprecedented 74-game victory streak worth $2.52 million on Jeopardy. Since that 2004 era, the affable quizmaster has gone on to host a podcast, become a beloved Twitter hero, write several books (including the newly released Planet Funny: How Comedy Took Over Our Culture ), and continue raising his two children with his wife Mindy. Here’s how he parents. Name: Ken Jennings Location: Seattle Job: Author and ex-game show contestant Family: Mindy and I have two kids, Dylan (15) and Kate (11) Tell us a little bit about your family and your career. Did life happen mostly as planned or were there surprises? The kids were planned. (Well, the conceptions were planned. Everything since then has been a total free-for-all.) My career change has been the biggest surprise. I was a perfectly happy suburban dad and computer programmer back in 2004, the year I turned thirty. I was not expecting to win on Jeopardy! for six months straight and start a new career as a writer and professional know-it-all. Take us through your morning routine. What are your best tricks for getting out the door? I work from home most of the time, but I do make sure I engineer a daily errand to get me out of my chair once a day, even if it’s just walking to the post office. I have the lifestyle of your 85-year-old grandpa, basically. How much outside help do you get as a parent? Who or what can’t you live without? With two kids and two of us and two pretty flexible work schedules, we can cover most of the bases ourselves. But the driving! Even with just two kids, we are driving somebody somewhere all the time. Carpools are a life-saver. It’s gotten to the point where I won’t let the kids start any new activity unless we can figure out some other nearby parents to run a carpool with. We’re launching “How I Parent,” a new Offspring column inspired by Lifehacker’s “How I Work”… Read more Read What are the gadgets, apps, charts or tools you rely on? There are gadgets and apps that will parent my kids for me? This sounds fantastic. We do use a “find my friends” app to track the kids at all times, since they seem congenitally incapable of answering phone calls or texts in a timely manner. Has becoming a parent changed the way you work? My home office is right by the front door, so as soon as the kids are home from school, they come barreling in. I thought about putting a lock on the door but I ended up just embracing the catastrophe. I work as fast as I can so that I can be mostly done with the day’s writing before the quiet ends. How do you decompress? We have a pretty hard-and-fast rule that the kids have to be in their rooms around 8:30 or 9. They don’t have to be asleep, but devices stay plugged in downstairs so they actually have to do something boring like read a book. This gives me and Mindy a few child-free hours to put on a movie or the next couple episodes of whatever show we’re watching. What’s been your proudest moment as a parent? I like to see the kids confident about stretching their wings a little. When we were in New York a couple summers ago, they both really wanted to go play Pokemon Go in Central Park one evening, but Mindy and I had dinner reservations. We decided to let them walk over on their own and have a little adventure. They could not have been happier or cuter about it, and also did not get kidnapped and die. What moment are you least proud of? 100-way tie for every time they spilled water or broke a glass in a restaurant. What do you want your kid to learn from your example? Hopefully that every single person they meet deserves to be treated with decency and respect. And also to load the dishwasher in the correct way that I load it, not the weird way their mother does it. What are your favorite funny/weird/special family rituals? When someone in a movie says the title of the movie out loud, we always applaud briefly (and quietly, if we’re in the theater). It didn’t come up much in, say, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, but a movie like Coco can be brutal. Has anyone ever given you a piece of parenting advice that has really stuck with you? All the cliches about how “the days are long but the years are short” are absolutely true. You’re not going to be the parent of young kids for very long, relatively speaking. Live it up. Go to the park. Buy them ice cream. What’s the hardest part about being a parent? Having to keep up with all the new youth slang and internet memes to annoy your kids with in front of their friends. What’s your favorite part of the day? 4:20, baby! ;) ;) ;) That’s usually when the UPS guy drops off any Amazon packages. Any tips for teaching a kid how to be funny? This is a can’t-miss as far as I’m concerned: What’s one piece of advice you’d give to all parents? Read to your kids every night. It’s not just an unwind-before bed ritual; it will change their lives. The one thing I would tell other parents who are juggling a career: If at all possible, arrange to win 74 times on a game show.","Ken Jennings became famous the easy way—through an unprecedented 74-game victory streak worth $2.52 million on Jeopardy.

"Josephine Wolff, Josephine Wolff","Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats departs a Capitol Hill briefing on election security measures in May. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. In 2013, when I was in graduate school studying cybersecurity policy, the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, launched its annual Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge. Born out of fears of a coming “Cyber 9/11” or “Digital Pearl Harbor,” the competition asks students to come up with hypothetical response recommendations (hence the day-after title) tackling a fictional cyber catastrophe. I’ve participated in that event many times over the years—both as a student and later as a faculty coach—so I’ve read through a number of different scenarios explicitly designed to be cyber Sept. 11 equivalents, ranging from widespread malware attacks directed at U.S. oil refineries to massive bots of Internet of Things devices deployed to shut down power plants, trains, and shipping companies. Yet, for all the years spent thinking about these scenarios, I’m still largely mystified by the comments director of national intelligence Dan Coats gave last week warning of a growing threat of a foreign actor executing a “crippling cyberattack on our critical infrastructure.” He suggested that daily the cyberstrikes on government, corporate, and academic institutions we see today are on par with the “alarming activities” that the U.S. intelligence community saw from al-Qaida in the weeks leading up to Sept. 11, 2001. “Here we are nearly two decades later, and I’m here to say the warning lights are blinking red again,” Coats said in the talk at the Hudson Institute, apparently referring to increasingly sophisticated or high-volume intrusion attempts from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea in recent years (activity that comes as no surprise to anyone who followed the Justice Department’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers last week ). This certainly isn’t the first time a government official has raised the alarm about cyberthreats. Coats’ remarks strongly recall then–Defense Secretary Leon Panetta’s 2012 warnings about a potential “cyber-Pearl Harbor.” Still, Coats’ words suggest that what the intelligence community is seeing now constitutes something above and beyond the usual, expected level of online intrusion attempts and manipulation efforts—a kind of threat the likes of which we haven’t seen in nearly two decades. But for all their comparisons to Sept. 11, Coats and other members of the government’s intelligence community still haven’t given us a clear picture about what a cyber 9/11-like event would even look like. And if we’re going to continue talking about cyberattacks in such stark terms—and apparently we are—it’s important for leaders to explain what distinguishes the daily, routine cyber intrusions and attacks from the truly devastating ones. For all his comparisons to Sept. 11, Coats still hasn’t given us a clear picture about what a cyber 9/11-like event would even look like. The closest Coats came to giving a direct warning was to suggest that the 2018 midterm elections might feature some of the same kinds of Russian interference as the 2016 presidential election: more attempts to stoke political and social tensions on social media, more attempts to breach state election systems, and more attempts to hack into voter databases. He clarified that we are not yet seeing the kind of electoral interference this time around, though, he warned, “We fully realize that we are just one click of the keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself.” That would certainly not be good news—but neither would it be something new, or necessarily more devastating, than what we’ve seen before. Coats singled out Russia elsewhere in his talk, too, calling out Russian government actors for targeting public and private organizations in the “energy, nuclear, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors.” But, here again, it’s unclear if one of these might be the “critical infrastructure” he’s referring to in his warnings about a “crippling attack.” The sheer variety of these targets makes it hard to guess. Even if Coats has intelligence he’s not sharing (potentially for good reason) that suggests Russia has one of these specific marks picked out, there are lots of cyber intrusions and attacks that could be directed at any of those sectors—or the 2018 elections—that would not rise to the level of Sept. 11-scale damage. The standard example that cybersecurity alarmists typically trot out to illustrate what might be considered a “devastating cyberattack on critical infrastructure” is a strike that shuts down U.S. energy grids. No question, a full-scale shutdown of the power distribution systems in the United States would fit the bill. But there’s no particular reason to believe, based on his remarks, that this specific kind of attack is the one that Coats had in mind. It isn’t just Coats who has failed to explain what he means when he issues such grave warnings about the possibility of an imminent, devastating cyberstrike. In general, Americans haven’t done a very good job of anticipating what the next set of online threats might look like or how hackers might target us. Nor have we managed to reach much consensus over what kind of cyberthreat might be damaging enough to warrant analogies to the 9/11 attacks. The Russian interference in the 2016 elections provides a good example of the kind of online threat that, depending on who you ask, might or might not be considered a devastating attack on critical U.S. infrastructure or a so-called cyberwar. Similarly, some suggested the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks that shut down much of the U.K.’s National Health Service —as well as a number of other organizations worldwide, including transportation, telecommunications, and energy firms —constituted the first Cyber Pearl Harbor, while others dismissed it as nothing more than large-scale cybercrime. Ditto the ransomware shutdown of the city government of Atlanta earlier this year. Since we still can’t agree on what constitutes a devastating cyberattack, or even necessarily what counts as critical infrastructure (while the Department of Homeland Security has designated 16 critical infrastructure sectors, election infrastructure—the focus of many of Coats’ remarks—remains sort of a gray area despite a decision from the departing Obama DHS to give it the same “critical” classification ), it’s hard to see what purpose warnings about a looming cyber 9/11 or a cyber Pearl Harbor serve beyond drumming up misdirected anxiety and attention. Invoking these devastating days in our nation’s history implies that the digital threats we should be worried about will come in one individual, cataclysmic event—one so clearly devastating, and more damaging than any we’ve seen before, that such invocations will be unquestionably merited. But, for the moment at least, the threat landscape seems to be characterized more by a constant, gradual escalation of a diverse set of cyberattacks and other online threats. It’s an important distinction because those latter threats matter. These lower-level attacks can be seriously damaging, even if they don’t happen in the sudden, bloody, highly visible ways of those days that will live in infamy. Most of the types of cyberintrusions Coats references in his talk—interference in election systems, breaches of the country’s infrastructure, theft of trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, espionage by foreign powers—are unlikely to ever make it to those levels. That doesn’t make those threats less worrisome. But constantly invoking the threat of a looming Sept. 11-like attack detracts attention and resources from addressing the persistent and growing number of smaller strikes by suggesting there’s one bigger, scarier thing right around the corner. Instead of making us better prepared, it may just make the invocations of a looming cyber 9/11 even more tired.","In 2013, when I was in graduate school studying cybersecurity policy, the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, launched its annual Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge.

The county’s roughly 60 row-crop farmers now grow corn and soybeans for chicken feed. While the farms have adapted to meet shifting demand, it is the unseen changes happening underfoot that may have a long-lasting impact. In the fields beyond the picturesque manor, six-foot-tall salt-tolerant weeds thrive. Nearby, a decaying corn cob lies in bare, bleached soil pocked with patches of blue-green algae. Last year’s dismal corn yield was this field’s last: The leasing farmer abandoned a 30-acre parcel. It’s amazing corn plants grew at all. “The soil salt content is six to seven parts per thousand. Corn, typically, won’t grow once salt is more than 0.8 parts per thousand,” says Keryn Gedan, a wetland ecologist. On a windy, overcast October day, Gedan, from George Washington University, and her colleague Kate Tully, an agroecologist from the University of Maryland, are checking salinity levels at several of their seven test sites in the region, farmlands only a few feet above sea level. “We knew this was an area where we were likely to see impacts,” says Gedan. Sea-level rise near the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States, is twice as high as the global average. It’s not solely the result of atmospheric warming, melting ice, and expanding waters. The ground is also subsiding. This is happening for a variety of reasons, most notably aquifer withdrawals and the continued settling of land that had been pushed up by ice sheets to the north during the last Ice Age. “We are sinking and the water is rising,” says Michael Scott, a geographer at Salisbury University in Maryland. The result of this slow-motion catastrophe is that saltwater is threatening America’s first colonial farms. Salt is a notorious land degrader. On several occasions between 2,400 B.C. and 1,200 A.D., Mesopotamians fled once-productive agricultural regions when salt accumulated in the soil following excessive irrigation. Today, salt may be slithering onto the lower eastern shore’s farmlands by any number of routes—chronic flooding from an increasing number of high tides, saltwater intrusion into aquifers, and even wicking upward through the soil from shallow water tables. We don’t know the true extent of the Chesapeake Bay area’s salt problem because state and federal agencies have just put resources toward investigations. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources’ most recent regional report on chloride levels in lower eastern-shore aquifers was produced almost 30 years ago. The 1990 report predicted it would take 50 years for groundwater with a perceptibly salty taste to reach a future Princess Anne well—but this was based on projected pumping increases. Thirty years ago, climate change and sea-level rise were not on the radar. The area’s chief concern has been preventing agricultural runoff into the bay—a problem that will likely be made worse by salt. With little existing ability to predict where salt will move, it will be difficult to adapt, much less preserve, farmland and the cultural heritage that goes with it. Gedan and Tully cobbled together funding to document the salt damage in the area. New funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will help them expand their efforts. “The whole region is a window in the future,” says Gedan. “We are not treating this like the crisis that it is,” Scott adds. “If we don’t start operating as a collective effort soon, suddenly the problems will get much more expensive.” Not far from Almodington, Bob Fitzgerald farms land that has been in his family since 1666. His father, born in 1884, farmed this land with mules. Fitzgerald and his brother tromped through the nearby marsh as boys. Now, at 79, Fitzgerald says the marsh is rotten and the salt is seeping onto their soybean fields. The tide gate he installed helps, but high tides are getting higher and more frequent each year. “It’s not a new phenomenon,” says Fitzgerald. “But it’s accelerated immensely in the last 15 years.” He has studied historical maps of the region extensively. He laments that he could write a book called The Lost Villages of Somerset County. Past the ghost forest of salt-affected trees, unoccupied homes dot the road from his house to nearby Deal Island, a community grappling with how to adapt to sea-level rise. Fitzgerald’s observations match existing data, according to Sarah Wilkins, the former site coordinator for the Chesapeake Bay Sentinel Site of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rates of sea-level rise have accelerated over time, she says, based on tide-gauge data that dates back more than 70 years in some areas of the bay. Kevin Anderson, a fourth-generation farmer in Princess Anne, estimates he’s lost roughly 50 acres to salt damage in the last 20 years. With an operation that spans 4,000 acres and a successful seed-conditioning business, Anderson says he is in the fortunate position to expand his operation by leasing other land. Others aren’t so lucky. If he, like other farmers, were dependent solely on acreage he owns, he says salt damage would be one of his top concerns. Anderson and Fitzgerald, like most residents in this area, are accustomed to dramatic environmental changes. And they are nothing if not resilient. More than 400 islands have disappeared into the Chesapeake Bay since the area was settled 400 years ago. Holland Island had more than 300 residents 150 years ago, says Fitzgerald. Now, it’s gone. “When the people moved to nearby Deal Island or Crisfield, they moved the entire houses, bricks and all.” Anderson and Fitzgerald seem resigned to some losses. But those losses may exacerbate nutrient-pollution problems that have long plagued the bay. Many coastal farms are loaded with nitrogen and phosphorus, from a time when the enormous waste produced by chicken farms was often dumped in excess on agricultural fields. While that practice is no longer commonplace—and a new $1.4 million manure-to-energy plant now under construction will help dispose of the waste—saltwater intrusion could send those legacy nutrients into the bay. “We expect large nutrient losses as coastal farms undergo saltwater intrusion,” Tully said at the Ecological Society of America conference in Portland, Oregon, in August. “If you want to extract nitrogen or phosphorus from the soil, you add saltwater.” And those legacy nutrients, she explains, will likely have an outsize effect on water quality because of their proximity to the bay. Coastal farms are found on fingers of land that extend into the Chesapeake Bay. In between the fingers are a vast network of salty tidal rivers and creeks. The bay and its tidal tributaries boast 11,684 miles of shoreline. Yet, only 10 percent of the land drains well. Artificial drainage is widespread. At least two-thirds of the land area has been ditched, but the ditches are a mixed blessing, not only serving their intended purpose but also acting as a conduit for the saltwater to enter the fields. “When you are only feet above sea level to begin with, it’s a fine line between draining freshwater off your land and allowing saltwater on land,” says Don Webster, a waterfowl-habitat specialist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources in Cambridge. “So much of this farmland that has been influenced by salt is right on the front line of Chesapeake Bay—land that will be important to create buffers between the farm and the bay.” And it’s not just the Chesapeake Bay area. “Sea-level rise is happening now and penetrating deep into the coastal interior of North Carolina,” Emily Bernhardt, a biogeochemist at Duke University, told the Portland ESA meeting. About 30 percent of her study area is agricultural land. “Much of the land vulnerable to sea-level rise—5,900 square kilometers of North Carolina’s coastal plain—is subject to saltwater intrusion.” The degree of vulnerability depends to a great extent on whether people continue to maintain or abandon the pumping and water-control structures that were built to allow agriculture. In Maryland’s Somerset county, berms built decades ago to block tides from farmlands have now failed in some areas. And landowners are taking steps to protect productive fields. Almodington’s owner, Kevin Barr, an avid waterfowl hunter, plans to move many cubic tons of earth to turn a 25-acre salt-damaged parcel into freshwater wetlands. “I’m interested in finding the right balance between agriculture and wildlife,” he says. “But I’m not dependent on the farm to pay my bills.” Freshwater wetlands will prevent runoff from the crop fields reaching the bay, but marshes—which help control floods and are crucial wildlife habitat—need real estate as well, and it’s unclear how well they will move upland. “When wetlands have nowhere to migrate, huge chunks of habitat will be lost as sea-level rise continues,” says Scott. “We are at one of these threshold times where we still have capability to address this at a price point that isn’t going to hurt a lot of people.” In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established a total maximum daily load for all pollution into the Chesapeake Bay. The clean-up regimen has had modest success, yet farmers bristle at the prospect of additional regulations. Agriculture has survived over three centuries in this area, but the farmable area is being steadily chipped away. Somerset County, home to 211,200 acres, has roughly 28,500 cropped acres. Around 4,000 acres of now-saturated soils have been put into agricultural retirement programs in recent decades. Facing regulations or loss of land or both, farmers are finding that they must embrace two things: trust and data. The former is key in crafting a plan to adapt to changing conditions, says Michael Paolisso, an anthropologist at the University of Maryland who leads a project to bolster resilience in this inundated coastal community. But it’s also the most elusive. “In my experience, farmers aren’t as leery of climate change as much as they are the socioeconomic or political changes that come with it,” Paolisso says. Scott Andres, a hydrogeologist at the Delaware Geological Survey, also feels that communication problems between the agricultural community and government agencies have been a hurdle. With property values in mind, many farmers opt not to share their concerns about salt with officials. In the past couple of years, Michael Scott, of Salisbury University, has received calls from a handful of farmers in the region, asking for information on which land areas are likely to be impacted first by sea-level rise. They want any insights that can help them decide which lands to reasonably hold onto and which they’d be better off letting go. “I don’t have a lot of good answers. Most of the ones I have are fairly unpalatable—but we’re trying to help,” says Scott, who grew up in the area. Still, he laments, “the culture of the region feels under threat.” Scientists might have better answers if they had better data to draw on, although Kevin Anderson, the Princess Anne farmer, cautions that how the data is used is equally important. “My grandfather taught agriculture and he told his students agriculture is as much an art as it is a science,” he says. Models of sea-level rise are quite good, but saltwater intrusion is harder to piece together. It’s not just about the elevation of the land, it’s about the hydrology of the groundwater. For saltwater intrusion, we can see it on the landscape and test for it if we know where to look, but we’re not exactly sure how it all goes together, says Scott. “There’s a lot going on down there.” To better understand the links between sea-level rise and landward migration of saltwater, Andres recently received funding to track salinity shifts in both wells and streams. Kate Tully and Keryn Gedan plan to produce a map of salt levels in soils and hand-dug wells, soil types, hydrogeologic layers, and ditches—and then model where the salt will likely move. Meanwhile, Jeff Allenby, the director of conservation technology at the Chesapeake Conservancy, a nonprofit based in Annapolis, Maryland, is piecing together one of the largest high-resolution land-cover data sets in the world. Updated as new satellite imagery becomes available, it will provide real-time ability to track sea-level rise, as well as identify areas of declining crop health and opportunities for marsh migration upland. The key, Allenby stresses, will be to find a balance that keeps farmers farming while minimizing their impact on the environment. “The agricultural economy is critical to almost every county in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,” he says. “Counties couldn’t survive without it.” This article was produced in collaboration with the Food and Environment Reporting Network.",Sea-level rise might be causing salt to creep into the soil around America’s lower eastern shore.,2018-03-02T13:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",The Slow-Motion Catastrophe Threatening 350-Year-Old Farms,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/maryland-salt-farms/554663/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/03/IMG_4631/facebook.jpg?1519947102,,Theatlantic.com,catastrophe,0

Peter Brannen,"Identifying a killer can be difficult when it seems every murder weapon imaginable has been used in the crime, and when the victim is the entire planet. About 252 million years ago, a rich and wonderful world was annihilated in the worst mass extinction ever: the End-Permian, a catastrophe with no close competitor in Earth’s history. Volcanoes of a truly preposterous scale erupted in Siberia over many thousands of years, loosing all manner of chaos on the world. Rounding up, everything died. Diagnosing the particular flavor of chaos responsible for this mass death has proven elusive. The Siberian Traps, now long retired as a vast swath of basalt plateaus in the far northern reaches of Russia, might have poisoned the world with mercury. Or maybe they destroyed the ozone layer by incinerating huge underground layers of ancient evaporites. Or perhaps they acidified the planet with sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, stripping vegetation, killing corals worldwide, and so altering the chemistry of the planet’s soil that dirt would have tasted like vanilla. Or maybe the Traps wracked the planet with brief volcanic winters, or maybe they poisoned the planet with carbon dioxide itself, or the oceans became stagnant and poisoned with toxic hydrogen sulfide. Maybe that’s what killed everything. Or, maybe the oceans became stratified and nutrient-starved, and phytoplankton suffered. Or perhaps it was a lack of oxygen in the ocean that suffocated everything, or maybe it just got too damn hot.Some paleontologists have thrown up their hands and yielded to this overdetermination of kill mechanisms at the End-Permian, proposing an inelegant Murder on the Orient Express hypothesis of mass extinction that implicates the entire suite of killers. A new study, though, claims to pinpoint the primary killer from this murderer’s row: Among the slew of Very Bad Things implicated in the worst calamity the Earth has ever known, it was the global-warming-driven ocean anoxia that stands out as the primary agent of Armageddon. And in this reaper of the Paleozoic, the study’s authors see a future menace. “I think this study shows the end of the road that we’re heading down,” says the lead author, Justin Penn of the University of Washington, about our modern warming, and increasingly suffocating, oceans. As we’ve known since the 1860s, carbon dioxide is a very important greenhouse gas, and if you increase the amount of it in the atmosphere, it makes the planet warmer. At the end of the Permian, the volcanoes of Siberia, by burning through a giant basin filled with coal and other carbon-rich rocks, emitted enough carbon dioxide to warm the planet by a sweltering 10 degrees Celsius or so. Coincidentally, this is about the same magnitude of warming predicted for humanity in a modern burn-it-all scenario. “If we are truly the stupidest intelligent species ever, we probably could do the same thing,” says Curtis Deutsch, a co-author on the study. “As it is, we’re headed towards 3 to 4 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, which is nothing to sniff at. But 10 degrees isn’t that off the charts.” As the world warmed 10 degrees more than 250 million years ago, up to 96 percent of species in the ocean went extinct (for comparison, roughly 0 percent of modern species in the ocean have gone extinct so far in what’s been called “the sixth extinction”). For all the planet knew, it was time for complex life to close up shop after a nice quarter-billion-year run. After several millennia of eruptions from the Siberian Traps, the fossil record remained startlingly impoverished for almost 10 million years before limply convalescing in the ensuing Triassic period. [ Read: Earth is not in the midst of a sixth mass extinction ] To tease out what was primarily responsible for all this death in the oceans—in this, “the Great Dying”—Penn and colleagues developed a climate model, not dissimilar to those used to project future warming on our own modern world. Only in Penn’s model the continents were reunited. This was Pangaea, the mythic supercontinent that reached its apotheosis in the Permian period, joining Morocco with New Jersey and India with Antarctica. Then they lit this ancient world on fire. By jacking up the CO2 in their model high enough, Penn and colleagues were able to recreate the scorching temperatures of the End-Permian mass extinction, searing their ancient climate model maps in increasingly worrying shades of red. The flip side of a hot ocean is one with less oxygen, and it has long been known that the oceans of the End-Permian were gasping for the stuff. This paleoceanographic fact has been uncovered by geologists who have found the sickly presence of laminated, pyrite-rich ocean rocks in End-Permian rock outcrops around the word—from the Salt Range in Pakistan to the old whaling redoubt of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean. Even subtler, uranium isotopes in rocks from the catastrophe whisper dark rumors about the asphyxiation of the entire ancient ocean. By driving up the temperature in their model, Penn recreated this End-Permian oxygen loss as well. This is because oxygen is less soluble in hot water, so heat alone can cause oxygen to plummet in the ocean. But a hotter ocean is also a more sluggish and stratified one, so the depths become starved of its delivery as well. Even worse, the hotter it gets, the more oxygen animals need to power their metabolisms, so hot water quickly creates a crisis of supply and demand. By populating their model ancient ocean with modern creatures, like sharks and crabs and corals—creatures with a variety of tolerances to things like deoxygenation and temperature and pH—and then letting all climate hell break loose, Penn found that it was the heat-driven loss of oxygen in the ocean, more than any other factor, that could explain the end of the world. While essentially nothing was spared in this mass extinction, it appears from the fossil record that life at the poles was especially marked for destruction. And this makes sense in a world losing its oxygen. There’s more oxygen in colder waters at the poles, so the creatures there have adapted to it—and are especially sensitive to its diminishment. On the other hand, tropical creatures are adapted to warmer, more oxygen-poor waters. So if anyone is to survive on a world that’s about to become outrageously hot and lose three-quarters of its oxygen, it will be those hardy inhabitants of the low-latitudes. And that’s what’s seen in the fossil record. The tropics still faced an unthinkable cataclysm, but they fared mildly better. On the other hand, the predicament for polar creatures was not unlike those luckless creatures that today inhabit the tops of mountains, and will have no higher altitude to which to escape in the coming decades. “They’re shit out of luck,” says Deutsch. [ Read: The chilling regularity of mass extinctions ] When the ocean loses its oxygen, it’s something of a great leveler compared to other hypothesized mass-extinction mechanisms. Ocean acidification, for instance (what happens when too much CO2 reacts with seawater), has previously been proposed as the great killer of the End-Permian. But while acidification can have a surprisingly variable effect on the survival of different kinds of sea life, there is hardly any selectivity at all when oxygen disappears from an ecosystem. Everyone dies, matching the near-universal signal of slaughter in the ancient ocean. “This study suggests we should be worrying much more about hypoxia than about ocean acidification,” says Deutsch. “There’s vastly more resources being put into organisms’ responses to pH in seawater than there is into understanding temperature-dependent hypoxia. I think that the field has basically allocated those resources in exactly the wrong way.” The modern oceans have already lost 2 percent of their oxygen since 1960, a remarkable loss driven mostly by coastal nutrient pollution and global warming. It’s an environmental problem that promises to worsen in the warmer world of the coming centuries, just like it did in the End-Permian. And if the Earth’s past is any indication of its future, this asphyxiation could be truly world-changing. The prospect has led dozens of paleoclimatologists, geochemists, and oceanographers to sign The Kiel Declaration on Ocean Deoxygenation, developed this September to raise global awareness of a problem with increasingly worrying geological precedent. “This study shows that we’re on that same road toward extinction and the question is how far down it we go,” says Penn. To head off warming and drastic deoxygenation of the oceans, humanity can either stop burning fossil fuels, or artificially dim the amount of sunlight reaching the earth’s surface—a kludgey solution that goes by the name of geoengineering. One of the most hotly debated methods of geoengineering would involve shooting sulfate aerosols out of planes and into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space. Unfortunately, says the City College of New York geoscientist Benjamin Black, the End-Permian mass extinction represents something of a proof of concept for the idea, and it’s not pretty. In a paper published last week in Nature Geoscience, Black and coauthors describe not only the extreme warming of the climate around 252 million years ago, but also the extreme climate whiplashes that throttled the planet much shorter timescales. These environmental seesaws, the researchers show, were induced by volcanic sulfur dioxide from the Siberian Traps, which would have briefly cooled the planet and masked the warming, before being rained out of the atmosphere and allowing the planet to jump back into the high-CO2 inferno. Similarly, if humans embark on a geoengineering project of shooting sulfur dioxide into the air to head off all the problems of warming, without drastically reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere—and if it ever gives up on this project after it starts, for whatever reason, at any time in the next few thousand years—Black can imagine a similar disaster unfolding. “So if you think about the Siberian Traps and the End-Permian mass extinction as a feasibility study for global warming and sulfur geoengineering, the results of that study were... not the best,” he said, referring to, quite literally, the worst thing that’s ever happened. “It’s worth asking ourselves whether we really want to make our current predicament even more like the End-Permian mass extinction.”",The worst extinction in Earth’s history offers chilling predictions for the planet’s future—and for humanity’s efforts to keep climate doom at bay.,2018-12-06T19:45:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",A Portrait of Catastrophe in the World's Oceans,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/oxygen-loss-during-mass-extinction/577537/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/12/RTX1QT33/facebook.jpg?1544124875,,Theatlantic.com,catastrophe,0
Justin Worland,"The world moved closer to an existential catastrophe this year as the threat of nuclear warfare escalated, bringing the symbolic Doomsday Clock two minutes away from midnight, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said Thursday. The move of the Doomsday Clock to two minutes away from midnight, the symbolic time at which the planet meets a world-ending disaster, represents a 30-second jump from last year. It is the closest the planet has been to midnight since 1953 when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were testing hydrogen bombs. “To call the world’s nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy,” said Rachel Bronson, president of Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Scientists behind the report cited a long list of concerning geopolitical developments, many of which come back to President Donald Trump, as reason for the move: a halt in U.S. nuclear nonproliferation negotiations with Russia, Trump’s threat to decertify the Iran nuclear deal and escalating nuclear tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, often instigated by Trump on Twitter. At the same time, other countries like India and Pakistan have doubled down on their commitment to nuclear weapons. Climate change also factored into their decision to move the clock closer to midnight, scientists said. Last year, a slew of extreme weather events linked to climate change— including Caribbean hurricanes, and extreme heat waves — incurred damage across the world. Meanwhile, the Trump Administration has worked to undo policies aimed at addressing the issue. The scientists also listed a loss of public trust in media and science as a barrier to addressing the planet’s existential threats. “Divorcing public policy from empirical reality endangers us all,” said physicist Lawrence Krauss, a member of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. “What we need is evidence based policymaking.”","The world moved closer to an existential catastrophe this year as the threat of nuclear warfare escalated, bringing the symbolic Doomsday Clock two minutes away from midnight, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said Thursday.

Seraj Assi,"When the creation of the State of Israel 70 years ago led to a mass Palestinian exodus, only about 150,000 Palestinians out of nearly 1 million who had lived on the territory managed to remain within the new state. Among them were my grandparents. And yet, it wasn’t until I was 20 years old that I first heard of the nakba, an Arabic term meaning “catastrophe” that many Palestinians use to mark the events of 1948. Ironically, I heard the word from a Jewish friend at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In my excitement, I called my father and told him about my thrilling new discovery. He faltered, then advised me to get this nakba out of my system. I hung up and stood there dumbly, wondering at the way my father seemed to be shunning the truth of his own existence. For 20 years, he had managed to silence, suppress, and obliterate the mention of the very word that binds Palestinians together in a shared memory. But I could hardly blame him. Between 1948 and 1966, men like my father and grandfather were forced to live under a military regime imposed by Israel on its remaining Arab population. Their freedom of movement was controlled by Israeli permit requirements and curfews. They were restricted from seeing their fellow Palestinians and Arabs in neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt, in the West Bank and Gaza, and even in other towns and villages inside Israel. Haunted by the fresh memory of loss and displacement, the first generation of Arabs in Israel was born into national limbo. Virtually overnight, they became strangers in their own homeland. To my father, the nakba never truly ended. But whether out of fear or brutal realism, he refused to bequeath it to his son. He believed that third-generation Arabs in Israel could survive only through ignorance of what had come before. This was his mantra, one I heard repeated by him and other Palestinians of his generation. As a youth I was educated in Arab schools in a small village near Jaffa, where I tried to make sense of the internal chaos my history teachers bred in my mind. The word nakba was omitted from Arabic textbooks, not to mention Hebrew textbooks. My teachers never dared mention it. I recall Jewish officials coming to our school around Independence Day—in retrospect, they may have been trying to monitor for use of the n-word, though if that was the goal it was an absurd effort. At the time the students there had no idea that such a word even existed. If anything, we thought that nakba was Arabic for the Holocaust. The word “Palestine” and its derivations were equally absent. The history of Arab Palestine that had vanished in 1948 was passed over in silence among families like mine in Israel. The dream of a future Palestinian nationhood also went undiscussed within our schools and homes. We saw no such thing as a Palestinian people. Palestinians across the border were “West Bankers” and “Gazans” but never Palestinians; they, not the Israelis, were our “other.” We, the Palestinians within Israel, were simply “Arabs”—neither Israeli nor Palestinian, but a nebulous species devoid of national character, identity, and memory. Meanwhile, I was overfed with lectures about Israel’s independence, Zionist pioneers and peace doves, and the “Promised Land.” Israeli national myths—for instance, that Palestine was “a land without a people for a people without a land”—masqueraded as historical facts. Decorating the classroom walls were modern maps that labeled the West Bank as “Judea and Samaria,” a biblical designation used by Israelis who support the settlement enterprise. Zionist mantras, ranging from “God promised the land to the Jews” to “The Zionists made the desert bloom,” were repeated over and over, and Zionist platitudes were engraved deep in my Arab mind, even if some seemed mutually contradictory: “The Arabs fled because they were cowards.” “The Arabs attacked Israel first.” “Palestine was an empty land before the Zionists.” “Israelis have lived in the Land of Israel for 3,000 years.” Indeed, I believed that Israel had existed in Palestine from time immemorial. I remember asking my history teacher, “From whom did Israel gain independence in 1948?” He hummed, gazed out into the distance, and said nothing. I gathered from his silence that Israel was a biblical miracle, somehow both eternal and created, like a national “big bang.” I vividly recall those Independence Day moments when we Arab kids were herded into the schoolyard and ordered to stand still in memory of fallen Israeli soldiers. A long, torturous minute would pass before the siren died out and we burst into celebration, surrounded by fluttering Israeli flags and the melody of Hatikva, the Israeli national anthem. It’s no wonder Arabs in Israel continue to call Israel’s Independence Day “Independence Holiday.” In the end, it is not what I learned, but what I did not learn, that has most profoundly shaped my memory: I did not learn, for instance, what drove thousands of people to abandon their homes and flee for their lives—leaving behind warm beds and brewed coffee, damp laundry still hanging from their windows, millstones running at their doorsteps—never to return. There were no answers, only clues wrapped in decades of collective fear and repression. Today, I find it miraculous that I have lived and endured a life in Israel where, for much of it, nearly everybody was pretending that there had never been any nakba. For some Israeli Jews, the nakba never happened—or if it did, it happened because it had to happen. For some Arabs of my father’s and grandfather’s generations, the nakba must not happen again, even in remembrance. But for young Palestinians of my generation, the nakba happened and happens still. Some of us feel as if our elders were enlisted to help hide the truth, and we frown sternly on their complicity in breeding a collective amnesia. Yet we also realize that for our fathers and grandfathers in Israel, keeping quiet about it was a survival tactic: The erasure bolstered their endurance. The irony is that those who lived the real nakba are still less inclined to invoke it than those who, like myself, are living it symbolically and from afar. Israel has never officially accepted responsibility for the nakba, let alone taught it as part of its history. In 2011, Israel went so far as to pass the “Nakba Law,” which authorizes the finance minister to reduce state funding for institutions that mark Israel’s Independence Day as a day of mourning. This law restricts the ability of Palestinians to publicly commemorate a tragic past. Israel seems to be under the perilous illusion that it can write off the national aspirations of millions of Palestinians by simply rewriting history. But history flows like a river out of the past into the present. As a Palestinian Arab who was born and raised in Israel, and who has inherited the double shock of catastrophe and independence, defeat and victory, erasure and memory, I feel like I am standing in the middle of a bridge where I can see both banks of the river. Perhaps one day Israelis too will walk that shaky bridge and see what lies on the other bank.","How does a boy growing up in Israel remember how many of his people lost their homes in 1948, if no one will teach him?",2018-05-15T14:08:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Why My Father Made Me Forget Our Palestinian Catastrophe,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/palestine-nakba-day/560231/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/05/father_son/facebook.jpg?1526391959,,Theatlantic.com,catastrophe,0

Reuters Editorial,"GAZA (Reuters) - Dozens of Palestinian youths gathered by the Gaza-Israel border on Saturday, though the area remained mostly quiet, a day after deadly violence broke out in one of the biggest Palestinian demonstrations there in years. In the southern Gaza Strip, residents said Israeli troops fired warning shots toward a crowd of youths, some of whom burned tyres. Health officials said two people were wounded and an Israeli military spokesman said he was checking the details. On Friday, at least 15 Palestinians were killed by Israeli security forces confronting protesters, some of whom the military said had opened fire, rolled burning tyres and hurled rocks and fire bombs toward troops across the border. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared Saturday a national day of mourning and a general strike was called across the occupied West Bank. Thousands in Gaza marched through the streets at funerals for those killed. Tens of thousands of Palestinians had gathered on Friday along the fenced 65-km (40-mile) frontier, where tents were erected for a planned six-week protest pressing for a right of return for refugees and their descendents to what is now Israel. The Israeli military estimate was 30,000. Families brought their children to the encampments just a few hundred metres (yards) from the Israeli security barrier with the Islamist Hamas-run enclave. Football pitches were marked out in the sand and scout bands played. But as Friday wore on, hundreds of Palestinian youths ignored calls from the organizers and the Israeli military to stay away from the frontier, where Israeli soldiers on the other side kept watch from dirt mound embankments, and violence broke out. PALESTINIANS MARKING “CATASTROPHE” The protest, organized by Hamas and other Palestinian factions, is scheduled to culminate on May 15, the day Palestinians commemorate what they call the “Nakba” or “Catastrophe” when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes in 1948, when the state of Israel was created. Israel has long ruled out any right of return, fearing an influx of Arabs that would wipe out its Jewish majority. It argues that refugees should resettle in a future state the Palestinians seek in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Peace talks to that end have been frozen since 2014. Abbas’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said: “The message of the Palestinian people is clear. The Palestinian land will always belong to its legitimate owners and the occupation will be removed.” Israeli military spokesman Brigadier-General Ronen Manelis said Hamas was using the protests as a guise to launch attacks against Israel and ignite the area. He said violence would likely continue along the border until May 15. “We won’t let this turn into a ping-pong zone where they perpetrate a terrorist act and we respond with pinpoint action. If this continues we will not have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip,” Manelis told reporters in a phone briefing. The Gaza Health Ministry had said on Friday 16 people were killed but revised the death toll to 15 on Saturday.

Nash Jenkins,"Nearly eight years ago, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stood on the floor of his chamber and delivered an angry invective against what he saw as the Obama Administration’s rampant spending, something he described as a national catastrophe. “The kind of spending and debt that Democrats are engaged in,” he said dramatically, “is like nothing this country has ever seen. And it threatens not only the livelihoods of our children: it threatens our national security and the very safety net Democrats claim they want to protect.” On Thursday evening, Congress steeled itself for the second government shutdown in less than three weeks, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky taking to the Senate floor to delay a crucial vote on a government spending package hours ahead of the deadline. Paul is arguably the Senate’s fiercest deficit hawk, and his point was simple: the party of austerity was no longer. The package in question would drastically raise tight spending caps imposed in 2013, hiking defense and non-defense spending by more than $300 billion over the next two years. And this is paltry compared to the $1.5 trillion cost of the G.O.P.’s tax reform bill, which they rammed through Congress in December. “It’s not a conservative spending proposal. In fact, it’s the opposite,” Paul told TIME in the Capitol basement on Thursday morning. “When Democrats are in power, Republicans appear to be the conservative party, and when Republicans are in power, there is no conservative party.” Grumbling Republican staffers denounced Paul’s floor speech — which went on for nearly an hour and included numerous posters illustrating government waste — as little more than political theater. But it seems difficult to disagree with his conclusion: that the party of deficit hawks and small government only cares about the debt and the deficit when Democrats are in power. The new spending deal is the result of bipartisan talks between McConnell, who is now the Senate’s Majority Leader, and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Chuck Schumer, and the culmination of years of bitterness about the austerity policy passed in 2013 that culled government spending by tens of billions of dollars. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has urged his members to vote for the bill. On the one hand, it’s a feat of bipartisanship in a Congress defined by anything but: Republicans control both chambers and the White House for the first time in a decade, and Democrats have very much been relegated to their minority status on crucial legislative issues, like tax reform and immigration. On the other, it marks an abandonment of long-stated principles from those Republicans who railed repeatedly against the climbing debt and deficit during the Obama years. Only a small bloc of fiscal conservatives, among them Paul, appeared willing to speak out against the caps deal on Thursday. “Any person in the Milky Way who cares about fiscal responsibility has to be concerned about the deficit contribution of this bill,” Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said. “And it does bother me. But there are a lot of good things in it — I feel like I have to choose between love and honor here, and I don’t know how I’m going to vote.” But most rank-and-file members were evasive when approached about the caps deal’s impact on the debt and deficit, turning to boilerplate talking points to avoid the topic. “We’re trying to get the government going again,” Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said. “We’re trying to start legislating.” “I believe what we did with tax reform is going to grow our economy,” Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina said, when asked about the deal. “That’s not true,” Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said, when asked if the G.O.P. is no longer the party of austerity. “We’re the party that wants to see the budget balance and deficit addressed. But 70% of federal funding is on autopilot, and sometimes you have emergencies — disasters and things like rebuilding the military so they’re ready to fight the next war or keep the peace.” However, Cornyn described the caps agreement, reached behind closed doors between only party leadership, as “a lousy way to do business.” “You get this big, ugly caps deal which denies the rank and file members the opportunity for input and doesn’t have the kind of transparency that we’d like to see,” Cornyn said. “But this is the hand we’ve been dealt.” Still, nothing was certain on Thursday afternoon, with less than 12 hours to go before the government shutdown deadline. Though the bill was expected to pass the Senate, its future was uncertain in the House. Democrats in the lower chamber seemed prepared to withhold their votes to strong-arm House Republican leadership into giving them a commitment on an immigration compromise — a strategy that evokes their Senate colleagues’ tactic that led to the last government shutdown.","Nearly eight years ago, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stood on the floor of his chamber and delivered an angry invective against what he saw as the Obama Administration’s rampant spending, something he described as a national catastrophe. “The k…",2018-02-08T23:48:51Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Rand Paul Is Leading a Last-Minute Fight Against the Budget Deal,http://time.com/5139462/rand-paul-filibuster-government-shutdown-congress-budget-vote/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-915438526.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,catastrophe,0

PCMag,"TGIF, everybody. I'm sure you probably have big plans for the weekend, but if those plans include the couch, a pair of comfy pants, and your remote, here are a few shows and movies you might want to cue up.
Each week, the PCMag features team will take turns highlighting the streaming content they're excited to watch or think you should binge. Feel free to leave your suggestions in the comments.
Billions (Showtime)
Bobby Axelrod returns this weekend with a new ally and a burning desire to destroy Taylor Mason. Catch up on last season's twists and turns via the Showtime app before the fourth season of Billions premieres on Sunday, March 17 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.
High Maintenance (HBO)
If the cutthroat world of hedge funds and New York politics has you on edge, chill out with HBO's High Maintenance. The series, now in its third season, offers charming vignettes of New Yorkers trying to get by with a little help from an affable weed dealer known only as The Guy. In some episodes, he's the focal point, in others, he floats in and out of the stories unfolding on the screen. Watch the series from the beginning, jump into season three, or just do whatever, man.
Shrill (Hulu)
In the typical Hollywood production, fat characters are depicted as desperately trying to lose weight to get the guy, fit into that dress, or otherwise mold themselves into a wispy vision of perfection deemed acceptable by magazines, fashion designers, and society at large. Shrill is not that story. The Hulu adaptation of writer Lindy West's best-selling memoir, this series follows Annie (SNL's Aidy Bryant) as she tries to change her life but not her body. It premieres on March 15.
PEN15 (Hulu)
Middle school is the worst, no matter when you attended. But for Anna and Maya, the year is 2000, and the inseparable duo are super excited for seventh grade. Unfortunately, Maya's bowl cut and Anna's awkwardness don't do them any favors, but their pain is our cringe-y comedy gold.
The show is intended for adults nostalgic for some 90s goodness; Maya and Anna are actually played by actresses in their 30sPEN15 creators Maya Erskine and Anna Konklewhile their classmates are played by pre-teen actors. It's an odd setup, but it works, and allows for some hijinks that would likely be inappropriate for younger actors. Watch the 10-episode first season on Hulu now.
Queer Eye Season 3 (Netflix)
You know who would never shame Maya or Anna? The Fab Five. The Queer Eye boys return for a third season today, bringing love and style to a new group of people who need a little made-for-TV TLC.
Catastrophe Season 4 (Amazon Video)
Four seasons in and Sharon and Rob are still together, going through the usual ups and downs of marriage and kids. Enjoy their banter, as this is the last season of Catastrophe.
The Lives of Others (Netflix)
In 1984, Gerd Wiesler, a member of the East German secret police, is ordered to eavesdrop on a prominent playwright, Georg Dreymanbecause, among other things, Wiesler's boss has a thing for Dreyman's girlfriend, a popular actress. The unassuming Wiesler sets up shop in Dreyman's attic and listens to his every word. But how much does he tell his boss? Find out in The Lives of Others, which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006, and arrives on Netflix today.
Colette (Amazon Video)
Do you work with someone who takes credit for your work? Then you'll empathize with Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, whose husband Willy passes her series of novels off as his own in this late 19th century period drama. She puts up with it for awhile, but ultimately has the last laugh. Celebrate Women's History Month by watching Colette on Amazon Video.
Killing Eve (Hulu)
If you're a Grey's fan who's missed Sandra Oh on your TV screen, her terrific portrayal of Eve Polastri, an MI5 officer on the hunt for a crafty hitwoman, will certainly hit the spot. Season two doesn't air on BBC America until April, but you can catch up with season one on Hulu.

Proma Khosla,"Climate change is probably coming for us like the Night King's army on Game of Thrones, but at least we get to start the year with a snow day and some work-mandated remote hours. So now that you're out of school or the office and trapped in swirling vortex of icy tomb, WHAT SHOULD YOU WATCH FIRST? Fear not, cold brethren, for we have you covered. Check out 10 shows you can binge right now to make the most of your bomb cyclone long weekend. SEE ALSO: 27 reasons 2018 might not totally suck (pop culture edition) 1. Search Party The TBS show may seem like formula on paper; it's got a core cast of New York millennials who are struggling and self-absorbed, but Alia Shawkat, John Early, Meredith Hagner, and John Paul Reynolds are an alchemical combination. What gives the show its edge is how well it teeters on the ed of the macabre; Dory (Shawkat) becomes morbidly fascinated with a missing high school classmate to the point where the search consumes her life and thoughts. Season 2 deals with the fallout from a shocking finale and is as transfixing and perversely humorous as the first. We say from experience that you can binge a season in a day. Where to watch: TBS website 2. The Good Place Yes it's that show that no one will shut up about, and for good reason! (GOOD, get it?) Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) finds herself in the Good Place after she dies, but figures out quickly that there's been some kind of monumental mistake and she doesn't belong there. She tries to become a better person with help from Chidi (William Jackson Harper) and to coexist with neighbors Tahani (Jameela Jamil) and Jianyu (Manny Jacinto), but the Good Place has more secrets than they bargained for. If you haven't watched Season 2, what are you waiting for?? It's amazing. And if you haven't watched Season 1, get over here and join us! Where to watch: Hulu 3. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Midge Maisel finds an unlikely calling in standup comedy after her husband leaves her. From Gilmore Girls ' creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, Mrs. Maisel is expertly paced, balancing Midge's emerging career (including a day job at a department store), family life (mainly her proud Jewish parents, played brilliantly by Tony Shalhoub and Marin Hinkle), and the looming crater of her marriage, which 1950s culture values above all else. Where to watch: Amazon Prime 4. Lovesick When Dylan finds out he has chlamydia, he's forced to confront every woman he's every slept with in this endearing British comedy. Since he's reaching out to them in alphabetical order, we piece together his romantic journey bit by bit over the show's three seasons (Season 3 just arrived, you lucky dog). Where to watch: Netflix 5. The Leftovers Be warned: This show is heavy. But The Leftovers – about those left on the planet after two percent of the population mysteriously disappears – deals remarkably with collective grief and the exhausting journey to heal. You get the sense that this was the show Lost producer Damon Lindelof always wanted to make; haunting, calamitous, and cautiously spiritual. It pulls phenomenal performances from its cast, particularly Carrie Coon, Ann Dowd, and Christopher Eccleston, with no shortchanging Justin Theroux as the tortured Kevin Garvey. Does the end of life as we know it inevitably lead to the end of the world? Where to watch: HBO 6. Master of None Whether you've been meaning to tackle it since Season 1 or never caught up on Season 2, tuck in with a bowl of pasta (trust us) and this charming passion project from Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang. From immigrant parents to online dating to more than one Emmy-winning episode, it's worth bingeing again and again. Also, Season 2, episode 9 is literally about a snow day...what could be more perfect? Where to watch: Netflix 7. The Americans This might be a little too close to home what with the whole Russian collusion ~thing~, but FX's drama about Soviet spies in D.C. is nothing if not thought-provoking, and addictive to boot. Philip and Elizabeth Jennings are deep undercover, the very picture of wholesome, homegrown Americans – with two children born on U.S. soil. Hidden by the front of a travel agency where they both work is a legacy of devoted espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union – a reputation threatened when an FBI agent moves into the house next door. Where to watch: Amazon Prime 8. Big Mouth Big Mouth takes a look at puberty in a way that no other animated show has done before, being brutally honest about what all those stupid hormones did to our growing bodies while simultaneously getting really really weird about seventh graders’ sexualities. Created by comedian Nick Kroll, his childhood best friend Andrew Goldberg, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett, Big Mouth is a hilarious show that you would never want to watch with your parents, but is perfect for bundling up under a blanket alone and doing hot cocoa spit takes at your screen. - Kellen Beck Where to watch: Netflix 9. Catastrophe You might not think you’d enjoy spending seven and a half hours (that’s 18 24-minute episodes) cooped up with a couple that alternates between bickering affectionately and bickering angrily. But that’s just because you haven’t seen Catastrophe yet. Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney star as two people pushed together when a no-strings weekend hookup results in a pregnancy – and find that they rather like being together in spite of themselves. Crackling chemistry and cutting humor make the central pairing a pleasure to watch, while a strong cast of recurring stars (including Carrie Fisher, Extras ' Ashley Jensen, and Black Mirror' s Daniel Lapaine) livens up the rest of the universe. - Angie Han Where to watch: Amazon Prime 10. American Vandal You will breeze through the eight-episode saga of Dylan Maxwell, a high school senior accused of vandalizing teachers' cars with giant graffiti penises. Dylan maintains that he's innocent and a student investigation reveals that there is indeed more to the story –– lies, conspiracy, and a corrupt system that may in fact uncover the true culprit.

Peter Brannen,"In Italy, the dawn of the greatest empire in the history of the world is marked, not by broken marble pediments strewn across the seven hills of Rome, but modest three-toed footprints pressed into rocks far to the north, high in the Italian Alps. They were left by coastal dinosaurs patrolling the tidal flats of a tropical lagoon over 230 million years ago, and they’re among the earliest in Earth’s history. Perhaps more remarkable, though, than this sudden appearance of dinosaurs in ancient Europe, are the strange rocks which host them. The legendary reptile trackways appear just above crumbling bands of red clay that cut through the cream-colored peaks of the Dolomites—a striking dash in the strata that marks one of the most bizarre climate events ever. Almost a quarter-billion years ago, rains soaked the arid wastes of the supercontinent Pangaea for more than a million years. When the floodwaters retreated, a new world was born. I joined up with paleontologist Massimo Bernardi in Trento, Italy hoping to learn more about this primeval washout, known as the Carnian Pluvial Episode. It was one of the oddest climate events, and most severe biotic crises, in the history of life. We hopped into the museum truck of his Museo Delle Scienze and, before long, were winding through apple orchards that sloped off sun-splashed towers of ivory and rose-tinted dolomite. Here in northern Italy’s Adige Valley you’re as likely to be served strudel as gelato and, traveling from one mountain village to another represents a linguistic island-hop between Italian, German and even Ladin, an ancient relic of Roman occupation. But among the jagged peaks that carve up this cultural collage Bernardi was more interested in literal island-hopping between 230-million-year-old tropical atolls that had been thrust toward the stars and draped in snow. Here in the mountains, the bottom of a prehistoric ocean meets the top of the sky, and gondolas hoist skiers up these ancient reef walls like alpine ammonites. In fact, the entire Dolomite region is a playground of exhumed lagoons, shallow seas, and tidal flats, part of a swath of Triassic rocks that extends all the way to Slovenia—lifted into the air ages later by Africa’s languid drift northward. “Of course, they’re just rocks for most people,” said Bernardi about his hometown limestone, which piled up almost 2 miles thick in places, “But I kind of like trying to be the voice of those rocks.” Bernardi is part of an international group of Carnian Pluvial Episode researchers, trying to reconstruct how this obscure spasm of extreme climate change tucked into the middle of the Triassic period rerouted the trajectory of life on Earth, and—if he’s right—launched the near-eternal age of the dinosaurs. The crisis started with a familiar culprit. Two hundred and thirty-four million years ago, gigantic pulses of carbon dioxide erupted into the atmosphere from volcanoes at the bottom of the ocean—volcanoes whose frozen magma today can be found on the other side of the planet, grafted onto the side of British Columbia. This earthly belch of CO2 drove intense bouts of global warming, ocean acidification, mass extinction, and, most notably, a barrage of extreme rainfall and mountain-flattening mega-monsoons still visible in rocks around the world. In Italy, the episode appears in places as a muddy red mess, many meters thick, that laterally slices through the white ocean rock of the Dolomites. Above and below this incongruous red-clay layer, in the kilometers of classic dolomite that sandwich it, one can find seashells living in what were the former white sands and reefs of a prehistoric Bora Bora–like platform almost 50 miles offshore. But among the surprising red layers of the Carnian Pluvial Episode itself one suddenly finds coals from forests, and lake sediments. The onshore world had somehow overrun the offshore one. [ Read: That dinosaur-killing asteroid? It triggered global warming, too ] The global warming pulse had fueled violent storms and lashing rains that attacked Pangaea, leveled the topography—eroding away whatever interesting terrain existed on the mainland—and dumped it all into the ocean. In the Dolomites the tropical island paradise was suddenly smothered by this red mud and swallowed up by a bloating supercontinental shoreline. Similar signals of extreme rainfall and humidity are found in rocks all over the earth, from Japan to Argentina, as lakes and rivers briefly soaked a parched Pangaea. The extreme climate change apparently stressed trees so much that—from Hungary to Arizona—they exploded in resin (a defense mechanism seen in modern conifers under duress), leaving behind the first widespread deposits of amber in the fossil record, as documented by University of Göttingen botanist Leyla Seyfullah. Like other similar heat waves deep in Earth’s past, the crisis was accompanied by sweeping extinctions. A menagerie of lumbering beasts (many of them unfairly consigned to the C-list of natural-history museums), like rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts, was all but exterminated; while in the ocean the disaster is marked by a massacre of reefs, sea lilies, shelled octopus relatives, and a sinuous group of marine reptiles called thalattosaurs. Oxygen isotopes from the fossil teeth of tiny sea creatures reveal that the entire episode was kicked off by warming of only about 4–7 degrees Celsius—roughly the same magnitude predicted for our own world under a business-as-usual carbon-emissions scenario. “We don’t need an experiment in a laboratory to tell us what happens when CO2 rises quickly, because it’s there in the rocks,” Bernardi told me about this ancient natural experiment that the planet ran all on its own. “It is written.” But perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the Carnian Pluvial Episode was not the crisis itself, but the world that came after. Until then, dinosaurs had been a puny and obscure lineage confined to the furthest southern reaches of Pangaea. But by the time the crisis was over, they had spread all over the world—perhaps using the oddly humid pulse to hopscotch across the previously arid wastelands of Pangaea—and rapidly diversified, using the extinction of their competitors to experiment with new lifestyles. The planet would never be the same. Bernardi pulled the museum truck up next to a typical tree-frosted colossus of beige rock that loomed over the valley floor. Halfway up, the cliff face was improbably interrupted by a crumbling medieval castle that had somehow been built into it more than 800 years ago. The castle apparently belonged to an older woman who waylaid us from her car window to complain to Bernardi in Italian about some teen trespassers, before driving away. Bernardi strapped on a helmet. “You should not go up there, it’s not the safest place,” he said, pausing to size up the cliff before us. “It can be done.” With that, we began climbing. The rocks before us, some studded with seashells, were from sometime in the middle of the Triassic—an endlessly fascinating period that lasted from 252 to 201 million years ago. The Triassic was one of the most unstable periods in the history of life. It kicked off in the wretched and scorching aftermath of Armageddon, as the planet struggled to recover from the greatest mass extinction it would ever endure, the dread End-Permian mass extinction. (The earth’s cruelty to its own creatures knew no bounds in this terrible age, as a mere 3 million years after the apocalypse another minor mass extinction, the “Smithian-Spathian,” would punish the survivors for their courage.) And the Triassic concluded 50 million years later with a terrifying runner-up to doomsday: the End-Triassic mass extinction (like the Carnian Pluvial Episode, both the End-Permian and End-Triassic mass extinctions were carbon dioxide–driven global-warming disasters). But sometime between these bookending nightmares came the impressive rise of the dinosaurs, mammals, and crocodilians, as well as modern conifers, corals, and even plankton. The Carnian Pluvial Episode has long been seen as something of a stratigraphic curio buried in the middle of this stack of time, dismissed by some geologists as a local or unimportant event. But amazingly, as the fossil record has come into finer resolution in recent years, not only has an overlooked mass extinction been uncovered in the Episode, but the closer the dramatic origin of all these creatures has edged toward the immediate aftermath of the mysterious event as well. It marked just as much a planetary birth as death. [ Read: The chilling regularity of mass extinctions ] “We have been stuck with a definition of extinction that is very easy to understand but is very misleading,” said Bernardi, as I struggled to keep up on our hike. “Extinction is more or less thought of as death, as the end, as something that does not go forward. That’s obviously true but it’s just half of the history. And some of the events are more easily described by what is happening after than before.” When we finally reached the castle in the cliff—what was left of it, at least—Bernardi informed me that we were, in fact, standing in the Carnian Pluvial Episode itself. And it was no coincidence that this medieval redoubt had been built into the exact line in the rocks that marked the ancient cataclysm. In the mountain of hard, island-paradise rock beneath us, before the event, there were no dinosaurs anywhere in Europe. Where we were standing though, in the castle ruins, was a cavity, a natural cave. Eroded out of the cliff face were the strange Pangaean red clays—the very same that had been dumped into the ocean by the unexpected megamonsoons of the Carnian Pluvial Episode, and that marked the fever of global warming. This disaster layer was softer than the otherwise hard ocean rock, and had thus been worn away. As a result, the ancient disaster had left a gap in the strata—and the perfect place to build a castle. And, above us, more than a million years later, in the natural ceiling of the castle when the hard dolomite rock of an offshore Bahamas returned, and the Triassic world recovered, Bernardi pointed to the arrival of the dinosaurs: those unmistakable birdlike footprints of the planet’s most legendary inhabitants, pressed into this former tidal flat, now a ceiling in the mountains. I asked Bernardi whose footprints he thinks will be found in the rock layers above our own chemistry experiment with the planet. ""I think we don’t actually know how the grand scheme works and that is the scariest thing,” he said. “Because we might be just very close to changing something that then creates cascades of effects that we don’t know. We don’t know how it all works.” Today we find ourselves at another very strange moment in the planet’s history. In the coming decades our climate may return to a state that has analogues only deep in geological time. The global water cycle could intensify by 24 percent by 2100. Who knows what this will mean for a civilization already struggling to accommodate unprecedented rainfall events like Hurricanes Harvey and Florence, and Japanese floods that, in recent months, forced the evacuation of almost 2 million people and an intensification of storms worldwide. In these liminal moments before our planet truly leaps backward into geological history, the need to understand strange events like the Carnian Pluvial Episode has taken on new urgency. We know that when you kick the climate system hard enough truly crazy things happen to the planet. And we know that we’re kicking it about as hard as possible. But the lesson for posterity is that, however temporary these climate paroxysms, the world that comes after is never the same as the world that came before. Later in the day, after a vertiginous gondola ride, we met Bernardi’s colleague Piero Gianolla on top of the snow-capped peak of Sass Pordoi, an alpine perch that provided jaw-dropping views of the Dolomites’ jagged kingdom. Gianolla traced for me, across the immense, wintry landscape, how the narrow band of Carnian Pluvial Episode geology—more than a million years of stormy chaos—slipped secretly across the countryside. The eroding red line shaped not only caves in the sides of cliffs, but the entire vista of mountains before us: Here, the ubiquitous red-clay layer had broken some of the peaks in half and, there, produced vast flat plateaus of red rock spattered with the footsteps of early dinosaurs. Though they are often thought of as the mascots for mass extinction, dinosaurs benefitted tremendously from the specter of indiscriminate destruction and climate chaos over their entire history—from this, the Carnian Pluvial Episode, to the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic which took out their crocodilian competitors and ensured the dinosaurs’ reign for over 100 million years. But mass extinction is an untameable fire and, in the end, brings about the fall of even the most storied empires. Two hundred and thirty-four million years ago a path was cleared by climate change for the dinosaurs’ eventual dominance—propelling a previously unimpressive tribe toward greatness, like a band of ragged but resourceful Romans overthrowing the Etruscans. If our species is in the late stages of empire, for whom are we clearing a path?","“The need to understand strange events like the Carnian Pluvial Episode has taken on new urgency.""",2018-10-22T14:19:38Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",A Climate Catastrophe Paved the Way for the Dinosaurs’ Reign,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/dinosaurs-dolomites/573286/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/10/RTX1MKEE/facebook.jpg?1539957960,,Theatlantic.com,catastrophe,0
Alison Foreman,"Talk about fighting Fyre with Fyre. 
In a surprise turn of events, Hulu has released its Fyre Festival documentary, Fyre Fraud, just four days before its competitor, Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, is due to begin streaming on Netflix. 
Stealing more than some of Netflix's publicity thunder on social media, Hulu's unexpected release coincides with the publication of numerous positive reviews for Netflix's documentary. Both projects center around the fraudulent activity of Billy McFarland, the entrepreneur-turned-felon behind the infamous 2017 Fyre Festival scambut only Hulu's features an interview with McFarland himself. 
Netflix did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment on the situation, while Hulu declined to comment on the record to Mashable about their decision.

Given the apparent shade of it all, streamers are naturally weighing in on the dueling docs.
Most are focusing on the savageness of Hulu's surprise release approach, a generally effective PR art form regularly employed by Netflix. As many are pointing out, Fyre Fraud's debut came with zero warning from Hulu.

Rhett Jones,"There was once a time when people had to go to a theater to watch movies. There was also a time when they called Moviefone to hear an automated message slowly read out the showtimes. MoviePass is trying to revive that first golden age and has now decided to throw its considerable weight behind the second, buying the showtimes company that most people probably thought was dead. Moviefone is still alive, but it’s a shadow of its former self. Of course, few people want to wait around listening to showtimes on the phone anymore, so Moviefone has a website that’s a lot like Fandango. There’s news about films in theaters, on DVD, and streaming services. You can also find local showtimes on the companus’s site, but when you go to purchase a ticket you ultimately end up doing it through Fandango’s payment service. Still, the site gets “over 6 million monthly unique visitors,” according to a statement sent to Gizmodo from MoviePass’s parent company, Helios &amp; Matheson. When Moviepass first announced that it would offer a subscription to see a film a day in theaters for just 10 bucks a month, people probably had a similar feeling that they do hearing this Moviefone news. The name sounds vaguely familiar, but they haven’t heard about it in years. So far, MoviePass is losing a buttload of money, but it’s growing at a crazy pace and continually cutting prices —that makes the film industry nervous. At first, it doesn’t seem like Moviefone holds all that much value for Moviepass, but it got it for a steal. According to the statement, Helios and Matheson will pay Oath (Verizon) $1 million in cash and supply it with about $8 million worth of common shares in its company. Oath also gets warrants to purchase up to $14 million worth of stock. In 1999, AOL paid $388 million for Moviefone. Oath purchased AOL and Yahoo, and now its offloading Moviefone in a fire sale. What Moviepass is buying is a platform with millions of monthly visitors that it can use to promote its inexpensive service. It’ll be hard to resist trying out Moviepass if there’s a big reminder that you’re paying more for a single ticket than the price of a monthly subscription. But MoviePass likes to make big bets, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it also starts pumping some investment into Moviefone to make it a stronger competitor against Fandango. From the beginning, MoviePass has said that it just wants to cut some deals with theater chains and studios to get a cut of the increased revenue it provides and to individually promote certain films. It also plans to act as a sort of Groupon-type service offering promotions for things to do before and after a movie. Some theaters are happy to take the boost they’re getting right now but they’re skeptical that MoviePass will be able to survive. AMC has notably resisted the new service and the two companies have been at war. What Moviepass wants is leverage to bargain. It’s building up millions of subscribers that accept its often poor customer service because it’s such a great deal. It’s also gotten into making film acquisitions of its own that it’ll eventually be able to promote through its service. Now, it’s picking up a news service and a potential way to gain leverage over online ticket sales. The Moviepass tentacles continue to spread while the VC money burns, but the all or nothing strategy has been tried and true for Silicon Valley startups for over a decade. Moviepass may end up being a savior for the theater industry the way streaming music has pulled the record business back from catastrophe. It could also end up being another behemoth that hollows out legacy businesses and takes over the way Facebook and Uber have cannibalized the media and transportation fields. Whatever its endgame, Moviepass is trying to go big.",There was once a time when people had to go to a theater to watch movies.

SIOBHAN BURKE,"A couple of weeks before the premiere, Ms. Ahuvia spoke about the work’s evolution. Below are edited excerpts from that conversation. Was folk dancing a big part of your life growing up? It became a bigger part of my life when we moved back to Florida. It was one way of staying connected to Israel. My mom had been a folk dancer, semiprofessionally. We went to weekly gatherings at the JCC [Jewish Community Center], and when we moved to Hawaii, joined another gathering there. Video What inspired this piece? Before this piece I made a solo that was returning to the dances in a more emotional way; it was more about my relationship to them. I talked at the time about making these dances and songs face the Nakba, which is what Palestinians call the founding of the state of Israel. [Nakba is the Arabic word for “catastrophe.”] How could I hold onto my heritage and also this other reality? I wasn’t really looking at how the dances were constructed. This piece came out of wanting to investigate that more deeply. I knew the dances were an integral part of this Zionist enterprise, and you could see that in a liberatory way or see some of the colonial mechanisms in it. I was looking for a way to communicate that. One issue you explore is cultural appropriation, how the pioneers of Israeli folk dance, mostly Eastern European women, drew from social dance forms like Palestinian dabke. It’s well-documented that these women went to Palestinian villages and watched them dancing and felt they held the steps for what new Israeli dances could be. And so they borrowed steps and wrote new music and created dances that were directly synchronous to the new music, and in this way it becomes a new Israeli dance. Photo Ms. Ahuvia, left, and Ms. Mendel with vintage footage of dancers in Israel. Credit Andrew White for The New York Times This was their way of participating in the nation-building and what for them was this revolutionary moment. I don’t think that cultural exchange is bad, but I think it’s about the context of whose narratives get told and seen. You also look at the popularity of Israeli folk dance among Christian Zionists. Did you know about this phenomenon before starting your research? Our family friends are Christian Zionists, so it wasn’t a surprise. But I figured out it was much larger in scope than I realized. I was looking for videos of basic steps being taught, and the first websites to pop up were almost always Christian. Where does the title come from? I went to the Israeli embassy in New York to renew my passport, and the security guard asked me, in Hebrew, “Everything you have is yours?” Because I was working on this piece, it really stuck with me. Is it risky showing this work at a Jewish-affiliated organization like the 14th Street Y? It’s a little risky. I don’t know who’s going to come, and last year when I did a work-in-progress showing [at the Y], there was some tension about the content of the work. But they pride themselves on being a place that’s politically open, where artists can say what they want to say.

Nicole Gallucci,"Trump's back on the cover of Time, but now instead of drowning in the Oval Office he's shown walking outside, singing in the rain.
Since 2017, Time Magazinehas visually depicted the president's controversial, ever-changing narrative through dramatic cover art illustrated by Tim O'Brien. The imagery has grown increasingly troublesome for Trump over the years with the third installment, titled ""In Deep,"" essentially showing him drowning in his office but the latest cover took quite a turn.
OBrien's ""Just Singin'"" art for Time's April 9 issue shows Trump was able to escape the storm raging in his office, take a walk outside, and gleefully sing in the rain. 
As you can see in the Brobel Design animation above, Trump is shown carelessly twirling his umbrella with a big smile on his face.
The art accompanies a Brian Bennett story, about ""How Trump Beat the Mueller Investigation,"" and comes a week after Mueller finally delivered his report to Attorney General William Barr.
SEE ALSO: The dramatic new cover of 'Time' shows Trump 'in deep'
""America has now seen Trump weather a massive investigation led by a widely respected prosecutor,"" Bennett writes. ""Somehow, Trump turned what might have been a catastrophe to any other President a sweeping inquiry into potential collusion with a foreign power to undermine U.S. democracy into a rebuttal against whatever comes next.""
Image: TIM O'BRIEN/TIME
The previous covers in the Brooklyn-based artist's  series were released after other significant Trump-related events, so this one seems right on track.
Days after Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight counts, and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, reached a plea deal, Time revealed the third ""In Deep"" cover. The second cover, which simply displayed the word, ""Stormy,""  came in response to the early stages of the Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels drama, post-Cohen office raids in April 2018, and the first, which included the words ""Nothing to See Here,"" examined the early White House chaos two months after Trump's inauguration back in February 2017. 
In an Instagram post, O'Brien shared his latest Time cover and explained that though Trump ""sees a clearing,"" O'Brian sees that ""he's all wet and there still is a lot of rain to come."" So even though this might seem like one of the Time covers Trump might like enough to frame, it's worth noting the sun's still not shining on him just yet.","Trump's back on the cover of Time, but now instead of drowning in the Oval Office he's shown walking outside, singing in the rain.

MAUREEN O’CONNOR,"The experts who appear in What If? are paramedics, firefighters, a guy who trains Navy SEALs and the occasional lawyer for ominous consultation on self-defense laws. Their professional advice would seem to offer an antidote to the anxieties What If? stirs up. But like all great literary works, What If? resists simple resolution: The panelists rarely agree on what you must, or must not, do to survive. In the advice portion of the ocean-liner story, a former cop recommends establishing an operable militia of ship patrons. But a professional survivalist argues that resistance would be futile in your average hijacked-by-ISIS-backed-pirates scenario: Youre not going to go up against an AK-47-wielding attacker with a rolled-up magazine or a butter knife. Smarter to barricade yourself in your room with a satellite telephone and call the State Department.
Among the contradictions, there is a more abstract form of comfort a tacit acknowledgment that, though we may struggle mightily to influence fate, we can never entirely predict or control it. Offgrids What If? does for disaster what Penthouse letters do for sex: It vividly describes events that its readers may have contemplated, or even obsessed over, but lack the imagination or information to really bring to life. (What nuclear war and three-way sex have in common: public interest vastly outpaces real-world probability.)
But amid this chaos, What If? also provides small points of stability. Chlorine gas, I learned, is heavier than air. In the event of a chlorine attack, you should not crawl on the floor, as you might in a fire, but stand and seek higher ground. If you come across a rattlesnake while you are trapped in the desert, hold still rattlesnakes track movement with ground vibrations.
What If? may be doomsday pornography, but whereas apocalyptic religions promise eternal bliss for followers after the storm, What If? sees bliss in the lives its readers already have. After all, to care about catastrophe and to fear loss, you must value that which you have. Before descending into chaos, What If? tends toward bourgeois idyll: You are a proud father who successfully raised a newly independent daughter. You have a loving spouse and enough money to take them on a cruise. You ride a secret uptown 7 train where theres always a seat.

OSMAN CAN YEREBAKAN,"Dressed in all black, in contrast to the radiant colors that surround him, the artist Angel Otero emanates warmth as he stands in his studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn, right off the high-spirited Avenue of Puerto Rico (also known as Graham Avenue). His expansive high-ceilinged work space is currently occupied by a group of sprawling mixed-media paintings made partly from collaged cutout pieces from his earlier works that will soon depart for his coming exhibition, Milagros, at Lehmann Maupin gallery in Manhattan. The artist, too, is about to set out for a journey.Known for his visceral abstract oil paintings, Otero, 38, who has lived in New York for almost a decade, will open a second studio in his first home, Puerto Rico, early this summer. I want to see what can happen if I am physically there, working and engaging with people, he explains. Ive always been a loner andintrovert while making art, and I want to break this habit there, and maybe even bring people into the studio to make art together. Hes hopeful about the revitalization of the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. He believes good can come out of catastrophe, and adds: A lot of young people are bringing amazing things back to the island. I want to be a part of this moment.
Otero left his home in Puerto Rico in 2003 to pursue a masters degree in fine arts at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He has lived in the mainland United States ever since, but his upbringing in a large family in San Juan helped form his compelling visual language of bold colors, vibrant abstractforms and autobiographical cues, leading to solo exhibitions at institutions including the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston and SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia. In his new work, Otero delves into both his physical and mental inventories, reusing pieces from his discarded paintings and domestic objects he has collected from thrift stores over the years, as well as memories of Puerto Rico.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"You may have thought, “Hey, if we’re threatened by an incoming asteroid, we should just nuke it!” You’re not alone: a team of Russian scientists are working on a plot to do so, by detonating miniature asteroids in a lab. In fact, several groups of researchers are now toying with the idea of asteroid nuking for the sake of planetary defense. The Russian team has even calculated about how much firepower they’d need to perform such a feat. According to the translated paper published in the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics : “Given the scale factor and the results of laboratory experiments, the undeniable destruction of a chondritic asteroid 200 m in diameter by a nuclear explosion with an energy above 3 Mt was shown to be possible.” That’s three megatons to blow up an asteroid twice the size of a football field, or a bomb 200 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This paper should be taken with a grain of salt, of course. The researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Russian Federal Nuclear Center and ROSATOM didn’t nuke a real 200-meter asteroid in a zero gravity environment. Instead, they used a laser pulse to zap a four-millimeter asteroid model, based on the composition of meteorite fragments. That laser pulse was certainly high energy for its size, 200 joules (the energy required to slide a two-ish pound box 600 feet on a frictionless surface). But that’s no nuke. The Russians aren’t the only ones considering nuking asteroids. Universe Today reports that NASA is working on a project called HAMMER, or Hyper-velocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response. As writer Evan Gough notes, it’s just an idea. An idea to nuke asteroids. These ideas aren’t totally out there, though. NASA does track most of the so-called “potentially hazardous” near-Earth objects, none of which are actually hazardous today. Given a 100-year warning, there are a lot of simple things you can do to slightly perturb an asteroid’s orbit to prevent it from hitting us. But as we’ve noted in the past, NASA does not track all of the nearby asteroids smaller than 140 meters in diameter. A 140-meter untracked meteorite showing up out of nowhere would spell bad news. Even a 20-meter object, the size of the Chelyabinsk meteorite, hitting an urban area could cause catastrophe. “They have thought about the logistics of the problem from the practical side, including how much advance warning you would need to send up a rocket in time, and how small the fragments of the asteroid would need to be, in order to burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere,” Karen Daniels, professor at North Carolina State Universi, told Gizmodo. “This one study goes a long way towards specifying the circumstances under which deploying a nuclear charge at the surface of an asteroid might be sufficient to address crises, as well as pitfalls that would cause it to fail.” Still, there’s way more work to be done. Asteroids can vary wildly in their composition. Some are large chunks of rock, while other are “rubble piles” loosely held together by a tiny gravitational force, according to the European Space Agency. The researchers plan to further study the effect of their lasers on other model asteroids. So, don’t go asking for space nuke poliferation just yet. Or at least, don’t go basing your judgment simply on what happens to pebbles in a lab.

Navi Radjou,"On September 25, students from five top French schools unveiled a manifesto titled “Wake up call on the environment.” Citing the recent UN report that warns of an impending climate catastrophe, the manifesto calls for students to capitalize on their collective power–as future employees–to compel French companies to embed sustainability deeply in all their activities. Today, more than 23,000 students from over 300 French higher education institutions have signed this manifesto, making a de facto a pledge to not work for companies that heavily pollute. The manifesto has galvanized a student movement that is creating a lot of buzz in the French media and business circles. [Source Image: Wacomka/iStock] The manifesto is the brainchild of Corentin Bisot, a student at Ecole Polytechnique, the top engineering school in France. Bisot points out the manifesto’s primarily goal is not to boycott polluting companies. Rather, it aims to raise students’ awareness about the ecological crisis we face and show them how they could make wise choices, including the choice of their employer, that can help build a sustainable world. The manifesto’s creators believe individual commitments won’t be enough to change the existing economic system. “Does it mean anything to ride a bike when you work for a company whose activities contribute to increasing climate change or draining natural resources?” asks the manifesto, thus calling students to achieve congruence between their core values and their work. [Source Image: Wacomka/iStock] By putting pressure on French companies to adopt sustainable business models sooner than later, the manifesto’s signatories want to avert the climate crisis. But they also see it as a stepping-stone to co-create a conscious society that eschews overconsumption and enhances the well-being of all citizens within our planetary boundaries. The students who initiated and support the manifesto are mostly from the Grandes Écoles, the French equivalent of the Ivy League. These elite schools, which produce future leaders of French business and government, tend to be conservative and do not take a stance–at least publicly–on sociopolitical issues. So the manifesto is really a “coming out”–in terms of civic engagement–of the students who represent the upper echelons of the French education system. But unlike the violent student protests of May 1968 that brought France to the brink of revolution, this new wave of non-violent student activism embodies new model, digitally enhanced and fluid. The French youth don’t want to disrupt the system from the outside as much as transform it from the inside and make it better. They are evolutionary leaders, rather than revolutionary ones. [Source Image: Wacomka/iStock] These bright youngsters want to lead by example by investing time and energy in self-transformation. Indeed, the manifesto has a whole section that offers a lot of advice to students on how they could adopt a sustainable lifestyle. The French manifesto should inspire U.S. students–especially at Ivy League schools–to take action. What if MBA students at top U.S. business schools took a pledge to not work for banks that contributed to the financial crisis of 2008, and commit their talent to promote social justice? And what if U.S. engineering students vowed to not offer their skills to the 100 most polluting U.S. companies, but rather work for 100 firms that develop the greenest products? The fight against climate change has been neglected by our political leaders. American college students can pick up the fight. Navi Radjou is a fellow at Cambridge University’s Judge Business School.

JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS,"Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the presidents speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.
At this moment in time, Mr. Kushner said, this is a good path forward.
Many conservatives did not share that view.
Trump proposes amnesty, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. We voted for Trump and got Jeb! she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.
Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a sincere effort by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.
But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.
The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.
This is not an amnesty bill, Mr. Pence said. There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.","Seeking to appeal to a broader swath of the public and end the government shutdown, President Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base and made no headway with Democratic congressional leaders.",2019-01-20T02:32:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","News Analysis: In Trump’s Immigration Announcement, a Compromise Snubbed All Around",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/politics/trump-immigration-conservatives-democrats.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/us/politics/20-dc-assess/merlin_149452290_d47f94f7-2ed9-49af-bfec-8cc4aac4af40-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,catastrophe,0
Tom McKay,"11,000 years’ worth of artifacts went up in smoke as the 200-year-old National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro—one of the largest collections in the Americas—burned down in a massive firestorm on Sunday night. According to the Rio Times, reports indicate that every piece from the museum’s collection of over 20 million items that was not stored offsite or rushed out could be destroyed: Early reports indicate that the museum’s vast collection of more than twenty million rare and historical objects, including South American archaeological artifacts, meteorites, fossils, and the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts in Latin America, were lost. “We have no idea how it started!” exclaimed a museum researcher to Globo news. “There is so much love for this institution,” she said fighting through tears. “[T]his 200 year-old museum, this is the work of many people’s lives, zoological collections, botanical collections, everything lost…everything lost!” No serious injuries are reported. The fire started at 7:30pm ET, with the cause unclear, and museum officials have to wait for firefighters to finish clearing the structure before they can assess the damage, CNN wrote. Items in the building included Latin America’s most extensive Egyptian collection, pre-Columbian artifacts, the oldest human remains ever discovered in the Americas ( “Luzia” ), dinosaur bones, extensive biology exhibits, and a massive scientific library. Here’s a few other things that were stored in the building, according to the New York Times : One of the world’s largest meteorites, which was found in 1784 and had been on display since 1888.... Items from a large swatch of Brazilian cultures, including funeral urns from around the year 1000 in the region of the Maracá River, statues and vases from the Santarém culture in the region of the lower Tapajós River, a mortar from the Trombetas River area and a rare mummy found in Brazil.... A Greco-Roman collection with more than 700 pieces that arrived in Brazil in the 1850s.... A vast bird collection almost 200 years old, representing the range seen in Brazil. (The meteorite was among the items that may have survived the fire.) According to the BBC, at least some parts of the building where animal specimens were stored survived intact, while the Guardian reported other parts of the archive stored in another building were undamaged. Museum staff were able to rush in, in some cases bashing down doors, and save some items. Professor Paulo Buckup, an expert in fish science, told the BBC he rescued “a few thousand” mollusk specimens, adding, “I don’t know how many tens of thousands of insects and crustaceans were lost. I feel very sorry for my colleagues, some of whom have worked here for 30 or 40 years. Now all evidence of their work is lost, their lives have lost meaning, too.” “This is 200 years of work of a scientific institution—the most important one in Latin America,” longtime museum employee Marco Aurelio Caldas told Agencia Brasil, per CNN. “Everything is finished. Our work, our life was all in there.” Brazil has been facing years of recession and corruption scandals, with both the federal and state governments struggling with massive budget shortfalls. According to the BBC, museum staff said lack of funding had left the museum in poor condition, and around a third of the building’s 30 exhibition halls were shut down due to financial constraints at the time of the fire. Vice director Luiz Duarte told TV Globo the fire was an “unbearable catastrophe,” according to the Guardian. “For many years we fought with different governments to get adequate resources to preserve what is now completely destroyed,” Duarte added. “My feeling is of total dismay and immense anger.” [ CNN / Rio Times ]","11,000 years’ worth of artifacts went up in smoke as the 200-year-old National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro—one of the largest collections in the Americas—burned down in a massive firestorm on Sunday night.

JEFFERSON COWIE,"Reviving this older stream of dissenting rests on the active interests and lost authority of its citizens and its fading democratic values. This would replace “my country right or wrong” with the centuries-long struggle, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it, “to be true to what you said on paper.” This is the position from which voting rights, civil rights, immigrant rights and economic rights can be fought: with a vision of what is acceptably American and what is not. Decent people will rise to the challenge. The nation is the only “imagined community,” as Benedict Anderson put, where everything from mass transit to health care to wealth distribution to a green economy can find traction. A rejuvenated national vision would transcend the backward-looking — and often reactionary — search for an America in arrested decay that has too often informed politics since Ronald Reagan first promised to make America great again. Civic patriotism must also be an aspirational story of struggle and inclusion. The narcissistic and racist politics of right-wing nationalism must be challenged with an expansive and inclusive civic vision about hope and potential. It’s what Barack Obama spoke of at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march. Standing before the Edmund Pettus Bridge, he asked, “What greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?” To be sure, the rhetoric of nationalism can be dangerous in a place with a history of settler colonialism, slavery, anti-immigrant hysteria and territorial expansion. Any civic framing risks fomenting exclusion by drawing lines between those who are in and those who are out — an especially profound problem in an era of mass migration. Yet when the American left abandons any vision of social patriotism because of the racist ugliness it has come to symbolize, it concedes the American story to the voices of exclusion and avarice. The pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty made many of these arguments 20 years ago in a book, “ Achieving Our Country. ” That book became famous after the 2016 election for having predicted the rise of a “strongman” to fill the void in national politics. He feared that indulging in cultural politics rather than emphasizing the material interests of American working people, and surrendering the struggle to shape the national vision where that can happen, would lead to such a catastrophe. While his nightmare of the nationalist demagogue has come to pass, few people are talking about the foundation of his predictions. Patriotism may well be the last refuge of the scoundrel, but as a pragmatist like Mr. Rorty would tell you, it is too powerful and too important to leave to the scoundrels. Voters are in search of a place of vision for average Americans, a place of idealism in an age of cynicism, a place of unity in a time of fracture and a place where policy can be embedded in something greater than technocracy. While commentators are getting worked up over the revival of “socialism,” an increasing number of insurgent blue-collar Democrats across the country are looking to recapture a sense of nation. The dark-horse candidate from Kansas, the Army veteran James Thompson, for instance, promises to “Fight for America.” As we approach midterm elections, we urgently need to hear these messages in good faith and rise to their challenge.

AJ Dellinger,"In the city of Xichang, located in the southwestern Sichuan province, there is a massive, artificial intelligence-powered roach breeding farm that is producing more than six billion cockroaches per year. The facility, which is described by the South China Morning Post as a multi-story building about the size of two sports fields, is being operated by Chengdu-based medicine maker Gooddoctor Pharmaceutical Group. Its existence raises a number of questions like, “Oh god, why?” and “Who asked for this monstrosity?” Inside the breeding site, the environment is described as “warm, humid, and dark” all-year round. The layout is wide open, allowing the roaches to roam around freely, find food and water, and reproduce whenever and wherever the right mood strikes. The insect sex pit is managed by what the South China Morning Post describes as a “smart manufacturing system” that is controlled primarily by algorithms. The system is in charge of analyzing more than 80 categories of data collected from throughout the facility. Everything from the temperature to the level of food consumption is monitored by AI, which is programmed to learn from historical data to determine the best conditions for peak roach fornication. The billions of roaches that pass through the facility each year never get to see the light of day. From their birth inside the building until their death months or years later, they are locked within the walls of the moist coitus cabin. Each and every one of the insects is eventually fed into machines and crushed up to be used in a “healing potion” manufactured by the pharmaceutical company responsible for the facility. The potion—which is described as having a tea-like color, a slightly sweet taste, and a fishy smell—sells for about $8 for two 100ml bottles. While it is used primarily as a fix for stomach issues, the medicine can be prescribed by doctors for just about anything. South China Morning Post reported that nearly 40 million patients in China use the so-called potion. It’s been sold to more than 4,000 hospitals across the country and is handed out as a cure for everything from gastric troubles to respiratory problems, and as a fix for a slew of other diseases. The Chinese government has touted the healing power of cockroaches for years now, going so far as to finance a number of nationwide studies designed to determine the health effects of the insects through laboratory work and clinical trials. Liu Yusheng, a professor at the Shandong Agricultural University and head of Shandong province’s Insect Association, told the Telegraph roaches “really are a miracle drug.” While there may be some healing magic to squeeze out of the roaches, the specter of the insects making out of the facility alive would have devastating effects on the community and environment. Professor Zhu Chaodong, the Institute of Zoology’s lead scientist in insect evolution studies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told the South China Morning Post that it would be a “catastrophe” if billions of cockroaches were suddenly released into the wild, either as a result of human error or natural disaster doing damage to the building.

Jake Kanter,"Facebook is not even close to getting its house in order on protecting people's privacy, according to the woman who hit the company with a maximum fine for the Cambridge Analytica catastrophe. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) fined Facebook £500,000 ($645,000) last month for the Cambridge Analytica data breach, as part of an unprecedented investigation into data misuse in British politics. Giving evidence to a British parliamentary committee on Tuesday, information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said Facebook has a lot of work to do to improve its privacy processes. She added that regulation is required to ensure the company gets its act together. Denham said Facebook's advertising business model rubs against privacy laws and the company is part of an ecosystem that has shown a ""very disturbing disregard"" for the data of British citizens. ""Regulators need to look at the effectiveness of their processes,"" she told lawmakers of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. ""There's a fundamental tension between the business model, the advertising business model of Facebook, and fundamental rights like protection of privacy."" Denham was speaking as the ICO published at 113-page investigation into the use of data analytics in political campaigns. The report provides a comprehensive account of the Cambridge Analytica breach, which allowed the political consultancy to exploit the data of 87 million Facebook users harvested by developer Dr Aleksandr Kogan. It also refers Facebook to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner over ""ongoing concerns"" about the company's ""targeting functions and techniques that are used to monitor individuals' browsing habits, interactions and behaviour across the internet.""

Sam Heller,"A war that seems to be ending could yet witness its most deadly assault yet. On Tuesday, President Trump warned on Twitter that “President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province,” adding it would be “a grave humanitarian mistake” for Russia and Iran to “take part in this potential human tragedy.” “Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed,” he concluded. “Don’t let that happen!” Yet U.S. policy towards a seemingly imminent Syrian military offensive on the country’s rebel-held northwestern Idlib province seems as if it will indeed let that happen. The U.S. has threatened military action if Damascus again uses chemical weapons, but, with some muddled exceptions, has otherwise only emphasized that an attack on Idlib would be a “reckless escalation.” The U.S. threat of force, and Russia’s rhetorical counterpunch, have sucked up much of the media oxygen around the possible offensive. But Idlib seems not to be America’s fight. Idlib’s fate hangs instead on neighboring Turkey, and on Syria’s ally Russia. Russia is abetting mass murder in Syria Idlib is the last real bastion of Syria’s opposition. Along with adjacent rebel-held areas, it holds almost 3 million people, mostly civilians. That includes nearly 1.3 million displaced from elsewhere in the country, fleeing a resurgent Syrian government. Idlib is also “the largest al-Qaeda safe haven since 9/11,” according to Brett McGurk, U.S. envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State. Its rebels include a major contingent of jihadists, among them Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the latest incarnation of former Syrian al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusrah. For the Assad regime, capturing Idlib would mark its effective victory over Syria’s opposition. The Syrian military is now massing along Idlib’s perimeter, preparing to attack. Russian aircraft bombed areas of western Idlib on Tuesday. The main protection Idlib has is a dozen observation points along its edge manned by Turkish troops. Turkey began sending in observer forces late last year to reinforce a “de-escalation” ceasefire covering the province agreed jointly with Iran and Russia. As part of the de-escalation, Turkey committed to halting violations of the ceasefire by opposition rebels and dealing with designated terrorist organizations operating inside the zone. Turkey’s positions around Idlib seem dubiously useful as a defensive line against a full-scale attack. Instead, they are a visible manifestation of Turkey, Iran, and Russia’s trilateral agreement, and a demonstration of Turkish commitment. Turkey has already sacrificed Turkish lives setting up these posts. Turkey wants to forestall a Syrian offensive that sweeps Idlib and sends a wave of refugees toward Turkey’s border or Turkish-controlled sections of neighboring Aleppo province. Turkey already hosts 3.5 million Syrians, according to government statistics. It can hardly handle more, much less a significant proportion of the population of Idlib. And any new refugee flow would necessarily include some of Idlib’s militants, among them jihadists who could threaten Turkey’s domestic security or, as Turkish officials are quick to warn, travel on to Europe or elsewhere. The worst may be yet to come in Syria Idlib’s jihadists, who have enmeshed themselves in the Syrian opposition and the area’s civilian population, have proved an intractable challenge for Turkey, the U.S., and the many countries that consider them a menace to global security. Those jihadists give the Syrian government and Russia their rhetorical justification for the threatened offensive. Militants inside Idlib have also violated the de-escalation agreement, including by repeatedly attacking Russia’s main airbase in Syria with makeshift drones. But while Idlib’s jihadists are real and dangerous, “counterterrorism” is also a useful pretext for Syrian military action against opposition-held areas generally, and one that Damascus and its allies have used previously to crush “de-escalation zones” with a relatively minor jihadist presence. In Syria’s southwest, Russia in fact claimed that military action was not a violation of that area’s de-escalation agreement, but in fact the fulfillment of the agreement’s counterterrorism provisions. For the Syrian government and its allies, an Idlib offensive would let them destroy their insurgent enemies, but it would also in their view be a chance to definitively reassert Syria’s sovereignty and territorial unity. Still, there are reasons for restraint—for Russia, in particular, whose posture will be critical. It is Russia’s choice to provide air support to a Syrian ground offensive that will effectively decide whether an attack is viable. But Russia’s intervention in Syria has twinned a military campaign with a political one. Russia seeks to deliver victory to a Syrian ally that is, at war’s end, rehabilitated diplomatically and on its way to internationally sponsored reconstruction. Russia cannot do that alone. It needs European donors, whom it has been trying to enlist in a new push for the organized return of Syrian refugees, which Russia is trying to leverage into diplomatic normalization and reconstruction funds for Damascus. And Russia needs Turkey, which has made itself an integral part of Moscow’s political efforts to manage the conflict and retool Syria’s political process to better suit Russian ends. By supporting a full-scale Idlib offensive, Russia risks complicating all of that. Russia has also helped broker the negotiated surrender of de-escalation areas in Syria’s center and south, facilitated by overwhelming Russian air power. Russia is attempting something similar in Idlib, but it seems likely to fail. Idlib’s fall cannot be neatly choreographed. As Damascus has retaken the rest of the country, it has bused irreconcilable militants and activists to Syria’s north, mainly to Idlib. People now in Idlib are there for a reason. Many cannot survive under Assad’s reconstituted rule and will instead fight to the death. Local rebels have made a show of detaining individuals suspected of being in contact with Russia or the Syrian regime. One town erected a gallows as a message to would-be “collaborators.” A Syrian military victory in Idlib will necessarily mean death on a huge scale, and mass displacement toward either toward Turkey or to Turkish-held areas whose humanitarian capacities, already strained, will be totally overwhelmed. Idlib’s population is multiples larger than Aleppo’s rebel-held eastern neighborhoods or Damascus’s East Ghouta suburbs, which fell bloodily to government forces in 2016 and earlier this year, respectively. And this time, there is no other Idlib to which residents can flee. Turkey made a bet against Assad—and lost Carnage in Idlib, at this late stage of Syria’s war, would make a farce of Russia’s claims that Syria is stabilizing and that the time has come for large-scale, organized refugee return and reconstruction. It would deeply injure Turkey, whose top officials have warned that an attack on Idlib will collapse the political scheme Turkey and Russia have co-sponsored. That multilateral arrangement has been the basis for Russia’s multiplying, parallel political initiatives, aimed at re-centering Syria’s political process from political transition—which would mean remaking or removing Syria’s current leadership—to issues such as constitutional reform that are less threatening to the status quo. Many in Syria’s opposition who have participated in these processes, with Turkey’s encouragement, would have little reason to go on. They have no obvious future in an Assad-ruled Syria themselves, but they can at least engage on constitutional reform in order to buy time and space for Idlib’s residents. But if Idlib ends in violence, why would they pursue this path? Russia will have trouble organizing a political process with even the minimum level of inclusiveness and legitimacy that prospective Western donors demand. There is little prospect that the U.S. will intervene militarily for Idlib’s sake and risk a confrontation with Russia. But Turkey and Europe nonetheless possess real leverage. In a briefing for International Crisis Group, my colleagues and I have argued that Turkey and European donors need to make clear to Russia that a Syrian military victory in Idlib will have a substantial political cost, in addition to the toll in Syrian lives. They need to convince Russia that its own aims in Syria are better-served by restraint and a return to negotiations with Turkey and Iran on a compromise solution, not by strong-arming Turkey and killing a large proportion of Idlib’s population. Idlib’s jihadists and the persistent violations of the de-escalation ceasefire are a genuine problem, and one that requires a solution. But that solution can still be one that is consensual and agreed between Turkey, Russia, and Iran, and one that spares innocent human life.",The Syrian province doesn’t have to be the site of another catastrophe.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It’s no secret the Great Barrier Reef is in dire straights thanks to human-caused global warming. But it turns out dramatic upheaval is nothing new for the world’s largest living thing. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered five large-scale die-offs over the past 30,000 years, all of them tied to abrupt changes in sea level or the environment, according to a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience. While this chronicle of death offers a hopeful message that the Great Barrier Reef has bounced back from catastrophe before, it isn’t cause for complacency. As the authors note, the current pace of climate change is pushing the reef into uncharted territory—from which recovery will be difficult, if not impossible. To track the rise and fall of the Great Barrier Reef over deep time, a team led by the University of Sydney’s Jody Webster spent a decade analyzing fossil reef cores collected from 16 sites near the cities of Cairns and Mackay. Examining both geological and biological evidence, they were able to identify five distinct periods during which the reef suffered a major die-back. The first two die-backs occurred prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) some 30,000 and 22,000 years ago. During this time, the growth of ice sheets caused sea levels to drop, exposing vast swaths of the reef to open air. After the peak of the LGM 20,000 years ago, the glaciers began to retreat in fits and starts, resulting in sudden pulses of sea level rise. Two such pulses overlapped with additional reef die-off events, 17,000 and 13,000 years ago. The study found that these spurts of sea level rise were accompanied by large pulses of sediment onto the Great Barrier Reef, leading the authors to hypothesize that the corals were drowned not by water, but by silt and sand. The last die-off event roughly 10,000 years ago also featured a major increase in the sediment load that substantially reduced water quality on the reef. Andrea Dutton, a sea level researcher at the University of Florida who wasn’t involved with the study, praised the authors for their “detailed, interdisciplinary approach,” which she said offers “a robust context for their interpretations.” But she also told Earther that the study cannot be taken as evidence that the Great Barrier Reef will survive the rapid changes it’s currently experiencing, from pollution to rising temperatures to rising acidity. Indeed, as the paper makes clear, the current pace of ocean warming—roughly 0.7 degrees Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) in a century—is outside the bounds of what the Great Barrier Reef has experienced over the past 30,000 years. And as recent history has shown, a little extra heat can be a life or death matter for corals. “We really are entering a no-analogue situation.” In 2016 and 2017, back-to-back coral bleaching events driven by unusually warm ocean waters killed one in every two corals on the Great Barrier Reef. The damage was so severe that a study published recently in Nature declared the ecosystem has been changed “forever.” “We can and should use this study to gather the clues to reef resilience through dramatic climate changes of the past,”Georgia Institute of Technology coral researcher Kim Cobb, who wasn’t involved in the research, told Earther via email. “From this study, it seems like the maintenance of diverse reef assemblages and reef terrain were key to the reef’s persistence” in the past. But Cobb also urged caution in drawing comparisons between the past and present. “The bad news is that human-caused climate change is many times larger than what these reefs have previously lived through,” she said. “So we really are entering a no-analogue situation.”",It’s no secret the Great Barrier Reef is in dire straights thanks to human-caused global warming.

Angie Han,"If you have any interest at all in Mission: Impossible — Fallout, any inkling that you may want to someday, maybe, eventually get around to seeing it, I suggest you do so in the next several weeks, while it's still in theaters. Preferably in IMAX, if you can manage it. It's that kind of movie. SEE ALSO: What's going on with Henry Cavill's beard in the 'Mission: Impossible – Fallout' trailer? As usual for this franchise, Fallout has a convoluted plot that's hardly worth the trouble it takes to explain, since it's really just an excuse to trot around the globe indulging in extravagant set pieces. There are scenes of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt running, jumping, punching, skydiving, driving a motorcycle while being chased by cars, driving a car while being chased by a motorcycle, and, in the stomach-dropping climax, steering an out-of-control helicopter over a mountain range. Sometimes, Henry Cavill (delightful in this movie, if not so much on the press tour ) is along for the ride as skeptical CIA agent Walker. Sometimes, it's Rebecca Ferguson, returning as the mysterious Ilsa Faust. Both of them match Cruise punch-for-punch in the action arena. All of their derring-do is choreographed, shot, and acted in a way that looks real All of their derring-do is choreographed, shot, and acted in a way that looks real, in a way that puts most of this summer's other action-adventure blockbusters to shame. You're on the ground with Hunt as he zips through the streets of London, or in the air as he parachutes into Paris. It's not technically true to say that the Mission: Impossible movies are why IMAX screens were invented, but it sometimes feels as though it could be. It's exhilarating to be surrounded by such heart-pounding action; that feeling wouldn't fully translate on a smaller screen. Fallout has its more humble charms, too. Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Michelle Monaghan return to give the franchise the heart and humor it needs to keep ticking. There's something kinda sweet about Hunt's commitment to his friends, even in the face of impending global catastrophe. Meanwhile, the script by Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed) is just self-aware enough, having some light fun at the expense of the IMF. One character describes that bizarre organization as ""a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick-or-treat,"" and he's not really wrong. At another point, someone points out that Hunt gets disavowed by his government in, like, every movie. It's nice to hear we're not the only ones who've noticed. The fuel that keeps this entire motor running, though, remains Cruise's magnetism, and his apparent commitment to punishing his body for our amusement. We know Tom Cruise made it out of the shoot alive, because he's currently grinning and handshaking his way through the press tour. And yes, even an actor as committed to performing his own daredevil stunts as Cruise is has a little bit of green-screen VFX magic helping him out. Still, as I watched Cruise sweat and pant and grimace like he was on the verge of death, I caught myself mouthing the words "" How is Tom Cruise still alive? "" Honestly, I'm not going to question it. I'm just glad he's decided to spend whatever time he has left on this planet doing this for us.","If you have any interest at all in Mission: Impossible — Fallout, any inkling that you may want to someday, maybe, eventually get around to seeing it, I suggest you do so in the next several weeks, while it's still in theaters.

"Caroline Kelly, CNN","(CNN)The Environmental Protection Agency appointed several new members to its Science Advisory Board who have denied key findings of the harmful effects of man-made pollutants on the environment and human health.
The appointments by acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler come following the former coal lobbyist and Republican Senate aide's confirmation hearing last month for him to assume the role permanently. Wheeler said at the hearing that he ""would not call (climate change) the greatest crisis,"" adding that he considers it ""a huge issue that has to be addressed globally.""
One of the newly appointed board members is Dr. John Cristy, a professor at University of Alabama in Huntsville who's a known climate change denier.
""I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see,"" Cristy wrote in a 2007 Wall Street Journal op-ed when he was on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a co-recipient of that year's Nobel Peace Prize. 
In the op-ed, Cristy accused colleagues projecting century-long weather patterns of having ""overstated-confidence"" and warned of ""jump-to-conclusions advocates and, unfortunately, some scientists who see in every weather anomaly the specter of a global-warming apocalypse.""
Three new appointees have worked on projects dismissing the harmful effects of low doses of well-known toxins. 
Dr. Richard Williams served on the formaldehyde panel for the American Chemistry Council, which championed research that ""supports it safety"" (sic) despite EPA guidance that high-level formaldehyde exposure can cause some cancers. He is on the Board of Trustees of the International Life Sciences Institute, which includes several food industry giants and which disputed dietary guidelines that suggest limiting sugar intake. 
New appointee Dr. Brant Ulsh, who works for the consulting firm M.H. Chew and Associates, criticized how ""right now we spend an enormous effort trying to minimize low doses"" at nuclear power plants, he told The Associated Press in October. Both the National Academy of Sciences and the EPA have found that even low-level radiation can increase cancer risk. 
Dr. Barbara Beck, another pick for the board, wrote in 2006 that researchers should be cautious in determining that low-level lead exposure harmed children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have long asserted that ""no safe blood lead level in children has been identified."" Beck is a consultant at Gradient, an environmental consulting firm that has faced accusations of backing research with results favorable to its interests.",The Environmental Protection Agency appointed several new members to its Science Advisory Board who have denied key findings of the harmful effects of man-made pollutants on the environment and human health.,2019-02-02T02:41:07Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Climate change denier among those appointed to EPA science board,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/01/politics/epa-new-board-members-climate-denier/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190116174015-andrew-wheeler-climate-change-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,catastrophe,0
Rebecca Fleenor,"March is practically here, so you know what that means? (Easter? Nope. That's not till April. I just checked.) A new month means new movies and shows coming to Amazon Prime. And I have to admit, unless you're a die-hard Little House on the Prairie fan, the offerings are a bit underwhelming. 
However, one premiere has me so excited I'm practically jumping up and down. The fourth season of Catastrophe hits Amazon on March 15! It's been nearly two years since the last season was released. Yes, I know good things are worth the wait. But the wait is finally over!
If you're looking for a good laugh, I recommend checking out the original 2007 Death at a Funeral. Or there's the mediocre, but always enjoyable, Ashley Judd thriller Double Jeopardy. And on March 22 you can catch Cold War, which is nominated for three Academy Awards. Unfortunately, you won't be able to watch it before the Oscar ceremony on Sunday. 
Catastrophe returns to Amazon for its fourth season March 15.

Jess Joho,"Samantha Bee just received yet another hard-earned Emmy nomination for her show Full Frontal, hot on the heels of her win last year. Yet she can't help but meet this achievement with mixed emotions, after being embroiled in an outrage news cycle for calling Ivanka Trump a ""feckless cunt."" ""You can't celebrate your victories long. That's all I'm saying,"" she said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter shortly after the Thursday announcement. ""It affected me a lot."" SEE ALSO: Michelle Wolf throws down her best 'life-alteringly hurtful' insults to Ivanka Trump Bee issued not one, but two apologies during the firestorm of backlash, on Twitter and the show itself. Her on-air apology focused less on the word itself and more on its distraction from the immigration policy she was trying to call attention to. Former Daily Show boss Jon Stewart stood up for Bee, blaming the political right for seizing an opportunity rather than expressing any genuine indignation. But that didn't stop advertisers like Autotrader.com and State Farm from threatening to pull out of Full Frontal. Bee took the near catastrophe to heart, regardless of whether the scandalized reactions were just manufactured political pageantry. ""I've been thinking a lot about it. We had a scheduled vacation around July 4, and it was a time of reflection,"" she said. It seems to have been a wake up call for Bee, a reminder of the unprecedented scrutiny that all public figures face in 2018. ""I do think that being a part of the outrage machine is an inevitability now,"" she said. ""That's a reality everyone has to grapple with — not just me. The level of ferocity is something I hadn't quite experienced up to that point, but I assume I'll go through it again. Maybe I'll be better prepared next time. I think we handled it well, but it was a pretty steep learning curve."" Yet Bee's commitment to her raw and honest approach to late night doesn't appear to be going anywhere. In a statement following the nomination, she wrote: It's been an interesting year for the show, to say the least, and none of it would have been possible without each person on my staff and each suit at TBS (it's OK to say that — they're very nice suits). TBS bravely put a woman over 45 on TV, and in turn I only got yelled at by the president once. We have some seriously special people on our staff, and hearing them go crazy in the office right now is just the medicine this world needs. And thankfully, she hasn't lost her sense of humor about the whole thing. When asked by THR about the advice she'd give upcoming Emmy hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost, Bee joked, ""I know one word they shouldn't say.""","Samantha Bee just received yet another hard-earned Emmy nomination for her show Full Frontal, hot on the heels of her win last year.

"Sunlen Serfaty, CNN","(CNN)Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts has been working with freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on ""Green New Deal"" legislation that will be unveiled soon, an aide to Markey confirmed to CNN on Thursday. 
There is no final text yet, as some parts of the legislation are still being worked on. There is not a specific date for introduction yet -- but the aide says they expect it to be soon.
The legislation will address issues such as job creation, emission reductions, greening infrastructure and a variety of principles that would come with a ""robust"" climate-change package, this aide says.
The two members have been working on the legislation together for about a month -- first meeting on Capitol Hill during the first week in January for a two-hour discussion where they discussed putting together the legislation, and have gotten to know each other well since.
The idea of a ""Green New Deal"" has, in just a few months, become a central piece of Ocasio-Cortez's agenda -- as well as other progressive Democrats -- and attracted the attention of ambitious national Democrats.
""I am thrilled to see so many of the potential 2020 presidential candidates embracing the idea of a Green New Deal,"" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN earlier this month. ""The oil and gas lobbyists won't back down without a fight and that's why we need to support groups like Sunrise Movement in their efforts to keep the pressure up. When the scientific consensus says that you have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe, it's time to get to work.""
Movement leaders have not agreed on a price tag. Estimates run in the hundreds of billions of dollars or more. But they argue a combination of tax hikes on the super wealthy -- Ocasio-Cortez has floated a 70% rate on income over $10 million -- and cuts to fossil fuel industry subsidies and military spending, in addition to the stimulative effects of the new public spending would offset any cost.

Stan Schroeder,"Popular cryptocurrency exchange EtherDelta got hacked in spectacular fashion Wednesday, with many users unknowingly sending their tokens to the hacker instead of the exchange. At least 308 ETH ($266,789) were stolen, as well as a large number of tokens potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. SEE ALSO: Ethereum's price surpasses $700 in another astonishing crypto-rally EtherDelta is a decentralized exchange which lists nearly all Ethereum-based tokens in existence. It doesn't have a huge volume compared to larger exchanges but it's an important first step for traders after a new token gets generated in an ICO (initial coin offering). Apparently, the smart contracts that govern EtherDelta's behavior weren't compromised in the attack. Instead, the attacker managed to take over EtherDelta's DNS server and serve a fake version of the site to visitors. This is far more dangerous than the common phishing attack in which a fake site sets up a domain name similar to the real one (such as etherrddeltta.com). Users who visited the actual EtherDelta site in the afternoon (ET time) Wednesday were served a partially functional but still quite convincing version of the site. The attack appears to have been mitigated within a few hours, and the proper EtherDelta site restored, but anyone who interacted with the fake site may have sent ether or other tokens to the hacker. EtherDelta confirmed the attack on Twitter and advised all users not to use the site. At the time of writing, they haven't lifted the warning, so EtherDelta should still be considered unsafe to use. Dear users, we have reason to believe that there had been malicious attacks that temporarily gained access to @etherdelta https://t.co/NnqU5Er4rj DNS server.

Ether and tokens flowed in from 1:40 p.m. ET up until roughly 8 p.m. ET; the attacker moved the bulk of the funds to other addresses at roughly 1:30 a.m. ET Thursday. There are various ways to interact with EtherDelta; either through the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet (the safest way), through a software wallet such as Metamask (a little less safe), or by just entering your private key into the site itself (the least safe way). It's difficult to say whether private keys were exposed to the hack, but it's possible. Users would probably do well to move any funds out of the wallets used for interacting with EtherDelta into new, secure wallets. You can check the state of the wallets you used with EtherDelta over at deltabalances.github.io. This hack is another warning of the dangers when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

Tom McKay,"The government of North Korea has set official dates to decommission its sole known nuclear test site, specifically between the dates of May 23rd and 25th, Reuters reported the country’s state media as saying on Saturday. According to the report, North Korea says it will effectively destroy the entire Punggye-ri facility, preventing its future use in nuclear tests without major renovations—and it’s promising that there will be at least some transparency in the process: The official Korean Central New Agency said dismantlement of the Punggye-ri nuclear test ground would involve collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts. “The Nuclear Weapon Institute and other concerned institutions are taking technical measures for dismantling the northern nuclear test ground... in order to ensure transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test,” KCNA said. The demolition of the test site could be fairly described as a major advancement towards lowered tensions between North Korea on the one side and South Korea and its many allies on the other, which have remained consistently high since the Korean War resulted not in a true peace but a continued armistice dating to 1953. It comes not long after US President Donald Trump committed to a June 12th summit with none other than Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, though South Koreans themselves appear to be giving the lion’s share of the credit to their President Moon Jae-in, whose popularity ratings have skyrocketed after he spearheaded the attempt to bolster relations. There’s reason to be somewhat cautious or even suspicious. Though the recent shows of mutual deescalation are unprecedented, there’s always the risk that negotiations could fail due to intransigence on either side —and even in a best-case scenario, the odds could be long that the players involved can commit to a long-term deal. For example, North Korea paused missile tests from 1999 to 2006, only to restart them, and it was only a few months ago that Trump was threatening to level the whole country with the US military’s nuclear arsenal. Moreover, Chinese scientists have already concluded that the site in question is worthless after satellite imagery suggested its overlaying 7,200 peak, Mount Mantap, appears to have experienced partial collapse during testing. Subsequent tunnel collapses are rumored to have killed hundreds of workers, which North Korea’s government may have deemed irreplaceable losses. Further damage to Punggye-ri could release radioactive dust trapped in the rubble and cause a regional catastrophe. So in other words, it’s possible North Korean officials are coming to the table because they have nothing to lose from giving up the test site. Internally, Quartz reported, state media has been fostering the impression the negotiations are only possible because North Korea already has missiles and nuclear weapons, and they’re probably not all that interested in surrendering them. Finally, Reuters noted North Korea said it would welcome international journalists to view the destruction of the test site, but they have not yet done the same for international experts who could verify the facility was properly destroyed. Still, according to Reuters, a little bit of optimism isn’t unreasonable, even if Punggye-ri’s demise would not signal the end of North Korean capabilities. Jeffrey Lewis of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies told the news agency Punggye-ri’s demolition would be a “good confidence building measure,” while former Los Alamos National Laboratory director Siegfried Hecker said it would be a “big and positive step.” [ Reuters ]","The government of North Korea has set official dates to decommission its sole known nuclear test site, specifically between the dates of May 23rd and 25th, Reuters reported the country’s state media as saying on Saturday.

Rachel Kraus,"Cryptocurrencies are crashing. People are panicking. The crypto faithful, however, abide by one word: HODL. HODL, an intentional typo of ""hold,"" has become the rallying cry for cryptocurrency traders in the face of this recent Bitcoin crash, which has extended to other popular coins like Ethereum and Litecoin. It's an instruction for traders to, um, ""hold"" their Bitcoin instead of selling it. There's a certain emotion to it, pointing to the steadfast belief of some that blockchain-based currencies will change the world — and generate a lot of value for people holding crypto along the way. ""HODL"" is being tossed around by the crpto crowd the way U.S. soccer fans chant "" I believe that we will win. "" The term HODL isn't brand new. It has popped up in the midst of other Bitcoin crashes, and is being employed this time to stave off catastrophe, too. Google Trends shows how search interest has spiked for HODL in recent months. In the past couple days, HODL has proven more important than ever. Bitcoin's dramatic rally in 2017 moved the cryptocurrency from weird internet quirk to mainstream phenomenon. The blockchain-based currency started 2017 valued under $1,000 and finished the year close to $20,000. In recent days, however, bitcoin has crashed back to... well, closer to $10,000. That means plenty of people have made money, but a lot of people who bought into the cryptocurrency in hopes of a similar rise in 2018 are (at least thus far) disappointed. Enter HODL. The term is now being used by people who have decided not to sell during the recent crash as well as a kind of advice against reacting to the dramatic swings of cryptocurrency prices. But why the intentional typo from ""hold"" to ""HODL,"" you ask? Because the internet is a quirky-ass place. And because bitcoin was born here! So Wall Street can take its correct spellings and shove it up their Brooks Brothers Butts. HODL comes a now-legendary message board post entitled ""I AM HODLING."" The screed came from what appeared to be a very drunk man in the midst of a 2013 Bitcoin crash. Internet slang and lingo has long embraced misspellings that tend to happen when typing. The early blog generation — the LiveJournals, Xangas, Hipster Runoffs of the internet — invented the ""teh,"" the unnecessary pluralz, the always lower case ""i's"" and u n mes. But few pieces of slang have become a rallying cry like HODL. There's plenty more crypto slang where that came from. A quick crawl through the internet yields a few more: Shills : these are people who endorse altcoins without anybody asking their GD opinions. From what I can see, there are plentyyyyy of shills about. Nocoiner: u if u don't buy into crypto. Or, a derisive term for people who missed out on buying Bitcoin, and are now sad and bitter. You also are a frequent experiencer of something we here at Mashable like to call "" SchadenCoin."" Shitcoin : (BOY THERE SURE ARE A LOT OF COIN TERMS IN HERE) An altcoin that becomes worthless, or is a scam. You can still make money on a shitcoin, as long as you're in and out at the right time. Pump and Dump : This isn't a phrase native to cryptocurrencies, but has become part of the conversation due to the aforementioned shills. A ""pump and dump"" refers to buying up a bunch of coins, talking up how great the coin is, and then selling it if the price rises. Bag Holder : Don't be this dude! Someone who buys during a high and then has no opportunity to sell without losing money, so he holds onto his bag for an eternity. BUT HEY, according to the HODLers, even for bag holders, HODLing is the safest thing you can do. Happy HODLing!","Cryptocurrencies are crashing. People are panicking.

Matt Patches,"The series finale of Adventure Time ended with a catastrophic event. GLOB, a godly being bent on spreading chaos through the dimensions, descended upon Ooo like a geostorm. Friends and foes of the Candy Kingdom assembled to defeat it, but in the end, only Betty, who initially summoned the entity, and the power of the Ice Kings crown could send GLOB back to the nightmare from which it came. Finn and a restored Simon escaped, Bubblegum and Marceline found comfort in each others embrace, and Ooo survived for another day. If the parallels to our own escalatingly violent environment werent enough, the first page of Boom! Studios and Cartoon Networks new, canon-approved comic, Adventure Time: Season 11, offers a haunting and hopeful message. I know it looks bad, Bubblegum tells Marceline among the rubble of the Candy Kingdom, but destruction is often an opportunity for growth. The Candy Kingdom may have needed to sour before becoming truly sweet again, but as Adventure Time: Season 11 #1 shows us, its going to take some serious to work to achieve the growth. Turns out the problem isnt in the present where the Bubblegum/Marceline romance is very much alive, Simon is a helping hand and Finn, Jake and BMO are amped to rebuild the treehouse but in a future reminiscent of the one we saw bookending the series finale, which found two new characters, Beth and Shermy, traversing a transformed Ooo. Boom! Studios The future version of Ooo is not that cheery of a place, Adventure Time executive producer Adam Muto told Polygon after the finale. You get the sense that another apocalypse has sort of happened in the meantime. That was kind of something the show was built on, too. Obviously Shermy [who appears in the episode bookends set further ahead in time] has got Finn-like qualities, and these analogies could exist. We dont see Beth and Shermy in this first issue, but after BMO spontaneously breaks down, Finn and Jake are summoned by an unknown voice into a flaming portal, which hurtles them 1,000 years into the future. On the other side of time, writer Ted Anderson, working off a story by Eisner-winner Sonny Liew ( The Art of Charlie Hock Chye ), introduces us to a darkened, purple Ooo. We also meet two new inhabitants: father-and-son farmers who, as we learn, are subservient to three robots and an unnamed Empress whos lording over the land. Where things go from there is the setup to an intriguing mystery, potentially seismic shake-up for the Adventure Time universe, and major spoiler territory. For all the melancholy topics Adventure Time explored over the years, Season 11 inches into uncharted waters: memories, materialism, and not only how we grow up, but how we grow up in the aftermath of tragedy. If you came of age in the wake of 9/11, or are feeling especially empathetic as climate change reports prognosticate our own slow-burn apocalypse, the writing in Season 11 may strike a particular chord. The people we know change; the world we know continually fades into new shades. When youre catapulted into a new, dangerous future literally, for Finn and Jake you can only grasp for understanding and solutions. This first issue goes there in only a few short pages. But like the cartoon series, Adventure Time: Season 11 is also full of vibrant art in this case, crayon-like sketches courtesy of artist Marina Julia and pithy comedy. The musicality of the show lives on in paperback, as does the adult-friendly lore. At one point, Finn and Jake wind up in hell, which could be The Nightosphere or not. The imagination swirls. Anything is possible. Boom! Studios But like the best of Adventure Time, Finns evolving perspective on the world remains at the core. Even before the adventure kicks off, Finn is confronted by his own mortality during the simple task of cleaning up the fallen treehouses clutter. Digging through old relics, filled with references for the observant Adventure Time fan, Finn steps back to wonder how we wound up with so much junk. BMO puts him on the spot: Is any of it important? I mean, they sorta ALL are, Finn replies. Or... NONE of them are. Finn is attached to what he knew, and that emotional tether might make his journey through the far, far future more difficult when he learns that the Ooo he knew is gone.","The Cartoon Network show’s series finale left room for more, and Boom!

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Israel sees Jerusalem as its indivisible capital but Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state French President Emmanuel Macron has told Donald Trump he is ""concerned"" the US leader could unilaterally recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Any decision on the contested city's status must be ""within the framework of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians"", Mr Macron said. Earlier, similar warnings came from a number of Arab and Muslim nations. Reports say the US president will recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital this week. Both Israelis and Palestinians claim the city as their capital. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption President Macron telephoned his US counterpart to express concern, the Élysée palace said The White House said Mr Trump would miss Monday's deadline to sign a waiver delaying the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But White House spokesman Hogan Gidley stressed that ""the president has been clear on this issue from the get-go: It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when"". Every president, including Mr Trump, has signed the waiver every six months since US Congress passed an act in 1995 calling for the embassy to be moved. What's so contentious about the move? The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed by the rest of the Arab and wider Islamic world. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel occupied the area in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries, including Israel's closest ally the US, maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. If the US recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it will put it out-of-step with the rest of the international community and reinforce Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities. What has been the international reaction? On Monday, Saudi Arabia said such a move before a final settlement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would ""have a detrimental impact on the peace process"". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has urged world leaders to intervene, saying ""such a US decision would destroy the peace process"". Jordan has warned of ""grave consequences"", while Arab League chief Abul Gheit has said such a move would ""nourish fanaticism and violence"".

"USA TODAY, Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY","Britain's Parliament has dealt a major blow to Prime Minister Theresa May, resoundingly rejecting her Brexit deal just 17 days before the U.K. is due to leave the bloc. (March 12)
 AP
LONDON  British lawmakers face a new Brexit test Wednesday as they vote on whether the country should leave the European Union without a formal exit deal. 
Britain's Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU for the second time in as many months late Tuesday in a move that dramatically increased political and business uncertainty over what happens next.
A ""no deal"" Brexit, according to analysts and political scientists could lead to chaos at ports, grounded flights, traffic jams and food shortages. Buckingham Palace has re-purposed a Cold War-era emergency escape plan for Queen Elizabeth II in the event this default EU-divorce position causes social unrest or other disturbances.

More: British lawmakers reject Theresa May's Brexit plan for second time
Lawmakers will be given an option Wednesday to back leaving the EU in less than three weeks without an agreement, but because they are likely to reject it an additional vote has been scheduled for Thursday when they could choose to delay Brexit. 
However, if Britain decides it wants to delay Brexit it would still need to seek approval from an EU that has grown increasingly frustrated with Britain's inability to speak with a unified voice over the terms of its exit from the bloc. The EU has demanded ""credible justification"" before it would grant any request to delay Brexit.
""I dont see reason to give any extension if first of all we dont know what the majority position is of the House of Commons,"" Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit official, said Wednesday. ""We are waiting now for a proposal from London. It is now in London that they have to find a way out of this and break the deadlock.""
Still, if the ""no deal"" option is voted down Wednesday, and Thursday's vote does not lead to a delay approved by the EU, then Britain will still depart the EU on March 29 without a deal because that is the default position under current legislation. 
The British government sought to reassure industry leaders Wednesday by publishing details of its contingency plans under a ""no deal"" scenario. These include cutting tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from outside the EU and measures to avoid a ""hard border"" between Britain's Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. 
Investors have been closely watching Brexit, which has caused volatility for the value of the British pound, although they appeared to shrug off the latest developments. Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 index traded flat on Wednesday. 
Dominic Grieve, Britain's former attorney general and a supporter of staying in the EU from May's ruling Conservative Party, told BBC radio that crashing out of the bloc without a deal would be an ""absolute catastrophe."" Grieve, who has advocated for a second public vote on whether Britain should leave the EU, has previously warned that a ""no deal"" Brexit could force the nation to declare a ""state of emergency.""   
""Politicians have spectacularly failed,"" said Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere GroupGroup, a London-based financial consultancy. ""Allowing the public to vote and giving them a final say is quite simply the only credible solution now available."" 
For many British lawmakers one of the chief stumbling blocks of May's EU deal relates to the status of Northern Ireland's border with Ireland. 
EU-facilitated friction-less trade and travel across this border is viewed as a key cog in ensuring peace between Northern Irelands Irish Catholic community and its British Protestant one. It underpins the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 peace deal between the British and Irish governments and political parties in Northern Ireland.
May has negotiated with the EU a mechanism, known as the ""backstop,"" to safeguard this open border. But supporters of Brexit fear it could be used to bind the country to EU regulations indefinitely, thus significantly watering down its exit from the bloc.

SINAN ARAL,"For all categories of information — politics, entertainment, business and so on — we found that false stories spread significantly farther, faster and more broadly than did true ones. Falsehoods were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted, even when controlling for the age of the original tweeter’s account, its activity level, the number of its followers and followees, and whether Twitter had verified the account as genuine. These effects were more pronounced for false political stories than for any other type of false news. Surprisingly, Twitter users who spread false stories had, on average, significantly fewer followers, followed significantly fewer people, were significantly less active on Twitter, were verified as genuine by Twitter significantly less often and had been on Twitter for significantly less time than were Twitter users who spread true stories. Falsehood diffused farther and faster despite these seeming shortcomings. And despite concerns about the role of web robots in spreading false stories, we found that human behavior contributed more to the differential spread of truth and falsity than bots did. Using established bot-detection algorithms, we found that bots accelerated the spread of true stories at approximately the same rate as they accelerated the spread of false stories, implying that false stories spread more than true ones as a result of human activity. Why would that be? One explanation is novelty. Perhaps the novelty of false stories attracts human attention and encourages sharing, conveying status on sharers who seem more “in the know.” Our analysis seemed to bear out this hypothesis. Using accepted computerized methods for inferring emotional content from word use, we found that false stories inspired replies on Twitter expressing greater surprise than did true stories. The truth, on the other hand, inspired more joy and trust. Such emotions may shed light on what inspires people to share false stories. As we learn more about how and why false news spreads, we should test interventions to dampen its diffusion. For example, though it was disheartening to learn that humans are more responsible for the spread of false stories than previously thought, this finding also implies that behavioral interventions may succeed in stemming the tide of falsity. It could be, for example, that labeling news stories, in much the same way we label food, could change the way people consume and share it. Financial incentives are another possible tool. The social media advertising market creates incentives for the spread of false stories because their wider diffusion makes them profitable. If platforms were to demote accounts or posts that disseminated false stories, using algorithms to weed out falsehoods, the financial incentives would presumably be reduced. The tricky question, of course, would be: Who gets to decide what is true and false? Our research is just the beginning. A more robust identification of the factors that drive the spread of true and false news will require direct interaction with users through interviews, surveys and lab experiments. We could also benefit from randomized controlled trials of efforts to dampen the spread of false stories. Some notion of truth is central to the proper functioning of nearly every realm of human endeavor. If we allow the world to be consumed by falsity, we are inviting catastrophe.

Laura Geggel Senior Writer,"How can humans limit catastrophic climate change? We can phase out fossil-fuel emitters — such as coal-burning power plants, jet-fuel-slurping planes and gas-thirsty automobiles — once they reach their retirement age, a new study finds.
And we need to start doing that now, the researchers said.
If society actually did that, we'd have a 64 percent chance of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, said study lead researcher Christopher Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, in England. [6 Unexpected Effects of Climate Change]
""We could ramp down all of the fossil-fuel-emitting infrastructure that we have, all of the way until it reaches the end of its life,"" Smith told Live Science. ""And then we'd replace it with something [that emits] zero carbon.""
More From LiveScience
However, this plan — while scientifically sound — is likely a pie-in-the-sky idea that won't happen anytime soon, said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who wasn't involved with the research.
""It's just not going to happen,"" Wuebbles told Live Science. ""It's so much cheaper to rehabilitate existing facilities than it is to totally close everything off.""
On the upside, weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels will likely happen at some point, just not tomorrow, Wuebbles said. Generally, it takes about 40 to 50 years for society to change its major power sources, for instance from coal to nuclear power plants. ""I think this one [from fossil fuels to renewable energy] is going to occur somewhat more rapidly, but it's still going to be hard,"" Wuebbles said.
Climate change calculation
Smith's team chose the 2.7 degree F (1.5 degree C) benchmark because that's a temperature increase that could unleash extreme flooding on small island states, he said. ""The difference in the sea level rise of the rate of warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees [celsius] would literally be life or death for them,"" Smith said.
And because climate change doesn't follow a linear trajectory (instead, it becomes much worse at high levels of warming), an increase of 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) could be catastrophic, Smith noted. That said, ""it is probably better to aim for [1.5 degrees C] and miss it slightly than it is for us to say 2 degrees is fine,"" Smith said. ""Because 1.6 [degrees C] is still a lot better than 2. I would definitely say we should have ambition and every fraction of a degree warming we can avoid is a good thing.""
So, he and his colleagues got to work to see whether humans could stick to the 2.7 degree F (1.5 degrees C) benchmark if societies the world over phased out sources of fossil fuels and then replaced them with zero-carbon alternatives. It was possible, they found; if the plan was followed, carbon-dioxide emissions would become near zero after just 40 years. [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted]
""If we don't build any new fossil fuel infrastructure, there is a good chance we'll avoid the worst impacts of climate change,"" Smith said. There is hope on the horizon, too, he added. Even if some federal governments aren't taking action, some state governments and companies are. For instance, in December 2018, the shipping giant Maersk pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050.
But humans have to act quickly, Smith noted. If governments and private industries wait until 2030 to start phasing out fossil-fuel emitters, there will only be a 50 percent chance that the world will be able to keep the average temperature increase to 2.7 degrees F, even if the rate of fossil-fuel retirement is accelerated, the researchers found.
Meanwhile, the transition will likely happen, but a lot more slowly than the study plan calls for, Wuebbles said. ""The bottom line is, I agree with the concept of the paper, it's an interesting piece of work, he said. ""I just don't see the political systems responding, unfortunately.""
The study also has two major caveats. First, it does not ""assess the practical feasibility of this transition,"" but rather focuses on the numbers, the researchers wrote in the study. That's a tall order, as phasing out fossil-fuel emitters will be an expensive and time-consuming mission, especially in industries that don't have good green energy alternatives yet, such as aviation.
In addition, the study doesn't consider hard-to-predict climate-change contributors, such as permafrost melt or forest dieback, which were not included in their model, Smith said. But even if these events occur, limiting human-made greenhouse gases is still worthwhile, Smith said.
The study was published online today (Jan. 15) in the journal Nature Communications.

They can turn to the Dominican Republic, which revoked citizenship status from an estimated 200,000 Dominicans of Haitian descent in 2013 amid international outcry, creating the largest stateless population in the Western Hemisphere. That ongoing crisis is an example of the consequences of taking the racist ideology underlying birthright debates (which often frame the usually dark-skinned descendants of immigrants as unworthy of full rights) to the extreme. The Dominican Republic shares an island with Haiti, its much poorer, less stable neighbor. For decades Dominicans have discriminated against and committed atrocities against people of Haitian descent, who are mostly darker-skinned and speak Creole, in contrast to Spanish-speaking Dominicans. Haitian immigrants are a crucial part of the countrys low-wage labor force and the two countries cultures and ancestry have become intertwined over the years. The Dominican Republic rewrote its constitution in 2010 to end the practice of granting birthright citizenship, though without changing the status of current citizens. The true crisis came in 2013, when the Dominican Republics highest court suddenly ruled that the new constitution should be applied retroactively, so that anyone born in the country to non-citizen parents since 1929 would no longer be considered a citizen. This meant people who had never been to Haiti, may not have known anyone in the country, and didnt speak Creole were expected to build a new life there. The slogans protesters immediately fired back with were telling: Soy Dominicano como tu (Im Dominican like you) and, Somos Dominicanos y tenemos derechos (Were Dominicans and we have rights). The ruling sparked outrage from human rights advocatesalthough notably the US continued to send the country millions in military aid, and even continued to dispatch Border Patrol agents to help train their Dominican counterparts. In response to the backlash, the Dominican Republic allowed affected people to reapply for citizenship for one year, but only a fraction of those stripped of their status were able to take advantage of that offer because many lacked birth certificates. Kristy Belton, a program coordinator at the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion who studies the Caribbean, said, (Dominican Haitians) see themselves as Dominicans still. The state has acted against them, but theyre very mobilized and active, fighting to regain the documents theyve lost. They realize theyre being discriminated against but theyre very strong in their assertion of their right to be Dominican. Everyone in the Dominican Republic has to periodically re-certify their birth certificates, which they need to obtain official IDs, Belton explained. This could be a difficult process for Dominican Haitians to get through even before the 2013 ruling. But now its nearly impossible for them to get the IDs that are necessary to enroll in school, open a bank account, get a job, or go to the hospital, among other routine life tasks. The stateless people who remain in the Dominican Republic have little hope of living normal lives without valid IDs, even if they dont attract the attention of the authorities. You need your identity card to do absolutely everything, Juan Antuan, a Dominican who was denied his ID between 2008 and 2014, told Amnesty International. You could be somebody with a lot of experience in a specific area but without an ID card, you cant be contracted I wanted to go to university and then suddenly everything is paralyzed. The experiences of these suddenly stateless people underscores what can happen when someones home country revokes their citizenship. If you dont have a secure citizenship status, unless youre living in a steadfast democracy that will at least respect your human rights then youre in danger and you dont have another country to go to for security, Belton said. And though the Dominican Republic expelled tens of thousands of people of Haitian descent following the court decision, Haiti also failed to provide for them once they crossed the border. As Human Rights Watch researcher Skye Wheeler highlighted in a 2016 report, Neither the Haitian nor the Dominican government is helping some of the most vulnerable undocumented people. According to that report, some pregnant women displaced to the Haitian side of the border were so desperate for medical care they bribed border patrol agents to let them return to the Dominican Republican so they could have sonograms and cesarean sections. In 2016, mainstream press coverage started ramping up about the thousands of Dominican Haitians being forced out of their country. An estimated 40,000 people were deported between August 2015 and May 2016, as Amnesty International warned that hundreds were unlawfully deported in the sweep, which observers say was clearly based on race. When you read the text [of the constitution and the court ruling] itself you dont see a direct link to race, said Amnesty International Caribbean spokesperson Elina Castillo Jiménez. Its not until you stand up and analyze whos being affected by this type of decision you realize that most of the people are Dominicans of Haitian descent and it ultimately does connect to the color of their skin and the way they live and their hair. Many others fled voluntarily, feeling unwelcome and intimidated, and built shantytowns on the border. A man named Manuel Don living at a border community told the Guardian in 2016, Over there, Dominicans would pick up machetes and yell at the Haitians to leave. Its clearly unlikely that the US would ratify a constitutional amendment to end birthright citizenship, or that the Supreme Court would make a ruling forcing millions of citizens to flee the country. But ending birthright citizenship would still probably create a new class of stateless people who were either born to undocumented parents or who would have difficulty providing their statuses through paperwork. It could also heighten discrimination and hostility against Hispanic communities in particular. Even if the change wasnt applied retroactively as it was in the Dominican Republic, the newborn babies of the over 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the US would find themselves in a desperate situation. If you decide babies and children are not citizens then that makes them invisible in the eyes of any government, Amnestys Elina Castillo Jiménez said. Depriving people of their citizenship should be taken really seriously. Notably, anti-immigration Dominican politicians see themselves as aligned with Trump. Before President Trump proposed the wall with Mexico, we in the Dominican Republic have been raising the need for a wall, right-wing Dominican politician Pelegrin Castillo recently told the New York Review of Books. We see in the Trump administration and in the policies that he promotes an opportunity to rethink all these issues, because with the previous administration it was not possible. Fortunately, outside of the Dominican Republic it doesnt seem that there has been any particular push to end birthright citizenship, which is a common policy in countries in the Americas. If Trump really followed through on his threat to attempt to end birthright citizenship, it would be an enormous policy change. The Dominican Republic should serve as a warning both about what can happen when a country moves to revoke citizenship, and about the virulent anti-immigrant hostility behind such rhetoric. Even though in the US birthright debates are mostly political bluster, Belton said, its an important conversation to have because it brings out these strong strains of racism that undergird a lot of immigration policy.

Sixteen Palestinians were killed on Friday after Israeli soldiers opened fire on some violent demonstrators. President Erdogan accused Mr Netanyahu of being ""a terrorist"" on Sunday. It came after Mr Netanyahu rejected Ankara's ""moral lessons"" and accused Turkey of indiscriminately bombing civilians in its actions abroad. ""The most moral army in the world will not be lectured to on morality from someone who for years has been bombing civilians indiscriminately,"" the Israeli leader said on Twitter.

Mr Erdogan had earlier labelled the Israeli response on Friday an ""inhumane attack"". ""Hey Netanyahu! You are occupier. And it is as an occupier that are you are on those lands. At the same time, you are a terrorist,"" Mr Erdogan said in a televised address on Sunday. The escalating war of words comes amid growing international criticism of the Israeli military response. Clashes broke out after thousands of Palestinians marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The demonstration comes ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel and the exodus of many Arabs - which Palestinians refer to as the ""Nakba"" (Catastrophe).

Palestinians accused Israel of using disproportionate force in their response, with leader Mahmoud Abbas saying Israel bore ""full responsibility"" for the bloodshed.

Barbara Unmussig,"BERLIN ( Project Syndicate ) According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the worlds main scientific authority on global warming, keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is a feasible goal. The IPCC's stance represents a move in the direction of the kind of radical realism that many civil-society actors have long advocated. The IPCC does not bet on geo-engineering proposals for example, deep-ocean sequestration of massive amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or dimming the sun by spraying the atmosphere with aerosols to combat global warming. These largely theoretical solutions could have untold consequences for people and ecosystems, worsening not only the climate crisis, but also the other social and ecological crises we face. Instead, the IPCC focuses on how we can avoid crossing the 1.5°C threshold in the first place. We must, it asserts, decarbonize the global economy immediately to ensure that global CO2 emissions decline by about 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Limiting global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is the only way to achieve social justice while protecting our environment from devastating climate change. And, contrary to prevailing wisdom, its not an impossible goal. Achieving this will require not just transforming economic activity, but also confronting destructive power dynamics and social inequalities. Radical Realism for Climate Justice, a new anthology published by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, sets out strategies developed by international civil-society and social movements to bring about such change. In line with the IPCC's core message, we urgently need a politically managed decline in fossil-fuel production. This means putting a brake on oil, coal, and gas production and exploration. As the group Oil Change International notes, it does not mean abrupt or panicked action that could lead to a sudden and dramatic shut-down of fossil fuel production, stranding assets, damaging economies, and harming workers and communities reliant on the energy sector. In building up the renewable-energy sector, we should avoid replicating systems that have driven inequality and entrenched damaging power dynamics in the fossil-fuel sector and other industries. This means replacing the market-based, investor-focused approach to energy production with one that treats energy as a public good, while engineering a shift toward social ownership and management of energy supplies. Rooted in energy sovereignty and self-determination, this approach would spur faster decarbonization, including by weakening vested interests power to resist change. It would also facilitate the restructuring of energy systems to serve social and ecological needs. Another system-level transformation that would facilitate major emissions reductions would be the creation of a zero-waste circular economy, whereby everything we produce and consume returns safely to nature or is recycled and reused. Consider textiles production, which in 2015 generated greenhouse-gas emissions totaling 1.2 billion tons of CO2-equivalents. These massive emissions more than the combined total for all international flights and maritime shipping reflect a fast fashion culture that produces garments as cheaply as possible, with the expectation of constant turnover in peoples wardrobes. If each garment were replaced half as often, the industrys total greenhouse-gas emissions would plummet by 44%. A zero-waste circular economy for textiles would include not just more use of the clothes that are produced, but also improved recycling and repurposing of materials, to avoid emissions-producing waste-disposal processes like incineration. The biggest gains would come from the introduction of less wasteful production processes. Important steps should also be taken regarding land use (encompassing agriculture and zoning changes). As the international peasants movement La Via Campesina shows, the industrial food systems emissions including those from production, fertilizers, transport, processing, packaging, cooling, and food waste, and from deforestation associated with the expansion of industrial agriculture account for 44% to 57% of the global total. A peasant agro-ecological production system based on food sovereignty, small-scale farming, and agro-ecology could, La Via Campesina argues, halve carbon emissions from agriculture within a few decades. This approach is proven to work: small-scale farmers, peasants, fishers, indigenous communities, rural workers, women, and youth already feed 70% of the worlds population, while using only 25% of its agricultural resources. There is also a need to restore natural ecosystems that have been destroyed. Forests and peatlands, in particular, can sequester several hundred gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere. Their restoration would protect not just biodiversity, but also local people, including the indigenous communities whose land-tenure rights have been systematically violated. In fact, retaining and expanding the land area under management by indigenous peoples and local communities could protect over 1,000 GtCO2 worth of carbon stocks. According to a report by the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance, ecosystem-based approaches in the land sector and agro-ecological changes to food production and consumption systems including more local ownership could deliver 13 GtCO2eq per year in avoided emissions, and almost 10 GtCO2eq annually in sequestered carbon by 2050. The result would be 448 GtCO2 in cumulative removals by 2100 around 10 times current global annual emissions. Limiting global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is our best hope of containing the effects of a climate crisis born of historical injustices and deep-rooted inequities. The only way to succeed will be to undertake a shift to a new socioeconomic system. This means abandoning the single-minded obsession with gross domestic product growth which has facilitated the proliferation of wasteful production and consumption patterns and fueled economic and social inequality and injustice in favor of a public-goods approach that serves genuinely to make peoples lives better. Demanding such a transformation is not naive or politically unfeasible. It is radically realistic. In fact, it is the only way we can achieve social justice while protecting our environment from devastating climate change. Barbara Unmüssig is president of the Heinrich Böll Foundation.

Credit Menahem Kahana/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Even as American and Israeli officials prepared to celebrate President Trump’s move of the embassy to Jerusalem — which previous American administrations have been unwilling to do — thousands of Palestinians took to the streets in protest. In the West Bank, Palestinians marched at midday in cities from Hebron to Nablus. Outside the Qalandiya refugee camp north of Jerusalem, youths released bunches of black balloons that carried aloft black Palestinian flags, bespeaking their disdain for the American move. Clashes pitting demonstrators throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails against security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets began even before hundreds of marchers had arrived there from Ramallah. Many Israelis see the relocation of the embassy as simply acknowledging that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital. But Palestinians, who hope to see the eastern part of Jerusalem become the capital of a Palestinian state, see the move as an abdication of any vestige of American impartiality in determining the region’s future. The embassy opening was set to begin at 4 p.m., with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and President Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, among the dignitaries attending, as well as a small contingent of Republican lawmakers. A bigger clash is planned for Tuesday. Photo Tear gas at demonstrations near the border between Gaza and Israel on Monday. Credit Mohammed Abed/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The mass protests in Gaza, promoted by Hamas, were expected to peak on Tuesday with an effort by thousands of people to cross the fence, despite warnings from Israel, possibly setting the stage for more bloodshed. The demonstrations were originally meant to protest the economic blockade by Israel of Gaza, the impoverished region governed by Hamas. Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank, have joined in the economic squeeze that has left Gazans increasingly desperate. The timing is no accident — May 15 is observed by Palestinians as the anniversary of what they call the nakba, or catastrophe. It marks the expulsion or flight from the newly formed Jewish state of hundreds of thousands of Arabs in 1948, who have been unable to return or reclaim property they left behind. Some of the demonstrators have thrown gasoline bombs or rolled burning tires toward Israeli soldiers, and Israeli security forces have said that some of the Palestinians who were killed were armed with semiautomatic rifles. The demonstrations at the Gaza fence have taken place primarily on Fridays since March 30, and have already left dozens of people dead and thousands injured. David M.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and to help gather data on how many of them will be coming back 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami hit their city. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. The official death toll is 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered. No one knows how many people are missing, especially in the areas hit by liquefaction, but it could be as high as 5,000, the national disaster agency said. At one state high school, teenagers dressed in gray and white uniforms swept up broken glass in the classrooms. Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked. “It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university. The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp. School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers. “We won’t force the students to come back because many are traumatized. But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don’t fall behind,” he said. The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said. GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo POSITIVE THINKING At the SMP Negeri 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up. School principal Abdul Rashid said he was aware of four students killed in the quake. “Classes haven’t started. We’re only collecting data to find out how many students are safe,” he said. “I’m still waiting for the Ministry of Education to give us instructions on when to begin classes. For now, I don’t think we’re ready. Many children are traumatized and frightened.” One boy chatting in the school compound with friends said he was disappointed that so few of his class mates had shown up. “I haven’t heard from so many of them. I want to think positively; I hope they are OK,” said Muhamad Islam Bintang Lima, dressed in the school uniform of white shirt and navy blue trousers. Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city. Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. A spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said on Sunday searches for bodies would stop on Thursday. Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks, sports venues and other public spaces, the spokesman said. Indonesia is hosting an International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting on the resort island of Bali this week, which has drawn some criticism from the political opposition. “What is the benefit for us Indonesian people, especially in this time of catastrophe,” Fadli Zon, deputy speaker of parliament from the opposition nationalist Gerindra party, said on Twitter, taking issue with government spending on the meeting. The government has allocated $37 million to help victims of the earthquake.

Dina Fine Maron,"Responding to fears of an imminent Soviet nuclear attack, in 1951 Pres. Harry Truman set up a national system enabling the president to quickly notify the public of an impending national security threat via a cross-country relay chain of AM radio stations. It used characteristic blaring warning tones and became a precursor of the Emergency Alert System still in use today. “There are certain stations across every market that listen for those tones and then retransmit the alert to other stations in their market,” says John Lawson, an emergency alert expert who has advised the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on its modern warning systems. A 2006 bill passed under Pres. George W. Bush augmented that capability with wireless text message alerts that could theoretically be sent to every cell phone across the country in the event of a national emergency like a nuclear attack. But surprisingly this new system has never even been tested—so Pres. Donald Trump plans to send an inaugural test alert on October 3. (It had initially been slated for September 20, but FEMA says the plan was delayed by the need to focus on Hurricane Florence.) This week Lawson spoke with Scientific American about how the new alert system may play out. Lawson serves as executive director of a private sector technology collaboration group called the Advanced Warning and Response Network (AWARN) Alliance, and spends his days thinking about how to best prepare communities for unthinkable disasters. AWARN aims to create alerting systems that could still function if the cellular network jams or the power grid goes down. [ An edited transcript of the interview follows ] How would this presidential text message alert system work? It’s my understanding that the code to send an emergency alert and the instructions would travel with the president in the “football”—the suitcase with the nuclear launch codes. [Asked for the agency’s perspective on the alert system, a FEMA spokesperson said she would not immediately be able to provide details or make an expert available for an interview.] Other than a nuclear attack, what circumstances would make it appropriate for the president to send a text versus, say, one coming from the head of FEMA? The president could theoretically use it for any other type of alert as decided by the president. Our current president is very active on Twitter, and I think one concern is that—without some sort of filter system in place—the president could send one of these national alerts and incite panic, or even an international incident of some kind. To your question about potential abuse, yeah, it’s possible. It does come down to a trust of civilian authority, of the commander in chief. Let’s go back to the cold war context, which is relevant here. You have to trust somebody. Let’s say there is a massive cyber attack that takes out the grid. Ironically the old emergency alert system, because it uses AM radio and the daisy chain, would probably survive that. Whereas the new system that depends on internet distribution probably wouldn’t—it is good we have both alert systems. So is it a good thing FEMA is setting up this presidential alert system now and testing it, even if it probably wouldn’t work in that scenario without the grid? Absolutely. I would say it’s about time. Who would be involved in helping to draft this kind of presidential text alert, and also handing the president the necessary instruction and whatnot to “press send”? I’m assuming he wouldn’t just be sending this from his phone like a tweet? I’m pretty sure a lot of that is classified. What’s the legislative background leading to this national emergency alert system? The Wireless Emergency Alert, or WEA, system was created by the WARN Act passed by Congress in 2006 [WARN stands for Warning, Alert and Response Network]. It was designed to motivate the wireless carriers to provide a text message system for emergency alerting, and there was a procedure—a rulemaking—at the Federal Communications Commission. There was an advisory subcommittee, and I was on that, to help establish the rules that led to the present system. WEA provides for any authorized originator, often county governments, to use that system for imminent threat emergencies. And it also allows people, users, to opt out of these alerts—except for an alert from the president of the United States. So these alerts are sent by a county government and go over the internet to an aggregator, a server managed by FEMA, to authenticate them. They are then redistributed to local wireless carriers that retransmit them to cell towers. “Authenticate” makes it sound kind of vague and mysterious. You mean there is a person who double-checks that these are valid warnings, and has to take action? Or is it more like a CAPTCHA system (which thwarts internet spam), that just makes sure it’s a real signal? I’m pretty sure no human touches it. A CAPTCHA would be a good analogy. It’s some sophisticated system of authentication that involves codes and passwords and other software that would detect what is legitimate and what’s not. Okay, well what would rise to the level of needing a presidential alert beyond a nuclear threat? It seems to me that most emergencies are regional—like a flood, earthquake or even a sinkhole. It’s always something horrible that we haven’t imagined. I can see the system being used post-attack. If this presidential wireless alert system was created under George W. Bush, why are we only testing it now? I think there have been many alerting failures recently, so that momentum is picking up to do something and improve our system. Hawaii [where an alert system erroneously sent text-message warnings of an incoming ballistic missile in January] was certainly a catalyzing moment. Post-Hawaii there has been a heightened awareness that we need to up our game in terms of alerting. And it wasn’t just that instance. Last year at about this time there were massive wildfires in Sonoma and the North Bay region [in California], and people died—and the wireless alert system was not used to warn people. The Sonoma emergency manager had reasons not to send them [warning texts]: One was because the number of characters [90] is so limited that you can’t really instruct people very specifically about what action they should take. If you say, “evacuate immediately,” well, in what direction? The alerts aren’t geotargeted, so you will warn people who aren’t affected—and they could then clog the roads so people can’t get emergency vehicles in.

Lizzie Plaugic,"The Iranian artist created a series of sculptures of dark goddesses I t sometimes seems like technology is at odds with the art world — a tension between brain and heart. But plenty of artists, from Da Vinci to Cory Arcangel, have proved that’s not true, and continue to prove it as technology evolves. In Technographica, we explore how contemporary artists are using technology in unusual and unexpected ways. The Iranian artist and activist Morehshin Allahyari is currently working on a project that transcends continents and centuries. Using ancient illustrations of Middle Eastern dark goddesses as her source material, Allahyari is producing 12 sculptures through a process of 3D modeling, scanning, and printing. The result is She Who Sees The Unknown, an attempt by Allahyari to reclaim ownership of traditional mythologies, and fight against “digital colonialism,” which she says is a recent trend that allows corporations to profit off of cultural artifacts of others. Currently on display at The Armory in New York City, She Who Sees the Unknown explores the “forgotten histories and narratives” of female figures in the Middle East and North Africa. “It’s a meaningful archive that’s focused on these kind of dark female figures in the Middle East,” Allahyari tells The Verge. “We don’t have that archive at all.” Allahyari at the Upfor Gallery booth at the Armory Art Fair Allahyari with source materials outside of her office at the School of Poetic Computation. She Who Sees the Unknown is a series of sculptures, but Allahyari is not actually a sculptor. “I wouldn’t know how to do that,” she tells The Verge. Instead, she uses computers and 3D printers to create her work. “The first time that I saw an object getting 3D printed… I was really fascinated by this idea of seeing a digital file, a digital model from a platform becoming a physical object,” she says. “It blew my mind actually watching that process.” According to Allahyari, “digital colonialism” refers to when, say, a startup goes to cultural sites in Middle East and attempts a reconstruction project, but doesn’t make the data available to the public. By using open source software, Allahyari is hoping to reclaim and redistribute forgotten cultural artifacts. Allahyari preps the file for her Aisha Qandisha sculpture for 3D printing at New York University's LaGuardia Studio with the help of Dhemerae K. Ford. “I want to offer another method to re-situate power,” she told The Verge, “through researching dark goddesses, monstrous, and jinn female figures of Middle Eastern origin, poetic-speculative storytelling, re-appropriation of traditional mythologies, collaging, meshing, 3D scanning, 3D printing, and archiving.” The process for creating She Who Sees the Unknown was multi-step. First, it involved researching and archiving information from Middle Eastern ancient texts to make the figures accurate. Then Allahyari created a scan each sculpture, and 3D printed it in resin with the Stratasys J750 printer. Each statue has a storytelling component, or a video essay that connects the power of the goddess to a particular modern source of oppression. Lastly, Allahyari will host a series of “ intimate public performances ” known as Ha’m-Neshini, or sitting together, in collaboration with other artists, scientists, and activists from the Middle East. Aisha Qandisha sculpture during the printing process on the Stratasys J750 printer at New York University's LaGuardia Studio. Each figure takes 15-25 hours to print. Allahyari sands the resin Aisha Qandisha sculpture. For Allahyari, this project, like most of her work, is personal. Allahyari, who has lived in the US since 2007, grew up in Tehran and has a US green card. Last year, after President Trump banned visitors and refugees from majority-Muslim countries, Allahyari was stuck in Berlin for 10 days after attending a conference there, because she had an Iranian passport. Allahyari hopes the 12 sculptures in the series will appear as if they are “an army of dark goddesses.” She has completed four sculptures so far, including Huma, “a jinn that brings heat to the human body,” Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj, two gods who represent chaos, and Aisha Qandisha, a Moroccan jinn known as “The Opener,” who creates a crack in the male body that opens up a space for other demons. “In this whole body of work, these figures and retelling their stories, is the idea about what it means to embrace monstrosities, and to take this power that these jinn have and use it against the powers that oppress,” Allahyari says. Detail of the Ya’Jooj and Ma’Jooj sculptures. The figure is part of the project, She Who Sees The Unknown, which ""recontextualizes goddesses and female Jinn of Persian and Arabic origin"" and ""explores ancient myths as they relate to digital colonialism, oppression, and catastrophe."" 3D printed in resin, the Huma (2017) sculpture stands at 12 inches tall. Huma is said to “bring heat to the human body and is a symbol of high temperature, madness and hallucination.” Sculptural pieces and video works from Morehshin Allahyari's project, She Who Sees The Unknown, on view at the Upfor Gallery booth at the Armory Art Fair in New York City.",The Iranian artist created a series of sculptures of dark goddesses,2018-03-24T18:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Morehshin Allahyari’s 3D-printed project pushes back against ‘digital colonialism’,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/24/17147826/morehshin-allahyari-she-who-sees-the-unknown-3d-printing-sculpture,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQq19KQKHusGQQ6Dd6jy-pq02es=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10415883/akrales_180307_2106_0090.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,catastrophe,0
Bill Chappell,"Ellicott City, Md.'s Main Street was turned into a raging river on Sunday, in a catastrophe that followed another flash flood in 2016. The water wrecked storefronts and left cars strewn amid debris on Monday. Katherine Frey/The Washington Post/Getty Images Fast-moving flood waters caused mayhem in Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, triggering an emergency declaration and urgent messages for residents to seek higher ground. One man remains missing, as crews work to clear the area. Howard County Police say Eddison Hermond, 39, of Severn, Md., is unaccounted for; they're asking the public to help find him. Washington-area radio news outlet WTOP describes Hermond as ""an Air Force veteran and a member of the National Guard."" A friend of Hermond's told WTOP that the veteran had been in a restaurant in downtown Ellicott City on Sunday; witnesses said he was swept away after trying to help people. Swiftwater rescue teams searched for Hermond last night, both on foot and in all-terrain vehicles – but the search was suspended and resumed on Monday, according to the Arbutus Volunteer Fire Department. Founded in 1772, Ellicott City's Main Street and downtown have been designated a historic district. The same area suffered massive flooding in 2016, when the city barely avoided having to tear down any buildings in a long and expensive rebuilding effort. In that catastrophe in July of 2016, two people died in what was called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" event. But in 2018, it has happened again, devastating an area that, due to its valley setting, had endured other floods in the past. ******* MISSING PERSON ALERT IN ELLICOTT CITY ******* this is eddison hermond. he was swept away in the ellicott city flooding yesterday around 5pm trying to help people and hasn't been seen or heard from since. if you have any news, please contact me #EllicottCityFlood pic.twitter.com/moxxJm1Sjj — Kenneth Josepha (@Kdogcony76) May 28, 2018 Rain storms have been seen growing more intense in recent years – but part of the difference, at least one expert says, also lies in how the area's land surface has changed. Discussing Ellicott City after the 2016 flash flood, Jeffrey B. Halverson, a geography professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, told member station WAMU : ""It's heavily paved, there's lots of narrow streets that act as very rapid conduits of water – so the flood was as much about the nature of the underlying land surface as it was the large amount of rain falling from the sky."" Intense flooding hit the town's Main Street in at least two waves on Sunday, shoving cars down the street and bursting through storefronts – including at several buildings where people found themselves suddenly trapped in stores and restaurants. Images and video from the scene are striking, showing fast-moving water rising nearly as high as the bottom edge of the streets' stop signs and obliterating anything in the torrent's path. One day after the flooding hit, people are reaching out to help. The Howard County government says anyone who wants to volunteer can register at its website – but that for now, the downtown area remains off-limits. The Visit Ellicott City organization says a local non-profit called the Ellicott City Partnership is taking donations to help the community recover from the flood, as it did in 2016. On Monday, conditions had dried out enough that salvage crews could begin towing vehicles that had been caught in the disaster.","Less than two years after what had been called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" flood in 2016, Ellicott City, Md., sees its historic downtown ravaged anew.

Cory Doctorow,"In the wake of the latest Facebook data breach catastrophe, Josh Constantine rounds up more than a decade's worth of major catastrophes wrought by Facebook's recklessness, greed, and foolishness, from Beacon to the ""Engagement Ranked Feed"" to the ""Engagement Priced Ad Auctions"" to the choices that created spamming games like Zynga's offerings, to the mass overwriting of privacy preferences, to ""ethnic affinity"" ad targeting, to the Real Names policy and the stalkers it abetted to Facebook's global anti-Net-Neutrality campaigns; to self-serve ads; to developer data access and the gift it handed to crooks like Cambridge Analytica. I'd actually forgotten about some of these; in some ways, Facebook is the Donald Trump of Big Tech, such a font of shitty behavior that it's impossible to remember all of the scandals, or even all of the biggest and worst ones. Ethnic Affinity Ad Targeting = Racist Exclusion – Facebook’s ad system previously let businesses target users in “ethnic affinity” groups such as “African-American” or “Hispanic” based on their in-app behavior as a stand in for racial targeting. The idea was likely to help businesses find customers interested in their products, but the tool was shown to allow exclusion of certain ethnic affinity groups in ways that could be used to exclude them from legally protected opportunities such as housing; employment, and loans. Facebook has since disabled this kind of targeting while investigates the situation. Real Name Policy = Enabling Stalkers – For years, Facebook strictly required to use their real names in order to reduce uncivility and bullying facilitated by hiding behind anonymity. But victims of stalking, domestic violence, and hate crimes argued that their abusers could use Facebook to track them down and harass them. Only after mounting criticism from the transgender community and others did Facebook slightly relax the policy in 2015, though some still find it onerous to set up a pseudonym on Facebook and dangerous to network without one. Internet.org = International Net Neutrality Concerns – Facebook’s plan to give free Internet access to developing nations has been largely criticized as merely a way to wrap a user growth strategy in a philanthropic bow. Internet.org’s app initially offered a limited set of free services, excluding some competing social networks and featuring Facebook’s products. While some think giving free access to a slice of the web is better than none for those who might not be able to afford it, others see the zero-rating programs as a form of digital colonialism designed to get the poor hooked on a certain company’s version of the Internet. The brand name didn’t help to dispel that. Telecom partners pulled out in India leading Facebook to open the program to all develpers and rename it “Free Basics”. A government ban forced it to withdraw the app from India, though it remains available in 50 countries.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption On board the Aquarius, people rest in cramped conditions Spain will welcome hundreds of migrants to Valencia on Sunday after they were rescued from the Mediterranean Sea and turned away by Italy and Malta. Three vessels will arrive carrying 630 migrants who were rescued near Libya last weekend by the Aquarius ship. A huge welcome banner will greet the migrants, while health officials and translators will offer support. Spain's new socialist government has promised free healthcare and says it will investigate each asylum case. ""It is our duty to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a safe port to these people, to comply with our human rights obligations,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said earlier this week. He has adopted a migrant-friendly stance since taking up his post two weeks ago. On Valencia's quayside, 1,000 Red Cross workers will help take the migrants in. There will also be police officers drafted in specifically to handle their arrival. Officials say the rescued migrants include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children under the age of 13 and seven pregnant women. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The migrants will be greeted by hundreds of volunteers, including translators and health officials The Aquarius sparked a major diplomatic row when it was left stranded on Monday. Italy's populist coalition - and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration and refused to let it dock. Mr Salvini says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx. He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it fell under Italian jurisdiction. Valencia's Mayor Joan Ribo, who has offered the ship a safe berth, described Italy's decision to turn the vessel away as inhuman. He told the BBC that he hoped the city's actions would act as an ""electric shock"" and lead to reform of Europe's migration policies. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron accused Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning the Aquarius away. His government will work with Spain to deal with the migrants. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said that any migrants who wish to go to France would be allowed to do, providing they had a legitimate claim to asylum. Image copyright EPA Image caption The migrants rescued by the Aquarius have spent a week in rough seas, many suffering seasickness, while their fate was decided The migrants aboard the Aquarius spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued.

Shara Tibken,"Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro in February launched an oil-backed cryptocurrency called the Petro. Getty Images If you've eyeing Venezuela's Petro digital currency, you're out of luck. President Donald J. Trump on Monday issued an executive order making it illegal for Americans to purchase any cryptocurrency issued by Venezuela as of January 9. He authorized Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to implement whatever rules and regulations are necessary to enforce the executive order. The South American country has been hit hard by hyperinflation and a shortage of cash. Its currency has been rapidly losing value, and Venezuelan citizens have been suffering from food and medicine shortages. In an effort to boost the failing economy and raise international financing, President Nicolas Maduro last month started offering an oil-backed digital currency called the Petro. The US, meanwhile, has issued sanctions against various Venezuelan leaders and has called on Maduro to distribute aid to his citizens and stop blocking foreign assistant offered to Venezuelans. The ban on the Petro in the US makes it more difficult for Maduro to raise funds, and the US has been considering issuing sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, the last industry propping up the economy.

"Mark Joseph Stern, Mark Joseph Stern","Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump. (Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images) On Monday, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision allowing states to purge voters from the rolls due to their failure to cast a ballot. The court’s ruling in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute is a catastrophe for voting rights that will lead to the disproportionate disenfranchisement of low-income and minority voters. It is also a huge win for the Trump administration, which jeopardized the Department of Justice’s institutional integrity in order to support Ohio’s efforts to purge infrequent voters. Husted began during the Obama administration, which strongly favored the expansion of voting rights. Under Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Department of Justice supported numerous lawsuits designed to block Republican efforts to suppress the suffrage. Husted was one such suit. Obama’s DOJ argued that Ohio violated the National Voter Registration Act by purging voters from the rolls because they skipped three consecutive federal elections and failed to return a mailer from the state. This process, the DOJ asserted, plainly ran afoul of the NVRA, which prohibits any state from removing a voter from the rolls “by reason of the person’s failure to vote.” (Congress later amended the NVRA to further clarify that “no registrant may be removed solely by reason of a failure to vote.”) The Justice Department’s position triumphed in the 6 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals toward the end of President Barack Obama’s tenure. But after the election—and the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch—the Supreme Court agreed to review the 6 th Circuit’s decision. A few months later, the DOJ, now under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, switched its position in the case. The agency urged the Supreme Court to reverse the 6 th Circuit and allow Ohio to purge voters on the basis of their failure to vote. Its brief gave no persuasive explanation as to its change of heart, compelling the conclusion that Trump’s new political appointees just didn’t like the DOJ’s prior position. It used to be extremely rare for the Justice Department to switch positions. The solicitor general, who often argues before the Supreme Court, is sometimes called the “tenth justice,” and is expected to put institutional concerns above partisan preferences. Every new solicitor general gets stuck arguing a few stances he or she doesn’t like. But they do it anyway, because the Justice Department is supposed to prize consistency and stability over fleeting political concerns. The DOJ has special duties before the court that other litigants do not. For instance, solicitors general occasionally confess error, even when that confession undermines their argument before the court. And because they represent the United States, solicitors general occupy a unique position: They must defend those federal laws passed the people’s representatives in Congress, even if they dislike them, unless they view them as completely and utterly irreconcilable with the Constitution. Trump’s political appointees have subverted these traditions at every turn, and Husted is an excellent example of their infidelity to longstanding principles. The Obama administration’s opposition to Ohio’s purges made good sense: A federal law, the NVRA, bars any state from removing a voter from the rolls “by reason of the person’s failure to vote”—yet Ohio did precisely that. By opposing Ohio’s procedure, then, the DOJ was defending the integrity of a vital federal statute. But Sessions, along with Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, reversed this position with no clear justification. Suddenly, the DOJ was encouraging the Supreme Court to let Ohio contravene the plain text of the NVRA. Why the flip-flop? It’s nearly impossible to avoid that conclusion that the DOJ simply wanted to help Republicans. Ohio’s purge procedure removed about 2 million people from the rolls between 2011 and 2016, and up to 1.2 million of those voters may have been purged for infrequent voting. Democratic-leaning neighborhoods were twice as likely to be purged as those in Republicans-leaning neighborhoods. Low-income and minority voters, key Democratic constituencies, were disproportionately targeted for removal. In total, Trump’s Justice Department has reversed its position in about a dozen cases in order to oppose immigrants’ rights, prisoners’ rights, consumer protection, and Obamacare. But its about-face in Husted may be its most flagrantly political, because its favored outcome is so obviously designed to favor the GOP. The Supreme Court’s decision on Monday will likely disenfranchise thousands of voters in Ohio—and other states down the road, as more Republicans adopt Ohio’s purge techniques with SCOTUS’ blessing. Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, and the DOJ’s political appointees have every reason to celebrate. So do supporters of Neil Gorsuch, who cast the crucial fifth vote to clinch a GOP victory. Monday was a terrible day for voting rights. But it was a fantastic day for the Republican Party and its allies on the bench.

David Murphy,"Flickr isnt going away, but a lot of your photos will be if you dont follow its new limitations : 1,000 photos, period. These photos can be any size you want, but you only get a thousand of them. The era of the free terabyte of Flickr storage is coming to an end. Ignore Flickrs new guidelines, and heres what youll face over the next few months: Starting Tuesday, January 8, free users over the 1,000-photo limit will be unable to upload new photos to Flickr. Starting Tuesday, February 5, Flickr will start deleting photos (oldest first) for free users over the 1,000-photo limit. Deletions continue until your account reaches 1,000 photos. If you dont want to pay $50 each year for Flickr Pro which frees you of these limitations and throws in other fun features like ad-free browsing, video uploads of up to 10 minute each, and a bevy of statsyoure probably going to want to prune your account manually. (That, or maybe its time to move all your photos to another service.) How to download all your photos from Flickr Previously, you had to turn to some kind of third-party tool to grab all your photos (or manually download batches of photos or individual albums directly from Flickr itself). You can still do this using any number of apps, but I recommend grabbing your photos directly from Flickrs website. Its not that hard of a process, and itll ensure that you dont miss a thing. If you dont care about keeping your photos organized into albums, you can use Flickrs Your Flickr Data section in its Settings to grab every piece of information the service stores about youincluding account preferences, profile information, and your photos and videos, Flickr notes. Simply visit your Account page, look in the bottom-right corner for the option to request your data, click the button, and wait a few hours (or many hours) for Flickr to process your request. Youll get an email when your archive is ready for downloading, and you can always check this page for the link if youre feeling impatient. If you relied on Flickrs albums to keep your many photos organized, youll find that Flickrs archive doesnt careits a dump of your photos, period. Youll have to go back and reorganize them yourself, which might be a little annoying. To get around that, you can always eschew Flickrs all-in-one tool and instead download archives of your photos via their albums. Pull up your album listing on Flickr, hover your mouse over an album, and click on the download arrow. Repeat for all of your albums to keep all of your grouped photos together. A warning, though: Any photos that are not in albums wont get saved when you use this technique. Now what? However you get your photos to your computer, youre left with a big question: What do you do with them? I wouldnt recommend keeping them on your desktop or laptop forevernot unless you have multiple backup options you use to preserve your data, as one computer catastrophe is all it would take for you to lose years worth of precious photos. While the cloud isnt perfect, since Flickrs big changes show that even popular and seemingly invulnerable sites can go awayor adjust their service offerings dramaticallyuploading your photos somewhere else is a great way to protect them from hardware failures, at the very least. The first and most obvious choice you can switch to is Google Photos. Its completely free, there arent any storage limits, and it supports shots up to 16MP in size and videos up to a 1080p resolution. That should be good enough for most people; if you need to save your original media in its highest-quality format, youll need to pay for a Google One storage plan. For $20 cheaper than the cost of an annual Flickr subscription, you can get 200GB of storage for your photosor for double the cost of Flickr, 2TB. You can also just stick with Flickr, so long as you transition to using the site as a portfolio for work you want to show off rather than a permanent storage solution. Make sure you use its Organize tool to delete that which you no longer want before Flickr makes that decision for you. 500px is another good online option, and its base plan (featuring unlimited uploads) starts at $48 annually. Thats not a huge savings compared to Flickrs Pro plan, but its a strong alternative if youre looking for something new. Dont bother trying to stick with its free account, however: Youre limited to 2,000 total pictures and a paltry seven uploads per week. If youre already paying a small annual fortune for Amazon Prime, this ones a no-brainer: Dump all your pictures over to Amazon Photos, where youll have unlimited space to store your pictures at any size or resolution. Videos, not so muchyou get 5GB to play with, which youll fill up pretty quickly. The downside? If you ever drop Amazon Prime, your unlimited storage goes away. Youll be able to download your saved photos for around three months or so, but Amazon will eventually start deleting your pictures. Finally, if youre feeling crafty, you can always roll your own photo storage setup. Should you enjoy staring danger in the face and prefer to keep your photos on your desktop, an app like Adobe Bridge CC or digiKam will help you stay organized. If you want to self-host your own galleryand have an available web server with lots of storage space to play withthen consider checking out apps like Lychee, Chevereto (which weve previously covered ), Piwigo, or any of the other options on this comprehensive list.

Issie Lapowsky,"The Trump administration's relentless efforts to crack down on undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers are well knownfrom the recent deployment of US troops to stop a ""caravan"" of migrants that hadn't yet reached the border to the president's promise to shut down the government if Congress doesn't approve funding for a border wall. But while these stories occupy the national headlines, a proposal to radically limit legal immigration is quietly barreling through the bureaucratic process of becoming law. On Monday, the public has its last chance to comment on a proposed change to the so-called ""public charge rule"" under the Immigration and Nationality Act. That rule has traditionally prevented people who depend on the government for most of their basic needsor might someday do sofrom obtaining visas and green cards. But in October, the Department of Homeland Security published a litany of possible changes to the rule that would drastically expand the definition of a public charge to include people who receive all sorts of additional government benefits, including food stamps and housing assistance. Under the new rule, DHS could also penalize applicants for having bad credit or lots of student loans. DHS says that no single factor will determine whether a person is in or out, but immigration advocates worry the rule could drastically curb legal immigration as we know it. ""You can view this as a backdoor, merit-based immigration system without Congress,"" says Doug Rand, who worked on immigration issues in the Obama White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy. He also cofounded a company called Boundless, which helps spouses of US workers apply for marriage green cards. Researchers found that more than 91 percent of people who would be affected by the rule are employed, and more than 1.4 million of them have at least some college education. When the rough contours of the Trump administration's public charge proposal first made news this summer, critics condemned the outsized impact the rule change could have on low-income immigrants. But Rand and others say the change would hit businesses, college-educated workers, and the spouses of high-skilled workers hard too. On Friday, Boundless sent a letter to DHS opposing the proposed rule. It was signed by 120 business owners, including top executives from tech outfits like General Assembly, Foursquare, TechStars, and MongoDB, among others. ""This policy would prevent countless people critical to growing American businesses from living and working here,"" the letter reads. ""As business leaders who run companies that employ thousands of workers, both American-born and Americans-in-waiting, we understand what a devastating impact this policy would have on business growth, economic vitality, and U.S. competitiveness."" Their claims are supported by a study from the Partnership for a New American Economy, a bipartisan advocacy group focused on immigration reform. Using the Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement, researchers identified individuals who might be considered ineligible under the new rule, either because they've received government benefits DHS views unfavorably or because their income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty guideline, another criteria under the proposed rule. Then they analyzed this group's education and employment data. They found that more than 91 percent of people who would be affected by the rule are employed, and more than 1.4 million of them have at least some college education. They work in nearly every sector of the economy, including the information sector, where an estimated 19,000 people could be affected, as well as professional and business services, where 515,000 workers could be affected. These findings challenged even the researchers' assumptions about who would be most vulnerable under the new rule, says Andrew Lim, director of quantitative research at New American Economy. ""We went at it from the same preconceptions other people had, that this would affect relatively poorly educated people and they'd be concentrated in manual labor industries,"" Lim says. ""Its a lot of middle-skilled people who would be caught up in this, too."" Importantly, Lim's study didn't take into account all of DHS's proposed considerations, such as whether people had debt or serious medical conditions. That means the affected population could be much larger. There are also parts of the proposed rule that are left intentionally vague and are thus hard to measure. For example, the rule says that DHS will look favorably at applicants who have ""adequate education and skills to obtain or maintain employment sufficient to avoid becoming a public charge in the US."" But it does not provide a precise definition of what constitutes an adequate education, leaving that up to interpretation. The proposal is similarly vague about the impact having a large family might have on an applicant's chances. ""This would be a catastrophe for the innovation economy if ever enacted."" Doug Rand, Boundless Rand has done some number crunching of his own. Boundless has data on 600 couples applying for green cards. Many of those couples include one spouse who's unemployed because he or she happens to be on a student or visitor visa. If the final rule imposes new household income qualifications, Rand estimates a third of married couples he works with would no longer qualify. ""We've never in our history before said that you have to already be successful and prosperous before we let you in. This is always a place where talent gets to prove itself on the merits,"" Rand says. ""This would be a catastrophe for the innovation economy if ever enacted."" The rule is not yet law, but already it seems to be having an impact. Reports have surfaced of immigrants turning down public assistance for fear of losing their shot at a green card if the proposal is enacted. As of Friday evening, the proposal received more than 150,000 public comments. Before it issues its final rule, DHS is required to digest all of those comments and at least respond to the concerns raised within them. That could take time. Even if DHS rushes through the process and the rule becomes law, Rand anticipates lots of legal suits in DHS's future. It's still unclear which of DHS's proposed criteria will make it into the final rule. In the meantime, WIRED created a checklist based on DHS's own charts, so you can see whether you'd likely pass or fail under this proposed regimeor whether, like so many other immigrants, you would be stuck in a waiting game while the government decides your fate. You may be rejected if ANY of the following are true: You're currently unemployed and can't demonstrate employment history or prospects. You're uninsured and have a serious medical condition that might interfere with work or require hospitalization. You're currently receiving public benefits including: supplemental security income (SSI), temporary assistance for needy families (TANF), food stamps (SNAP), section 8 housing or rental assistance, non-emergency Medicaid, subsidized long-term hospitalization, Medicare Part D drug subsidies, or any other federal, state, or local cash benefits. You've received any of the above benefits during any 12-month period in the past three years. These are ""heavily negative"" attributes under the proposed rule. DHS says that no single factor will determine your fate, but it does consider these factors particularly indicative that you might either be or become a public charge, and therefore would be considered inadmissible. You'd likely pass if ALL of the following are true: You're between 18 and 61 years old. You're employed and have employment history. You have no serious medical conditions or disabilities. Your household income is least 250 percent of the federal poverty guideline. (For example, if you're single, that's $30,350. If you have a family of four, that's $62,750). You haven't received public benefits in the last three years. Your US credit score is good or excellent or, if you don't have a US credit score, you have little to no debt. You have private health insurance. You have a high school diploma. You're proficient in English. These are all considered positive under the proposed rule. If these are all true, you'd likely sail through the process of getting a visa or green card application. That is, as long as youre not from one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries listed in President Trumps travel ban, which the Supreme Court upheld earlier this year. You could be left in limbo if several of the following are true: You're younger than 18 or older than 61. You have any medical condition that could interfere with work or study. Your household income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (For example, for a single person, that's $15,175. For a family of four, that's $31,375.) Your US credit score is bad or fair. You don't have private health insurance. You don't have a high school diploma. You're not proficient in English. You have debt. DHS considers several of these traits to be negative. Maybe you have bad credit and a bunch of student loans or a mortgage. These answers won't automatically disqualify you on their own, but if the negative factors outweigh the positive ones, they might. You and your employer would have to wait and see.

The Brazilian town of Brumadinho became the site of unbearable desperation and sadness Saturday as hundreds of people waited for news about their loved ones a day after a dam collapse. Rescue workers continued the Sisyphean work of digging through mud to try to find survivors after a dam collapse at a mine released a wave of red iron ore waste and caused the worst environmental catastrophe in the countrys recent history, reports the Guardian.
At least 34 people were dead as of Satruday afternoon, according to the New York Times. Although there were some signs of hope throughout the day as authorities said they had found 43 people alive, the death toll is almost certain to rise as the number of missing was almost 300. As the hours tick by, the already slim chance of finding many survivors kept on declining. Firefighters found a bus that they said was likely filled with bodies but rescue workers lacked the specialized equipment needed to bury it out from under yards of mud. Around 100 workers were having lunch in a canteen when they were engulfed by mud. Unfortunately, at this point, the chances of finding survivors are minimal. Were likely to just be recovering bodies, Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais, said.
Attention immediately turned to Vale, the mining company that operated the dam. A report in a local newspaper said that the firm had been granted an expedited license to expand in December, a move that local environmental groups say did not follow the letter of the law. This tragedy comes a few year after Vale experienced another accident with a dam that resulted in deaths. In 2015, a dam administered by Vale and Australias BHP Billiton collapsed and killed 19 people only 75 miles away from the site of the current tragedy.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Spain is wasting no time. The country plans to dramatically decarbonize its economy by 2050, and that includes banning a lot of cars, according to a draft law the Ministry for Ecological Transition published Tuesday. The Law on Climate Change and Energy Transition seeks to ban the sale of vehicles that depend on fossil fuels (including hybrids) by 2040, according to a document the ministry sent Earther. Electric cars and their charging stations will take over. Spain also plans to take its electricity production 100 percent renewable by 2050, which will further help it reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 90 percent below 1990 levels by then. Why? To meet the goals set forth by the Paris Agreement and avoid global climate catastrophe, of course. Our proposal is to reduce Spains current greenhouse gas emissions by a third in just a decade, which we consider an international milestone and a sign of our firm commitment to the fight against climate change, said Spains ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera, to Climate Home News. If this draft law goes into force, Spain will end fossil fuel subsidies and the issuing of permits for oil and gas infrastructure both on land and offshore. All existing oil and gas operations must cease by the end of 2040. In their place, Spain wants to install at least 3,000 megawatts of solar and wind energy a year over 10 years. The country also plans to conduct a study to figure out a way to sustainably and equitably wean itself off oil, gas, and coal. Spains already planning on re-training programs for workers in these sectors. But its not just about industry and cars. Spain is bringing this effort into peoples homes with plans to update its housing stock to be more energy efficient. Between 2021 and 2030, Spain plans to retrofit at least 100,000 homes a year with special attention to homes in vulnerable groups, per the text. Beginning in 2025, all new buildings must be zero energy consumption. Any building the government leases must also meet this requirement by 2025, or leases wont renew. Now, none of this is for certain. The Spanish Parliament must support the ministrys proposed law as they work to finalize the text. And the new Socialist Party that took hold with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchezs election in June, under which this effort is happening, is the minority party in parliament, so this process likely to take a while, according to El País. Plus, the Spanish government requires National Integrated Energy and Climate Plans, which will lay out the proposed energy portfolio, and a Low Emissions Strategy, which assesses the steps necessary to meet these goals, to complement this plan draft law. And some critics dont think even this plan goes far enough. Regardless, this law is a dramatic step forward in a time when the world is ramping up its oil and gas infrastructure. Maybe if Spain cuts off oil and gas, the rest of the world will fall in line.","Spain is wasting no time.

George Dvorsky,"Around 74,000 years ago, a massive caldera erupted on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a prolonged and devastating volcanic winter. Scientists have speculated that the Toba eruption pruned back human populations to a considerable degree, but new research published today suggests at least one group of humans living in southern Africa not only managed to survive the event—they actually prospered. The Toba eruption, as we’re learning, wasn’t nearly as bad for humans as we thought—and it may not have produced a volcanic winter at all. The Toba supervolcanic eruption—the most powerful eruption to happen in the past two million years—hurtled thousands upon thousands of tons of ash and other aerosols into Earth’s atmosphere. Temperatures around the Earth plummeted, unleashing what scientists have assumed was a volcanic winter that lasted somewhere between six to 10 years, and possibly inducing a cooling period that lasted nearly a thousand years. With so much debris in the atmosphere, sunlight barely touched the Earth’s surface, threatening entire species with extinction. Back in the 1990s, scientists theorized that the lingering effects of the Toba eruption created a population bottleneck, reducing the size of Homo sapiens to 10,000 individuals from an effective population of about 100,000. No doubt, the environment would have literally changed overnight for human hunter-gatherers living in Africa and Eurasia, forcing them to adapt to the changing conditions. As new research published in Nature shows, there was at least one pocket of humans living in southern Africa, some 5,600 mile (9,000 km) away from the site of the eruption, that managed to survive this calamitous period in geological history. And in fact, as the authors of the new study point out, they didn’t just survive—they thrived. It’s very possible that this particular band of humans was at the right place at the right time, allowing them to survive the ensuing volcanic winter. But other researchers say it’s yet another sign that the effects of the Toba eruption wasn’t nearly as bad as we’ve been led to believe. The so-called “Toba Catastrophe Theory,” as it’s called, may actually be a myth. What’s more, the volcanic winter may not have even happened. The lead authors of the new study, Curtis W. Marean from Arizona State University and Panagiotis Karkanas from the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece, uncovered evidence of human habitation at two excavation sites along the southern coast of South Africa: the Pinnacle Point rockshelter, where humans lived, work, ate, and slept, and the Vleesbaai dig, a former open air site where humans, possibly those from the Pinnacle Point caves just six miles (10 km) away, sat in a small circle making stone tools. Shards found at these two locations link these sites to the same point in time, as established by previous dating efforts (these caves have been studied for nearly 20 years). But Marean and Karkanas also found traces of the Toba eruption at these sites in the form of microscopic pieces of glass known as cryptotephra, which was intermixed with the rock and gas blasted out from the supervolcano. Using a new dating technique known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), in which scientists can tell the last time a grain of sand was exposed to sunlight, the researchers were able to corroborate the previously established date of the sites, and also show that humans occupied these two locations during and after the Toba eruption. By studying the archaeological items found at the sites, including stone artifacts, bones, and other cultural remains, the team was able to create a model of the site, showing continuous—and even increasing—human occupation during the time of the Toba eruption. No evidence was found to indicate that the eruption impacted their daily lives. “Many previous studies have tried to test the hypothesis that Toba devastated human populations,” said Marean in a press release. “But they have failed because they have been unable to present definitive evidence linking a human occupation to the exact moment of the event.” The area may have served as a kind of “refugia”—a place where humans sought shelter from the degraded environmental conditions. These early humans managed to survive, argue the researchers, by taking advantage of their proximity to coastal waters. The hunter-gatherers likely subsisted on sea food, which is less vulnerable to a prolonged volcanic winter than terrestrial plants and animals. It’s now the only known example of Toba-era survival in the archaeological record, so the authors of the new study are hoping that other teams will be able to uncover similar evidence of survival elsewhere in Africa, and possibly Eurasia. “I do think this is wonderful work,” Martin B. Richards, a University of Huddersfield archaeogeneticist who was not involved with the new study, told Gizmodo. “It confirms that the Toba eruption impact was worldwide and that Africa harbored refugial groups of early modern humans who survived the resulting climatic impact and went in to settle the whole world in the following millennia.” Richards points out that other humans living in Eurasia were heavily hit by the climate effects of Toba, and that some of them, like the Neanderthals, survived until modern humans arrived considerably later. In a related study published this past Friday in the Journal of Human Evolution, a team led by Chad Yost from the University of Arizona analyzed charcoal records and other evidence found at Lake Malawi in eastern Africa. Like the other researchers, they linked samples embedded with cryptotephra to the Toba eruption. But this study was more geological than archaeological, with Yost’s team concluding that the volcanic winter was not as bad as scientists have assumed. “We find no support for the Toba catastrophe hypothesis and conclude that the Toba supereruption did not produce a six-year-long volcanic winter in eastern Africa, cause a genetic bottleneck among African [anatomically modern human, i.e. Homo sapien ] populations, or bring humanity to the brink of extinction,” conclude the authors in that study. Given the similarities of the two new studies, we contacted Yost to see how this latest research relates, and how our conceptions of the Toba eruption might be changing. “The datasets from our research and the Nature paper complement one another and together indicate that the Toba supereruption had little effect on the climate of Africa and the humans who were living there,” Yost told Gizmodo. “Where the two studies diverge has to do with interpreting the magnitude of climate change from the Toba eruption.” Yost says Marean and Karkanas failed to cite the most recent Toba eruption climate model showing minimal cooling in Africa, as well as other geological studies suggesting climate models have overestimated the amount of erupted atmospheric aerosols by one to two orders of magnitude. “We conclude, based on empirical evidence, that there was no volcanic winter,” he said “In contrast, the authors of the Nature paper actually invoke a ‘decade or more of volcanic winter’ to bolster their hypothesis that South Africa was a refugia and the sole source for modern human populations after the eruption.” John Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin—Madison, agrees with Yost, saying the Toba eruption was probably a major event, and early humans probably noticed—but it did not have the catastrophic impact that some scientists believed. “The way I look at this, we have many lines of evidence about Earth’s history, including the fossil record, archaeology, ashfalls from ancient eruptions, ice and deep sea cores,” Hawks told Gizmodo. “We’ve learned more and more about the kinds of events that have happened. It’s human nature to want all of them to match up into a single series of cause and effect.” But the human past was not that simple, he says. “Some big events like Toba happen to be obvious to us in geology,” said Hawks. “But they were actually fairly small in the scheme of things. Hominin populations were resilient and able to adapt to the kind of small-scale climate changes caused by eruptions.” [ Nature ]","Around 74,000 years ago, a massive caldera erupted on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a prolonged and devastating volcanic winter.

MARGARET RENKL,"The damage is done, the song says; paradise has been razed, and theres nothing we can do about it now except to remember. But Mr. Prines true story of Paradise, Ky., also spells out just what we have to lose in this gorgeous green world, and how permanent those losses are. Today, just as in 1971, the song reminds us of what happens when a gentle existence that lies easy on the land is destroyed for the profit of developers and corporations. The difference between the way Paradise resonated with listeners in 1971 and the way we hear it now is that back then we didnt know what coal was doing to the planet itself. According to a new report from a United Nations panel of climate experts, the very industry that destroyed Paradise, Ky., is the one we must eliminate today or we will have no chance of curbing greenhouse gasses in time to prevent global catastrophe. It also happens to be the industry Donald Trump vows to bring back. We have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, he said in this years State of the Union address. Mr. Prines two-night residence at the Ryman known here in Nashville as the mother church of country music was part of his tour for the release of The Tree of Forgiveness, the first record of original music he has made in 13 years. This album, his 19th studio recording, is classic John Prine: equally sweet and irreverent, written from a worldview where the heartbreaking and the ludicrous walk hand-in-hand. No song on the new record is an overt protest song in the vein of Sam Stone or Paradise, but the albums spare production echoes the powerful simplicity of Mr. Prines first record, and the animating spirit of that early music is threaded throughout the new work, too. There are rollicking songs about knocking on a screen door in summertime or getting to heaven and smoking a cigarette thats nine miles long, yes, but the one whos knocking on the screen door is a lonely drifter, and the one whos going to heaven is a songwriter who gave up smoking when he got throat cancer. And tucked among these cheerful sad songs, too, are signs of the oracular John Prine, a prophet with his finger on the pulse of his times and his eyes turned always toward the world beyond. The Lonesome Friends of Science, for example, predicts the end of the world; Caravan of Fools links wealth with idiocy; the music video for Summers End turns a haunting but elliptical song about randomness and failed dreams into a ballad for loved ones lost to the opioid epidemic.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Its been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow. New imagery released on Monday at the American Geophysical Unions annual meeting shows the challenges of getting the light back on. The insights the researchers reveal could be used to help respond to the next disaster on the island or anywhere throughout the Caribbean. The images are what NASA calls its black marble. Its like the blue marblesatellite images of Earth in the daytimebut for nighttime viewing. To create them, NASA scientists looked at satellite images captured at night and weeded out fires, reflective surfaces like lakes that might catch the glimmer of the moon, and other natural sources of light. They took what was leftall the human sources of lightand overlaid it on a striking black map of Puerto Rico. The before-Maria image is vibrant, showing San Juan shining bright like a diamond, and the constellation of smaller cities like Ponce, Mayaguez, and Caguas lit up like Orions belt across the southern tier of the territory. But in images of Puerto Rico after Maria, which struck as a Category 5 monster in September 2017, the entire island is basically dark as only those with solar panels or generators were able to light up their houses. The lights slowly flickered back on, but NASA scientists found that, perhaps not surprisingly, rural areas struggled to power back up. More than 40 percent of long-lasting power outages occurred in rural locales despite being home to much smaller populations. By comparison, just 29 percent of the long-duration outages were in urban areas, places that are largely more wealthy. The lack of light in the countryside is what drove Puerto Rico to have the second-longest blackout ever recorded anywhere in the world. It also neatly illustrates that the poorest suffer the most from climate catastrophe and that inequality is likely to intensify as the planet warms and violent weather becomes more common. With the power out, it wasnt just a question of not being able to watch television, but a question of life and death. According to NASA, areas with prolonged power outages also lacked access to medical resources. A landmark study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government earlier this year found Hurricane Maria led to 2,975 excess deaths on the island, some of which were due to lack of medicine or care. But if the new research shows where governments and Puerto Ricos utility failed during Maria, it also points to opportunities for how to improve disaster response and preparedness for the next storm. By visualizing where the outages lasted the longest, utility crews could pre-position tools or develop plans for how to access and restore power quicker. Ditto for first responders. The maps also reveal where it may make sense to prioritize grid improvements or install community or rooftop solar and battery storage. Ultimately, it will make sense for other cities, states, and countries to take heed, given the weather weve seen over the past year.","It’s been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","If climate change has its way, the seeds the world is saving for doomsday might just be able to grow in the Arctic, according to a report released Monday by the Norwegian government.
Svalbard, the Norwegian islands that are home to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault aka the Doomsday Vault, has warmed up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1971. But according to the new report, which draws on existing studies and data as well as new targeted modeling, it could see temperatures ratchet up another 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 if carbon pollution continues unchecked. That would precipitate major changes to sea ice, permafrost, and glaciers that dominate the landscape.
The Arctic is the fastest warming location on Earth, and Svalbard has already seen dramatic changes. In addition to the spike in temperatures, the islands have seen a drop in sea ice, particularly in fjords, a 20-day shrinkage of snowfall season, and permafrost warming at rates of 0.15 degrees Celsius (0.27 degrees Fahrenheit) annually since 2009. That warming signature can be detected down to 80 meters (262 feet) below the surface. 
And if humans continue burning fossil fuels at rapid clip, the aforementioned eye-popping 10 degree Celsius (18 degree Fahrenheit) uptick in temperatures will set off a series of changes that will ripple out through the islands. Under the worst case scenario, by centurys end, glaciers will retreat into the mountains by 400 meters (1,312 feet), and permafrost will turn to mush and release carbon dioxide and methane. Those twin trends will in turn destabilize the landscape and, along with more rain and less snow cover, likely lead to more avalanches and landslides. The only silver lining is that sea levels will drop as the islands spring up in response to being relieved of the weight of glaciers. 
Under a more moderate scenario where the worlds carbon emissions decline by midcentury, Svalbard is only looking at 7 degrees Celsius (12.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming. Only 2,300 people call Svalbard home, but even so, the impacts on locals cant be ignored. The changes also mean polar bears, seals, and other animals that live on the remote outpost will also face major risks. 
And of course theres the flashiest resident of Svalbard, the Doomsday Vault. Drilled into the side of a mountain, the seed bank is managed by the Norwegian government, Crop Trust, and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center. It can hold up to 2.5 billion seeds, and the cold climate is a key component to keeping the seeds in viable condition. The permafrost acts as natural insulation and the temperature inside is kept at a brisk minus18 degrees Celsius (o degrees Fahrenheit). The whole purpose is stash away crop seeds in a safe place in case of environmental catastrophe. 
Yet climate change has already led the vaults owners to plunk millions of dollars into renovations to keep up with climate change. The vault also had a flood scare a few years ago, driven by hotter-than-normal temperatures thawing the permafrost around it.The new report shows even with all the recent upgrades, it still may not be enough to keep the seeds on ice.","If climate change has its way, the seeds the world is saving for doomsday might just be able to grow in the Arctic, according to a report released Monday by the Norwegian government.

Catie Keck,"Following an open letter from Representative Adam Schiff calling on Jeff Bezos to curb the promotion of anti-vaccination content and videos on Amazon, it appears his website has done just that.
BuzzFeed News reported Friday that Andrew Wakefields Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe is among a number of anti-vaxxer titles that no longer populate in Prime Video search results for vaccines and are not available for streaming. (You can however still purchase hard copies, and the sites Frequently bought together section still promotes related anti-vaxxer content.) BuzzFeed News noted the site may have pulled the plug on streaming anti-vaxxer videos because they violate its content policy guidelines, a question raised by Schiffs letter on Friday:
In his letter, Schiff explicitly asked Amazon: Does content which provides medically inaccurate information about vaccines violate your terms of service? According to Amazons content policy guidelines for Prime Video, it bans content that promotes, endorses, or incites the viewer to engage in dangerous or harmful acts.
Its not clear whether the content violates Amazons rules, and Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment about the change. But on YouTube, for example, videos that violate its ad policies by promoting harmful or dangerous acts do include anti-vaccination content.
That Amazon is no longer surfacing anti-vaxxer videos in its vaccine-related search results follows concerns about the sites algorithms raised by Schiffs letter. Schiff pointed to a recent CNN report that revealed searching for legitimate resources about vaccination on Amazon surfaced anti-vaxxer content as well, an issue he said could contribute to vaccine hesitancy.
If a concerned parent consistently sees information in their Amazon searches or recommendations that cast doubt on the safety or efficacy of vaccines, it could cause them to disregard the advice of their childrens physicians and public health experts and decline to follow the recommended vaccination schedule, he wrote. Repetition of information, even if false, can often be mistaken for accuracy, and exposure to anti-vaccine content via your web service may negatively shape user attitudes towards vaccination.
Schiff also specifically addressed the ongoing measles outbreak in Washington state, calling the situation a dramatic demonstration of the dangers of vaccine hesitancy and disinformation campaigns. As of Friday, Clark County Public Health reported there were 68 confirmed cases of measles in the area since the start of the year, mostly in young children. In at least 59 of those cases, the individual had not received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
There is strong evidence to suggest that at least part of the source of this trend is the degree to which medically inaccurate information about vaccines surface on the websites where many Americans get their information, among them Amazon, Schiff wrote. As the largest online marketplace in the world, Amazon is in a unique position to shape consumption.

Conrad Egusa,"The Brexit referendum in June of 2016 sent shockwaves across the world. The doomsday forecasts dominated headlines with predictions of an inevitable economic catastrophe whose onset some today are still expecting. But if many were and are worried, you may not see it from taking a walk around East London’s stunning Silicon Roundabout, the beating heart of the UK tech scene. For the Roundabout’s 50,000 digital tech employees, 30 accelerators, and over 2000 startups, it’s just business as usual these days. And the tech business in London over nearly the last decade has been very good. Several months ago I was fortunate to spend a week in London. Eager to get a sense for the state of things, I was looking for symptoms of distress. But in many ways what I found was the opposite. With at least another year of Brexit trade negotiations awaiting, the digital economy in Europe’s startup capital is moving ahead, growing twice as fast as the wider economy and boasting a yearly output of $138 billion. In 2017, venture capital investment in the UK reached an all-time high of $4.14 billion, totaling more investment for Europe’s long-time fundraising leader than that raised in Germany, Spain, France, and Ireland combined. Meanwhile, the latter half of 2017 saw Amazon and Facebook announce plans to expand operations in the UK capital. In other words, the tech scene in one of the world’s greatest cities is far from at the point of crisis. Indeed, from what I could tell, it looks to be thriving – and if some anticipated a decline, there are many today predicting the moment when London surpasses New York as the world’s second most important tech center behind Silicon Valley. Even still, the uncertainty has as of late cast a shadow over London’s incredibly promising tech ecosystem. For that there’s good reason to take a look at what is keeping so many business leaders and industry experts optimistic. And even though when it comes to London there’s always an endless number of things to mention, here are a few that will stand out to those not lucky enough to know this city firsthand. An origin story, as told to the author The reason why we’re still hearing good news from the UK’s digital industry in the wake of the Brexit vote is easier to comprehend once you understand that today’s flourishing tech scene itself took off in the midst of calamity. The economic recession of 2008-09 left London reeling. It also saw thousands of professionals from the creative industries forced to try their hand on the city’s nascent tech scene. From out of the economic tumult, a small cluster of internet startups – including Last.fm, TweetDeck, and AMEE – sprang up around East London’s Old Street Roundabout, in part due to lower recession-era rent prices in the area. By 2010, the tech industry, sparked by activity in the Old Street Roundabout, was the only UK industry not in decline, and Prime Minister David Cameron’s government stepped in to fan the flames. They introduced Exceptional Talent Visas to lure digital talent from across the world. They initiated the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), allowing businesses to write off angel investments for tax purposes and laying the foundation for an investment community that today is unrivaled in Europe. They also started the Tech City initiative, an effort to accelerate growth around the Old Street Roundabout, which would itself soon come to be called ‘East London Tech City,’ or ‘Silicon Roundabout.’ The government invested around $69 million in Tech City, hoping to attract large American companies such as Cisco, Intel, Facebook, and Google. The initiatives had great success, drawing investment from American tech giants while helping the number of startups in the area to more than double, from 85 in 2010 to 200 in 2011. Tech accelerators like startupbootcamp, led by Andy Shannon, Wayra, and Seedcamp arrived on the scene to help guide and grow the multitudes of new tech businesses. Techstars London new managing director Eamonn Carey And then Google came to town. In September of 2011, Google acquired a seven-story building in Silicon Roundabout, opening the doors to its Campus London community hub and coworking space in 2012. Hosting a range of activities, from speaker series and hackathons to training workshops and product demonstrations, Campus London had 22,000 members less than two years in – it has since helped raise millions in investment for its members, and created thousands of jobs. With Google’s arrival, London’s tech scene really took off. Soon other tech giants followed, among them Apple and Facebook. Spotify and Skype also opened London headquarters. The big tech companies helped inspire local entrepreneurs to think big, and the smaller startups reminded their industry giant neighbors how to stay nimble. And the synergy of the Tech City neighborhood, stimulated by a plethora of VC funding, tech accelerators, and government initiatives, quickly transformed London’s technology sector into an ecosystem that could truly give Silicon Valley a run for its money. From 2010 to 2015, turnover in the UK digital tech industries grew by a rate of 22 percent ; in that same period London-based technology companies raised a total of $5.2 billion in venture capital funding. A flexible, resilient ecosystem with the resources to thrive Take a walk around Old Street Roundabout today and the energy is palpable. With trendy pubs and cafes, vibrant art galleries, and jaw-dropping graffiti, it exudes style, and inspires creativity. Today, Tech City is a playground for innovators of all types, from artists to entrepreneurs. And it is home to tech giants and startups of all kinds. In the past few years this spirit of innovation has spilled over into each of London’s boroughs, with startups now active all over the city. It has been the fintech capital of the world for quite some time, but now also boasts top startups from the edtech, adtech, proptech, health tech, as well as media and entertainment industries. The city produces more unicorns than any other European city, with Shazam, Improbable, Benevolent.ai, and TransferWise currently highlighting that list. The circumstances of the 2008-09 recession in many ways produced a perfect storm for innovation. And the reason London’s ecosystem still shows so much promise is that these same forces remain strong – they helped build a flexible, resilient ecosystem that’s rich in resources and can thus thrive in the face of adversity. For one, the government continues to help tech companies, supporting them with everything from R&amp;D tax credits to visa schemes for digital innovation experts. It can cost you as little as $275 to start a business in the UK, as compared to costs exceeding $10,000 in other countries. Entrepreneurs can also count on a plethora of crowdfunding companies, global VCs, angel investors, mid-sized and large investment companies, and private investment opportunities. They’ll find accelerators like TechStars and Seedcamp – that’s raised $1 billion in follow-on funding to date – and incubators like Wayra UK – which has raised $160 million in third-party funding since 2012 – as well as spaces like TechHub, led by CEO Elizabeth Yarley and COO Andrew Tibbitts, Rainmaking Colab with its Head of Ecosystem and Marketing Triin Linamagi, Impact Hub Westminster, Forge &amp; Co, Central Working, Huckletree and Campus London. I was told that Startup Grind, led by Europe Director Marian Gazdik, is one of the city’s most popular events, as well as the conference The Europas, led by Mike Butcher. Rainmaking Colab &amp; startupbootcamp’s Triin Linamagi Beyond London, the regional tech hubs It’s not just London, however. There’s fertile ground for startup activity all over the UK. Regional tech hubs have emerged across the country, specializing in everything from cyber security to digital media – and in 2016, these regional clusters attracted more than $6.2 billion in digital tech investment. We’d be remiss not to mention a few. Start with Manchester, where a vibrant digital tech economy employs over 62,000 people, hosts a number of tech conferences, and attracted nearly $108 million in investment in 2016. To the north, Edinburgh is the UK’s second-largest financial center, a health tech hub, and home to unicorns like Skyscanner and FanDuel. Newcastle has given birth to 211 startups and some of the UK’s biggest digital tech businesses, including Sage. It’s also the location of the Ignite accelerator – the UK’s best outside of London. Gaming, virtual reality, and digital agencies are flourishing in Liverpool, while Cambridge probably boasts the country’s most mature tech ecosystem. With a world-class university producing top-tier talent, the city has produced some of the UK’s most successful companies, including chipmaker ARM. The university also has the popular Cambridge University Entrepreneurs group, which since 1999 has awarded over 600,000 Euro in prize money to more than 60 start-ups. Cambridge University Entrepreneurs 2016 CUE Winners In Leeds, a number of promising startups are emerging, including Cocoon and Ten10. Meanwhile, Brighton stands out for its digital advertising and marketing agencies, as well as design and gaming studios. Rounding out the list is AI heavyweight Glasgow. In Scotland’s largest city startups from a wide range of digital tech sectors are also supported by meet-ups like Glasgow PHP and accelerators such as RookieOven. Still Going Strong As the UK continues to renegotiate its relationship with Europe, the main anxieties have centered on how Brexit could limit access to EU talent and the possibility of investors opting to refocus on EU businesses with guaranteed access to the European market. But though Brexit will surely present its share of challenges, signs thus far indicate that fears are inflated. As we’ve scene, the London and UK digital economy has the assets to stay strong. And even to grow stronger. A recent study by Tech City showed that the majority of tech workers migrating to the UK aren’t coming from the EU, but rather from India, Australia, and the US. And if this is the main source of the UK’s imported talent, the government is aiming to keep it that way by recently boosting the number of special visas available to non-EU tech workers. Fundraising dollars, meanwhile, are no more likely to dry up than talent. After a wave of successful IPOs, Britain’s first-generation entrepreneurs are now looking to invest. This sort of recycling of capital is something that has been integral to Silicon Valley’s continued supremacy. With the end of one cycle and the beginning of another, both capital and know-how are now flowing back into the startup ecosystem, promising to keep it healthy. Gloomy forecasts, then, don’t account for the myriad strengths underlying the London and UK tech scene. Far from any doomsday scenario, the UK and its capital continue to further cement their place as world leaders in tech entrepreneurship and innovation.

Catie Keck,"As the Green New Deal pioneered by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez continues to gain momentum, the plan to wean the U.S. off of fossil fuels has now found support in more than 300 local and state government officials who called for the initiative in an open letter on Friday. The letter from environmental nonprofit Elected Officials to Protect America and signed by 311 officials from 40 states pointed to extreme weather phenomena exacerbated by climate change that are already affecting communities across the nation and costing billions to manage in their aftermathdire issues that are only going to worsen as our planet continues to warm. Our nations mightiest cities have been flooded by unprecedented superstorms including Sandy, Katrina, Harvey, and Maria. Scientists warn that the impacts will continue to worsen, the federal governments National Climate Assessment predicts economic losses will exceed the GDP of many states, and our military is responding to climate change as a key threat to national security, the letter read. Fossil fuel production and burning, the primary driver of climate change, causes serious local impacts and harm to public health from air pollution, water contamination, leaks, explosions and other dangers. Like climate change, the impacts from oil, gas, and coal disproportionately harm low-income communities and communities of color, and exacerbate social inequalities. The objectives of the Green New Deal include shifting wholly to renewable energy sources and overhauling infrastructure for sustainability with a focus on just transition for workers in fossil fuel-dependent industries and economic justice. Citing the findings outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released in October, the letter stated the pressing need for environmental reform in the next decade before we reach total climate catastrophe. As the Huffington Post noted, the hundreds of signatories include L.W. Allstadt, a trustee of Cooperstown, New York and former executive vice president at Mobil Oil, who said in a statement that climate changes existence and its potential disastrous impacts have been known for decades. Those who signed the letter join a growing chorus of government officials calling for a Green New Deal. The push for a shift away from fossil fuels flies directly in opposition to the position of President Donald Trump, who is a staunch supporter of the coal industry and who has stated that he would like to pull the U.S. from the historic Paris Agreement. But a newly-elected Congress is poised to disrupt the fossil fuel status quo with more than three dozen current or incoming House Democrats backing a Green New Deal. President Trump may not believe it, but the scientific consensus is in: climate change is real, its here, and its going to be disastrous for our communities unless we take action immediately, Representative-elect Mike Levin, a supporter of the Green New Deal, said in a statement earlier this month. The initiative has also found support from Senator Cory Booker, who tweeted Friday: We must take bold action on climate change and create a green economy that benefits all Americans.

Aileen Kwun,"Achieving a net-zero lifestyle may seem an unapproachably ambitious goal, particularly for the vast majority of us living in older homes, or renting them. But if we stand a chance against climate catastrophe, architects, engineers, and the buildings they create will necessarily play a huge part in moving the needle–and not just in shiny new buildings, but more crucially, by retrofitting existing structures as well. Energy efficiency is a key factor in reducing emissions and curbing the effects of climate change. Residential and commercial buildings alone accounted for about 39% of total energy consumption last year in the U.S., according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, and a recent report from the UN found that 65% of projected building stock expected worldwide in 2060 has already been built. Do the math and the answer is clear: We need to act to improve existing structures–and quickly. [Photo: Michael Grimm] A growing number of institutions, schools, and industry groups are hoping to spur that kind of action. The latest is Harvard University’s Center for Green Buildings and Cities (CGBC) and Graduate School of Design (GSD), which this week launched HouseZero, a new working prototype and “living laboratory” of an older structure that’s been renovated to become an ultra-efficient machine for living. It makes a necessary and approachable case for renovating existing homes into energy-positive structures–or buildings that actually produce more energy than they consume over a lifetime of use, and offset the emissions created by renovating them. Harvard’s HouseZero isn’t a cold or stark vision of survivalism, but rather a warm, wood-shingled 1940s building that’s been expertly refurbished to meet performance demands of our time. [Image: Snøhetta] Working with the Norwegian firm Snøhetta as the lead architects, and the firm Skanska Teknikk Norway as the lead energy engineers, the home produces zero carbon emissions, operates completely on natural ventilation, and uses hardly any energy for cooling, heating, or lighting. Beneath the nostalgic surface lies miles of wiring and a complex, data-driven infrastructure embedded with hundreds of sensors that will collect millions of data points to monitor and optimize its performance across energy use, wellness, and sustainability. HouseZero is a current model for a best-case, cutting-edge renovation for remediating existing structures, but it points to a goal that many have identified as a top-down defense against climate change: Focusing on existing buildings. Nonprofit organizations like Zero Energy Project offer builders and homeowners information and resources for improving energy efficiency; meanwhile, our more advanced Dutch counterparts have designed prefab kits for updating homes –even rental units–into net-zero nests. [Photo: Michael Grimm] HouseZero will be used as both an active workspace and a research tool, and the Center anticipates this sensory data collection will provide unprecedented understanding of how buildings–and in turn the behaviors of its occupants, i.e., us–truly operate, to aid in the generation of learning algorithms. Meanwhile, retrofitted features including solar photovoltaic panels, solar thermal water heating systems, and a weathervane will operate to enhance the building’s overall performance. Over time, Harvard CGBC plans to release the system’s collected data points on a public platform as a resource for others in the field. But a mix of analog, low-tech features, such as natural ventilation, also play a significant part in how the building “adjusts itself constantly, sometimes by the minute,” says Harvard CGBC. The network of sensors, for example, would work in concert with special hardware that automatically opens or closes windows as needed, though letting users open or close them the old-fashioned way, with their own hands, importantly keeps the home “firmly tethered to the human instinct.” The ultra-efficient residence of the future, HouseZero argues, isn’t all Jetsons, gadgets, and robots–it’s something that should, and will, feel very at home.","A growing number of architects and advocates are promoting an ambitious vision of energy-efficient, data-driven homes–many of which have been around for decades.

Kyle Orland,"That Steam logo is the only outward sign that this is a Steam Machine and not an Alienware Alpha. reader comments 9 Valve is no longer highlighting Steam Machine hardware through the front page of its online Steam store, seemingly putting a final nail in the coffin of Valve's partnership with third-party PC builders. While you can still access a Steam store page linking to four remaining Steam Machine partners through a direct link, Steam Machines no longer show up under the drop-down menu for ""Hardware"" on the main Steam store page. Promotional language and images for Steam Machines were also previously featured prominently on a hardware-focused landing page on the store ( archived version ), but that page now redirects to a simple search results page for the store's ""hardware"" category. The marketing change seems to have happened around March 20, according to snapshots from The Internet Archive. Fan site Linux on Gaming was among the first to note the change publicly over a week later, though, perhaps highlighting just how little interest there has been in SteamOS-based hardware of late. The ultimate fate of the Steam Machine line of gaming PCs has been clear since at least mid-2016, when Valve revealed that fewer than 500,000 Steam Machines have been sold in about seven months, barely making a dent in the wider PC gaming market. While Alienware made a renewed effort to upgrade and market its Steam Machines around that time, PC makers have shown next to no interest in launching new Steam Machines or pushing existing ones for a while now. When Valve first announced its Steam Machine partnership plans and SteamOS efforts back in 2013, Valve CEO Gabe Newell was publicly worrying about potential ""catastrophe"" of Microsoft exerting stronger control over the Windows gaming ecosystem. Years later, though, even Microsoft skeptic and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney acknowledges that ""the PC market remains free and vibrant."" The Linux-based SteamOS that formed the backbone of all Steam Machines, meanwhile, suffered from a lack of support from most major game publishers and poor technical performance compared to Windows on many games. But SteamOS, which continues to see updates, has unquestionably helped with mainstream acceptance and availability of gaming on Linux. Steam now lists over 4,400 SteamOS games for sale, a massive order-of-magnitude increase from just a few years ago. Valve's hardware efforts continue through the Steam Controller, the Steam Link in-home streaming box, and support for SteamVR-based headsets like the HTC Vive.

Beth Elderkin,"Gather around children, Ive come to tell you a tale. A story of Santa Claus, a red-nosed reindeer, a talking snowman, and an evil wizard with ice dragons and flying snakes engaged in a centuries-long war against the Northern Lights. This is Rankin/Bass Rudolph and Frostys Christmas in July, and its the holiday crossover you never knew you needed...if you even knew about it to begin with. 
Rudolph and Frostys Christmas in July is a movie I have to convince people actually exists. The culmination of 15 years and six popular holiday movies, Christmas in July is the quintessential seasonal crossoverthe Avengers of Christmas classics. It stars Rudolph (Billie Richards) and Frosty (Jackie Vernon) as best friends who join a seaside circus, with Santa Claus (Mickey Rooney) coming along for a summer vacation, only to get caught up in a wizards quest to get rid of Santa once and for all. It brought many Rankin/Bass characters together, with most of the original voice actors reprising their roles.
The special was released on ABC November 25, 1979actually, scratch that, because it technically came out several months prior. Rudolph and Frostys Christmas in July was originally supposed to be a theatrical release, following 1967's relatively successful Mad Monster Party. Boasting a nearly 100-minute runtime, it was released in theaters overseas in the summer of 1979. Unfortunately, it did so poorly that it was quickly shelved and later made its way to television.
It was not a resounding success when it opened in the summer, Arthur Rankin Jr. said, according to The Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass. I think it ran for two or three weeks, and it was not the hit we thought it would be.
Once you actually watch the movie, its easy to see why.
Remember how in Suicide Squad, we spent the beginning of the movie suffering through a plodding exposition dump, where we were introduced and re-introduced to characters we already knew...sometimes altering their origin stories to make them part of a larger mythos that in the end didnt mean a goddamn thing? Christmas in July predicted this.
Over the course of 11 insufferable minutes, were given a huge backstory explaining why Rudolphs glowing nose is currently going out. Its due to an ancient feud thats taken place over hundreds (or possibly even thousands) of years. Long ago, there was an evil wizard named Thunderbolt who ruled over the wintery lands. One day, the Aurora Borealis took a human form so she could fight back, putting Thunderbolt into a deep sleep and clearing the way for Kris Kringle to become Santa Claus. 
Hold on, it gets better.
After Thunderbolt wakes up, hes pissed that Santa is basically King in the North and devises a plan to stop him. Hell use his ice dragons fog breath to stop Santa from delivering presents. Do you see where Im going with this? Yes, a human version of the Northern Lights gave Rudolph his shiny glowing nose because he was the Chosen One who would one day help Santa defeat Thunderbolt and his ice dragons. But Rudolphs magic is running low, and if he uses his nose for evil, even once, his magic will go away forever.
I am not making any of this up.
After that epic but painful opening, Rudolph and Frosty spend most of their time trying to save a circus, which is at risk of being taken over by a mogul named Sam Spangles (hes earned the right to be that fabulous). Ethel Merman sings songs while dressed up as a cowboy shooting birds. Santa Claus and his wife get caught in a tornado and presumably die for a little while. Rudolph does glitter drugs. A band musician has an upside-down pentagram on his hat. And there are some horrible Native American stereotypes that ensure this should never be shown on television in 2018.
But how can snow people hang out at the beach in the middle of summer, you ask? Because Thunderbolt gave Frosty, his wife, and their two childrenyes, the snow fucksmagical amulets to keep them alive. But not for long. After spending most of the movie in a panic, fearing that he and his loved ones are going to die, Frosty dies. Twice.
But were here to care about literally none of that, because a) Frostys fine, and b) there is one actual saving grace in this entire motion picture that I have to share with all of you.
This is Scratcher, one of a few original characters created for Christmas in July. And for the love of Christmas, this guy needs his own Hulu series. Voiced by Alan Sues (Rowan &amp; Martins Laugh-In), Scratcher is an evil reindeer that Santa kicked out of the troop for speaking his mind...and maybe stealing some shit, its hard to tell. Hes silly, hes sarcastic, and hes such a snarky little bitch that hes basically my Patronus.
Thunderbolt finds Scratcher at this sort-of seedy hotel/maybe prison for awful Christmas characters, hiring him Boba Fett-style to infiltrate the circus and ruin Rudolphs life from the inside. Scratcher succeeds, reports back to Thunderbolt, and is never seen again. For all we know, hes still out there, hiring himself out as the perfect Christmas assassin. Kicking ass and taking holiday treats. Wheres that reboot, Netflix? Giving us thatDark Crystal prequel noise, when the story of Scratcher the Evil Reindeer is just sitting right there? I take that back, Im really excited about Age of Resistance. But still, Scratcher. Hes the man.
Im not going to tell you anything else about Rudolph and Frostys Christmas in Julynot about how Frosty and his snow family are saved from a fate worse than death, or how it involves Jack Frost arriving Captain Marvel-style, not to mention a giant whale with a clock on its ass (because it does). Instead, Im just going to encourage you to watch it for yourself. Its on Amazon Prime and its really cheap to rent. But the memories are priceless. Forget Kurt Russell smacking his Santa-clad buttocks. This year, its about Rudolph snorting a bunch of glitter to relive the good old days.
Oh, you thought I was kidding about the Rudolph thing?

Tristan Greene,"President Donald Trump reopened the US government last Friday after his 35-day-long attempt to compel members of Congress to fund a wall along the southern border ended in abject failure.
By all accounts, except perhaps the Presidents own, the longest shutdown in modern US politics was a complete catastrophe. According to experts, its lingering effects may never be fully understood. Especially when it comes to the gaps and delays caused by a lack of data the peoples data.
The most visible and immediate harm caused by the shutdown came in the form of Federal employees forced to work for more than a month without pay. Other well-known problems include the poor state of our national parks and flight delays.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown cost the nation $11 billion dollars, with $3 billion of that irrecoverable.
But these arent the only problems Trumps shutdown caused. The agriculture industry was disrupted and academics reliant on the peoples data had to put their research on hold.
Data drought
When Trump first cracked Forbes World Billionaires list in 1989, data was something stored in manilla folders and on punch-cards. If you wanted access to government data, you submitted a request and waited a few weeks.
Thirty years later, data is most often described as oil or blood by the people who rely on it to fuel their systems. Researchers, small businesses, investors, and federal agencies use government data to perform day-to-day functions and plan long-term strategies.
During a government shutdown, the people have limited access to government data. This, of course, is data that belongs solely to the people and, specifically, has been designated such by the Open Government Initiative.
A decade ago, President Barack Obama saw the need to give US citizens transparent access to government data and directed various government agencies to provide data-sets of relative information to the people, which could then be accessed via a central portal: Data.gov.
Data.gov and many other portals were either taken offline or recieved no updates during the government shutdown. The government shutdown didnt take away all the data. In fact, Data.gov, as mentioned, is just a portal theres no actual data-sets stored there.
Q: If https://t.co/N8W38QiMnJ is having an issue or does not list the data, should I assume the data does not exist?
A: No, please only be sad after a full audit.

 Rebecca Williams (@internetrebecca) January 9, 2019
But some databases, such the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA), were completely offline. Others, including the US AID Developmental Data Laboratory (used for healthcare research), remained accessible but werent updated.
Its impossible to know all the ways that limited or no access to government data-sets affected the nation. For example, its likely that thousands of students across the country werent able to complete assignments.
That might not sound like a big deal, but imagine for a moment if public libraries closed during a shutdown. For students working with datasets which, at the university level, is most of them this is is just as problematic.
Taught a 6 hour class in SQL programming today and I recommended https://t.co/QbbJXhlAcQ as a source of practice datasets. The site is closed due to the govt shutdown. Enough already! I might be inconvienced but real people are suffering. TSA, etc
 Geoffrey Root (@GeoffreyRoot) January 20, 2019
Of course, academia isnt the only entity affected by a data drought. Researchers and AI developers use government datasets to train machine learning models. These kinds of models are used to predict weather patterns, understand climate change, and to forecast trade in numerous industries.
According to Ira Cohen, co-founder and chief data scientist for Anodot, these people could be in for a double-whammy if theyre reliant on datasets that are down or not being updated.
They could be screwed twice, he told TNW, once because they might not have access to the datasets they need and again because theres also a gap in the data after the shutdown ends.
Mind the gap
Cohen explained that, depending on the particular dataset, some information could be lost forever. For example, if a machine learning model uses data from NOAAs dataset, and that data is no longer available, theres no way to make up data to fill in for it. If theres no data from December and January, for example, researchers could have to, hypothetically, skip those months.
TNW talked to several data experts and, without fail, the refrain seems to be that nobody knows what the long-term effects of the data drought will be. Cohen warned us the effects could result in datasets that will be perpetually incomplete, robbing researchers and data scientists of information that modern AI would otherwise exploit for insights.
At a minimum, the 35-day shutdown delayed countless research projects and caused any businesses working with the peoples datasets to spend man hours and/or money finding alternatives.
Unravelling the damages
Part of the problem is that you cant quantify what delays in accessing data cost research. Students and university faculty members likely just move along to another assignment or project when datasets become unavailable.
Another issue is that any company that relies on the peoples data is probably not chomping at the bit to let their customers and clients know theyre hamstrung by the White Houses lack of foresight.
Alex Howard, an open government advocate, told FedScoop:
More than 5 years after [the 2013] government shutdown showed that public access to public data would be at risk during a shutdown, its infuriating that there is still no backup plan. Shutdowns are a known risk. The federal government should ensure that 21st century civic infrastructure like websites, data archives, and digital services are resilient against political threats as well as natural disasters.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle in determining the effects of closing off access to public datasets comes in the form of uncertainty over the future. The datasets that were taken down are all slowly coming back online as Federal workers who were furloughed return and websites that werent updated become available again.
This is good news for everyone who was stuck waiting for access. But all indications point toward the increasingly likely possibility of another shutdown in a little over two weeks. 
21 days goes very quickly. Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border &amp; through dialogue. We will build the Wall!
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2019
Some experts believe were out of the woods. There are plenty of pundits arguing that the President wont risk another costly shutdown because, as GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell likes to put it: there is no education in the second kick of a mule.
Republicans and those who continue to retain faith in the Presidents border wall proposal believe the answer lies not in another shutdown, but in the White House declaring a national emergency.
But, as Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center wrote in The Atlantic, Trump has no case to declare a national security:
A president using emergency powers to thwart Congresss will, in a situation where Congress has had ample time to express it, is like a doctor relying on an advance directive to deny life-saving treatment to a patient who is conscious and clearly asking to be saved.
Her point is that theres little chance at all the President can successfully declare a national emergency to build his border wall. Its hard to imagine a Federal judge will allow the President to circumvent Congress in a situation which, by the very fact he gave the government 21 days to ruminate on his offer, is not an emergency.
None of this is any consolation to the untold number of people affected by the sudden disappearance of datasets or data portals they rely on.
With Trumps mercurial temperament and irrational negotiating tactics holding the nation hostage month-by-month, the shutdown hasnt really ended yet. At least not for citizens, universities, and businesses that rely on the peoples data.","President Donald Trump reopened the US government last Friday after his 35-day-long attempt to compel members of Congress to fund a wall along the southern border ended in abject failure.

Cale Guthrie Weissman,"Earlier this week we received the frightening news that warming temperatures might lead to a cloud-less future. And a world without clouds means only more catastrophe. While many people–namely, lawmakers–are choosing to avoid this issue of climate change, we’re already seeing it impact our everyday lives. Icecaps are melting, oceans are getting warmer, and now we’ve learned that real estate values in coastal cities are plummeting.Data from the First Street Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit that looks at the impacts of rising water levels and flooding, shows that coastal properties have already taken a huge hit in the last decade-plus. The group looked at property values along the Eastern Seaboard between 2005 and 2017, and found that most states have seen real estate values decline significantly as a result of tidal flooding.
The group uses a statistical model to analyze real estate transactions over time and try and quantify that value lost as a result of rising water levels. Florida, New York, and New Jersey have been hit the hardest, says First Street’s data. Florida, the organization writes, had the “greatest loss in relative home values at $5.4 billion, followed by New Jersey at $4.5 billion, and New York at $1.3 billion.” The cities hit the hardest are Ocean City, New Jersey, which saw an overall value loss of $530 million, Miami Beach, Florida, at $337 million, and Hollywood, Florida, at $304 million.
Below are the 20 cities hit the hardest and their relative loss in value:
Ocean City, NJ: -$530,439,399
Miami Beach, FL: -$337,167,466

Tasha Robinson,"Film is an expressive medium — at least as flexible as books are, in terms of the potential for variety and nuance. So how to explain the way cinema processes so many diverse, nuanced books into generic, nearly identical hunks of cookie-cutter product? And the problem seems particularly pronounced with books aimed at younger readers. When novels as tonally and creatively wide-ranging as Bridge to Terabithia, The Dark is Rising, the first five Spiderwick Chronicles novels, and Cirque du Freak all enter the screen-adaptation machine and come out looking and feeling nearly identical, it’s clear that the problem isn’t with the source material, it’s with filmmakers who are suffering a lack of imagination. Or maybe it’s just a lack of freedom to express that imagination. There’s a clear studio expectation that all children’s movies should be loud, garish, and impatient, with a lot of action and a few big, bold scares. And the predictability and artificiality of that model is killing the chance for children to experience more than one kind of onscreen story. The latest children’s classic to hit the cinematic meat-grinder is John Bellairs’ 1973 novel The House With a Clock in Its Walls. The book is a charmingly quaint, deeply eerie supernatural mystery about grief, necromancy, and the apocalypse. The movie version is a shrieking CGI carnival full of poop jokes and barfing pumpkins. Handled properly, the material would look more like The Haunting than like Home Alone. But the filmmaking team seems to have tried their best to iron the quirks and scares out of the book, replacing them with big comedy-horror action beats and a topiary griffin that shits mulch in all directions. That’s particularly surprising given that the director is Eli Roth, who revamped the horror genre with 2005’s Hostel, which helped usher in a wave of cheap torture-porn movies focusing closely on how slowly and excruciatingly the human body could be taken apart. It’s easy to forget that Roth made animated children’s shorts before he made horror films, but his history comes back into focus during House With a Clock in its Walls, a PG movie made for Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, and made with a high-energy, low-impact sensibility that’s more Robert Zemeckis than classic horror. Owen Vaccaro stars as Lewis Barnavelt, a 10-year old whose parents recently died in a car accident. It’s 1955, an era mostly expressed through boaty-looking cars and vintage hairstyles, and as a nerdy, weedy kid who wears steampunk goggles everywhere he does, Lewis stands out at school and on the playground even more than he would in 2018. As the film opens, he’s being shipped cross-country to live with his uncle Jonathan (Jack Black), a proud eccentric who wears embroidered kimonos, plays saxophone at 3am, and is incidentally a warlock. His house is full of Pee-wee’s Playhouse accoutrements: an animated chair that rolls around accosting people like a friendly dog, a stained-glass window that periodically moves and changes, and that unfortunate back-yard griffin, which has no upsides to offset its habit of explosively spraying people’s faces with leaf-poop every time the film needs a cheap laugh. And there are a lot of cheap laughs in this version of the story, even though the main story is about an evil dead wizard ( Twin Peaks ’ Kyle MacLachlan) who died in Jonathan’s house while performing a ghastly ritual, and somehow left behind a monstrous magical clock that’s slowly counting down to some kind of unknown catastrophe. Jonathan and his neighbor and BFF Florence Zimmerman (Cate Blanchett) are obsessed with finding and destroying the clock, but they briefly try to keep the danger from Lewis, who’s more interested in trying to make friends at his new school. Briefly, he connects with a popular, scrappy little jock named Tarby (Sunny Suljic), whose broken arm is keeping him off the sports field. But Lewis’ desperation to be liked pushes him toward a terrible decision with literally world-threatening consequences. Image: Universal Pictures This version of the story has its upsides. Cate Blanchett is appealingly brisk and no-nonsense as Mrs. Zimmerman, and her bantering, snippy, utterly platonic relationship with Jonathan Barnavelt is a rare thing in cinema, in kids’ films and adult movies alike. There’s something to be said for a world where adult men and women can be friends and even competitors without a hint of romantic tension or discomfort. Their casual name-calling and friendly disdain for each other feels a lot like a relationship between pre-adolescent kids, and it’s the most authentic thing in the movie. And the script certainly has its heart in the right place. There’s a dimly realized but still welcome message here about how people are happiest and best-suited for taking on the world when they’ve embraced their own weirdness and found their own talents, instead of trying to change themselves to emulate other people. But the execution is all yelling and chaos, with Black playing nearly every emotion with a fixed cheery grimace, and slathered-on CGI critters standing in for worldbuilding. Even when the film pulls off an authentically creepy image or potential emotional moment, Nathan Barr’s garish score shoves the audience away from it, and back into the feel of a highly caffeinated circus. The House With a Clock in Its Walls feels a great deal like the early Chris Columbus Harry Potter films, with their forced whimsy and upbeat, frantic pacing. Nothing about those early films had much sense of weight or impact — they just felt like a maniacal race to get deeper into the story. But the Harry Potter films eventually matured to take on a slower pace, a deeper interest in character, and a better realized world. Kids’ cinema in general could stand to do the same — or at least to offer some variety. Children’s literature is aimed at a wide variety of tastes and interests.

Elizabeth Segran,"According to a report from Racked, J.Crew is gearing up for a comeback. The brand sure needs it. Over the last few years, it’s gone from being one of the few successful mall brands in America to being just another retail catastrophe. Last year, we reported extensively about the brand’s declining sales, which has led to firings and shuttered stores. The brand’s longtime creative director Jenna Lyons also left. But the brand’s strategies to bring customers back into the store don’t sound very promising. For one thing, it is hoping to mimic its sister brand Madewell’s successful loyalty program. It will also relaunch its “data-driven personalization engine,” which will recommend products to customers in a more customized way. The company’s new CEO, Jim Brett (who previously ran West Elm), says that all of this will help make 2018 a “pivotal year” for the brand. Neither of these concepts is particularly innovative in the retail industry. Many e-commerce brands and retailers have sophisticated algorithms that connect consumers with products. And Kobie Marketing recently found that younger generations are far less responsive to loyalty programs than older generations. They are more more interested in how competitive prices are and whether brands offer perks like free shipping. Back in 2015, J.Crew launched a lower price line, Mercantile, into its outlets. But it is now incorporating those products into J.Crew stores. This might help, but all of these incremental changes will only take J.Crew so far. It seems like more fundamental changes are in order, such as bringing in a new creative director who can help redefine what J.Crew really stands for in a crowded marketplace. The brand could also stand to learn from startups about what retail strategies work best. In a retail landscape where generic stores are no longer exciting consumers, J.Crew could invest more in giving customers exciting in-person experiences.","The brand wants to bring customers back with a loyalty program and data-driven personalization.

Dan Maloney,"If you ever doubt the potential for catastrophe that mucking about with electric vehicles can present, check out the video below. It shows what can happen to a couple of Tesla battery modules when due regard to safety precautions isn’t paid. The video comes to us by way of [Rich], a gearhead with a thing for Teslas. He clearly knows his way around the EV world, having rebuilt a flood-soaked Tesla, and aspires to open an EV repair shop. The disaster stems from a novelty vehicle he and friend [Lee] bought as a side project. The car was apparently once a Disney prop car, used in parades with the “Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride” theme. It was powered by six 6-volt golf cart batteries, which let it maintain a stately, safe pace on a crowded parade route. [Rich] et al would have none of that, and decided to plop a pair of 444-cell Tesla modules into it. The reduced weight and increased voltage made it a real neck-snapper, but the team unwisely left any semblance of battery management out of the build. You can guess what happened next, or spin up to the 3:00 mark in the video to watch the security camera mayhem. It’s not clear what started the fire, but the modules started cooking off batteries like roman candles. Quick action got it pushed outside to await the fire department, but the car was a total loss long before they showed up. Luckily no other cars in the garage were damaged, nor were there any injuries – not that the car didn’t try to take someone out, including putting a flaming round into [Lee]’s chest and one into the firetruck’s windshield.

Read it here: Warren Buffett’s annual letter to investors In this year’s bulletin, Buffett talks about the hit Berkshire’s BRK.A, +0.87% BRK.B, +1.01% underwriting business took as a result of the three devastating hurricanes that hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico last year. Berkshire’s pretax loss is seen at $3.2 billion he said, which comes to around $2 billion after tax. Overall damages from the hurricanes are seen at around $100 billion, Buffett noted, while cautioning that such estimates are often revised substantially higher. Read: 7 highlights from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway investor letter Buffett noted the loss came after a 14-year string of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3 billion pretax. “I have regularly told you that I expect Berkshire to attain an underwriting profit in a majority of years, but also to experience losses from time to time. My warning became fact in 2017, as we lost $3.2 billion pretax from underwriting.” See: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway got a $29 billion boost in 2017 from tax plan Buffett said the $2 billion net cost from the hurricanes cut Berkshire’s net worth by less than 1%, while other companies in the reinsurance business suffered net losses of 7% to 15%.

Alexandria Sage,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - A monster wildfire in northern California burned unchecked on Saturday after it killed two firefighters, destroyed hundreds of structures and sent thousands of frantic residents racing from their homes. Some 3,400 firefighters on the ground and in helicopters and airplanes battled the 48,300-acre (19,500 hectares) Carr Fire early on Saturday as it ripped through Redding, a city of 90,000 people, in California’s scenic Shasta-Trinity area. More than 38,000 residents in Redding and elsewhere in Shasta County fled their homes as the fire began to gain speed and intensity on Thursday, destroying 500 structures and leaving Keswick, a town of 450, in smoldering ruins. The fire, which was just three percent contained after igniting six days ago, has been fed by high temperatures and low humidity, which were expected for at least the next week, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) Director Ken Pimlott. “This fire is a long way from done,” he said. A bulldozer operator and a member of the Redding Fire Department were killed in the blaze. A Redding hospital said it had treated eight people, including three firefighters. The flames erupted into a firestorm on Thursday when it jumped across the Sacramento River and swept into the western side of Redding, about 150 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, before gale-force winds during the night created a fire “tornado.” “This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity, uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways,” Pimlott said. Firefighters and police were hustling door to door to usher civilians out of harm’s way, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). California has had its worst start to the fire season in a decade, with 289,727 acres burned through Friday morning, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) data. Governor Jerry Brown requested emergency federal assistance to prevent an “imminent catastrophe” as Shasta County tried to find supplies and water for evacuated residents and care for horses and cattle rescued from ranches and farms. Wildfires have blackened an estimated 4.15 million acres (1.68 million hectares) in the United States this year. That was well above average for the same period over the past 10 years but down from 5.27 million acres (2.13 million hectares) in the first seven months of 2017, NIFC reported. Cal Fire said the Cranston Fire, about 110 miles (177 km) east of Los Angeles had blackened 12,300 acres and was 16 percent contained. The Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, which has charred 46,675 acres, was 29 percent contained.

Cory Doctorow,"This week, AV-TEST 's census of samples of circulating malware that attempt to exploit the Meltdown and Spectre bugs hit 139, up from 77 on January 17. AV-TEST CEO Andreas Marx says that the different strains of malware mostly contain recompiled versions of the same proof-of-concept code released with the initial report on the bugs. It doesn't appear that any of the exploits work yet, but it's clear that malware authors are working to actively exploit Meltdown and Spectre. Early reports suggested that mitigating Meltdown and Spectre would be easy, but in practice, attempts to mitigate the defects have been a catastrophe. Marx believes different groups are working on the PoC exploits to determine if they can be used for some purpose. “Most likely, malicious purposes at some point,” he said. The expert believes the current malware samples are still in the “research phase” and attackers are most likely looking for ways to extract information from computers, particularly from web browsers. He would not be surprised if we started seeing targeted and even widespread attacks in the future.

 (CNN)Events in Venezuela may be heading toward a catastrophic conflict. Venezuelan society is deeply divided between President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters, backed by the military, versus an opposition led by self-declared president, Juan Guaido, leader of the National Assembly.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior administration official, the US promised it would back Guaido as part of a secret plan developed over several weeks. The US, along with Canada and several Latin American governments, quickly recognized Guaido as president, while China and Russia are backing Maduro. One spark could set off a civil war. 
Neither side appears willing to go down without a fight and new elections in these circumstances would be fraught with peril. If Venezuela had a parliamentary system, new elections might produce a broad coalition among several small parties. Unfortunately, with Venezuela's presidential system, an election now, if somehow organized, would amplify both the stark polarization between Maduro and the opposition -- and the threat of civil war. 
The US' move to recognize Guaido is provocative. The problem is that the US has a track record of bullying Latin America and staging successful interventions in the region. These US interventions, both direct and indirect, have resulted in dozens of regime changes over the course of more than a century.
Even if Guaido proves successful in his bid for power, millions in Latin America and around the world will view Maduro's overthrow as the latest case of US-led regime change.
The appointment of neoconservative Elliott Abrams on Friday as President Trump's new special envoy for Venezuela just two days after Guaido declared himself the new leader will only fuel the charges. Abrams famously advocated for the armed support of Nicaraguan Contras and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress about secret efforts to arm the rebel forces -- before he received a presidential pardon. Even if Guaido proves successful in gaining power, the view that the US once again helped to orchestrate regime change will embitter Venezuela and the region for years to come.
Instead of a US-led regime change, the two sides need to share power temporarily, until new elections, perhaps in 2021. It seems inconceivable, yet history shows this can be done. Poland's successful transition to democracy in 1989 provides a pertinent example. In early 1989, Poland was on the brink of catastrophe, with martial law, a hugely unpopular Communist government, a collapsed economy and an incipient hyperinflation. 
In Poland's case, the rapid transformation started with Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, or restructuring and openness. The Communist regime and the Solidarity opposition brokered a Round Table Agreement in 1989, which led to a partially free election for the Polish parliament later that year, which set the country on a path of deep economic reform. 
While Solidarity won a significant victory with a majority in the upper chamber of parliament, the communists retained control of the lower chamber. The Solidarity movement brilliantly found a way to peacefully break the deadlock and proposed the solution known as ""Your President, Our Prime Minister."" The Communists would retain the presidency and the ""power ministries"" of interior and defense, while one of the Solidarity leaders became prime minister with the power to appoint his cabinet. 
This compromise was put into practice and it held fast under the guidance and support of Gorbachev, the US, Europe and Pope John Paul II. The Communists did not meddle in economic management. Indeed, the new Polish government launched the most ambitious reform in modern history, designed to return Poland to the mainstream of the European economy. The reforms worked. Poland's economic collapse was reversed and economic growth resumed, setting it on course for European Union membership. 
Violence was completely avoided. In 1990, Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last Communist leader of Poland, stepped down and Poland elected Lech Walesa as president. Of course by then, the international scene had changed dramatically, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. 
There is of course no precise analogue between Poland in 1989 and Venezuela today, but the comparison is apt. Venezuela, like Poland, needs a compromise that avoids a violent confrontation between the government and the opposition, a military coup, a civil war or, even more disastrously, a proxy war pitting US-backed contingents against Russian-backed contingents. Such a grim scenario might seem fanciful, yet Syria has been blown apart by such a proxy war during the past eight years. 
And like Poland, Venezuela has suffered an economic collapse. This is the sad, predictable result of Venezuela's failed policies under Maduro, also stoked by US economic sanctions that have further squeezed Venezuela's oil production and helped to push the country into vertiginous collapse.
Maduro won re-election in 2018 with most of the opposition boycotting the election. Hyperinflation has now reached a rate of 1 million percent per year, with signs of acceleration. Venezuela has defaulted on its external obligations, including enormous sums owed to China and Russia, which will no doubt try to protect their claims. 
In short, all sides have an urgent reason for compromise. The Venezuelan military aims to protect its privileged standing within the Chavez-Maduro system, yet it would like to end the economic catastrophe and avoid mass bloodshed. Maduro aims to hold power, yet is clearly incapable of solving Venezuela's economic crisis. He has lost the confidence of the overwhelming majority of the population. Yet for now he holds the backing of the military. 
The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is also very serious, with hunger, dire shortages of medicines, and massive refugee movements out of the country. These grim realities could propel a Polish-style compromise solution. Such a compromise would have Maduro remain as president, the military in effect hold the Ministries of Defense and Interior, and the opposition forces take over the civilian ministries and the Central Bank of Venezuela. Guaido, or some other leader in the opposition camp, would serve in effect as a prime minister, leading the civilian cabinet, and guiding Venezuela's economic policies. Elections would be agreed upon for 2021 or 2022, perhaps under a semi-parliamentary system by that time. 
The major outside powers, notably the US, China and Russia, and the neighboring countries, would agree to and oversee the end of economic sanctions and the regularization of economic relations with the international institutions and the formulation of an emergency stabilization program. All creditor nations would be ready to take urgent steps, such as debt restructuring, needed to end the catastrophic hyperinflation. The UN Security Council would support these measures. 
We are not currently on this path. The US instead appears to be aiming for regime change and tightening sanctions to bring Maduro to his knees. Such an outcome is perhaps feasible, though it would leave a very bitter legacy. More likely, though, it would occasion further violence and an escalation of the economic crisis, possibly leading to war. 
This is the urgent time for compromise, not for a winner-take-all showdown.","Events in Venezuela may be heading toward a catastrophic conflict.
