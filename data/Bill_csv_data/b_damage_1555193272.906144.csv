Jon Evans,"The ICO regulators are here, and they’re carrying big sticks. (PDF) “Coins or other digital assets issued on a blockchain may be securities under the federal securities laws… tokens were securities as defined by Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act because they were investment contracts … An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” What does this mean, exactly? I’ll let people who have actually passed the bar decode it for you. Here’s a thread from Marco Santori, fintech team leader of Cooley Law: 1/ OK HERE WE GO. Today, the SEC today confirmed some of our suspicions about utility tokens. I’ll summarize here in this thread. https://t.co/MI66jV4g27 — Marco Santori (@msantoriESQ) December 11, 2017 And, as you might expect, many of the serious thinkers in the blockchain space (yes, they exist) have greeted this governmental intrusion with … actually … cautious relief. OK, you might not have expected that, but it’s true. Everybody saw it coming, so it’s a relief to finally get it over with; and the ICO space has become such a get-rich-quick shitshow, so full of empty promises, that precipitating what John Biggs calls “the coming avalanche of ICO failures,” while achieving some legal clarity, seems like a good-case scenario. This is reportedly even more true in China, which has banned ICOs ouright — and according to Emily Parker, “everyone I spoke to in China’s cryptocurrency community supported, or was at least sympathetic to, the ICO ban. I repeatedly heard that 90 percent of Chinese ICOs were scams. The whole model, in which you buy tokens to use on a platform that does not yet exist, might never exist, or could be a total flop, can be a magnet for fraudsters.” That is no less true outside of China. But pointing accusatory fingers at risible ICOs is almost too obvious, and too easy, and there are too many to choose from. Let’s not dwell on stupid greed or greedy stupidity or valuations. The blockchain revolution was not supposed to be about getting rich. Stop laughing. I’m not kidding. And neither is wunderkind Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, reflecting on what he has wrought (click through to read the whole thread): So total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we *earned* it? — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 13, 2017 or Brave engineer Yan Zhu: most of these people are too technologically myopic to imagine something better than both BTC &amp; traditional currency. people used to care about cryptocurrency because they wanted to solve problems that couldn't be solved by existing systems, now they just want to make money. https://t.co/znp8ufM93R — yan (@bcrypt) December 9, 2017 Wasn’t the idea to decentralize the power of networked technology, and programmable money, from banks and governments to the ignored masses — rather than adding maybe a few thousand people to the world’s Very Rich List? If your ICO is going to make a handful of people rich, then it’s not actually very decentralized, is it? That’s not part of any kind of brave new world. That’s actually incredibly boring. This is all a moot point for today, though. The real reason that the SEC is right to regulate ICOs as securities is that, with very few exceptions, today’s ICO tokens are almost definitionally speculative … because public decentralized blockchain technology is not yet ready for prime time for anything other than low-volume transfers of value, with some programmatic control. It’s technically and socially and economically utterly fascinating, don’t get me wrong, and it has a very bright future ; and, sure, cryptocurrencies are having a surreal / spectacular run as a store of imputed value, i.e. the thing blockchains are currently good at. But we aren’t going to see any big-money fat-protocol applications, or any decentralized people’s revolution either, until and unless the technology gets much easier and cheaper to use — for both end users and developers like me. It is pretty remarkable that people have imputed tens of billions of dollars of value to a technical ecosystem so immature that it can't handle functions which return arrays of structs. https://t.co/Xt5y1WNRzf — Jon Evans (@rezendi) December 15, 2017 That will happen. But not right away. And in the interim, people are making huge bets on entire classes of technology that carry a real risk of being obsoleted before they’re so much as alpha launched, if they ever alpha launch, much less before ordinary users ever even try them in real numbers. Everyone loves comparing blockchain protocols to the early days of computing and the Internet, so here’s another analogy: today’s ICO investors are bidding billions to own pieces of gopher, FTP, and X.400. Which is fine — even admirable, in a way — as long as the craze to get rich now doesn’t get in the way of cooler heads inventing/upgrading to HTTP and SMTP over the next few years. Here’s hoping.","The ICO regulators are here, and they’re carrying big sticks.

Lily Hay Newman,"On Monday evening, the White House released an order instructing the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to declassify excerpts from an array of documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference. He has every legal right to do so. But national security analysts and former intelligence officials say that such a demand isn't just largely unprecedented; it's potentially dangerous. The Trump Administration said Monday that the disclosure was ""for reasons of transparency"" and was ""at the request of a number of committees of Congress."" The affected documents include certain pages of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application related to former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page, and a number of FBI interview reports related to the Page FISA application and larger Russia investigation. President Trump has been fixated for more than a year on proving that a wiretap of Page—after he left the Trump campaign—was part of a partisan effort to undermine his candidacy. ""The damage that is done is something that’s going to continue for several years."" Jeffrey Ringel, The Soufan Group Additionally, Monday's White House order includes the public, unredacted release of a trove of text messages ""relating to the Russia investigation"" sent from and between former FBI director James Comey, former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, former FBI agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and current Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. A more recent fixation of President Trump's, Ohr's wife has worked as a Russia analyst and contractor for the same intelligence firm that commissioned the infamous Steele dossier. Though the White House has demanded specific pages from the Page FISA application, its other requests potentially cast a wide enough net to potentially expose law enforcement and intelligence methods and sources. ""I do not recall anything like this happening in the past,"" says Jeffrey Ringel, director at the intelligence consultancy The Soufan Group, who spent 21 years as a national security specialist at the FBI. ""Emails and text messages of investigators have been pulled into court previously by defense attorneys, but this would be much more broad and public. If law enforcement guaranteed that my identity would be kept secret as part of a deal, and then that bond is broken, it makes people lose faith in the system. The damage that would be done is something that’s going to continue for several years."" Monday's White House order came in the form of a press release rather than a formal directive, potentially leaving the DoJ and ODNI room to interpret it as a discretionary request for review, rather than a nonnegotiable command. That could help limit the fallout, if so. ""When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America's national security interests,"" a Department of Justice spokesperson said in a statement. ""The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President's order."" Taken at face value, though, the request concerns former intelligence operatives. ""It really depends on how this is executed,"" says David Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec and founder of the threat tracking firm Binary Defense, who formerly worked at the NSA and with the Marine Corps' signal intelligence unit. ""If there is the ability to blow intelligence sources, show inner workings of how information is collected, or anything that could damage the intelligence community, then this is really bad. What worries me is FISA docs are usually top secret, and methods of collection and evidence are in there. But if this is purely communications that don't reveal too much, then it might not be too damaging."" But while personal communications could potentially be revealed without a major impact on national security, so much haphazard declassification could still have collateral impacts on individual privacy. Complicating the interpretation of the White House order is the question of whether the Trump Administration only requested specific pages from the FISA application to protect law enforcement sources and methods on other pages, or whether it's selectively excluding information that validates the FBI's Carter Page wiretap. Given how Trump associate Devon Nunes has misled the public about key aspects of the FISA application, hopes aren't high. ""There are obvious privacy and investigative reasons that you might legitimately not want to publish certain pages,"" says Julian Sanchez, a national security-focused research fellow at the Cato Institute. ""But the problem with the incomplete way information has been dribbling out is that it might also be that that stuff confirms the utility of the surveillance. It's an issue of selective disclosure and the potential to support a narrative through omission."" Which is a shame, because there's an argument to be made that the FISA process really is too secretive. Selectively declassifying self-serving information, though, doesn't achieve that end. ""On the one hand I would love to see the FISA process generally be more transparent,"" Sanchez says. ""But it's clearly a terrible precedent for the White House to be picking and choosing specific investigations that personally affect the president. There are reasons that the White House is not in a position to weigh the equities impartially or expertly."" ""It's clearly a terrible precedent for the White House to be picking and choosing specific investigations that personally affect the president."" Julian Sanchez, Cato Institute Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he has already seen a more complete version of the Page FISA application, and that he also worries about selective disclosure and the larger, long-term ramifications of this White House move. ""I worry not just in terms of precedents it sets for this investigation, but I also worry about the men and women of our intelligence community whether they think some future president at the drop of a hat may decide to disclose contacts, information,"" Warner said. It also, in turn, could make allies less willing to work with the US, if they thought their own classified efforts could be exposed on a whim. The full scope of the situation won't be clear until ODNI and the DoJ determine what to actually disclose based on the White House demand. But the request alone sets a precedent to at least attempt the same tactic in the future, and perhaps double down on it if the results aren't to their liking. ""The President of the United States should not be involved at this level in an ongoing investigation,"" the Soufan Group's Ringel says. ""This may be good for President Trump this week, but in the long term it’s going to have detrimental effects, because faith in the system has been weakened.""

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","You’re not just getting old. Today’s toys are too damn loud. This isn’t simply an annoyance that drives many parents to either break out the hammer, or drink—prolonged exposure to high decibel levels can be dangerous for kids, and may even cause long-term hearing loss. All toys are required to meet the American Society of Testing and Materials’ “acoustic standard,” which states that the sound-pressure level of a toy must not exceed 85 decibels at a distance of 50 centimeters. Go above 85 decibels and you’re entering a danger zone. ( A vacuum is about 80 decibels.) The thing is, kids get much closer than 50 centimeters to their toys. Arm’s length is about 25 centimeters (or 10 inches), and any parent who’s watched their kid fall in love with a plastic Spider-Man knows they will often cuddle it, sleep with it, and maybe even lick the thing once in a while. The Sight &amp; Hearing Association has been making this point for years and puts out an annual Noisy Toy List, which I appreciate a lot. It includes toys that are louder than 85 decibels at testing distances that make more real-world sense—zero inches and 10 inches. Browsing through the latest list from 2017, I noticed several popular toys that my kid oooohs at every time she sees them on store shelves. You may have seen them, too. Here are the top 10 offenders: 0 inches: 96.7 dB 10 inches: 89.4 dB 0 inches: 96.3 dB 10 inches: 85.6 dB 0 inches: 93.9 dB 10 inches: 88.3 dB 0 inches:93.8 dB 10 inches: 79.2 dB 0 inches: 93.8 dB 10 inches: 88.1 dB 0 inches: 92.4 dB 10 inches: 88.3 dB 0 inches: 91.2 dB 10 inches: 79.6 dB 0 inches: 91.0 dB 10 inches: 79.6 dB 0 inches: 90.8 dB 10 inches: 83.1 dB 0 inches: 90.6 dB 10 inches: 87.3 dB See the full list here. Hearing loss develops over time, so don’t panic if your kid has played with one of these toys before. But do know how important it is to protect young ears. If you think a toy is too loud, you can test it with a sound level meter app like Sound Meter or, as the Sight &amp; Hearing Association points out, you can just trust your own ears. If it’s too loud for you, it’s too loud for your kid. Get rid of the toy, or if you really don’t want to part with it, muffle the sound by putting water-proof tape or super glue over the speaker. Or, you know, just take the batteries out.","You’re not just getting old. Today’s toys are too damn loud.

Vijith Assar,"When the blockbuster twin security exploits known as Meltdown and Spectre appeared in early 2018, Mozilla was among the first to respond, retroactively changing several behaviors of Firefox to help prevent them. Both attacks rely on using high-speed timing measurements to detect sensitive information, so somewhat counterintuitively, the patches had to decrease the speed of seemingly mundane computations. The first change was to slow down the performance API for web browsers, which had previously been able to analyze the behavior of a page at speeds fast enough to be used in an attack; the second change removed SharedArrayBuffer, a new kind of data structure atop which similar timers could be trivially rebuilt. Similar changes were also soon also implemented by Microsoft for Internet Explorer and Edge browsers and also by WebKit, a tool for viewing the web that is used to build Safari, Mobile Safari, Android Browser, and the dedicated browsers embedded on many other devices. As of this writing, SharedArrayBuffer is now disabled in all major browsers. The speed and power of our computers until now has always been a lie, built atop a foundation that must now be undone. Backpedaling on established features of the internet was necessary, but also strange and unexpected. The web is, among other things, a decentralized specification: It is an agreement about how to build things, and then also how to run the things that have been built. In order for a new feature to meaningfully exist on the web, developers and browsers and standards bodies must all first come to an understanding about how it will work. Once you add something to that agreement, you can't remove it, because you have no idea what problems might arise, or even in which far-flung corners they may appear. In contrast, technology systems and programming languages that operate in narrower contexts—on a specific server, for example, or inside a specific app—can successfully withstand more dramatic changes to their behaviors. Any upgrade-related malfunctions are localized, and accordingly easy to fix. There are no such promises with a distributed web, though, so its technologies have always evolved in ways that maintain backwards compatibility. This is why old web pages pretty much always to work in newer browsers. Spectre forced browsers to finally break the compatibility covenant of the web. It's entirely likely that no meaningful projects relying on those features even exist, and even if they do, there may still be simple, safer workarounds. Nonetheless, such a prominent episode in which the internet broke its own code retroactively comes with a cost, at least ideologically. The web can't quite be trusted as an infallible platform to the extent it had been. Breaking Changes There's a common practice in software engineering called semantic versioning, whereby the officially published new releases of software tools and packages are given slightly complex version numbers—think the more nuanced ""version 2.4.1"" instead of moving straight to ""version 3""—so that shifts to the largest numbers can indicate to both users and automated systems that something important has changed. The system might no longer work the same as it did previously. These are referred to as ""breaking changes,"" and they serve as safety checks, or at least warning flags. We don't know how widespread the impacts were, but the patches made to web browsers to help protect against Meltdown and Spectre do meet the technical definition of breaking changes for the entire web. Of course, by now the web is far too old and chaotic to be subject to any versioning or planning whatsoever. That's precisely why, until now, it had always opted to safely preserve backwards compatibility. Both Meltdown and Spectre are caused by the widespread use of a technique called ""speculative execution"" in which processors eagerly and proactively execute instructions even before they are actually needed by the program. The speculatively computed material is then faster, but the primary discovery of Meltdown and Spectre was that it is insufficiently secured, and thus provides a way to leak sensitive information. Meltdown most notably affects Intel hardware in which the speculative execution was previously assumed to be safe, and attempts to disable it at the software level can have a marked performance cost. This is not just about sluggish laptops— many cloud service providers charge clients varying rates that reflect the computational burden of the contract, so Meltdown and Spectre may show up as an increase in technical budgets, paid out as a literal dollar amount to services that now have to run more slowly as a result of the patch. The only real fix for Meltdown is to eventually physically replace all the chips, a change which will take at least a full hardware generation to propagate. Spectre is more sophisticated, and may have no real fix at all. We might not have realized it until recently, but the speed and power of our computers until now has always been a lie, built atop a foundation that must now be undone if we also want to remain safe. Beyond Bits Responding to Meltdown and Spectre required immediately decreasing the speeds of both processors and online timing measurements, thereby reversing advances we thought we'd made both in hardware and with the general sophistication of the web as a platform. Disruptive ideas can likewise attain a pace that manifests outside the silicon: In New York, Uber's reach and market dominance emerged fast enough to capitalize on the ongoing financial struggles of the subway system, and Airbnb's alongside the rising barriers to home ownership for the modern middle class. We had quite literally been racing toward something terrible. Even if Intel wouldn't quite agree that Moore's law is over, its real-world performance benefits may be substantially erased after Meltdown and Spectre are tamed. The long-standing computing trope that should be even more concerning in this context, however, is ""it's all just ones and zeroes."" We're not just talking about bits once those bits drive our robots, drones, 3-D printers, and soon our autonomous vehicles. New technologies now often manifest in the real world, since for now that is still where most of the money is, but even Bitcoin melts the polar icecaps. On the mind-boggling cosmic scale, these exploits will affect our ability to create and edit organisms, but on a more tangible level, they also decreased the operational speeds of both processors and online timing measurements, thereby reversing advances we thought we'd made both in hardware and with the general sophistication of the web as a platform. In both fields, we had quite literally been racing toward something terrible. We’ve built technology too quickly for our own good, quantifiable now in dollars and microseconds, using a wide range of tools and metrics even though of SharedArrayBuffer is no longer around to take the meassurements. Anything that seeks to reshape the infrastructure built by our past selves should deserve our most aggressive scrutiny, regulation, and suspicion. If backtracking overeager technology is already proving so catastrophic for the cheap chips in our laptops and phones, then we certainly have no hope of reversing its changes to our homes, cities, and oceans. Some things can't be patched or safely versioned. We just have to get it right the first time. More Meltdown",Spectre fixes forced browsers to break the compatibility covenant of the web.

David Nield,"Accessing the internet isn't normally a problem when you're inside the confines of your own home—it's secure, it's easy to connect to, and it's relatively uncongested—unless the whole family is streaming Netflix on five separate devices. When you venture out though, it's a different story. You can access Wi-Fi in more places than ever, enabling you to keep in touch or catch up with work from wherever you happen to be, but getting online isn't quite as simple, or as safe, as it is with your home network. A public Wi-Fi network is inherently less secure than your personal, private one, because you don't know who set it up, or who else is connecting to it. Ideally, you wouldn't ever have to use it; better to use your smartphone as a hotspot instead. But for the times that's not practical or even possible, you can still limit the potential damage from public Wi-Fi with a few simple steps. Know Who To Trust This relates to the previous point, but wherever possible stick to well-known networks, like Starbucks. These Wi-Fi networks are likely less suspect because the people and companies operating them are already getting money out of you. No public Wi-Fi network is absolutely secure—that depends as much on who's on it with you as who provides it—but in terms of relative safety, known quantities generally beat out that random public Wi-Fi network that pops up on your phone in a shopping mall, or a network operated by a third party that you've never heard of. These may well be legit, but if any passerby can hook up for free, what's the benefit for the people running the network? How are they making money? There's no hard or fast rule to apply, but using a bit of common sense doesn't hurt. If you can, stick to as few public Wi-Fi networks as possible. In a new city, connect to Wi-Fi in a store or coffee shop you've used before, for example. The more networks you sign up to, the more likely the chances that you'll stumble across one that isn't treating your data and browsing as carefully as it should be. Stick With HTTPS As of a couple of weeks ago, Google Chrome lets you know when the site you're visiting uses an unencrypted HTTP connection rather than an encrypted HTTPS encryption by labeling the former ""Not Secure."" Heed that warning, especially on public Wi-Fi. When you browse over HTTPS, people on the same Wi-Fi network as you can't snoop on the data that travels between you and the server of the website you're connecting to. Over HTTP? It's relatively easy for them to watch what you're doing. Don't Give Away Too Much Info Be very wary of signing up for public Wi-Fi access if you're getting asked for a bunch of personal details, like your email address or your phone number. If you absolutely have to connect to networks like this, stick to places you trust (see above) and consider using an alternative email address that isn't your primary one. Stores and restaurants that do this want to be able to recognize you across multiple Wi-Fi hotspots and tailor their marketing accordingly, so it's up to you to decide whether the trade-off is worth it for some free internet access. Again, sign up for as few different public Wi-Fi platforms as you can. Does your phone or cable carrier offer free Wi-Fi hotspots in your current location, for example? If you can get connected through a service that you're already registered for, then that's usually preferable to giving up your details to yet another group of companies. Limit AirDrop and File Sharing When you're on a public network around strangers, you'll want to cut off the features that enable frictionless file sharing on your devices. On a PC, that means going to Network and Sharing Center, then Change advanced sharing settings, then Turn off file and printer sharing. For Macs, go to System Preferences, then Sharing, and unselect everything. Then head to Finder, click on AirDrop, and select Allow me to be discovered by: No One. For iOS, just find AirDrop in the Control Center and turn it off. And voila!. No one nearby can grab your files, or send you one you don't want. Check What You're Signing Up For We know we're probably saying this in vain, but read up on the attached terms and conditions before you connect yourself to a public Wi-Fi connection. You might not always understand every word, but you should be able to spot any major red flags, particularly around what kind of data they're collecting from your session, and what they're doing with it. If you find the associated policies really impenetrable, a quick web search should bring up any known issues or problems that other users have been having. Of course there's nothing inherently evil about terms and conditions—they help protect the Wi-Fi provider too—but don't just blindly click through on whatever pop-up screens you're presented with. And if they ask you to install any extra software or browser extensions, back away quickly. Use a VPN By far the most effective trick for staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to install a VPN or Virtual Private Network client on your devices. It encrypts data traveling to and from your laptop or phone, and hooks you up to a secure server—essentially making it harder for other people on the network, or whoever is operating the network, to see what you're doing or grab your details. We've written here about some of the ways to choose a good VPN, as not all VPNs are created equal, and some are downright dodgy. It's definitely worth paying for a service, as free solutions are more likely to be financed by some suspect marketing or data collection practices that it's best to steer clear of. Independent review sites like The Wirecutter and That One Privacy Site can help here. Actually connecting to a VPN is usually straightforward, and once you've downloaded the client for your provider of choice, it will take you step-by-step through the process, whether you're on mobile or the desktop. If you move around a lot, and connect to a lot of different networks, a good VPN is well worth investing in. Bonus Tips In the next few years, as the next-generation WPA3 Wi-Fi security protocol comes online, public Wi-Fi will have more built-in protections. Until then, many security exploits rely on old, outdated software, so make sure you're running all the latest patches and software updates on your laptop or phone before venturing out. Also, don't download or install anything new over public Wi-Fi unless you absolutely have to. And again, best way to avoid running into security problems due to public Wi-Fi is not to use it at all—think about downloading videos and music for offline access before you leave home, for instance, or using your smartphone's hotspot function instead. If you are going to get connected though, the steps mentioned above should maximize your chances of staying out of trouble.

Adam Clark Estes,"Steve Jobs was a notorious case-hater. He once looked at Wired ’s Steven Levy with disgust when the journalist pulled out an iPod with a case on it. “I think stainless steel looks beautiful when it wears,” Jobs said. For my own reasons, I’ve never used a case on my iPhone. The glass on my $1,200 iPhone X, however, does not look beautiful when it wears. And let me tell you, it wears way too easily. My iPhone X is almost perfect after two months of daily use without a case. Almost is too strong a word, actually. The back of the phone: beautiful. That stainless steel rim: flawless. The dual-lens camera: perfect. That gorgeous, enormous, bezel-free OLED screen: scratched beyond comprehension. Apple says that the iPhone X features “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone, front and back.” So did I get a different kind of glass by mistake? Did Apple sacrifice some quality control as it was rushing out the first iPhone X orders? Is it just my fault? Sure, I could’ve avoided some of this grief by using a case. But I’ve never used a case, and I’ve never had a screen develop scratches so quickly or so comprehensively an a decade of using iPhones and Android phones. The first scratch appeared on my iPhone X screen just a few days after I bought it. It was small, shallow, but clearly visible in the center of the screen. In the weeks that followed, more and more micro-abrasions appeared as if through sorcery. Then came a fan of deep scratches on the bottom left on the screen, deep enough that I could feel them with my finger and see them when the display was on. The latest scratch is even deeper and mars that cute little slice of screen next to the notch. It’s not like the phone is hard to use or anything. I just feel annoyed and confused that the thing is so fragile. I’m not the only one. There are countless threads on Reddit and other forums featuring disgruntled iPhone X owners who are similarly perplexed about how easily their screens scratch. One person claims that their iPhone X was covered in hairline scratches when it came out of the box. Another says that a cluster of scratches appeared “ after four days of literally babying it.” Some people even say that scratches are showing up on phones that have always been kept in a case. The list of complaints goes on and on. In my case, it feels precious to let myself get worked up over what amount to cosmetic flaws on my very expensive new phone. Everyone I talk to about the screen scratches asks, “Why didn’t you put a case on it?!” Because I didn’t want to. The iPhone X design feels perfect without a case, and my experience with past iPhones had suggested that the glass would hold up to everyday use pretty well. My iPhone 7 didn’t have any significant scratches when I swapped it for an iPhone X after a year-and-a-half of use. Even still, I’m not frustrated that the iPhone X screen can be scratched. I’m frustrated that it can be scratched so easily. At this rate, I won’t even be able to see past the scratches in a year’s time. But maybe it really is just me. Maybe the screen gets scratched going into my pocket because I wear extra coarse jeans. (I don’t.) Maybe I put the phone on the table face down sometimes. (I always put it face up.) Or maybe I’m not as careful as I think I am. (None of us are.) Figuring out what’s causing the scratches won’t undo the scratches that are already there, though. I’ve reached out to Apple to find out if the company is aware of the iPhone X screen scratch issue. It does seem like a trend, though I’m clearly biased in judging its severity. I have not yet gone to the Genius Bar to see what Apple says in the store. Again, it feels like a cosmetic issue for now, one that doesn’t really affect my using the phone. Yet for the price I paid and the marketing I bought into, the iPhone X should be more flawless. It should be better than this. 1 / 7","Steve Jobs was a notorious case-hater.

Sam Rutherford,"While it produces fantastic audio, Apple’s new HomePod smart speaker has also annoyed early users with obtuse software limitations, a lack of real Bluetooth connectivity, and missing multi-room playback support that won’t come until later this year. And now there’s one more irritation to add to that list, as it seems the HomePod can damage your wood furniture. Multiple reports on Twitter and from outlets, including Wirecutter and Pocket-Lint, claim that when left on a wooden object, a HomePod can leave behind potentially permanent white rings. Wirecutter reports that Apple has confirmed the problem. It’s apparently caused by an interaction between the HomePod’s silicone base and certain oils used to finish wood furniture. The severity of the marks seems to vary, judging from a tweet by MacStories’ Federico Viticci. For those affected, Apple says “the marks can improve over several days after the speaker is removed from the wood surface.” However, if the rings don’t go away, Wirecutter says Apple suggests that you can either go refinish the furniture or “try cleaning the surface with the manufacturer’s suggested oiling method.” This is not a good look for Apple. For the people who just brought home a fancy new smart speaker, the last thing they’ll probably want to do is be forced to re-sand their furniture on a regular basis. We have reached out to Apple for comment on the news, but have yet to hear back.

Devin Coldewey,"CRISPR-Cas9, the gene editing tool that is currently the darling of biotech and many other fields, may not be quite as miraculous as early tests suggested. A new study finds that what scientists thought of as a scalpel may be more like a felling axe, causing damage hundreds of times what was previously observed. Before anyone panics and checks out the window for mutated monstrosities, it should be said right away that this isn’t a nightmare scenario by any means: the tool can still be used in many ways safely, and the clinical repercussions of the damage are unexplored. But this unexpected limitation of a tool so widely applied will almost certainly but a chill on its use. CRISPR, as a quick reminder, is basically a molecule that cleanly and reliably snips bases out of DNA strands paired with a molecule that hunts out a single sequence of bases. Together, they act like a pair of laser-guided scissors. The idea is that by cutting out a handful of bases in a sequence that produces, for instance, sickle cell anemia, you can disable that gene altogether. This has been shown in numerous studies and although unexpected insertions and deletions (abbreviated “indels”) of a handful base pairs has been observed, no greater damage has been expected or seen — until now. It turns out that some CRISPR edits may produce indels at the scale of thousands of bases — more than enough to affect adjacent genes or otherwise interfere with normal geneftic operation. The study published today in Nature, by Michael Kosicki, Kärt Tomberg and Allan Bradley of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, explains that previous research may have never encountered this type of damage simply because, essentially, it never allowed damage at this scale to occur. The problem isn’t that CRISPR is going wild and producing this damage on its own; instead, the issue is an unexpectedly sloppy repair job by the cell itself. After a CRISPR snip, lead author Bradley explained in a Nature news writeup, “the cell will try to stitch things back together. But it doesn’t really know what bits of DNA lie adjacent to each other.” While doing its best to repair the damage with a bit of its own genetic cutting and pasting, it may accidentally substitute hundreds or thousands of base pairs that weren’t there, or cut out similarly sized ranges that were supposed to remain. Because previous studies often used many copies of the same thousand-pair (or thereabouts) sequence to watch CRISPR in action, the possibility of thousand-pair damage was pretty much absent. It’s only when using much longer and more diverse strands of DNA that these high-volume indels are possible. “We speculate that current assessments may have missed a substantial proportion of potential genotypes generated by on-target Cas9 cutting and repair, some of which may have potential pathogenic consequences,” reads the paper. Fortunately, the damage seems to only occur when the job performed by the CRISPR complex is the cutting out of a sequence, leaving it open for the cell to repair. There are other methods that involve replacing or deactivating sequences that should not provoke this reaction. And like many problems in the practical biological sciences, it doesn’t need to be feared and worried about — it needs to be studied and accounted for. All the same, having serious genetic damage accompany any part of this revolutionary technique will surely (or at least hopefully) spur inquiry and countermeasures, even if it means tapping the brakes on certain existing therapies, experiments, and companies.","CRISPR-Cas9, the gene editing tool that is currently the darling of biotech and many other fields, may not be quite as miraculous as early tests suggested.

Virginia Heffernan,"Speed has tripped the light fantastic in America for more than 85 years. From Ritalin and Adderall to the twice-­methylated Breaking Bad stuff, speed seduces both overbright founders and scurvy garage-dwellers. But it’s not the drug for right now. Speed is not only deadly; it’s defeatist. It’s been two sobering years. We’d do well to take stock of what we were blind to in the raciest days of Silicon Valley and the government-as-usual Obama years. When the writer Casey Schwartz gave up Adderall after having it define her youth, she identified deep regrets: “I had spent years of my life in a state of false intensity, always wondering if I should be somewhere else, working harder, achieving more.” America is plenty intense—and it requires more freethinking from its citizens now than ever. It’s time for a reckoning with reality, reflection and reform, principled action. It’s also a time for civil disobedience. As grandiose as Adderall makes some people feel, the history of amphetamine as a drug of subjugation—used to compel obedience in soldiers, dieters, and unruly kids—haunts it. In 1933, 46 years after Lazăr Edeleanu, a Romanian chemist, fatefully synthesized amphetamine—a mix of mirror-image molecules, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine—Smith, Kline &amp; French picked it up and sold it as Benzedrine. Wouldn’t you know, enterprising hacker-tweakers soon prised open the inhalers, liberated the speed-soaked cotton strips, and swallowed them. Benzedrine as an “alertness aid” then shipped out to war. Months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the drug was, quite literally, weaponized. Military commanders, writes Nicolas Rasmussen in On Speed: From Benzedrine to Adderall, greatly feared another humiliating epidemic of “shell shock” like the one that had crippled the Allied armies of World War I. To keep soldiers looking on the bright side of war, armies began provisioning the men with amphetamines. Psychiatrists on the battlefield rechristened shell shock “operational fatigue,” and soldiers were relieved to hear they had a manly sounding physical ailment, eminently treatable with more Benzedrine. Get back out there, Private. Combat itself was changed by speed. Speedfreak servicemen of the 1940s made for gung-ho, wild-eyed fighters as the drug supplied them with fool’s courage. They hurled themselves into battle where they might otherwise have been held back by less thrilling but more adaptive human traits: anxiety, prudence, conscience. Commanders liked what they saw, and kept their men dosed. When the soldiers came home, many were addicted, and their wives were the nation’s next good soldiers. They reproduced the logic of the battlefields: They sucked down amphetamines to wage war on bodies—their own. The postwar obsession with thinness developed in tandem with the speed trade. By the end of the ’60s, 9.7 million Americans used prescription amphetamines. Of those, hundreds of thousands were addicted. The everyday tweakers jittered along, subduing their fears and hungers with the pep pills that were now dyed and looked like candy. In 1968, after speed killed a dieting woman, an investigative journalist for Life magazine, Susanna McBee, published a bombshell exposé about the overprescription of pills for weight loss. McBee made a tour of doctors’ offices, and—after cursory interviews—was able to cop bags and bags of darling little tablets. Of course McBee had no weight to lose. But the drug trade now battened on the styling of female flesh as a disease. From soldiers to dieters to children. After McBee’s article, and more deaths traced to diet pills, weight-loss speed became more tightly regulated. But speed changed shape. Just as “operational fatigue” and “flesh” had been styled as pathologies, distractibility got a pharmaworld makeover—and became ADHD. Ritalin prescriptions for kids took off in the 1990s. By 2011, 3.5 million children in the US were on stimulants. A recent formulation, Adzenys, is aimed at first graders and up: It’s orange-­flavored and melts in your mouth. Speed can give kids a wonderful A-student experience. Of course parents want their kids to have that. To know the pleasures of conformity is a kind of bliss; those who pretend otherwise must never have feared that their eccentricities would disqualify them from life. But eventually the wandering mind, the hunger, and the anxiety return. Speed gooses certain receptors to fake a body out, making it feel tight, urgent, self-important. On speed, you tend to embrace monotonous chores, especially asocial or servile ones, like arid sessions of dusting or coding, as the tiny muscles that line the walls of blood vessels contract. Speed also curbs mucus, while relaxing the lungs. So while users have symptoms of fear that may read as excitement, they also breathe easier. You’d do well to lay off the starch and read some Betty Friedan on the slavery of scut work. Eventually, though, congestion returns. The mortal coil tightens. When it does, you may wonder: Why am I taking apart iPads and starching sheets? Good question, and you’d do well to lay off the starch and read some Betty Friedan on the slavery of scut work. Also, sleep. But if speed calls you back, it’s because the power to rise to social demands that elude undrugged brains—that just feels too good. It’s not immoral to want relief from being too slow, scared, and fat—too disappointing to your commanders. But chasing relief with speed could set you up for brain damage and psychosis. Worse, under the guise of fraud liberation, it locks you into life-­draining repetition. You think you’re being gloriously “productive”—even if what you’re producing is expense reports and Fortnite kills—without noticing that you’re missing the reasons for being: food, books, reflection, reform, engagement, adventure, rest, and meaningful work. Why would anyone submit to this? Years ago, I stumbled upon an illustration of meth’s effects in Donna Tartt’s The Little Friend. Danny takes a hit and “Tears rose to his eyes. The icy, disinfectant taste at the back of his throat made him feel clean: everything surface again, everything sparkle on the glossy face of these waters which swept like thunder over a cesspool he was sick to death of: poverty, grease and rot.” I tried Ritalin in graduate school. I did manage term-­paper all-nighters under its influence, and stopped eating; I had the sense that people like bosses were pleased with undernourished, industrious me, that I was doing well by them. But the tensing of blood-vessel muscles evidently reads to my body not as euphoria but as a kind of stifled misery, and sometimes I’d mistake my loss of appetite for grief. More precisely: High on speed, I felt as though someone I loved dearly had recently died. Worse still, I felt too important and prolific to mourn, or even care.

After leaving an Airbnb in Madrid, Spain, travel writer Lee Abbamonte returned home to find an angry email from a supposed owner of the apartment.
At first I didnt think this was meant for me, nor did I know who this woman was, Abbamonte wrote. I had dealt with very nice people from a management company before and during my trip to Madrid. Then the woman started sending me photos of the apartment claiming we did all this damage to her apartment.

According to the email, Abbamonte and his guests had, among other things, left trash on the floor of a room and ruined furniture, including a chair worth 4,000 euros. But Abbamonte insists he did no such thing. The chair, which was a piece of shit, was already ripped when we arrived, he wrote. We literally sat in it once or twice and saw feathers pop out. We picked them up and that was it. It didnt even occur to us this was an issue or that we should report it or whatever.
And after a back and forth with an Airbnb rep, Airbnb ultimately ruled in favor of the host. Abbamonte was not charged in the endbut he was still held responsible (his account was notated for future discipline if anything else happens).
Take photos of your Airbnb upon your arrival and before your departure
Perhaps the easiest way to protect yourself from this type of scenario is to take photos of every room as soon as you arrive and right before your departure. By taking photos of the Airbnb on your arrival day, you can make sure you werent responsible for any existing damage (in the same way you might photograph a rental car before using it). Taking photos on your departure date, too, will ensure you didnt leave the apartment in a total state of chaos.
Having time-stamped proof of your departure time and date is crucial, too. If you find something seriously damaged when you arrive, you should inform your host immediately in person, or otherwise, send a photo as close as possible to your arrival time. When leaving, try taking a photo with a dated newspaper or a video of the apartment with time-stamped email as proof (or even send a thank you message to your host via Airbnb as you depart and use that as evidence).

Carefully read the reviews
Of course, always check your Airbnbs reviews before booking a trip. If the apartment has little or no reviews, check to see if your host has other listings with reviews or even their own reviews as guests. Check to see if theyre verified through Airbnb, too (which requires info like Facebook profiles, email addresses, and government-issued IDs). And as Redditor u/cr1zzlrecommended, communication is key. If theyre not as responsive or dodging any questions, it might be best to reconsider your stay.
Communicate through Airbnb
Lastly, be sure to verify anyone who reaches out to you from any means other than Airbnbs direct messaging system. While management companies may operate on some hosts behalf, you should always reach out to Airbnb to make sure theyre, in fact, the owner. (In other words, dont immediately trust any emails from supposed owners.) Its a pretty common practice now for hosts to email their guests with check-in info or map directions. Still, you shouldnt be so quick to accept from someone unverified.
Hosts must often provide documentation like photos and receipts in the event of any damage claims, too, so being armed with proof that you left a rental in good shape will protect you from any trouble down the line.

JAMES BARRON,"In court papers, the citys lawyer echoed that idea, saying the project had an overwhelming net positive impact and calling the opponents arguments long on histrionics but not substance.
The city also said the landmarks law presumes that owners should be afforded maximum latitude to use and adapt what is it bears repeating private property.
The blocklong building that houses the clock was owned by the city, which sold it in 2013 to the developers. The next year, the developers went to the landmarks commission about the clock tower, saying that it was inaccessible to the public and that they wanted to electrify the clock mechanism without moving it.
Some clock experts worry that electrifying it could ruin it.
Access is necessary because the clock can only be maintained by hand, say opponents of the penthouse project. For nearly 40 years, the citys official clock master, Marvin Schneider, did the job.
[Meet the man who turns back New York Citys clocks, hand by hand.]
That was easy when the city owned the building, and at first, the new owners the developers allowed him in. But in March 2015, he said, they told him he was no longer welcome. The clock stopped soon after that, Mr. Schneider said.
Supposedly, the New York City landmarks law was given a jump-start by the demolition of Penn Station in the 1960s, Mr. Schneider said. Something of great significance like that should not have been summarily torn down. There should be protection. So thats pretty much how I felt about the clock. Its a testament to American pre-eminence in the clock field in the late 19th century, that a clock like that could be made on that scale to function well enough in this age. You could still set your watch by it.

Katrina Filippidis,"A group of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University have found a way to counter surface damage and electrical failure commonly observed in soft materials used in engineering robotic electronics. Like previous efforts, it involves a certain kind of polymer. To create a material that is both flexible and resistant to damage, Carmel Majidi and his team inserted liquid microdroplets of a gallium-indium based metal alloy into a soft, elastomer shell. Essentially, it's a solid-liquid hybrid that is stretchable, electrically insulating and capable of auto-repair even when damaged multiple times. Where most other self-healing soft electronics need exposure to heat, increased humidity or manual reassembly to get back to health, the metal-elastomer composite heals itself by forming new electrical pathways. Majidi says the inspiration behind the composite material comes from the nervous system's ability to regenerate itself. It isn't mimicking neuroplasticity entirely, though; while the metal-elastomer could be useful in wearable computing and inflatable airships to protect electrical wiring from potential damage, there's no such protection for mechanical or structural damage. That's the eventual aim -- creating a material which helps robots weather both electrical and structural defects and, like Astro Boy, interact with humans more safely.","Most conventional androids are fairly rigid, susceptible to damage and difficult to repair.

Ed Cara,"One of the worst side-effects of chemotherapy treatment is the inadvertent damage it causes to the gastrointestinal (GI) system, leading to nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. While there are short-term treatments available to help deal with these symptoms, oftentimes the damage can lead to chronic GI problems. Now, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh say they’ve found a way to short circuit the molecular pathway that sparks this gut damage in the first place. Most forms of chemotherapy, including radiation, are like grenades: They’re great at killing cancer cells, but they’ll take out plenty of perfectly healthy ones nearby, too. That’s a problem for the cells that line and protect our gut from stomach acid and an overabundance of bacteria, since they need to be constantly replaced. Chemotherapy is especially destructive to the back-up supply of stem cells in the gut, which makes renewing the lining all the harder. That then leads to the myriad of GI problems it causes (hair follicles are also easily destroyed by cancer treatments, which accounts for the frequent baldness of cancer patients). Research has shown that completely blocking the activation of a protein known as p53 could possibly protect healthy cells from this effect. But p53 is too crucial to the overall health of cells for that to be a realistic approach; blocking it entirely would only cause more problems than it’d solve. Instead, the researchers of this current study, based on their earlier studies, theorized that blocking another protein that sometimes activates p53, known as PUMA, could accomplish the same trick without being as harmful. The researchers first created mice that were genetically unable to produce PUMA and dosed them with a common chemotherapy drug used to treat colon cancer. Some of the mice were also made to develop tumors. The healthy gut cells of mice unable to produce PUMA avoided much but not all of the splash damage caused by the drug, while it was still able to work its mojo on the tumors. They then tested out a small molecule thought to inhibit PUMA on a second group. Just like before, mice without PUMA had healthier guts, and the lack of PUMA didn’t seem to interfere with the drug’s antitumor effects. Lastly, they tested out the inhibitor on miniaturized, lab-grown mice and human colons, finding similar results. The findings were published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine. “The PUMA inhibitor selectively protects intestinal stem cells from being killed by chemo and helps improve their ability to repair DNA, ultimately improving GI regeneration and long-term functions,” study authors Jian Yu and Brian Leibotiwz, both at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s Hillman Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, told me via email. Encouraging as the results are, though, they’re just a proof of concept for now. And there are still lots of improvements the UPMC team needs to make, such as refining the molecule to provide a sturdier buffer against chemotherapy damage. “The lab has also been interested in identifying additional compounds that might act in concert with the PUMA inhibitor to provide even better GI protection against cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation,” they said. With any luck, they hope to reach trials involving larger animals—and eventually people— within the next three to five years.

Kate Clark,"Munchery’s vendors claim the food delivery startup took advantage of them in its final hours, knowingly allowing them to continue making deliveries it couldn’t pay for.
Earlier this week, Munchery surprised customers with an email announcing it would cease operations, effective immediately. It did not, however, notify any of its vendors of the news, according to the owners of several small San Francisco-based businesses, who told TechCrunch they are owed thousands in overdue Munchery payments.
Charles Farriér, the owner of Crumble &amp; Whisk Patisserie, is waiting on a $1,700 payment from Munchery. Lenore Estrada of Three Babes Bakeshop said she’s owed more than $20,000. Melissa Cohen of Salty Sweet Cookies, Jennifer Roy of Dandelion Chocolate and Jennifer Nguyen of Native Baking Co. are expecting a total of $16,417.50.
Munchery was founded in 2010 by former chief executive officer Tri Tran and Conrad Chu, who have both since left the company. It had raised a total of $125 million in venture capital funding, reaching a valuation of $300 million at its peak. Supported by notable Silicon Valley investors, including Greycroft, Menlo Ventures and Sherpa Capital, the high-flying startup failed to deploy capital efficiently, then crumbled. 
Now, three days after its sudden announcement, several vendors are waiting anxiously for their final invoice checks, and say they weren’t notified of Munchery’s end, nor has the business responded to persistent requests for explanations.
Munchery has not responded to multiple requests for comment from TechCrunch. As of Thursday morning, Munchery had not officially filed for bankruptcy in the Federal Court or in the Superior Court of San Francisco.
Munchery chief executive officer James Beriker joined the startup in 2016.
Gone without a trace
Days before Christmas, Farriér was told to slow down production of his artisan cheesecakes, which he had been servicing to Munchery for three years.
Munchery provided prepared meals to residents in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and New York. In addition to preparing ingredients in-house in its South San Francisco headquarters, the startup also partnered with local businesses, like Crumble &amp; Whisk, whose baked goods were included with its meals.
Unlike the other business owners TechCrunch spoke with, Farriér said he had caught on to Munchery’s financial struggles after multiple late payments, and was on the verge of ending his relationship with the business entirely. Little did he know they were just weeks away from an implosion, that, according to sources, even some Munchery employees weren’t aware of until 24 hours before the end of business announcement was sent to customers.
Charles Farriér, the owner of San Francisco-based bakery Crumble &amp; Whisk Patisserie.
“Today, with a heavy heart, were reaching out to announce that Munchery is closing its doors,” the business wrote in an email signed “Team Munchery.” “More than anything, we want to say thank you. Thank you for all of the love and support you have shown us over the years, for sharing us with your friends and family, and for including us in your special life moments.”
Beriker, who joined the startup as CEO in November 2016 after a four-year stint as the chief executive of recruitment firm Simply Hired, was missing from the signature of the email. Beriker has gone dark, opting not to respond to media requests, as well as emails and phone calls from vendors looking for payment.
“Munchery ran into a wall rather than planning to shut down in an orderly fashion,” Munchery vendor Lenore Estrada told TechCrunch.
When Farriér heard the news on Monday, he went to Munchery’s headquarters seeking his final payment. To his surprise, no one, except another aggravated vendor, was there. The $1,700 Farriér is owed may be equivalent to the cost of a dinner with colleagues for some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, but for him, it’s meant being forced to take out a loan to pay his employees.
“They just expect us to sit back and take it but we need that money to keep our businesses afloat,” Farriér told TechCrunch. “It may be pennies to them but it’s money to us, we cannot stay afloat without being paid. It hurt my business; I had to take out a loan; I had to tell my staff I couldnt pay them this week.”
Farriér has worked with a number of tech-enabled food delivery platforms, including Good Eggs and Sprig, which similarly went out of business in May 2017. Contrary to how Munchery has handled its sudden ending, however, Sprig, he said, ensured all vendors were paid the same day the startup notified them that it would cease operations.
“The sad part about this whole situation is [Munchery] didn’t even have the courtesy or the respect to let the vendors know,” Farriér added. “It’s a real slap in the face.”
Bakers await payments
Estrada of Three Babes Bakeshop said she’s heard nothing from Munchery about its shutdown or the $20,000 owed her. Cohen, Roy and Nguyen similarly told TechCrunch they’ve attempted to reach out to Munchery, to no avail.
Dandelion Chocolate owner Jennifer Roy says Munchery owes her $6,000.
“The thing that’s really baffling to me is why they didn’t call it earlier,” Estrada told TechCrunch. “When I was there [Tuesday], there was a truck leaving with food that had been donated. Munchery ran into a wall rather than planning to shut down in an orderly fashion. That’s just crazy, as I’m sure they knew how much runway they had.”
Estrada and Nguyen said Munchery had standing orders with both Three Babes Bakery and Native Baking Co. Three Babes had planned to make their delivery Tuesday, one day after Munchery announced they were going out of business. Munchery never canceled the standing order. Native Baking Co. completed their standing order delivery Monday morning, the same day Munchery said it would cease operations.
“I’ve been hounding them to pay me for old invoices for the whole month of January,” Nguyen told TechCrunch. “During the holidays, we are so busy, so as a small business owner I wasn’t totally on top of keeping up with [payments]. I just thought I will get to January, then I will deal with it.”
Nguyen ultimately learned of Munchery’s shut down Tuesday morning from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle.
Munchery, as mentioned, had raised roughly $125 million in VC funding across rounds that closed in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Munchery didn’t raise any capital under Beriker, who was appointed amid reports the business had been struggling to improve its margins, aside from a $5 million financing in 2017.
“For a company that had raised so much money, it’s shocking to me that the CEO and the board weren’t more on top of calling it with enough time to pay their vendors,” Estrada added. “I personally will go without pay to pay my employees because of this situation. Will the Munchery CEO be doing the same? Most likely not.”
According to a 2016 report from Bloomberg, Munchery was making way too much food — much of which was thrown out — and was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars distributing discount flyers. For what it’s worth, Munchery told TechCrunch at the time of those reports that its “customer base and revenue [were] growing” and that it was profitable in San Francisco and contribution margin positive in its three other markets.
This was, however, before Munchery laid off 257 employees, or 30 percent of its workforce, and shut down its Seattle, Los Angeles and New York operations. In May 2018, at the time of the layoffs, the company said it planned to double down on the San Francisco market, achieve profitability” and “build a long-term, sustainable business.
“This feels like these guys locked the doors and ran off to another country,” Munchery vendor Jennifer Nguyen told TechCrunch. 
Why Munchery and CEO James Beriker decided not to communicate its demise with vendors is unclear, as is what ultimately forced it to shutter so suddenly. What is clear is that Munchery ran into a brick wall and fast, left without enough cash to settle even its smallest debts.
“This feels like these guys locked the doors and ran off to another country,” Nguyen said. “I only have a couple of employees and I want to pay them. Nine-grand isn’t much to a giant company, but it makes a huge difference at our company. It feels as if we’ve been taken advantage of by the big guy and it sucks.”
Of the five businesses that spoke to TechCrunch, Munchery owes nearly $40,000 in overdue bills. What’s next? Munchery will inevitably officially file for bankruptcy and the small business owners — collateral damage of a startup that failed to overcome the brutal economics of the central kitchen model — will go without payment.
I basically mean nothing to [Munchery],” Farriér said. “Im just there to make sure [they] look good on paper. I’m just a number to [them].”",Five small businesses are collateral damage after a well-funded startup failed to overcome the brutal economics of the central kitchen model.,2019-01-24T16:38:43Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","After an abrupt shutdown, Munchery’s small business vendors are the ones picking up the bill",http://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/after-an-abrupt-shutdown-muncherys-small-business-vendors-are-the-ones-picking-up-the-bill/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20476652160_bbf7b2def3_o.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,damage,0
PAUL KRUGMAN,"No, it wont. Even if most of the tariffs go away, Trumps trade belligerence has done lasting damage to Americas reputation, and hence to a global economy that depends on American leadership. 
The whole world now knows two things about us. First, were not reliable an agreement with the U.S. is really just a suggestion, because you never know when the president will invent some excuse for breaking it. Second, were easily rolled: The president may talk tough on trade, but in classic bully fashion, he runs away if confronted.
On U.S. unreliability, consider the way the current administration has treated Canada, probably the friendliest neighbor and firmest ally any nation has ever had. Despite generations of good relations and a free-trade agreement, Trump imposed large tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, invoking national security as a justification. This was obviously specious in fact, Trump himself basically conceded this point, justifying the tariffs instead as retaliation for Canadian dairy policy (which was also specious). 
The lesson for the world is that America cant be trusted. Why bother making deals with a country thats willing to slap sanctions on the best of allies, and clearly lie about the reasons, whenever it feels like it?
Meanwhile, the sudden retreat in the confrontation with China shows that we talk loud but carry a small stick. It would be one thing if the U.S. had changed course on the merits. But backing down so easily, after all the posturing, tells the world that the way to deal with America is not to bargain in good faith, but simply to threaten the presidents political base, and maybe offer some payoffs, political and otherwise. (Im still wondering about those floors Chinas largest bank rents at Trump Tower.)
And when it comes to payoffs, autocracies have an advantage over nations that observe the rule of law. China appears to be getting most Trump tariffs removed; Canada still faces those steel tariffs.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Speaking with reporters following the quake, Alaska Governor Bill Walker said that resulting disruption and needed repairs could last quite some time. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck around 8:29 a.m. local time followed by ensuing, smaller earthquakes. Citing United States Geological Survey research geophysicist Gavin Hayes, CNN reported Saturday that a magnitude-5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest event since a magnitude-5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake. Despite earthquakes being common in the area, Fridays event was still significant. Videos shared on social media captured widespread damage across Anchorage and the surrounding area. One video shared by climatologist Brian Brettschneider on Twitter captured drone footage of cracks in ice at Anchorages Waldron Lake. According to Brettschneider, the ice was 8 inches thick. Nat Herz, a reporter for Alaska Public Media, told NPR that he was sitting at a coffee shop in Anchorage when he just felt like sort of a rumble or a buzz. But then things kind of got louder, and things started really shaking and shaking hard. And people were kind of looking around, he told NPR. And then I think, you know, someone went for the door, and everyone else went for the door. And, you know, everyone kind of hurried outside. And kind of once things settled down, everyone went back in. At least two highways were closed down following the earthquake, with local CBS affiliate KTVA reporting that areas Glenn Highway endured significant damage that included a massive sinkhole. Power losses also reportedly affected tens of thousands of people following the initial earthquake. Governor Walker said in a phone interview Friday that theres a possibility that some infrastructure damage could take weeks or months to repair, especially given the winter season. Walker also said he spoke with President Donald Trump, after which call KTVA reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved assistance for the area. Its going to be a disruption for quite some time, Walker said. Weve been on the phone with the White House a number of times today [and] took a call from President Trump. They talked about their desire to help us, and we appreciate that very much. According to Alaska Public Media, schools in the area are expected to be closed until at least Wednesday of next week.","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.

A.A. Newton,"Garbage disposals are designed to take a lot of abuse, but nowhere near what some people put them through. As magical as they seem, these powerful machines do have their limitsand if used improperly, you can do just as much damage to your plumbing with a disposal as you can without one. 
Garbage disposals wear out over time, and can also break or clog when you throw the wrong stuff in. 
Read more Read
Everyone knows that certain things dont belong in a garbage disposal, but its surprisingly hard to get a straight answer about what exactly those things are. The easiest way to separate the things that can and cannot go down the disposal is to have a general idea of how they work. Lots of people think that garbage disposals have spinning blades like a blender, but theyre actually closer to flat burr coffee grinder. As the motor turns, it forces food particles in the main disposal chamber through a series of holes around the perimeter, breaking them up into tiny particles. From there, the food flows into the wastewater pipe and on its merry way:
Video via This Old House on YouTube.
Ultimately, your garbage disposal is just a fancy front door to your kitchen sink: everything you put down it eventually ends up in your pipes, just in much smaller pieces. In order for a piece of food to go from the garbage disposal to the waste water treatment plant with no major detours along the way, it needs to be soft enough to pass through the grind holes and water-soluble enough to resist clogging. This covers most things youd eat, but as always, there are some notable exceptions. 
Non-food items
This should be obvious, but never put anything that isnt food down your disposal. Its designed to break down stuff thats soft enough to chewnot glass, metal, or even paper. The first two are easy enough to avoid, but dont forget to peel off stickers and labels from produce or new kitchen gadgets and throw them in the garbage. While one or two wont do much damage, they can build up over the years. 
Anything really hard
Your garbage disposal is a powerful grinding machine, but that doesnt mean it can handle anything you feed it. The really tough stuffthink fruit pits, bones, raw meat, and fruit or nut shellswont break down at all. Instead, itll just bounce around the chamber, getting more and more banged-up until you admit defeat and chuck it in the trash or compost where it belongs. If its too hard to chew, its too hard to grind up. 
Avocados just cant stay out of the news. Not only are they dangerous to ones hands and wallet,
Read more Read
Of course, just because your disposal can grind something doesnt mean it should. Egg shells are a great example of this: most disposals will eventually break them down, but they pose more danger to your pipes than the disposal itself. The shards dont exactly dissolve in water, so theyre prone to building up over time and even clogging your pipes. 
Known clog risks
On that note, its extremely important to avoid putting potential clogging agents down your disposal. These are the worst offenders:
Grease and oil: Never put large quantities of oil down any drain, not even one with a disposal. Cooking grease floats on top of waste water, sticking to the walls of your pipes and trapping particulate solids until it forms a massive plug. Let frying oil cool and dispose in the trashor strain it and re-use. 
Coffee grounds: Where fat floats, coffee grounds sink. Even if they dont get caught in built-up grease deposits, they can collect on the floor of pipes, eventually stopping the flow of water altogether. Throw them away, compost them, or save them for garden fertilizer. 
Anything that can absorb a lot of water: Cooked or raw rice, bread, pasta, grains, flours, and starches are far too water-absorbent to safely pass through pipes. 
Anything that can get stuck in a pipe probably will. When in doubt, think about what would happen if you left that thing in a bowl of water indefinitely. If it would dissolve on its own, its probably OK; if it wouldnt, dont risk it. 
Fibrous or stringy substances
Thanks to good old common sense, most people know enough not to put chicken bones down the garbage disposalbut might think nothing of chucking in a stalk of celery. Unfortunately, some fruits and vegetables are so fibrous that their surprisingly tough structures dont always break down in the disposal. Over time, stringy fibers from foods like celery, corn husks, pineapple, onion and garlic skins, asparagus, and artichokes can get tangled, putting unnecessary stress on the motor and shortening its lifespan.
Too much of anything
As is so often the case, when it comes to garbage disposals, the dose makes the poison. Even innocuous foods like carrot peels can cause problems if you cram your disposal full of them and then switch on the motor. Always run the tap, feed things in slowly, keep the pieces small, and throw away anything that gives you pauseor makes a lot of noise. 
With that said, the opposite is also true to some extent. A tablespoon of congealed bacon fat here or a handful of chopped celery there wont instantly destroy your pipes or disposal, but over time, bad habits will come back to bite you in the ass. Treat your garbage disposal welland clean it from time to timeand itll have your back for years to come.","Garbage disposals are designed to take a lot of abuse, but nowhere near what some people put them through.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Sunscreens will get new labeling soon, and some will be off the market, according to a proposed rule that the FDA announced today. The changes will also mean that its easier to find sunscreens that protect against UVA rays (the ones that cause damage but not sunburn). 
Some ingredients safety is in question
Many of a sunscreens ingredients are similar to non-SPF products like lotions. What makes it a sunscreen are specific ingredients that either reflect or absorb ultraviolet rays. Currently, 16 ingredients are approved for this purpose and currently on the market. The FDA announced today that: 
Only two ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are generally recognized as safe and effective. These are physical sunscreens that reflect UV light away from your skin. 
Two ingredients, PABA and trolamine salicylate, should not be considered generally recognized as safe and effective, and will not be allowed in sunscreens going forward. 
For the other 12 ingredients, the FDA didnt feel they had enough evidence to make a decision one way or another. They are asking manufacturers to do more testing and submit their data. 
Part of the reason for reconsidering the ingredients is that early sunscreen regulations assumed that people would only use small amounts of low SPF sunscreen, and that not much of the ingredients were absorbed into the skin. We now know that more is absorbed, and its worth doing some extra testing to see if these levels are still safe.
Sunscreens should get better at blocking UVA
The skin-damaging rays from the sun come in two flavors: UVB causes the reddening we know as sunburn, while UVA results in the thickening and wrinkling of skin over time. (There are other rays as well, but these are the major ones that have been studied.) You can be exposed to UVA even through windows, and even at times of day or times of year when you arent likely to get a sunburn. Both types can contribute to skin cancer. 
The SPF label on sunscreen only tells you how well the product protects against UVB. To figure out whether it has UVA protection, look for the words broad spectrum. There is currently no way to tell how strong the UVA protection is (on US packaging, anyway). Your high SPF sunscreen might have very little UVA protection, and youd stay out in the sun and never know. 
Going forward, the FDA wants all sunscreens from SPF 15 on up to be broad spectrum. They have to protect against more of the UVA spectrum than they currently do, and the amount of UVA protection has to match the total UV protection. In real terms, that means you can count on an SPF 50 sunscreen to provide more UVA and UVB protection than an SPF 15.
Formulations may change before the rule is officially in effect
Todays announcement will cause a sea change in how sunscreens are formulated, Environmental Working Group senior scientist David Andrews said in a press call today. (We have our issues with the EWG, but they do watch the industry closely.) Companies wont want to be caught by surprise when the rules finally take effect, which could be months to years from now, so they are probably thinking right now about how they can reformulate their products. 
Among the other proposed changes: 
There may be no more combination sunscreen/bug spray products (pesticides and personal care products have labeling requirements that are too different, and they havent been sufficiently tested together). 
Products like sunscreen powders, wipes, and shampoos may not be allowed at all unless their makers do further testing.
Sunscreens with less than SPF 15 may not be on the market at all. (This isnt decided, but the FDAs document asks, essentially, what is even the point of these?) 
High SPF numbers may not be allowed, with a suggested cap of 60+ and a hard limit of 80. While there is research showing that higher SPFs may actually work better, its controversial whether the numbering system is reliable enough to make this a meaningful difference for consumers.","Sunscreens will get new labeling soon, and some will be off the market, according to a proposed rule that the FDA announced today.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"In his letter on Friday accepting the resignation of Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Catholic archbishop of Washington, Pope Francis praised the departing prelate for his nobility in not trying to defend mistakes in his handling of sexual-abuse allegations. The pope misses the point. The archbishop may not be as culpable as other bishops who more systematically covered up sexual predation, and in at least one case he took action that was initially thwarted by the Vatican. But a devastatingly detailed grand jury report on widespread child sex abuse in Pennsylvania churches showed that Cardinal Wuerl, as bishop of Pittsburgh, was immersed in a clerical culture that hid pedophilic crimes behind euphemisms, conducted unprofessional investigations and evaluations of accused priests, kept acknowledged cases of sex abuse secret from parish communities and avoided reporting the abuse to police. In an anguished letter to his archdiocese, Cardinal Wuerl accepted responsibility for actions described in the grand jury report.

DOROTHY KRONICK,"Perhaps Plan B was to invade, despite well-founded pessimism about where invasion would lead. But that option faces mounting political hurdles. On Monday, nine Latin American countries along with Canada and the European Union unequivocally rejected military intervention. Twenty-one members of the House of Representatives have sponsored a bill that would forbid military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization. And according to opinion polls, a majority of Venezuelans oppose an invasion.
A better backup plan would allow Venezuela to exchange oil for essentials. For example, the United States could buy Venezuelan oil so long as proceeds accrued to escrow accounts subject to international monitoring are used only for purchases of food, medicine, and oil-sector infrastructure.
As in the case of Iran, the United States could exempt from sanctions third countries that trade with Venezuela (such as India and China), again on the condition that proceeds would go toward essentials.
And while aid alone will not fill the hole left by sanctions, the United States could participate in multilateral efforts designed to disarm rather than encourage Mr. Maduros abhorrent effort to block humanitarian assistance.
In Iraq an oil-for-food program did alleviate suffering despite corruption and mismanagement. But it arrived seven years after the imposing of sanctions. Venezuelan children cannot wait seven years.
Without a Plan B, Washington has made a bet thats safe for President Trump and dangerous for the Venezuelan people. If sanctions contribute to a quick Maduro exit, Mr. Trump will look like a hero. And if they dont, the United States president will wash his hands of the whole mess. He cant be blamed if Venezuelans starve, can he? Werent Venezuelans starving before the sanctions? You say sanctions made things worse. Mr. Trump says fake news.
Some have argued that depriving the Venezuelan government of cash is a moral imperative, because not doing so amounts to paying a hostage-taker. We should not reward hostage-takers like Nicolás Maduro, the thinking goes. But of course, in practice, the international community has done it, in Iraq and elsewhere. We pay hostage-takers not because it feels good or right. We do it when the alternative is worse.

Jacob Kleinman,"If you just picked up Apple’s flashy new HomePod speaker you might be thinking of displaying it proudly on the nicest piece of furniture you have, but before you do there’s something you should know. The $350 gadget’s silicon base can damage wooden surfaces, leaving behind an ugly stain. I can’t believe I have to say this (actually, at this point when it comes to Apple, nothing really surprises me), but you should probably put a coaster under your HomePod before you place it on that heirloom nightstand by your bed. Staingate (as some people have decided to call it) was reported in Wirecutter’s HomePod review on Wednesday. It’s also mentioned by Pocket-lint and at least one angry customers on Twitter. In a statement to Wirecutter, Apple confirmed the issue but claimed that “the marks can improve over several days after the speaker is removed from the wood surface.” If that doesn’t work you’ll have to refinish the wood to remove the stain. But really, that shouldn’t be necessary. This is a $350 product and the very least you should expect is that it won’t damage whatever surface you put it on. So if you want to display your new HomePod on a wooden table or shelf put a coaster (or some other sort of buffer) underneath the speaker. Alternatively, you could also place it on glass, granite with no issue at all, or, you know, just skip the overpriced Apple device entirely this time around.","If you just picked up Apple’s flashy new HomePod speaker you might be thinking of displaying it proudly on the nicest piece of furniture you have, but before you do there’s something you should know.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","The sun’s ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to our skin cells because it damages our DNA. That’s why sun exposure can cause cancer, and why sunscreen is so important (even apart from its power to prevent sunburns). There are sunscreens that claim they can help your skin repair that damage—and, it turns out, they actually might (might!) work. Some animals and bacteria produce DNA repair enzymes that we don’t, Robbie Gonzales reports at Wired. Some of these are activated by sunlight, and preliminary studies show that they can actually be absorbed through human skin and protect DNA from radiation, as advertised. But there are a couple of problems. One is that we only have a few lab studies to go on, not a solid body of evidence. Another is that these enzymes haven’t gone through the FDA approval process, and aren’t widely available. But the biggest issue is simply that they’re expensive. Estée Lauder makes them, Gonzales found, and sells them to other cosmetics companies who want to make DNA-repairing sunscreens as a pricey niche product. Three to four ounces will run you anywhere between $45 and $75 depending on the brand. That’s enough for maybe a couple of days of responsible sunscreen use. So don’t expect these formulas to replace your regular sunscreen any time soon.","The sun’s ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to our skin cells because it damages our DNA.

JOSEPH B. TREASTER,"Two University of Puerto Rico art museums lost chunks of their roofs: Casa Roig, a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired two-story house 45 minutes south of San Juan, and the Museum of Art at the Mayagüez campus on the west coast. Casa Roig’s paneled ceilings partially collapsed. The wind blew out windows and broke a set of stained glass interior doors. It ripped tiles off mosaics. Putting Casa Roig back together is expected to cost nearly $400,000. In Mayagüez, Zorali De Feria, the museum director, found mold on a mural and a handful of paintings. She gave them first aid and alternated putting the paintings briefly in the sunlight and in the shade of a breezeway. Photo Tile mosaics in the home at the Casa Roig Museum were already fragile and damaged, but suffered more loss with hurricane Maria. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Right after the storm, in her unlit office, Ms. De Feria wrote out a plea for help in longhand. The National Endowment for the Humanities sent her $30,000. Ms. Ramírez, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, also received $30,000 from the Endowment. She is putting her money toward the purchase of a generator that, with installation, is going to cost $110,000. “We need a generator, too,” Ms. De Feria said. The electricity came back sooner for both museums than in most of the island, but generators would have greatly reduced the risk and the stress. Ms. Pérez, who is also president of the Association of Puerto Rican Art Museums, and her colleagues have begun to rethink almost everything about their museums and hurricanes. Many museums did not have emergency operations plans. Some did not have home addresses for staff members. Cellphones and landlines were knocked out. Gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce. The museums became isolated. With help from the Smithsonian and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Ms. Pérez has been organizing conferences and workshops. At the top of the agenda: satellite telephones, generators and extra fuel tanks. Solar panels have been mentioned, and some art specialists are enthusiastic about creating emergency art storage vaults around the island, perhaps by converting buildings at abandoned but well-maintained military bases.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Summer is a great time to get in shape—you can enjoy the non-freezing weather, the longer days, and depending on your line of work, you might have more free time. But then a vacation happens, and your fitness goals take a back seat for a little while. Here’s how to minimize the damage. Plan Ahead If I’m following a structured exercise plan, I always build in some extra time to allow for vacation. For example, you can start a 12-week marathon plan a week or two early, so that when you take that week-long vacation you won’t have to skip a week of training. I also like to get some extra exercise in before I leave for vacation. I’ll use up my Classpass credits for the month before I take off, for example. If you’re planning a longer vacation, make sure you know what the effects will be. Even a few weeks won’t set you back too far on your strength training workouts, but you’ll lose cardio fitness more quickly. How long a vacation can you take before you start falling ""out of shape""? The answer can… Read more Read With that in mind, consider whether you want to work out—maybe just a little—while you’re on vacation. Stay Active on Vacation This is a personal choice. If you’re following a plan or staying in shape for a sport, taking time off can be more stressful than spending some of your vacation time working out. But if you can enjoy a true reprieve from obligations, it’s fine to leave your workout gear at home and pick things back up when you return. I like to find a middle ground, working out a little bit but not as much as I would back home. Here are some ways you can do a workout on vacation: Apps like Sworkit and Nike Training Club can give you no-equipment workouts, as short as you like. Bring equipment for hotel room workouts, like resistance bands or a suspension trainer. Bring your running shoes and explore your vacation spot. Take advantage of the active opportunities your vacation has to offer: swim, rent bicycles, go hiking, try surfing or paddleboarding, or get in a picturesque run or yoga session on the beach. Don’t underestimate the power of walking, either. You might end up taking far more steps than usual while you’re exploring a new city, and you can check your fitness tracker or phone to see if that’s true. Ramp Up When You Get Back Don’t expect everything to be the same upon your return. Your usual workout might feel a little harder, and that’s okay; you’ll be back up to speed soon. Just don’t fall into the trap of waiting until tomorrow because you’re still jet lagged, and then push it off to the weekend, and then oh why bother if you’ll be traveling again in a couple weeks… Get back into your routine, even if it’s just for a little while. Go easy on yourself the first few workouts, and figure out whether your fitness level has changed. Adjust accordingly, and keep going; you’ll be back up to speed before you know it.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A powerful earthquake struck Taiwan today, causing damage and a partially collapsed hotel building, sources report. The USGS reports that the magnitude 6.4 quake struck 21 kilometers (13 miles) north of the city of Hualien at 10:50 U.S. Eastern Time, at a shallow 9.5 kilometers (6 miles) below the surface. No tsunami warnings have been issued. The English-language Taiwan News and the BBC report that a number of buildings have collapsed in Hualien City, including a roof of a hotel. There are no reports of injuries yet. Residents as far away as Taipei (around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north) could feel tremors. This is the second powerful earthquake in the area in just a few days. A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck in nearly the same spot on Sunday (Monday Taiwan time). Taiwan’s location on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire means they’re no stranger to tremors. Many of the country’s buildings are built to withstand some shaking. With a quake of this size there’s always the potential for aftershocks. “We haven’t seen any large enough here to record yet,” John Bellini from the USGS told Gizmodo. “But don’t have the local instrumentation they would have.

Mark Kaufman,"Surging hurricane waters can throw around cars, boats, and houses like toys. Six years ago, Hurricane Sandy pushed storm surges into the streets of Staten Island, New York, wrecking entire neighborhoods along the small island off the coast of Manhattan. Homes are still being rebuilt, and some have simply been abandoned. Now, a more powerful tempest, Hurricane Florence, is set to hit the Carolinas late Thursday with winds reaching some 120 mph. SEE ALSO: Glowing snow is falling thousands of feet under the sea. Here's why. Regardless of exactly where it makes landfall, the storm's mass of winds will be destructive, forcing high surges of ocean water into coastlines, barrier islands, and neighborhoods. And the storm surge may be even worse due to the effects of human-caused climate change. The oceans off the southeastern coast of the U.S. have risen by about 9 inches in the last 100 years, boosted by some of the most visible manifestations of global warming, namely melting ice sheets and expanding oceans. NHC Advisory 46. Surge+tide levels ~ 10 ft above MSL near coast. Higher levels in converging estuaries that amplify the surge. Areas hardest hit by surge = central to N Onslow Bay &amp; western Pamlico Sound. Flooding from rainfall will exacerbate conditions throughout the area. pic.twitter.com/kuugOzWU4c — Dr. Rick Luettich (@RLuettich) September 11, 2018 In light of this reality, how much worse might these Florence-caused storm surges be? ""The simplest effect is that any storm surge is amplified by sea level rise,"" Jaap Nienhuis, a researcher at Florida State University's Coastal Morphodynamics Lab, said in an interview. ""When a major event like this occurs, it's riding on top of sea level rise,"" added Rick Luettich, the Director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an interview. Sea level rise can certainly make the difference in whether or not hurricane waters surmount coastal dunes and comes flooding into communities, said Luettich, but it’s not yet as influential as normal tides in determining how a destructive a storm’s surge may, or may not, be. Off the North Carolina coast, tides rise and fall between 5 and 6 feet each day — substantially more than current contributions from sea level rise. It's important to remember that the Storm Surge Watch issued at 5 AM this morning covers the potential for life-threatening surge through 48 hours. Impacts beyond 48 hours will be covered by subsequent updates. pic.twitter.com/0RaE51d5Ws — NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 11, 2018 “The timing of the surge with the tide is enormously important,” said Luettich. “We might dodge the bullet if it [Florence} were to hit at a low tide.” Yet, a looming problem with Florence is that the expansive storm is expected to stall over the region — as more storms are want to do as the Arctic warms. This means strong winds could have more opportunities to hit the high tide cycle, bringing the worst of the surges. “If it’s a real lingerer, then it will undoubtedly end up going through a high-tide cycle,” said Luettich. The future of storm surges Any storm surge is dependent on a variety of factors — the shape of the land, winds, tide, etc. — and sea level is just one component. But sea level rise is now accelerating as ice sheet melt hastens and the warming ocean expands. Eventually, sea level rise will be a critical influence. “The effect today is not nearly what it’s going to be in 100 years,” said Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University. “Down the road — when the sea has risen a meter — then it’s going to be a factor.” Until then, however, sea level rise will still be a growing, relentless problem. Melting ice and expanding oceans “are going to persistent into the future,” Ben Hamlington, NASA’s Sea Level Change Team Lead, said in an interview. “You know they’re going to contribute going forward.” A NASA graph showing sea level rise since 1993. Image: nasa And as the surges grow, development along the coast has largely eliminated the natural barriers that once weakened storm surges — things like marshes and dunes. “There’s not a buffer zone anymore,” said Nienhuis. “It’s been developed immensely,” he said, specifically citing the Southeastern coastline. To counteract the disappearance of natural barriers, we’ve built impressive fortifications like seawalls to combat rising seas or surges, said Nienhuis. But these efforts are counter-intuitive, he said. Rigid walls reflect wave energy, rather than absorbing it, sending that energy to other portions of the coast, and bringing erosion and damage elsewhere. Worth mentioning the continued population &amp; exposure growth in the potential path of #Florence. Many spots show robust change since 2000. Such rapid changes means many new residents have yet to experience hurricane conditions and/or severe inland flooding. pic.twitter.com/gdLmHZDhjr — Steve Bowen (@SteveBowenWx) September 10, 2018 Hurricane Florence promises to be such a powerful tempest that it’s wise — if not imperative — to leave the coasts, should the right combination of high tides, surging waters, and ever-growing sea level rise combine to hammer coastal communities. Willoughby says it would behoove coastal dwellers to take a trip well inland — perhaps using the storm as an excuse to really get out of town. “There’s a lot of people in the coastal Carolinas that should be thinking about visiting Aunt Mabel in St. Paul, Minnesota,” he said.","Surging hurricane waters can throw around cars, boats, and houses like toys.

NORMAN L. EISEN and NOAH BOOKBINDER,"There has never been a cabinet official who has survived as many scandals as Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency — until his resignation Thursday. Mr. Pruitt faced up to 19 separate investigations into his conduct reflecting a stunning degree of disregard for federal ethics, special-interest and procurement rules. The sheer volume of investigations would be comic but for the harm Mr. Pruitt wrought. Although the mess he leaves behind will linger, Mr. Pruitt’s departure offers good news for the nation — but ominous portents for President Trump. The full extent of Mr. Pruitt’s ethics lapses were incredible even to those normally supportive of the president — the $43,000 soundproof room, the multimillion-dollar security details. He used special hiring authority to bring on ex-lobbyists and give raises to key aides; worst of all, he reportedly retaliated against agency employees who raised concerns about his spending or management. Mr. Pruitt’s near-complete disregard for taxpayers’ trust made for a great deal of work not only for the many government investigators probing his behavior, but also for journalists and government watchdogs. Our group alone filed 20 legal matters, including litigation focusing on Mr. Pruitt’s and the E.P.A.’s failure to produce documents about his actions — or even to create them. There are too many reported instances in which agency employees were instructed not to document meetings or often avoided the creation of certain documents — a brazen dodge of the laws requiring both preservation and production of such materials so the people know what our government is doing, and why. Mr. Pruitt’s departure may be reason for celebration, but the mess that he created is substantial. He has turned the agency into an ethics and regulatory Superfund site that will take years to clean up. Thanks largely to him, the ethics system at the E.P.A. is broken and in need of repair. Why did no one with authority in the agency step in to stop him, or support whistle-blowers who tried to speak the truth? The involvement of political appointees in this process, and the apparent fear of retaliation instilled in officials across the agency, suggest to us that the current system is unable to ensure that federal ethics standards are upheld. Nor are all the investigations into Mr. Pruitt likely to vanish just because he has resigned; if his use of public office for private gain has caught the eye of federal prosecutors, there may be more coming.","The damage he caused to the E.P.A., the federal government and the Trump administration will linger for years.",2018-07-06T10:00:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Pruitt’s Resignation Is Just the Beginning,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/opinion/scott-pruitt-resignation-wheeler.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/06/opinion/05eisen/06eisen-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
WILLIAM WEBSTER,"Mr. Mueller’s service to country should not require defending. Leading the criminal division of the Department of Justice under George H. W. Bush, he shut down the illegal bank that laundered Osama bin Laden’s blood money. Under George W. Bush, after Sept. 11, Mr. Mueller led the F.B.I. through one of the most difficult times in our nation’s history. As mayor of New York, Mr. Giuliani himself stood with Mr. Mueller in the rubble of the World Trade Center. Mr. Mueller, a former Marine and decorated Vietnam combat veteran, was unanimously confirmed twice by the Senate to run the F.B.I. He’s a no-nonsense prosecutor with unquestioned integrity who calls balls and strikes devoid of ideology. Lest anyone wonder, he is of the same political party as the president and the majority in Congress. These are facts, and as John Adams once said, “Facts are stubborn things.” Most important, I worry where today’s rhetoric takes America. I’ve been very proud to serve as a United States attorney and as a federal judge. I saw firsthand how important it is that average Americans trust that justice is delivered with fairness and impartiality. America works when we can all put our faith in a common set of facts and know that committed public servants are determined to find them. Americans need to know that we are all still united in the pursuit of justice. We should not run down our own institutions, trivialize the impartial actions of our own grand juries, degrade our own justice system, or bully a free press for doing its job. We do so at our peril. The president should want this investigation to follow the facts where they lead and bring America the answers we all deserve. I’ve humbly served my country all of my adult life. The proudest title I’ve ever held is one Americans share: citizen. In times like these, citizens have a duty — to serve, and to speak up. Robert Mueller is doing his duty. We need to do ours. When I was sworn in as director of the F.B.I., I said we would “do the work the American people expect of us in the way the Constitution demands of us.” That means defending values like truth, justice and civility, because the idea of an America united by the rule of law is too important to lose.

The Northern Hemisphere could be fully fixed by the 2030s and Antarctica by the 2060s. A new United Nations report says it's an example of what global agreements can achieve. The ozone layer had been damaged by man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Image copyright Antartica What does the ozone layer do? The ozone layer starts about six miles above Earth. It is a colourless form of a specific type of oxygen molecule that protects Earth from ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer, eye problems and crop damage. How was it being damaged by humans? The chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) effectively began eating away at the ozone. CFCs were found in things like spray cans, fridges, foam insulation and air conditioners. As a result, in 1985 a gaping hole in the ozone over the South Pole was discovered. How bad did it get? At its worst in the late 1990s, about 10% of the upper ozone layer was depleted. But since 2000, it has begun to increase again by about 3% per decade, according to the UN report. How did things turn around? An international agreement called the Montreal Protocol made sure that businesses came up with replacements for these damaging products. 180 countries signed up to it. In signing the protocol, those countries agreed to phase out chemicals like CFCs. Image copyright Getty Images So it's all better now? No. It's not a complete success yet, according to the University of Colorado's Brian Toon, who was not part of the report. ""We are only at a point where recovery may have started,"" he said, pointing to some areas of the ozone that haven't repaired. There are also concerns that increasing emissions of some chlorine-containing chemicals could still slow down the progress made in healing the ozone layer. These are normally made in China to go in to paint stripping products and to create PVC and they are unregulated. But many experts are seeing it as a major step forward.

A nine-year project has been completed to restore the tomb of ancient Egypt's boy king, Tutankhamun, and address issues that threatened its survival.
Experts from the Getty Conservation Institute repaired scratches and abrasions on the wall paintings caused by visitors to the burial chamber.
The paintings were also affected by humidity, dust and carbon dioxide introduced by every person who entered.
A new ventilation system should reduce the need for future cleaning.
New barriers will restrict physical access to the paintings, while a new viewing platform, lighting and interpretive signage will also allow visitors to better see the tomb and understand its historical and cultural significance.

Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings, near Luxor, in 1922 by the British archaeologists Howard Carter and George Herbert, the fifth Earl of Carnarvon. 
It is the only tomb dating from the pharaonic New Kingdom (1550BC-1069BC) to have been found substantially intact, and its contents provided an insight into royal funerary practices, art and craftsmanship of the period.
Although most of the objects are now in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, visitors to the tomb can still see Tutankhamun's mummy, the outermost wooden coffin, and a quartzite sarcophagus, as well as the paintings depicting his life and death.

David Riggs,"More posts by this contributor As a relentless swarm of successful cyber attacks severely disrupt companies in every industry and require enormous expenditures to repair the damage, what typically gets lost in the shuffle is that some industries are victimized more than others — sometimes far more. The corporate victim that almost always grabs this dubious spotlight is the healthcare industry — the second-largest industry in the U.S. and one in which hacker meddling of operations not only costs lots of time, money and operational downtime, but threatens lives. The healthcare industry itself is partly responsible. In a seemingly admirable quest to maximize the quality of patient care, tunnel vision gives short shrift to other priorities, specifically cybersecurity. In aggregate, healthcare organizations on average spend only half as much on cybersecurity as other industries. For this and other reasons, such as the unusually high value of stolen patient records on the black market, attracting extra-large flocks of hackers, hospitals especially find themselves in a never-ending cyber war zone. FortiGuard Labs, a major security protection firm, reports that in 2017, healthcare saw an average of almost 32,000 intrusion attacks per day per organization as compared to more than 14,300 per organization in other industries. Some attacks are outright deadly. For example, MedStar Health, a huge, Maryland-based healthcare system, was severely incapacitated by a ransomware attack that made national headlines when, among other things, it threatened lives. Compromised by a well-known security vulnerability, MedStar Health was not only forced to shut down its email and vast records database, but was unable to provide radiation treatment to cancer patients for days. Such trouble typically starts when a doctor or other healthcare worker is persuaded to open an email sent by an attacker and click a link or attachment that downloads malware to his computer, a so-called “phishing” attack. The attacker can then use this software to gain access to the healthcare organization’s financial, administrative and clinical information systems. Attackers also can use the health network to spread into connected medical devices and equipment, such as ventilators, X-ray and MRI machines, medical lasers and even electric wheelchairs. Any medical device connected to a network is potentially at risk from being taken over and exploited by hackers. Hospitals and other healthcare providers must practice better cybersecurity hygiene. Compounding the threat are prevalent and vulnerable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, which integrate components and software from dozens of suppliers with minimal concern for security. Even individual patients can be targeted. A few years ago, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney’s doctors disabled his pacemaker’s capabilities because there were concerns about reports that attackers could hack such devices and kill the patient. It’s a dire situation that must be addressed. Hospitals and other healthcare providers must practice better cybersecurity hygiene. For starters, healthcare organizations must improve the speed and thoroughness of software patching and update processes. As much as possible, organizations also need to use threat intelligence and automation, as well as institute cyber-awareness training programs to protect against social media attacks and other attack vectors. As IoMT devices proliferate, more elaborate network segmentation and inspection is required. A segmented strategy enables organizations to institute checks and policies at various points of the network to control users, applications and data flow and to more quickly identify and isolate security threats. And on the network visibility front, healthcare organizations need more insight throughout the network, including the cloud. Hospitals and other healthcare organizations must do a better job of protecting patient’s records, as well. Since the transformation from paper records to digitized Electronic Health Records (EHRs), records are commonly updated and then sent by doctors to specialists in other hospitals. The problem is that hospitals are not banks, where financial information is locked up and not shared. This unencrypted information is vulnerable to profit-hungry hacker attacks. A solution to this is likely to be homomorphic encryption, an impressive technology that allows for the encryption of data-in-use and that has tremendous potential to lock down the most valuable medical information. Specifically, this technology can secure and protect sensitive medical records and personally identifiable information (PII), often the target of cyber thieves. Notwithstanding the fact that data-rich healthcare records are worth more than 10 times a credit card on the black market, this would shut down the most aggressive “data-focused” hackers. These improvements will not occur without substantial monetary investment and effort. It’s commendable that hospitals focus overwhelmingly on day-to-day quality of care, but times change, and they must look at their mission with a broader perspective. Because they fail to do so, hospitals typically pay up in almost non-stop ransomware attacks, minimizing the possibility of additional health threats while systems are down. Among the obstacles that hospitals face in pursuing the path toward change is intensifying merger and acquisition activity in the healthcare sector. IT integration challenges, including different medical technologies, create additional vulnerabilities, as does the need to share information between newly merged organizations. The reputation of and trust in healthcare organizations depends on their understanding of the true extent of threats and taking sufficient measures to guard against them. The healthcare industry has no choice but to improve its capabilities regarding security. Nothing short of our lives are at stake.","As a relentless swarm of successful cyber attacks severely disrupt companies in every industry and require enormous expenditures to repair the damage, what typically gets lost in the shuffle is that some industries are victimized more than others.",2018-08-09T20:00:20Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",The healthcare industry is in a world of cybersecurity hurt,http://techcrunch.com/2018/08/09/the-healthcare-industry-is-in-a-world-of-cybersecurity-hurt/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/healthlaptop.jpg?w=566,techcrunch,TechCrunch,damage,0
EMILY KELLY,"When I first met him in 2007, Rob had this gentle, endearing way about him that caught me off guard. I had never watched a full game of football in my life, but still believed the stereotypes: Players were tough and abrasive. But he was neither. I had never met a man who was so sensitive and tenderhearted. I loved that he wasn’t afraid to be vulnerable and to show tears. When we married in 2009, I already knew he was an amazing father. He could play dollhouse with my stepdaughter for hours without a hint of boredom. This continued when we had two children of our own. When our son was born and I was focused on taking care of a baby, he would bathe the girls, brush and blow-dry their (tangled!) hair. He would put the girls to bed every night. Afterward he would wash the dishes. He brought me coffee in bed each morning. I was spoiled rotten. But he had always had trouble sleeping, and he was prone to mood swings and depression since I’d known him. Things got worrisome, so in 2010 I arranged for him to be evaluated by neurologists to apply for disability benefits. We traveled from Ohio, where we were living at the time, to North Carolina for full cognitive evaluations and testing. There were seemingly endless amounts of paperwork and record keeping. I was right to be concerned. Over time, I had started to notice changes. But this was different. And things became increasingly frightening. He lost weight. It seemed like one day, out of the blue, he stopped being hungry. And often he would forget to eat. I’d find full bowls of cereal forgotten around the house, on bookshelves or the fireplace mantel. The more friends and family commented on his gaunt frame, the more panicked I became. By 2016, he had shrunk to 157 pounds. That’s right, my 6-foot-2 football-player husband weighed 157 pounds (down from around 200 when he was in the N.F.L.). People were visibly shocked when we told them he had played the game professionally. Besides damage resulting from football-related concussions, my husband has never had a diagnosed brain injury. He’s never been in a car accident or fallen off a roof. He never did steroids and, after struggling with alcohol abuse for about six years, off and on, after retirement, hasn’t had a drink in eight years. And he’s only 43. When you live with someone with brain damage, you become highly attuned to your environment and develop an intimate relationship with your senses and intuition. Your hearing becomes excellent, almost unbearably keen, like a movie character who develops supernatural abilities overnight. Rob has dramatic mood swings and I always have to be in tune with early signs of his agitation. I try to protect him from stress so he won’t be overwhelmed. It’s exhausting. Every argument we had ended with me thinking: “This isn’t normal. This is not what couples fight about. Something’s wrong.” Our fights went in bizarre circles and were never resolved. He would be irrationally upset about one thing but would quickly lose track and begin rambling about something that had no connection to the topic at hand. And the arguments were always the same. It was as if our lives were on a loop, like some song that’s been left on repeat for years. That sort of repetition has a tremendous ability to make you feel that you’re going insane. And maybe, you wonder, you are. Photo Rob Kelly in 1998, playing with the New Orleans Saints. Credit Vincent Laforet/Getty Images He was losing touch with reality and was increasingly paranoid. The first time he accused me of stealing loose change from his nightstand I was speechless. And when I told him how illogical it would be for me to do such a thing, he looked at me with even more suspicion. But his paranoia didn’t end there. It would leave me with a heaviness in my chest that made me sob without warning. He went from being a devoted and loving father and husband to someone who felt like a ghost in our home. For a couple of months one winter he was so depressed and detached, he couldn’t muster up the energy to speak. My questions went unanswered until I simply stopped asking them. The silence was unnerving. So we were relieved when, in January 2013, we were told that the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle N.F.L. player retirement plan and supplemental disability plan had awarded him total and permanent disability benefits. His benefits were listed as “degenerative,” which establishes that his “disability arises out of league football activities” and had manifested within 15 years of his last season. He is entitled to monthly payments for the rest of his life. (These payments are separate from the estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion-related lawsuits with thousands of retired players to which we have registered.) The examining clinician found that “repeated concussion is very likely to have caused Mr. Kelly’s neuropsychological dysfunction,” and also that his prior alcohol abuse may have been a factor. But he has not had a single drop of alcohol for eight years, and his condition continues to deteriorate. After years of little to no sleep, he alternated between sleeping either three hours a night or 20. I’d wake up to find every blind and curtain in the house closed and Rob sitting on the sofa with a blank expression on his face. He no longer felt comfortable driving, refused to leave the house and cut off contact with everyone. Specific details about how he wanted his funeral to be, and his demand that he be cremated, were brought up with excruciating frequency. One particularly dark time, he went five days without eating anything; he drank only water and a few swigs of chocolate milk. He was suffering deeply and barely surviving. My love and affection seemed to offer no comfort or solace. I felt helpless. It wasn’t until I joined a private Facebook group of more than 2,400 women, all connected in some way to current or former N.F.L. players, that I realized I wasn’t alone. Our stories are eerily similar, our husbands’ symptoms almost identical: the bizarre behavior I had tried to ignore; the obsessive laundering of old clothes — our washing machine ran from morning till night. It was comforting and terrifying all at the same time. Why did so many of us see the same strange behaviors? “Our neurologist said they do it to calm their brains,” one friend told me. Symptoms consistent with C.T.E. are a recurring topic in the Facebook group. They include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression and anxiety. These problems become apparent sometimes years or even decades after a player hangs up his helmet. One woman may write a post, desperate and afraid of the man her husband is becoming — the rage, mood swings, depression, memory loss. A man so drastically different from the one she once knew. Hundreds of comments will follow, woman after woman confirming that she is going through the exact same thing. While the symptoms and behaviors are telling, C.T.E. can be conclusively diagnosed only posthumously, because it requires the close examination of brain tissue. But many of us, including me, are convinced our husbands suffer from the disease. We try to comfort one another with the same words: “Just know you’re not alone.” I don’t think the public has any idea how widespread this problem truly is. There are likely to be hundreds of wives and partners of football players, maybe more, who live a life like mine. Sadly, there is a feeling of shame among those affected, in both the men and their families. Rob and I hope that, in telling this story, we may help other families. But who these men have become is not who they are, and I write that with conviction. The symptoms they display are beyond their control and occur through no fault of their own. These men chose football, but they didn’t choose brain damage. I used to read all the articles about C.T.E., all the stories about football players committing suicide. I’d skim the comments to see remarks like: “They know what they signed up for” and “Of course football is bad for the brain, everyone knows that.” But when all those big hits happened and the fans cheered, did they cheer in spite of knowing a man just greatly increased his risk for dementia? Was anyone worried about an A.L.S. diagnosis or a C.T.E.-related suicide at 40 after their favorite player suffered repeated blows to the head on the field? No, they cheered and they celebrated because they didn’t know. And neither did we. Emily Kelly lives in Boulder, Colo.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"In at least 14 countries, American troops are fighting extremist groups that are professed enemies of the United States or are connected, sometimes quite tenuously, to such militants. The Houthis pose no such threat to the United States. But they are backed by Iran, so the commandos’ deployment increases the risk that the United States could come into direct conflict with that country, a target of increasing ire from the administration, the Saudis and Israelis. Such significant military decisions require public debate to force presidents and their generals to justify their decisions and be held accountable for the consequences. But checks and balances have eroded since Sept. 11, 2001, as ordinary Americans became indifferent to the country’s endless wars against terrorists and Congress largely abdicated its constitutional role to share responsibility with the president for sending troops into battle. The United States initially deployed troops to Yemen to fight Al Qaeda’s forces there, under post-Sept. 11 congressional authorization measures. But Congress never specifically approved military involvement in the Saudi-Houthi civil war. President Trump, who has broadened the authority of commanders to make some war-fighting decisions independent of the White House, rarely speaks about military operations publicly and has not articulated an overarching strategy for what the worldwide antiterrorism campaign is intended to achieve and how long it will last. The Saudis’ brutal campaign in Yemen has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with at least eight million people on the brink of famine, one million suspected of being infected with cholera and two million displaced from their homes. Legal and human rights experts say the killing of thousands of civilians and the humanitarian aid deprivations, most blamed on Saudi Arabia, could be war crimes in which the United States would be complicit.",Yemenis inspecting the damage from airstrikes in the city of Saada in January.,2018-05-03T23:19:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Are American Troops in the Yemen War?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/opinion/american-troops-yemen.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/opinion/04yemenWeb/04yemenWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations Iran has asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to lift the sanctions imposed by the US after it abandoned the deal on Tehran's nuclear programme. Iranian lawyer Mohsen Mohebi said the US aimed to damage Iran's economy ""as severely as possible"" and had violated a little-known 1955 friendship treaty. The US is expected to argue that the sanctions do not breach the treaty. Iran's economy has slumped since US President Donald Trump ordered that the sanctions be reinstated in May. The Iranian currency, the rial, has lost half its value against the dollar, the monthly inflation rate has risen to 10.2%, and unemployment stands at 12.5%. On Sunday, Iran's parliament voted to dismiss Finance Minister Masoud Karbasian over his failure to address the country's economic woes. Why did the US abandon the nuclear deal? The 2015 accord between six world powers and Iran saw the Islamic Republic limit its controversial nuclear activities in return for relief from international sanctions. But Mr Trump said the deal ""failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to an Iranian nuclear bomb"" and did not deal with Tehran's ""malign activities, including its ballistic missile programme and its support for terrorism"". Media caption What is the Iran nuclear deal? In an attempt to compel Iran to agree to a new accord the president reinstated sanctions earlier this month that targeted the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be reimposed on Iran's oil and shipping sectors as well as its central bank. The other parties to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - have criticised Mr Trump's decision and pledged to abide by their commitments under the existing deal. But many major firms have already pulled out of Iran. What is Iran arguing at the ICJ? The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and settles legal disputes between member states. Last month, Iranian lawyers filed a case before the court that called on its judges to order the US to suspend its sanctions pending a definitive ruling - something that could take years. The lawyers argued that the sanctions violated the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights between Iran and the US, which grants the ICJ jurisdiction over disputes. Media caption US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? They also said the reasons cited by President Trump for reimposing the sanctions were unfounded because the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had repeatedly confirmed that Iran was complying with the terms of the nuclear deal. ""The US is publicly propagating a policy intended to damage as severely as possible Iran's economy and Iranian national companies, and therefore inevitably Iranian nationals,"" Mr Mohebi told the court on Monday. ""This policy is nothing but naked economic aggression against my country."" How has the US responded? The US has vowed to ""vigorously defend"" itself against Iran's ""baseless"" lawsuit. It is expected to argue on Tuesday that the ICJ should not have jurisdiction in the dispute, and that Iran's assertions fall outside the bounds of the treaty. Image copyright AFP Image caption US lawyers led by Jennifer Newstead (2nd R) are due to address the court on Tuesday The ICJ has ruled previously that the treaty is valid even though it was signed before the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, which saw the US-backed Shah overthrown and heralded four decades of hostility between the two countries. The oral hearings will last for four days and a decision on Iran's request for a provisional injunction is expected within a month.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"More than 90 people have been killed and hundreds injured by an earthquake which hit the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday. Many in Lombok's main city of Mataram were sent running from their homes and onto the streets as the 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit the island. The extent of the damage became clear on Monday, with houses, mosques and schools among the thousands of buildings destroyed. Many residents fled their homes, some carrying along the belongings they were able to salvage. Some worshippers might still be trapped inside collapsed mosques, the head of North Lombok district told AFP. Patients were tended to in makeshift wards set up under tents after hospital buildings were also damaged. The quake was also felt in the nearby resort island of Bali, where makeshift emergency tents were also set up to treat patients. On Gili Air, one of three islands that make up the Gili islands off the north-west coast of Lombok, crowds of tourists wait as they prepare to be evacuated. About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists have already been evacuated in boats from the Gili islands, according to a spokesman. There were long lines at Lombok's airport, which is still operating, as tourists scrambled to leave. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the seismically active Ring of Fire.

JORGE G. CASTAÑEDA,"Next, the new president will have to ensure that current sanctions on Mexican steel and aluminum exports are removed and that the U.S.M.C.A. is something that the United States Congress will actually approve. With a new Democratic majority in the House, this will be a task more arduous than many believe. As happened 25 years ago, when President Bill Clinton had to struggle with his own party to ratify Nafta, this time practically every Democratic vote in the House sought by Mr. Trump will require a Mexican concession, in annexes or side letters, or on separate issues. Then, Mr. López Obrador may decide to go forward with his bold and praiseworthy ideas of legalizing the recreational use of marijuana and poppy cultivation to produce painkillers in Mexico. The country imports legal morphine in large quantities and exports illegal heroin. If he proceeds this way, however, he may face serious reprisals by an American administration concerned about the opioid crisis and drugs in general. Finally, Mr. López Obradors sympathy for the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, given the United States animosity toward them, will add more tensions to the relationship. If AMLO and his team had any experience in handling these matters, or if Mr. Trump showed any inclination to back off on trade, immigration and drugs with Mexico, all of these disagreements could be managed, as they have been in the past. Neither of these two conditions exists today. As long as nothing occurs that threatens Mexican economic stability, this state of affairs is regrettable but tolerable. But if a crisis, like Mexicos economic and financial meltdown in 1994-95, were to arise, neither the American president nor Mr. López Obrador is well suited to confront it. Mr. Trumps constant manipulation of immigration issues for domestic politics and Mr. López Obradors penchant for impetuous and poorly thought through decisions work against the type of crisis management that both governments produced a quarter of a century ago. Misguided policies like the cancellation of a new Mexico City airport by AMLO via popular referendum; the authoritarian drift seen in the militarization of Mexican public safety and law enforcement; the sending of American troops to the common border by Mr. Trump, and his insistence on building a wall along the border and recklessly imposing trade sanctions all show just how trigger-happy both leaders can be. The Mexican economy has collapsed at least four times over the past 40 years. It can happen to any country. But not all countries can prevent collapse, or fix it. Mr. López Obrador and Mr. Trump are on their own, together and terribly mismatched. Hoping that everything will work out is perfectly understandable, and perfectly naïve. Troubled times, indeed.

RUCHIR SHARMA,"At a time when finance increasingly dominates the global economy, America’s influence as a financial superpower is as great as ever. Central banks around the world are always looking for a safe place to park their money, and they usually buy United States assets, typically Treasury bills, which show up as dollars in their foreign exchange reserves. Since 1980, the dollar’s share of foreign exchange reserves has held roughly steady at around 66 percent. This is in part the world’s way of saying it not only trusts the United States to pay its debts but also trusts it more than Europe, Japan and especially China. Serious money does not equate America with Mr. Trump, and those obsessed with American decline ignore the state of its rivals. The euro was introduced 19 years ago, ambitious to become a reserve currency, but its youth and the recurring fears of a eurozone breakup have limited the world’s willingness to trust it. Aging Japan’s long stagnation acts as a permanent cap on the yen’s popularity. And outsiders remain even more wary of the renminbi, owing both to China’s debt troubles and the standing threat that Communist rulers pose to free flows of capital. On the other hand, confidence in the dollar reflects longstanding faith in American financial and political institutions and effectively ignores both the recent advent of Mr. Trump, who as a candidate threatened to reduce United States debt payments, and the dysfunction in his White House. When businesses in two countries — say, India and Argentina — want to conduct a deal, they almost always arrange payment not in rupees or pesos but in dollars. Everyone wants to hold the world’s most trusted and liquid currency. Nearly 90 percent of bank-financed international transactions are conducted in dollars, a share that is close to all-time highs. The world is on a dollar standard, and in some ways the reach of the dollar is expanding. When individuals and companies borrow from lenders in another country, they increasingly borrow in dollars, which now account for 75 percent of these global flows, up from 60 percent just before the global financial crisis in 2008. Even though the crisis began that year in the United States, American banks dominate global finance more now than they did before the crisis — in part because debt troubles have dogged banks in Europe, Japan and China even more persistently. The share of countries that use the dollar as their main “anchor” — the currency against which they measure and stabilize the value of their own currency — has risen to 60 percent today from about 30 percent in 1950 and 50 percent in 1980. And those countries collectively account for some 70 percent of the global gross domestic product. In other words, most of the world chooses to live in a dollar bloc. Critically, there is no sign that the dollar’s status on any of these measures — as a reserve, an anchor or the favored currency for cross-border transactions and loans — has declined since Mr. Trump took office. In a dollar world, most countries are happiest when the dominant currency is cheap and plentiful. A strong dollar raises the cost of borrowing, which slows global economic growth and has often triggered debt crises in the emerging world. A weak dollar has the opposite effect, which is why the weakening of the dollar this year offers more evidence of its dominance: Partly as a result, the world is enjoying an unusually broad recovery encompassing every major economy. The global embrace of the dollar matters not only as a sign of trust. Having the world’s favorite reserve currency is a practical advantage, lowering borrowing costs and boosting G.D.P. growth in America, while symbolizing great power status. Not surprisingly, then, China in particular has been eager to challenge the dollar’s supremacy. Instead, the renminbi has gained no ground as a reserve currency and probably won’t as long as China’s financial markets remain largely closed, underdeveloped and subject to government meddling. One reason foreigners like to hold the dollar is that they know they will never get stuck with it, thanks to the vast, open and highly liquid American stock and bond markets. Many observers nonetheless assume that with China rising as an economic power, financial clout will follow. Perhaps, but the United States surpassed Britain as the world’s largest economy in the late 19th century, and the dollar did not fully displace British sterling as the leading reserve currency until after the world wars, which left British finances shattered. That doesn’t mean it will take World War III to end the dollar’s reign, but it will take time and a shock bigger than one unpredictable president. History also suggests that economic size alone will not be enough to propel China to financial superpower status. From 1450 through the late 1700s, the leading reserve currency was held by smaller countries — first Portugal, followed by Spain, the Netherlands and France. These nations were all major trading and military powers with credible financial systems, but not one was the world’s largest economy. Throughout those centuries, the leading economy was primarily China. It never gained the advantages of having the leading reserve currency because, then as now, its financial system lacked credibility. No one doubts that China poses a growing military and economic challenge to the United States. But Mr. Trump’s critics may be overstating both the scope and inevitability of American decline and the role one president can play in advancing it. To identify which nation the world really trusts in the long term, follow the money. And money still flows downhill to the dollar — arguably the vote of confidence in America that matters most.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Yesterday, the National Science Foundation announced that they’ll keep the storied Arecibo telescope running in the wake of the Hurricane Maria damage. The NSF concluded that the best way forward was to collaborate with “new stakeholders” who will both use and maintain the facility, according to the Record of Decision. There could be some potential demolitions of buildings on the site, but funding will continue. “This is great news,” said Abel Mendez, planetary astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo. “We hope to continue our science at the observatory.” The iconic Arecibo telescope has been struggling financially for many years now. September’s devastating strike from Hurricane Maria could have been the last straw, but the telescope received its repairs and began limited observations once again only a week later. The facility is still running on diesel generators and there’s millions more dollars of fixes required, according to a Nature report. Under this decision, the NSF will decrease funding from $8.2 to $2 million annually over the next five years as it looks for new partners, writes Nature. Arecibo is now the second largest single-dish filled telescope behind the FAST telescope in China, but it can still make observations of rotating neutron stars (a.k.a. pulsars), exoplanets, and even assist with gravitational wave astronomy. And having a second dish is important—scientists feel much more confident about discoveries when two different experiments independently spot the same thing.

JIM TANKERSLEY and ANA SWANSON,"Border activity makes up a relatively larger share of Mexicos economy than the United States, meaning Mexico would most likely have more economic damage from a border closing, Mr. Zandi said.
But that does not mean the United States would be in a winning position. Communities across the country would probably see supply chain disruptions, product shortages, seizures in stock and bond markets and a plunge in already-fragile business confidence, Mr. Zandi said. The disruption would be especially sharp in the border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, which all have Mexico as their No. 1 export market.
Any closure could have far-ranging implications for a wide range of industries including automotive, electronics and apparel that source small components and deliver their products on a just-in-time basis on both sides of the border.
It could also be devastating for the agriculture industry. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, American farmers have moved toward specializing in corn, soybeans, chicken, dairy, pork and beef to supply to Mexico, while Mexican farmers have specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables to send to the United States. Any delays in deliveries of these products could lead to near immediate price hikes and empty supermarket shelves, which would hit low-income Mexicans and Americans the hardest.
Christin Fernandez, the vice president for communications at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that slowing or halting screenings at major ports near the border would lead to product delays and potentially higher shipping costs.
The entire retail ecosystem is sustained on the expectation that Americas retailers can provide consumers with the goods they want and need, when they need it, at the best possible prices, Ms. Fernandez said. If our suppliers are feeling the pain, retailers will feel the pain, and, ultimately, it is consumers that will bear the burden.
Stock markets do not appear to be pricing in any risk of a border closure. The S&amp;P 500 was essentially unchanged on Tuesday, and it remains near a six-month high.","“Security is more important to me than trade,” the president declared, while advisers sought to limit any economic damage from the move.",2019-04-02T23:55:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Trump Vows to Close Border, Even if It Hurts the Economy",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/us/politics/trump-mexico-border-economy.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/02/business/02DC-BORDER-01/02DC-BORDER-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0

EMMANUEL AKINWOTU and JINA MOORE,"Mr. Trump’s latest comments drew criticism from many quarters in the continent. The African Union told The Associated Press that Mr. Trump’s statement “ flies in the face of all accepted behavior and practice.” On Twitter, President Macky Sall of Senegal wrote: “I am shocked by President Trump’s comments on Haiti and Africa. I reject them and condemn them vigorously. Africa and black people deserve the respect and consideration of all.” Je suis choqué par les propos du Président Trump sur Haïti et sur l'Afrique. Je les rejette et les condamne vigoureusement. L'Afrique et la race noire mérite le respect et la considération de tous. MS — Macky SALL (@Macky_Sall) Jan. 12, 2018 Botswana’s government issued a statement calling the president’s remark “highly irresponsible, reprehensible and racist.” The statement added: “The government of Botswana is wondering why President Trump must use this descriptor and derogatory word when talking about countries with whom the U.S. has had cordial and mutually beneficial bilateral relations for so many years.” Across social media on Friday, Africans shared pictures of beautiful beaches, tree-lined streets and glamorous tourist resorts captioned with the insult. Online and offline, in cafes and shops across the continent, some wondered why the United States had spent millions of dollars to build massive embassies in countries which Mr. Trump held in such low esteem. Others speculated that if Mr. Trump visited their countries, he might revise his assumptions. Still others said that Mr. Trump may have had a point, citing the endemic corruption, public health challenges and poverty in many African nations. “That’s why we’re being termed a shithole,” Andrew Mataso, a 55-year-old businessman, said on a busy street in Nairobi, Kenya. Vincent Omondi, who lives in a sprawling working-class neighborhood of Kibera, in Nairobi, pointed out that America had a long relationship with people from the countries Mr. Trump criticized. “The USA,” he wrote in a Facebook message, “was partly built by slaves from the ‘shithole’ countries.” But Mr. Omondi said poverty and economic dysfunction across Africa lent support to Mr. Trump’s point. “Do I care?” Mr. Omondi said. “Not really, but such statement coming from the leader of the ‘free world’ should serve as a wake up call for Africans to build Africa.” Alpha Bah, a 24-year-old shop owner in Dakar, Senegal, agreed that the president’s description was correct. If it wasn’t, he said, thousands of migrants wouldn’t risk their lives trying to flee to Europe. “Nobody wants to be in a shithole,” he said. Oyenka Nwenze, a 26-year-old broadcaster, was stocking up on cooking ingredients for the weekend at a supermarket inside the Silverbird shopping mall in Abuja, Nigeria, an expansive retail space that includes a cinema, several restaurants and boutiques. He called Mr. Trump racist. “For someone in that position he should know better, and he doesn’t even try, he isn’t attempting to expand his knowledge base,” Mr. Nwenze said. “In Africa we are normal human beings.” Dante Ndoma-Egba, 34, runs The Cube, a hipster hangout in Abuja that sells books by Nigerian authors and coffee from Nigerian-grown beans. He called Mr. Trump “a voice of thinking Americans because he was elected, is backed by a majority of legislators.” Like anywhere, Nigeria isn’t perfect, he said, calling it “a mixed bag of impoverishment, poor governance and beauty.” “A lot of what he says comes from ignorance,” Mr. Ndoma-Egba said. “The reality is that immigration is a part of Western life, it’s been happening and will continue to happen, so speaking in this way is very damaging.” Some in the African diaspora said Mr. Trump’s comments reflected common negative stereotypes about their homeland. “We need to get over the misconception that everyone from a poor African country has been saved by staying in the U.S.,” said Moses Khisa, a Ugandan political scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He added: “I could well resign tomorrow and take up a position at Makerere University,” a pre-eminent institution in Uganda. Mr. Trump’s State Department appears to have gone into damage-repair mode. Without directly referring to the contentious statement, the State Department’s main Africa account said on Twitter that “the United States will continue to robustly, enthusiastically and forcefully engage in Africa, promoting this vital relationship, and to listen and build on the trust and views we share with our African partners.” The tweet was framed as a comment on a meeting of African ministers that the department hosted in November. Not everyone accepted that gesture, and some people feared speaking in opposition to what they perceived as American policy. In Dakar, diners at a beachside restaurant that serves Moscow mules and mojitos declined to express their views about Mr. Trump, fearing they might be denied visas to visit the United States. Babacar Faye, a tailor in Dakar, had tuned his radio to another station Friday morning when discussion of Mr. Trump’s comments was aired. His remarks were not surprising, Mr. Faye said. “White people in general don’t like black people,” he said. “They just pretend to like us but they don’t.” Nanjala Nyabola, a Kenyan writer who graduated from Harvard Law School and spent time documenting the anti-pipeline protests at the Standing Rock reservation in South Dakota, said Mr. Trump’s comment reminded her of the sadder sides of the United States. “I personally can’t help but remember articles about hookworm in Alabama, and H.I.V./AIDS in Washington, D.C.,” she said, from her home in Nairobi. “Then I recall my time in Standing Rock, and I think that we are all in a giant shithole but some of us are looking at the stars.” But Phoebe Mutetsi, also in Kigali, Rwanda, said she wasn’t falling for it. “Trump is a troll,” she said. “He is trolling the world. Don’t feed the troll.” Emmanuel Akinwotu reported from Abuja, and Dionne Searcey from London. Jaime Yaya Barry contributed reporting from Dakar, Senegal, Jina Moore from London and Lenny Ruvaga from Nairobi, Kenya.

ALAN HENRY,"You probably already know that you should keep supplies and an emergency kit on hand for the most common types of emergencies your community may face, but those kits are designed to be helpful only for the first hours or days — ideally just long enough for you to get help or for help to get to you. Even if you have a sizable stockpile of supplies, you’re going to need help from other people sooner rather than later. Mr. Stripling said that most search and rescue after a disaster is done by people in their communities, long before professionals arrive. However, a lot of the support structures that foster the sense of community that led people to look out for one another have degraded, Mr. Stripling said, and it’s up to individuals to bring them back to life. “We have fewer stores and more social media addicts — and that’s tough from a preparedness standpoint since disasters are inherently geographical,” he said. “In a disaster, more people will survive if your neighborhood is resilient — tightly connected, with lots of knowledge about who lives there and lots of strong institutions. ” Photo Credit Ángel Franco/The New York Times Before you go knocking on doors however, make a plan — not about how you’ll persuade your neighbors exactly, but what you’ll actually ask of them. How to get started Instead of going door-to-door to rally neighbors, you’ll find more success if you piggyback on existing institutions to organize people in times of need, Mr. Stripling said. “Disaster research shows that tight-knit communities with strong, locally driven organizations respond better in disaster situations,” he said. “That means that any work you do to build community, from strengthening a P.T.A. to starting a local business that serves as a community hub, will naturally help your neighborhood be better prepared. “That’s a key point to focus on. These civic institutions or schools or churches not only enrich our lives day to day, they help to save our lives when disaster strikes. And many of them are not as strong as they used to be.” In short, don’t reinvent the wheel. There’s little need to build something you’ll then have to persuade people to come to when you could get involved with a local P.T.A., sports team, church, book club or neighborhood watch. Mr. Stripling even suggested getting involved with a local coffee shop, day care, or just a group of friends you get drinks with periodically if you can’t find a community group to join. Your next step is to put disaster prep on the agenda of the group you’ve connected with. That doesn’t mean taking over or dragging out a stodgy set of doom-and-gloom talking points. Try to have fun, Mr. Stripling said. “You can schedule a disaster-focused P.T.A. meeting, or a bar trivia night about disasters. Honestly, people do that!” he said. “Your local coffee shop could host a Godzilla Awareness Party. Your small group can help bring people in using an ‘each one reach one’ approach around the neighborhood — and most localities have emergency management teams that would be thrilled to speak at an event like that.” Photo Credit Bryan Oller/Associated Press What to include in your community disaster plan Once you have a group of interested people and a venue to get everyone talking, it’s time to start thinking about what your community’s plan will include. That said, don’t get caught up in the specifics. The point is to get people aware of the possible disasters your community will face, and get them ready and willing to help and take care of one another in a crisis. “The most important thing to understand is that planning for these sorts of things is about the process, not any final document,” Mr. Stripling explained. “Because disasters are chaotic, you’re probably not going to have a lot of reading time, right? So, it’s important to get your group ready to improvise. Building your group into a team that can react to different types of events is more important than being ready to run any one evacuation plan.” He outlined three major components of a good community disaster prep plan: 1. Make sure everyone has more than one way to reach one another. Cellphone numbers are great, but remember that in an emergency, cellular networks will probably be overloaded. If you have a signal but can’t place a mobile call, text messages and walkie-talkie apps use far less mobile data and are more likely to get through. In every case, however, old-fashioned landlines are ideal, since they can be used without power. Mr. Stripling also suggested that getting into amateur or HAM radio is helpful, especially for times when traditional communication networks are down. Finally, don’t forget old-fashioned rendezvous points. If you have no communications at all, it’s critical to have a spot everyone knows to meet up just to make sure everyone is safe. 2. Learn about the hazards and most likely disasters in your area. Not every region is prone to the same types of disasters. If you live on the coast, make sure you talk about plans for coastal storms and flooding. If you live in the Midwest, make sure you’re all on the same page about tornadoes and catastrophic storms. Western state residents may want to talk about mudslides and wildfires. Everyone should probably discuss things like terrorism or other man-made disasters. In every case, people respond better in an emergency if they’ve talked about possible threats before they occur. “It’s also incredibly important to understand that disasters don’t impact people equally — they tend to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities,” Mr. Stripling said. “So you need to understand the vulnerabilities in your neighborhood — things like poverty, housing discrimination or unequal transportation access — since these elements often point to where the worst consequences will occur.” 3. Understand your neighborhood and how your neighbors can help one another. If everyone is going to rely on one another, think about what is convenient and makes sense for each person. “Maybe one neighbor runs a store and could help stock food supplies for the whole team, and another has a vacation home or relative’s house that could serve as a rendezvous point,” Mr. Stripling said. “The neighbor who lives within walking distance of the school could be in charge of kid pickup if transportation goes down. Or someone owns an S.U.V. or boat that could help evacuation procedures. Everyone brings something to the table — and the more diversity your team has, the more powerful it will be.” Ideally, everyone in your community will be willing to pitch in with their own unique skills, abilities and perspectives to help everyone stay safe and protected. Additionally, while everyone should pool resources in a way that makes sense, you should all be willing to back one another up, even if it doesn’t seem like a particular role is your best fit. If the neighbor responsible for kid pickup is out of town when a blizzard hits, someone else should be ready to step in. Best of all, the closer and more tight knit you are before a disaster, the more you’ll be willing to cover the gaps when one happens. Be ready before help arrives Most of us are taught that in an emergency, first responders like police officers, emergency medical personnel and firefighters will be the first ones to get there and help victims. In reality, bystanders and neighbors are usually first — and in the best position to help save lives — especially after a disaster significant enough that it may take time for those emergency workers to arrive. Mr. Stripling suggested reading the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s “ Until Help Arrives ” program and sharing it with your community group. Similarly, he pointed to the New York City Health Department’s Bystander Training Course as another useful resource even for people who don’t live in New York. Keep in mind that most disasters are much worse for people who are already the most at risk. For example, elderly neighbors, people who live alone, or people with disabilities that make evacuation difficult. Make sure people in your group know who in the area may need a helping hand if disaster strikes, and check in on them or be ready to help them evacuate. Mr. Stripling also noted that this extends beyond storms, earthquakes or catastrophic events. Consider that extreme heat waves or cold snaps claim more lives every year than many other “traditional” disasters, and plan to take care of one another accordingly.

 The damages are not covered by Lin Chin-hsiang's car insurance policy
A young Taiwanese man who dozed off in his car and crashed into three Ferraris got the shock of his life when he was told it would cost 12 million Taiwan dollars ($390,000; £310,000) to pay for the repairs.
But a public outpouring of support and donations to help him pay what at first seemed an insurmountable sum has stunned the 20 year old. 
Lin Chin-hsiang's predicament has gripped Taiwan and the response from the public reflects growing dissatisfaction with the island's widening wealth gap, which has left many low-income families like Mr Lin's struggling to make ends meet.
The young man from a single parent family dropped out of college earlier this year to help his mother at the family's shop that sells incense and gold paper money (burned during worship) in New Taipei City. His father died from illness a few years ago.
He works nightshifts at a barbecue restaurant and, after finishing at 03:00 on Sunday, he returned home to find his mum not feeling well, and so decided to help her deliver an order to a nearby temple in time for a ceremony.
It was around 05:40 in the morning when, exhausted from working all night, he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the Ferraris. 
They were among four luxury cars that belonged to a group of friends who were meeting up before a scenic drive. The owners were standing near the vehicles and no-one was injured.

 Lin Chin-hsiang was helping his mother with an early morning delivery after an overnight shift at a restaurant
""I thought: 'Oh no, I've gotten myself into a big mess.' I was really worried about bringing trouble to my mother and having to pay so much money. I wanted to help her, but made things worse"" Mr Lin told the BBC on Wednesday.
Police said he had not been drinking alcohol and had a clean driving record.
Local media contacted luxury car dealerships and repair shops to calculate that the repair bill would be 12 million Taiwan dollars. 
What happened next was something Mr Lin and his family, trying to figure out how they could pay such a huge sum, had not expected.
Dozens of people called the local police station handling the accident and offered to donate money to help pay Mr Lin's repair bill or his legal fees. Some of them even turned up at the family's shop - a shack made of sheet metal, which also serves as their home. 
""I'm really grateful to everyone who has offered to help and who has come here to encourage me. Some people even drove up from central Taiwan and asked me where they can donate money. Some spent a long time looking for our shop, some are not in good situation, but they still gave money,"" he said, sounding overwhelmed by what has happened.
""Some people gave 5,000 ($160) or 10,000. They just said 'In the future, you just have to help society.'""

 The Ferrari owners were going on a scenic drive together
The local authorities have asked people who want to help Mr Lin to direct their funds to an official account.
More than 100 donations have been made - the smallest equal to about $4 and the largest almost $6,500. In total 740,000 Taiwan dollars ($24,000) have already been raised.
The college Mr Lin dropped out of has meanwhile invited him to return. He was in his last year of middle school when his father died. He has an older brother who is working and a sister in high school.
Since the story hit the news, some Taiwanese social media users have called on the Ferrari owners to forgive Mr Lin and not demand money from him, given his circumstances.
One owner, however, has publicly said that he worked hard to be able to buy the car and would like to be compensated for the damage.
Mr Lin says the Ferrari owners have been kind and have not insisted he pay the bill all at once. They have instead suggested he could start eventually paying in instalments while they consult their insurance companies on how much the policies will cover.
Ferrari: What happened to F1's most ruthlessly successful team?
With a monthly salary of 35,000 Taiwan dollars ($1,136), it would take Mr Lin 28 years to pay the full cost of the repairs. His family's vehicle insurance policy only covers injuries not damages.
But he insists that covering the cost is the right thing to do.
""I'm really sorry to have hit their cars, really sorry. It wasn't intentional Even though it will take a long time, I committed a wrong. I should still pay for it.""",Taiwanese people open their wallets to help a low-paid man foot a rather large bill for the damage.,2018-12-19T12:36:21Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Sympathy for overworked Taiwan man who ploughed into Ferraris,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46619532,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/787F/production/_104874803_e0855913-b037-4b8e-9238-6bb9941e1763.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,damage,0
MIRIAM JORDAN and MATT STEVENS,"In late February, California’s stone-fruit and nut trees wake up from their winter dormancy, begin to bloom and enter a growth spurt that stretches until the summer harvest. “Trees in bloom are very, very fragile,” said Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. “Freezing temperatures can burn the flowers or harm fruit that is just being set.” Growers worked around the clock to implement frost-protection measures, such as irrigating their orchards to create a warmer environment around the trees. Extremely low temperatures have also kept bees in their hives, instead of on the job pollinating. “Not only are we losing crops, but bees aren’t flying,” Mr. Jacobsen said, adding, “The bees make your crop.” Subfreezing temperatures are more likely to impact California agriculture in December and January, when the citrus harvest is underway. Temperatures plunged to the 20s only briefly around Christmas last year, sparing this season’s production. Half of the navel orange and mandarin crop is still on trees, but citrus industry officials said they were not worried. Smaller almond and stone-fruit crops could push up prices for consumers. “We’re casting a wary eye on the forecast,” Mr. Chandler, the grower, said. “If Mother Nature keeps going cold, there’s not much that worrying is going to do to save the crop.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

Credit Misha Erwitt for The New York Times Smack in the middle of Los Angeles, Canter’s Deli has long provided Angelenos — a few of them famous — with a comforting respite in the wee hours of a weekday morning. After the bars close, the decades-old landmark of a restaurant has stood ready to receive customers seeking endless coffee refills, a plate of pickles, enormous pastrami sandwiches and an entire booth they could claim for themselves. But this month, the deli announced on Twitter that it was suspending weekday dine-in service between 3 and 8 a.m. Owners acknowledged that customers’ preferences have shifted to delivery (“most of you really like to eat our delicious sandwiches and black&amp;white cookies at home in your pjs”) and appeared well aware of the need to keep sit-down dining available all night on Fridays and Saturdays (“We know you need us after the after parties”). It’s a small alternation, sure, but a concerning one to some longtime locals who have watched the slow decline of Jewish delis in L.A., fretted over Gary Canter’s sudden death and become disheartened over the “C” grade the restaurant got from health inspectors last year. Gentrification has already remade the corridor in which the deli resides. Critically acclaimed restaurants, a coffee shop hawking artisanal breakfast burritos and streetwear vendors with lines out the door now fill the district, which was once considered a hub of Jewish life in Los Angeles. “Change is hard,” Canter’s tweeted. “But our food will still be the same.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

The photographer, who was thrown to the ground and kicked, reportedly suffered fractured bones in his face and ruptured vessels in an eye. It has caused anger in South Korea, where the main opposition has called for Mr Moon to cut short his visit. Koreans also say Chinese leaders have repeatedly snubbed Mr Moon. President Moon's visit was intended to improve relations, which had cooled after South Korea agreed to have a US missile defence system located on its territory to defend against possible attack from North Korea. China says it is a threat to its security. China's retaliatory measures included trade sanctions and a reported ban on K-pop concerts. Media caption How have fans dealt with K-pop's China crisis? The attack on the South Korean photographer took place on Thursday as Chinese security prevented South Korean photographers from following Mr Moon's delegation at a trade show in Beijing. He and another photographer, who was less seriously hurt, were due to return to South Korea on Friday for further treatment. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said there was ""concern"" at the injury but added that the event had been organised by South Korea, which had also hired the security guards. The South Koreans should have ""found an equilibrium"" between the media's needs and the guards' ""professional requirements...

Mr Moon had his first three meals in China without any Chinese officials present, a lunch with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was cancelled and he was met off the plane by an assistant minister, unlike other regional leaders, South Korean media said. Kim Dong-cheol, leader of the second-largest opposition People's Party, said the visit had so far been a ""series of mistreatments, humiliations and shames"". The country's biggest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, said the ""lynching"" and Mr Moon's treatment were intentional and caused by Chinese ""arrogance"" and Seoul's ""subservient attitude"".

BROOK LARMER,"The Japanese businessmen may be among the trade war’s first economic victims. But the shift of manufacturing away from China is not a new phenomenon. Over the past few years, as wages in Chinese factories have risen sharply, many companies, foreign and Chinese alike, have begun moving at least some of their operations to Southeast Asia to take advantage of lower production costs. In Vietnam, where wages are barely a third of those in China, Adidas now makes twice as many shoes as it does in China, and Intel and Samsung Electronics have made billion-dollar investments there. The country’s export-led growth depends on attracting foreign investment, and now American and Chinese policies may be hastening its arrival. “For many companies, the trade conflict is a catalyst to explore changes they hadn’t contemplated before,” says Jon Cowley, a tax-and-trade partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie in Hong Kong. “For others, it’s an accelerant to a process they’d already started. The trade conflict is just pushing them over the finish line.” It is still early in the trade war, only two months in, so many of these corporate moves are just taking shape. Still, the race is on to secure excess manufacturing capacity all around the region — in Thailand, Indonesia and elsewhere. In late July, Delta Electronics, a Taiwanese producer of Apple power components, approved a $2.14 billion buyout of its Thai affiliate to cope with the growing trade risks. Also this summer, Hong Kong’s Techtronic Industries (T.T.I.), the maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and Milwaukee power tools, opened a new plant in Vietnam and another, its sixth, in the United States. Some 76 percent of T.T.I.’s revenue comes from North America. “We have always said we won’t want all our eggs in one basket,” the company’s chief executive, Joseph Galli, said in August, stressing the importance of “a flexible supply chain.” Supply chains, innocuous as they sound, are a locus of collateral pain in this trade war. The American exports that China is hitting with retaliatory tariffs are mostly simple goods sourced close to home: pork, soybeans, whiskey. But China’s exports to the United States, especially in high-tech, are complex products assembled in China from a staggering array of foreign components and raw materials. A “Made in China” laptop shipped to America, for example, may have a South Korean screen, a Japanese hard drive and a memory chip from Taiwan. A tariff hurts every part of this international supply chain. Asia’s most advanced economies, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, are so globalized that they can easily get caught in this protectionist crossfire. Taiwan may stand to lose the most. It supplies 18 percent of China’s total imports of intermediate goods, or nearly 14 percent of Taiwan’s gross domestic product, according to the Stimson Center in Washington. As Tsai Ming-fang, an economist at Taipei’s Tamkang University, told Bloomberg: “Trump’s tariffs are giving Taiwanese companies further incentives to move to Southeast Asia.” The dust kicked up by the trade war obscures the fact that Asia is the world’s most dynamic trading region. According to the World Trade Organization, Asia in 2017 had the world’s fastest growth in trade volume for both imports and exports, 9.6 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. Eighteen months ago, the leaders of Vietnam and 10 other Pacific Rim nations believed the economic outlook would be enhanced even further by the creation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The agreement, which included the United States and Japan but not China, also offered the chance to push back, as a group, against Beijing’s unfair trade practices like intellectual-property theft and forcing companies that do business in China to share their technology.","In the escalating U.S.-China trade war, Asian trading partners are trying to avoid becoming collateral damage.",2018-08-29T09:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On Money: Can Vietnam Avoid Getting Hurt in the Crossfire When the Tariffs Are Flying?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/magazine/can-vietnam-avoid-getting-hurt-in-the-crossfire-when-the-tariffs-are-flying.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/magazine/02OnMoney_1/02OnMoney_1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
COLIN KOOPMAN,"An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms. It would also include a set of cultural expectations, fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges, requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them, not after they have already profiled, categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people. Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash. Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name? Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook’s user data. “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post. This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed. Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg’s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice. The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much. The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America’s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the “Personal Data Sheet,” a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth’s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines. The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests — I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments — would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system. Researchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica’s Christopher Wylie, the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles on two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great data-science challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing. For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer a data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.

ALAN BLINDER and MAGGIE ASTOR,"Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the city argued that the convention would bring many millions of dollars into the local economy — officials estimate the 2012 convention had a $164 million impact — and offer a crucial opportunity for Charlotte, which has long striven to be seen as a “world-class city,” to stand on the global stage. Hosting a controversial convention, they said, would signal the city’s commitment to free speech at a caustic moment. “Cities need to stand up for our democratic process, and I’m proud that Charlotte is standing up for the democratic process,” former Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who was also mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, said in an interview this week. Controversial gatherings, he suggested, were part of evolving into a major metropolitan area. “Every politician should support the conventions coming, but that doesn’t mean they have to like the convention that’s coming,” he said. But many others in Charlotte, which leans Democrat, believe the city is imperiling its carefully tended reputation as an orderly, prosperous city, and risking protests that they fear could dissolve into the kind of fatal violence seen last year in Charlottesville, Va. Malcolm Graham, a former member of the City Council whose sister was among the nine people killed in a racially motivated attack at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, said that hosting the convention would aid in the “normalization of what’s not normal.”","Party officials voted unanimously on Friday to select Charlotte, which approved the gathering amid concerns over protests and damage to its reputation.",2018-07-20T17:16:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Republicans Choose Charlotte for Their 2020 Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/us/politics/republican-2020-convention-charlotte.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/19/us/politics/00rnc1/00rnc1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
ELISA GABBERT,"The phrase “I do,” in the context of a marriage ceremony, is what linguists call a “performative utterance” — words that don’t simply mean or imply but actually enact a change. There are some words powerful enough that, when a president utters them, we might think they amount to a performative utterance, too: For the chief executive to call something a “disaster” in public, for instance, might suggest that a formal disaster declaration will follow. Except lately. During the Oct. 9, 2016, presidential debate, the candidate Donald Trump said “disaster” 17 times. The 17 things that Trump characterized as disasters were, in order: inner cities, Obamacare, single-payer health care plans, Obamacare, Obamacare, Iraq, taxes, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton again, Libya, Hillary Clinton’s foreign-policy record, Aleppo, Nafta, Nafta, education, Hillary Clinton’s political performance in upstate New York and jobs. Since that night, he has used the word “disaster” on Twitter with slightly less frequency — just 31 times. Last year there was a record-breaking pileup of multibillion-dollar “megadisasters,” including wildfires, tornadoes and flooding, but only three of the president’s tweets referred to such events. “Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc.,” he wrote in one, after Hurricane Irma. “A real disaster, much work to do!” The oddly cheerful tone of this tweet aside, the word “real” was an interesting addition, a seeming acknowledgment of the distance between a true disaster and Trump’s preferred, mostly rhetorical usage, which designates its recipient as a laughable mess, a high-profile embarrassment. Merriam-Webster does offer two contemporary definitions for disaster. One is “a sudden calamitous event bringing great damage, loss, or destruction,” as in “natural disasters.” The other is more hyperbolic, in the Trumpian sense: “a sudden or great misfortune or failure,” as in (the dictionary’s example) “The party was a disaster.” This second flavor leaves plenty of room for subjective evaluation of the failure in question. It puts disaster in the eye of the beholder.",It has little to do with lives lost or damage done — and everything to do with the stories we want to tell about ourselves.,2018-04-10T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",First Words: What Separates Ordinary Bad News From True ‘Disaster’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/magazine/what-separates-ordinary-bad-news-from-true-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/magazine/15mag-firstwords/15mag-15firstwords-t_CA0-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands of people have been taking part in demonstrations The pictures of Paris swathed in tear gas, with burning cars and angry protesters rampaging through the streets in high-vis jackets demanding an end to a fuel tax rise have been seen across the world. That so-called carbon tax had already increased diesel by 7.6 cents per litre and petrol by 3.9 cents in the last year, and it was due to rise again in January. Yet as the rage over the added expense spilled into the cities and on to front pages, the original reason for the increase became somewhat lost. It was supposed to help reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuel-guzzling cars, part of a wider attempt to reduce emissions and curb the effects of man-made climate change. What's more, it would have been a chance for French President Emmanuel Macron to prove politicians could make difficult decisions when it came to the fight against global warming. But now his government has bowed to pressure and promised to suspend the tax rise for at least six months, which raises the questions: where does this leave France's fight against global warming - and what message does it send to the wider world? 'Complete transformation' The protests are, in some ways, surprising. The French, in overwhelming numbers, believe in man-made climate change. According to a study released earlier this year by the European Social Survey, almost 94% of French citizens believe climate change is at least partly caused by human activity, with 73.7% believing the impacts will be bad. In comparison, 91% of British people believe climate change is partially caused by human activity, and just 66% believe the impact will be negative. Meanwhile, a report by the University of Michigan's Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy notes only 60% of Americans believe climate change is happening and humans are playing a part. France's fuel tax aims to encourage motorists to use their cars less or switch to electric versions. The tax would also raise 34bn ($39bn; £30bn), although according to news agency Reuters, just 7.2bn will go towards the environment. So why fight against a policy designed to combat carbon emissions? Many argue the people out on the streets are not protesting against the ecological aim of the tax. It has become much more than that in the weeks since it began. Image copyright AFP Image caption It began as a protest against a fuel tax rise ""Clearly the reason the yellow vests began to demonstrate was the so-called carbon or fuel tax,"" François Gemenne, a lecturer in environmental geopolitics at Paris's SciencesPo university, explained. ""But I'm not sure this [postponing the tax] will calm them down - most of them are just against tax."" Indeed, one of the leading members of the yellow vests - or ""gilet jaunes"" - appeared to almost echo these words. ""The measures announced today do not satisfy us at all - for the simple reason they don't go far enough,"" Benjamin Cauchy told the BBC's Chris Bockman in Toulouse. ""The French people want a complete political transformation. They want to change the way things have been for the last 30 years. We're sick and tired of taxes being raised and the quality of public services going down."" Read more But, environmentalists warn, this wider campaign against tax could end up harming the advances made towards a greener society. ""It is not by turning our backs on ecology that we will emerge from the political crisis we are experiencing,"" French political party Europe Ecologie Les Verts warned in a statement. ""Ecology must not become the atoning victim of this government's bad choices."" 'Will of the people' Considering the damage on France's roads over the last few weeks, it could be other countries where environmental policies suffer most. Mr Macron found a platform as the brave reformer, chastising US President Donald Trump for his refusal to sign up to the Paris accord. His ""Make the planet great again"" refrain - a rip-off of Mr Trump's ""Make American great again"" slogan - immediately went viral. Media caption French President Emmanuel Macron says Paris agreement will ""make the planet great again"" And yet, Mr Macron cannot get the laws through his own country. ""Abroad, this is likely to be perceived as if we had a choice to make between social issues and then fight against climate change, as if they need to be contradicting each other,"" Mr Gemenne told the BBC. ""It begins to send the really wrong message: if you try to impose constraints to your people, they are likely to rebel and revolt."" It is a message which has already made its mark. Polish President Andrzej Duda referenced France's fuel tax rises at this week's UN-sponsored climate talks, COP 24, saying climate policies cannot be implemented against the will of the people. What that message means for a country such as the US, run by a president who refuses to believe in the lasting negative effects of climate change, remains to be seen. 'Cart before the horse' In fact, the protests are widely believed to be a result of how the tax was created, not why. ""The decision of the French prime minister... shows the government has done things upside down, and put the cart before the horse,"" the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) Pierre Cannet told people gathered for the COP 24 talks. ""The carbon tax must be accompanied by a process, a process that is more consensual and as inclusive as possible."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption The tax was supposed to help reduce carbon emissions Mr Gemenne agrees, pointing to the way the Paris accord was reached three years ago: with everyone's co-operation. ""It really kind of triggered this anger because it was [perceived as being] unfair, rather than being discussed collectively,"" he said. ""Macron needs to apply the same ideas as COP 21 in 2015, the same bottom-up recipe. But he is a very top-down president."" And failure is not the message France's climate campaigners want to leave people with. In fact, Lorelei Limousin, of Réseau Action Climat, argues that the protests show how much France needs to change. ""It is a sign that our society is highly dependent on fossil energy and a car-based transport system,"" she said. ""We should get free of our addiction to the drug of hydrocarbons and cars by building a fossil-free transport system and moving beyond the current consumption and production forms to go 100% renewable and make greater energy savings."" For that reason, she is not giving up hope that this will be nothing more than a misstep on the way to a greener economy. ""This is a failure that the government will have to learn from so they can put in place measures for a fairer and more ambitious transition without delay,"" she said.",Campaigners warn nationwide protests over tax rises will only damage the country's green agenda.,2018-12-05T00:23:40Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",France protests: Will the environment be the true victim of the fuel-tax riots?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46439469,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/122FB/production/_104619447_e59b6c55-fb54-4ce1-bd90-704f836fd246.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,damage,0
MAX FISHER and AMANDA TAUB,"As a result what we have now isnt a global refugee system so much as a loose network of occasionally and partially observed norms. This means that there is no reliable process for relieving the political, social and economic pressures that sudden refugee influxes create. This creates dangers primarily for refugees but also for the governments that have deconstructed the system. We have seen in Europe in the last few years just how significant the political impact can be. And we should expect this to get worse. Scientists anticipate a near- and medium-term future in which climate change drives large population movements, either directly as people abandon areas rendered inhospitable by rising temperatures or extreme weather events, or indirectly as climate change exacerbates violence. The resurgence of populist and nationalist politics also bodes poorly. Us-vs-them movements, skeptical of international agreements and immigration, have little interest in asylums foundational concepts of global burden-sharing or universal rights. If asylum rights were declining even in the era of sunny 1990s global liberalism, it is hard to imagine their doing much better in the era of Donald J. Trump, Viktor Orban and Vladimir V. Putin. It takes a really, really long time to build these norms, especially when they restrict government actions in some way, Ms. Schwartz said. Its so much easier to take them down.

JAMES BARRON,"The drone survey will let Ms. Kargère compare the drone photographs to images taken in the 1990s. The drone made it easier to see into high-up crevices and peer at the figures on the corbels, the brackets just under the roofline. Sunny weather helped, too. The survey in the 1990s was done in late winter. Everyone was freezing, Barbara Bridgers, the head of imaging for the Met, recalled. This time around, the drone was sitting in the cobblestone driveway behind the apse, not far from a tent that had been set up as Mission Control. Its like youre walking into a James Bond set, one Met official said, looking at the paraphernalia a laptop, a portable monitor and extra batteries for the drone and the camera.

He was talking to Edward Kostakis, a drone pilot certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, who was on the other side of the driveway, holding the remote controller for the drone. Mr. Kostakis had already sent a warning to aircraft that might be flying through the area, even though the Cloisters is about eight miles from La Guardia Airport as the drone flies.

Cyclone Gita, a category four storm, battered the island overnight and caused widespread damage. Electricity lines were downed and roofs were torn off houses by the high winds. The government declared a state of emergency before the storm hit, and set up evacuation centres where thousands of people stayed overnight. ""The wind was terrifying. It was roaring overhead. We could hear roofs being lifted,"" witness Mary Fonua told Radio New Zealand. ""I could see the people across the road, their roof was flapping around the house, it was trying to disintegrate. I think a lot of people were very desperate last night."" The UK Met Office said the storm - which brought winds of more than 200km/h (124mph) - was the strongest to hit the main islands of Tonga, which is made up of more than 170 islands, since modern records began.

Read more about the expected floods here. • More than 4,500 people had checked into shelters in South Carolina, and the authorities said they had space for more than 34,000 across 64 shelters. North Carolina had opened 126 shelters for about 12,000 people, and is trying to open more.

Read about their experiences. • The Times is providing open and unlimited access to our coverage of Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut. Catch up on the rest of our coverage here. Government and military officials prepare to respond Brock Long, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday that the federal government had staged resources and personnel in states along the Eastern Seaboard to help quickly after the storm. Video FEMA workers were focused on helping the state and local authorities prepare, he said. But as the storm pushes through, the agency will shift its focus to identifying infrastructure damage and work to restore services. “The infrastructure is going to break. The power is going to go out,” Mr. Long said at a news conference. “We need people to get their mind-sets right that disasters are very frustrating and that it takes time to get the infrastructure back and running. We will move as quickly as we can to get back up.” The National Guard has readied about 4,000 soldiers and airmen, with more than 10 states mobilizing support. Air Force and Army helicopters were standing by for search-and-rescue operations and evacuations. A bad day for a wedding Hurricane season coincides with wedding season, which means a lot of cancellations and thwarted plans this week in the Carolinas. Some couples, like Leah Chesney and Brandon Frick, managed to move their ceremonies up, holding their beach wedding on the Outer Banks a few days earlier than planned. Deborah Sawyer, a veteran wedding planner and photographer in the Outer Banks, said that she always counsels couples considering a late-summer or early fall ceremony to get wedding insurance. Oceanfront homes used as event venues in the area generally offer renter’s insurance that covers storms. Carter Loetz and Esther Walsh were relieved that they got insurance. They live in Charlotte, N.C., and had been planning a 130-person wedding in Charleston, S.C., for a year. It was scheduled for Saturday. Now they’re considering new décor and outfits: Their new date is Nov. 30, and the summery garden party they had planned won’t quite work. They have also added a menu item. “We will definitely be serving hurricanes as the specialty cocktail,” Mr. Loetz said. Is this the last time we’ll get a Hurricane Florence? We’ll never see a Hurricane Harvey again. Or an Irma, Maria or Nate, for that matter. After last year’s hurricane season from hell, those four names were permanently scratched from the list that forecasters use to designate tropical cyclones. Hurricane Florence, if it meets expectations, looks as if it could be a slam dunk to join the list of retired names, which happens when the World Meteorological Organization judges that “a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity.” The current system for naming tropical cyclones has been around since 1979. Names for storms in the Atlantic are drawn from a different list than those for storms in the Eastern Pacific. The names are selected to be “familiar to the people in each region,” according to the meteorological organization. Read more here about how storms are named and retired.

If youre not a desert person, you dont understand how fragile these environments are, he said. They look like theyre built to take a beating.
During the shutdown, these environments are more at risk.
Desert flora rely on a fine layer of cryptobiotic soil, which Mr. Schreiner said, can take literally thousands of years to form and can be crushed with a single footprint.
Animals, like desert bighorn sheep, are susceptible to the unfamiliar pathogens that dogs can carry, which is why many trails dont allow them.
The issues raised by the shutdown have just heightened broader philosophical discussions about the reasons we protect public lands, as social media draws more and more visitors.
The issue is, how many people is too many people? Mr. Schreiner said. The parks service mission is to preserve these places for future generations, its not so that everyone can visit them.

Zachary Goldberg, a spokesman for the College Board, which administers the S.A.T., defended the extra-time policy. The College Board considers all reasonable requests for accommodations such as large print, Braille, or extended time needed by students with documented disabilities, he said.
The board asks for documentation in some cases, Mr. Goldberg said, but in the vast majority of cases, the modifications are granted through the schools that students attend, where they are evaluated and given an individualized education program.
Mr. Goldberg said that the people who administer the S.A.T. in schools, including test-center supervisors and proctors, are recruited and assigned by the schools.
Deliberate misconduct by testing staff is rare and, if it does occur, can result in the staff member or even the school being barred from further testing, he said.

SYDNEY EMBER and JONATHAN MARTIN,"And it was a sign that Mr. Bidens advisers were aware they had to do more than they have in the five days since a former Nevada assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, published an essay in which she described Mr. Biden touching her inappropriately and kissing her on the head in 2014, when he was vice president. On Tuesday, two more women told The New York Times that the former vice presidents touches made them uncomfortable.
Mr. Bidens aides said that after listening to the women who have criticized him, as well as many other female friends, family members and advisers, he indicated he wanted to address the matter directly. They said the former vice president paid particular attention to the comments of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime friend of his whos similarly rooted in an earlier political era, when she said Tuesday that peoples space is important to them, and whats important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it.
With his legs crossed, wearing a blue suit jacket over a white shirt with no tie, Mr. Biden stared directly into the camera as he issued his statement, which notably lacked a direct apology to any women whom he might have made uncomfortable. The hastily-made video, which appeared to be filmed on a phone, was recorded at Mr. Bidens Northern Virginia home.
Mr. Bidens campaign-in-waiting has not ruled out the possibility of a TV interview, but advisers indicated that he was more likely to address reporters when he delivers a speech to a union conference Friday in Washington. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
Mr. Biden is widely expected to join the Democratic presidential race this month.

Mary Beth Griggs,"Shaking from the large earthquake that shuddered through Anchorage, Alaska last week was strong enough to turn smooth asphalt roads into broken, jagged depressions of rubble. But within just a few days, crews managed to repair the worst of the damage, unsnarling traffic in Alaska’s largest city. Anchorage has a population of nearly 300,000 people spread across more than 1,900 square miles — an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. That space is threaded by roads, asphalt lifelines of the population. When the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck last week, some of the most visceral images showed roads that had broken apart. But within days, many of these same cracked highways had been smoothed back into ribbons of pavement by crews working around the clock. “We have more quakes than any other state in the Union.” The rapid response to damage in Anchorage shows how investing time and money into preparations for these kinds of large, infrastructure-hobbling events can pay off in the long-run, even when there’s no way to tell when or where disaster may strike. “We have more quakes than any other state in the Union,” says Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. As a result, Alaska takes its earthquake preparation very seriously. The largest earthquake ever recorded in the country shook Anchorage to its core in 1964, causing a deadly tsunami and leaving in its wake damaged buildings, buckled roads, and a legacy that inspired years of earthquake preparation and policies. Strong building codes put in place post-1964 helped make the area more secure than other earthquake-prone areas, like Seattle. Extraordinary that we had 0 casualties in this earthquake & only a few injuries. The resilience of Alaskans & our buildings is a testament to lessons learned from the '64 quake & speaks to our level of preparedness. Repair crews are hard at work but we still have a ways to go. pic.twitter.com/i5PvvkAtYT — Sen. Lisa Murkowski (@lisamurkowski) December 5, 2018 The 50th anniversary of the 1964 quake took place just four years ago, and officials took the opportunity to update their earthquake plans, hold drills, and generally prepare for when a quake would hit in the future. “I think that really helped,” McCarthy said. Over the past six months, a less ground-shaking development also helped prepare the teams on the ground for that moment. In March, a truck slammed into a bridge on the only major road connecting Anchorage to one of its suburbs, shutting down the throughway for days. In the months after the collision, the Department of Transportation went through and updated its recovery plans in the event of another damaging incident. All that preparation readied Alaska residents to spring into action as soon as the shaking from the initial quake subsided. Bridge inspectors based in Alaska’s capital, Juneau, packed and got on a plane that night. Arriving before midnight, they immediately started checking on the 243 bridges that had been impacted by the shaking. After checking in on damaged homes and offices, government employees and contractors within the quake zone also got to work, readying themselves to do a job that wouldn’t be easy during this time of year. Working 24/7, they cleared away the broken asphalt, saving it to be melted down at a later date. Then, crews with heavy equipment began digging out water-saturated sediments that slipped or sunk during the quake. They trucked in or gathered fresh material and compacted it, creating a sturdy earthwork base. Atop that, they placed large rocks, finer gravel, and finally, asphalt. “Our asphalt plants were all shut down for the winter,” McCarthy says. Thick and tarry, asphalt needs to be heated up from a solid form before it can be spread out in a thick layer to make a road. But Alaska in late fall is bitterly cold, and frozen asphalt can take a week or longer to melt into a sticky, pliable material. Soon after the earthquake struck, owners of asphalt plants switched on their heaters. “We were fortunate that they did that.” McCarthy says. “By the time we’d finished the earthworks, the asphalt plants were ready to go.” Frozen asphalt can take a week or longer to melt into a sticky, pliable material According to McCarthy, it was one of the first times that paving had ever occurred in winter. Snow was moving in to the area quickly, but the still-warm asphalt stayed clear just long enough for the crews to paint temporary lines on the roads. They couldn’t use the paint typically used on Alaska roads, an epoxy filled with glass beads and grit that prevents cars from skidding. It’s made to withstand the brutal wear and tear Alaskans put on their roads during the colder months, when layers of sand and tires wrapped in chains keep cars on the road, but would swiftly wear other paints down into oblivion. Unlike the asphalt, applying this paint has to wait for summer, when the weather is more amenable than it is now. The crews worked through some days of heavy, wet snow, high winds of 65 miles per hour. And the weather wasn’t the only natural element being a pain — the ground shook with near constant aftershocks. In addition to inducing seasickness in several Alaskans, the shaking also carved crescent-shaped bites out of some of the roadways, or shook the ground so hard that the soil under the freshly paved roads settled, forcing a do-over. Alaska DOT &PF Repaired road near Mirror Lake. The earthquake hit on Friday morning at 8:29AM local time. By the next Wednesday at 4AM, all eight major transportation corridors that had been severely damaged by the quake had re-opened. Dozens of others are still awaiting repair, and officials are asking selfie-takers to stay away from their still-cracked surfaces, no matter how visually appealing they might be. Similar situations play out in other places of the world, especially at bottlenecks where a web of roads narrows down to a precious few lanes. Japan can fix an intersection-eating sinkhole in less than a week. California, which has seen far more dramatic earthquake-induced road damage, has comparable plans in place. As impressive as the completed sections are, this is still just a temporary fix. While most roads in Alaska have to be built to last for 20 years, these are only meant to carry people through the summer. When warmer weather returns, the asphalt plants will spark to burbling life again, and the crews will return to the same once-shattered spots to build more permanent roads. “we’re particularly vulnerable if there is a break in the line” Roads are important threads of human civilization around the world, but they are especially entwined in Alaskan life, where wilderness is only sparsely dotted with towns, and there are fewer detours available to re-direct traffic. “Alaska is different from many states in that in many cases we usually only have one road in and one road out. That’s true with Anchorage. We have one road to the north and one road to the south, so we’re particularly vulnerable if there is a break in the line,” McCarthy says. In this case, breaks in the line were swiftly repaired, mirroring quake recovery in other areas of the city. Supply lines stayed intact, utilities were swiftly restored, damage was minimal, and, most importantly, there were no fatalities. In some ways, the minimal damage and recovery offer a beacon of hope to communities facing down other natural hazards, whether that’s hurricanes, fires, floods, rising sea levels, or more earthquakes. Preparation makes a difference. “In terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,” Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz said Saturday at a press briefing, according to the AP. “People pulled together. We followed the plans that were in place. We looked after one another. And when people around the country and around the world look at this, they’re going to say, ‘We want to do things in the Anchorage way because Anchorage did this right,’” Berkowitz said.","Shaking from the large earthquake that shuddered through Anchorage, Alaska last week was strong enough to turn smooth asphalt roads into broken, jagged depressions of rubble.

DANIELA J. LAMAS,"Even so, as the years passed, the Footes watched their son lose gains he had made in the early days at rehab. Though they were told that this was the natural progression of his injury, it was hard to scale back and realize that this was it — he most likely would never eat on his own without a feeding tube, never be able to use his hands or to talk clearly. He had turned 29 a few days before I met him, a bittersweet milestone. He no longer had friends to celebrate a birthday with and though he didn’t seem to mind, it was hard for Mrs. Foote to be reminded of time passing. Mr. Foote had recently stopped by a nursing facility, just to take a look. He was almost 60 with a new diagnosis of advanced melanoma. He knew that he and Linda wouldn’t be able to take care of Andrew forever. They’d promised each other that the responsibility would not fall to his siblings. But for the moment, their son was home. “I remember driving into Boston and crying and crying and begging just to say one more word to him. I basically sold my soul,” Mr. Foote said. “And to me, this is my wish. I got my wish. So now I just have to do what I have to do.” When I visited them it was still cooler out, and they were looking forward to when the weather would turn warm again. Linda and Lenny Foote would help their son onto the tandem bike they had bought, and maybe his father would ride with him or maybe one of his siblings would come over.

THOMAS FULLER,"With the median price of a home in California now above $500,000, estimates of the potential uncovered losses in an earthquake run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Economists say a large earthquake could have serious repercussions for local California banks. And with one-fifth of America’s $10 trillion in mortgage debt held in California, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government mortgage finance giants that guarantee much of America’s mortgage debt, are also exposed to the risk, economists say. Those who have lived through major earthquakes recount how damaging they can be, even to ordinary wood-structure homes, which are considered among the safest. Art Polan and his wife were still sleeping when the Northridge earthquake struck their two-story home in 1994. Bookshelves crashed to the floor, and the china in the kitchen spilled out of closets. “The house was totaled,” Mr. Polan said. The insurance payout he received was not enough to rebuild the house, so with the help of a federal loan, he moved and built elsewhere. Cindy Watter remembers the Napa earthquake of 2014 sounding like “a runaway train full of howling beasts was outside my back door.” Her two-story Victorian home, built in 1895, had relatively light damage, but her neighbors were not as lucky. One house burned to the ground because of a gas fire. “Lots of people around here took a real financial hit and couldn’t afford to fix up their houses, so they sold them and moved away,” Ms. Watter said. “I still have earthquake insurance because, well, you never know.” Insurance is not a panacea, experts say.

You may have that already through your health insurance provider or some other source, but your coverage probably only works here in the States and doesn’t cover you when it comes to international car rentals. You can always call your provider and ask, but don’t expect much. That means you have to pay for new liability insurance in the country you’ll be driving in, and it’s not optional in most parts of the world. It’s mandatory by law throughout Europe, for example, but at least most rental agencies include third-party coverage in their advertised prices. Things can get confusing, though, depending on where you’re traveling to. For example, in Mexico, liability coverage is mandatory when renting a car, and it has to be Mexican liability insurance. No coverage from U.S. auto policies or credit cards will work. You’ll often see incredibly low prices for rentals being advertised, but when you go to rent, they’ll surprise you with a hidden insurance fee that can double or triple the cost. But here’s a secret: the mandatory liability insurance you’re required to have is included in the base rental price by law. They’re just trying to up-sell you on supplemental liability insurance (SAI), collision damage waivers (CDW), or personal accident insurance (PAI). All of those things are good to have if you can afford them—basic liability insurance only covers claims for injury or damage to another driver, vehicle, or property, not you or your rented vehicle—but you don’t necessarily need to pay for them in order to rent a car. Even if you're aware of the free car rental insurance provided by credit cards, unless you… Read more Read Furthermore, your credit cards that offer coverage for theft or collision damage when you decline a rental company’s collision damage waiver (CDW) is a nice perk, but it doesn’t provide you with this often essential personal liability insurance. No matter what, you need to make sure you have basic personal liability insurance in the country you’ll be driving in. You won’t be able to rent a car without it, and even if you could, you’d be at risk of losing a ton of money if something goes wrong. Before you leave for your trip, do some research. Speak to your insurance providers to see if you’re covered, find out what’s provided by the rental companies before you pay, always read the fine print of your rental agreements, and look into local laws regarding rental cars. A little research ahead of time can save you a huge headache and boatload of cash down the road.","With so many types of driving coverage, either from your personal car insurance or your credit cards, it’s hard to tell what insurance covers what when you drive a rental car.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"Its aftermath was both devastating and remarkable, with helicopter footage of the base Thursday morning showing hangars that had easily survived past storms now riddled with gaping holes. At least three twin-engine propeller planes owned by a contractor and used for training were buried in debris from the wreckage of the largest hangar, which also housed at least five QF-16 jets retired fighters that have been stripped down and turned into drones and used as target practice. Those, too, were entombed beneath what was left of the building. [ Click here for photos from Hurricane Michael. ] In a Facebook post late Thursday, base leaders said many of the buildings were a complete loss. The marina, its structures and docks were also destroyed. Power lines and trees blocked nearly every road, and utilities and electricity had not been turned back on. The destruction of an air force base can only be matched in scope by the pounding that Hurricane Andrew gave Homestead Air Force Base, just south of Miami, in 1992. That Category 5 storm, with winds estimated at 150 m.p.h., smashed hangars and left battered fighter jets and mammoth cargo planes in pieces on the runway. Nearly all of the surviving planes and personnel were reassigned to other bases. Two years later, it reopened as a smaller, Air Force Reserve base. The Air Force was unable to say Thursday when Tyndall might resume operations. Other Air Force and Navy bases in the area, which were spared the brunt of the storm, reopened in a limited capacity Thursday. Tyndall, where about 3,600 airmen are stationed, sits on 29,000 acres that include undeveloped woods and beaches, as well as stores, restaurants, schools, a bowling alley and quiet, tree-lined streets with hundreds of homes for both active-duty and retired military. Video footage captured the ruin there, too: The high-powered storm skinned roofs, shattered windows, and tossed cars and trailers like toys, transforming the normally pristine base into a trash heap. Multistory barracks buildings stood open to the sky. The Air Force said Thursday that recovery teams conducted an initial assessment of portions of base housing and found widespread roof damage to nearly every home. At this point, Tyndall residents and evacuated personnel should remain at their safe location, said Col. Brian Laidlaw, 325th Fighter Wing commander.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Though Puerto Rico is home to 3.4 million United States citizens, the tax code treats the island as both a foreign and domestic entity. American affiliates in Puerto Rico get tax breaks like the ones granted to foreign companies, while the goods they produce are sold as made in America. The tax on intellectual property, which includes patents and design rights, would make Puerto Rico less attractive for business, compared with foreign countries that offer lower tax rates for manufacturers, said Ramón Ponte, president of the Puerto Rico C.P.A. society. “A lot of companies are going to look at the numbers and decide that, under the circumstances, it’s better to leave,” he said. “The issue is not Puerto Rico versus the mainland: It’s really Puerto Rico versus its competitiveness with other foreign jurisdictions.” If Republicans want to protect American jobs, as President Trump has pledged, then Congress should consider Puerto Rico a domestic entity, said Mr. Rosselló, who spent last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, making one last push for support. The governor predicted the tax plan would renew debate on the island about its commonwealth status. A vote on the tax bill could come as early as Monday or Tuesday. Mr. Rosselló accused Republican leaders — several of whom made highly publicized trips to Puerto Rico after Maria — of reneging on Congress’s commitment to help the island regain its financial footing. Photo Mylan, a mainland pharmaceutical company with operations in Puerto Rico, would be one of the businesses affected by the new tax. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times “Congress essentially turned its back on Puerto Rico, and essentially failed in its mission,” said Mr. Rosselló, a member of the island’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party who also identifies as a Democrat. “It’s just penalizing Puerto Rico. It’s putting Puerto Rico in a worse-off position than it was yesterday.” Last year, a special law — called Promesa, or “promise” in Spanish — was enacted to restructure Puerto Rico’s more than $70 billion debt. It established an eight-member, bipartisan task force that concluded in a December 2016 report that Congress needed to address the complex federal tax policy for Puerto Rico. The report underscored that jobs on the island and in other territories — including the United States Virgin Islands, which were also hammered by Hurricanes Irma and Maria — are American jobs. “The Task Force believes that Puerto Rico is too often relegated to an afterthought in congressional deliberations over federal business tax reform legislation,” lawmakers wrote. The group said it was “open” to giving tax incentives to American companies on the island as long as they were geared toward improving Puerto Rico’s economy and raising employment, as opposed to bolstering companies’ bottom lines. A 2012 Senate investigation found that Microsoft employed 177 workers on Puerto Rico, but reported some $4 billion in earnings there from profits channeled to the island to reduce the software giant’s tax burden. Microsoft sold brands and copyrights — that is, intellectual property — to its Puerto Rican affiliate to avoid paying higher mainland taxes. Among the task force’s recommendations that the final tax bill ignored: allowing lower-income Puerto Rican families with one or two children to qualify for an additional child-tax credit that currently kicks in only after a third child. Last month, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said lawmakers would address Puerto Rico’s tax concerns in negotiations with the Senate. “It is our intention to make improvements to our tax reform legislation as it relates to Puerto Rico when we go to conference,” Mr. Ryan said in a Nov. 16 statement issued jointly with Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress. Now, however, it appears Puerto Rico’s requests will have to wait until next year, when Congress could draft bills to extend tax credits or make technical corrections to the law. One of Ms. González-Colón’s suggestions, to create “opportunity zones” offering tax incentives for manufacturing, remains a possibility, said Representative Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “I think more can be done as well, but I think this is important,” he said. “We are just absolutely committed to helping that island rebuild.” Still pending before Congress is Puerto Rico’s request for more than $94 billion in hurricane relief aid. The island continues to suffer deeply after Maria: Only 65 percent of its power generation has been restored. An exodus of Puerto Ricans has taken away workers crucial to reigniting the economy. More than 243,000 people have landed in Florida from the island since Oct. 3. Puerto Rico is sensitive to tax decisions made in Washington. In 1996, President Bill Clinton authorized the repeal of a 1976 provision that gave American companies significant tax incentives to establish their subsidiaries on the island. Those perks helped turn the island into a biotech manufacturing hub, but critics countered that most of the benefit went to wealthy investors, not local workers. Once the incentives were fully phased out in 2006, at a time when manufacturing was declining across the nation, Puerto Rico plunged into a recession that has lasted for more than a decade.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Scrambling to soften the blow of his destructive trade wars, President Trump is offering a $12 billion bailout for farmers facing retaliation from America’s trading partners hurt by his tariffs. It’s a desperation move, and it won’t do much to reverse the damage the administration has inflicted by senselessly raising duties on steel, aluminum and other imports from Canada, Mexico, the European Union, China and elsewhere. Mr. Trump’s tariff increases were never needed in the first place. Indeed, the plan to pay off farmers — theoretically, voters in many of the president’s political strongholds — is the latest in a series of incoherent and haphazard economic decisions that the Trump administration has made in recent months, often in an attempt to clean up after it failed to think through the consequences of its earlier actions. In retaliation for Mr. Trump’s tariffs, China, the European Union, Mexico and other countries quite predictably imposed tariffs on soybeans, corn, pork and other products, and so — equally predictably — demand, and therefore prices, dropped for these commodities. The agriculture sector is understandably upset. But a one-time payment is no way to fix this problem the president created. That’s why even lawmakers from farm states don’t like the president’s approach of using a Depression-era program known as the Commodity Credit Corporation to help farmers. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, likened the plan to spending “$12 billion on gold crutches.” He added, “This administration’s tariffs and bailouts aren’t going to make America great again; they’re just going to make it 1929 again.” In April, after the administration floated the idea of helping farmers hurt by foreign tariffs, Senator Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who heads the agriculture committee, told reporters, “We don’t need another subsidy program; we need to sell our product.” Mr. Trump’s decision to pay farmers could run afoul of commitments the United States has made at the World Trade Organization not to unfairly subsidize its agricultural sector. That could give other countries, which will now be worried that their farmers will be at a competitive disadvantage, a reason to further retaliate against the United States. Countries have often fought about agriculture subsidies. For example, the Obama administration accused India of unfairly subsidizing its farmers, and Brazil has long complained about American farm programs.",A $12 billion farm bailout will not undo the damage the administration’s incoherent policies are doing to American industry and workers.,2018-07-24T23:28:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",So Now Trump Wants to Protect Farmers From Trump’s Trade War?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/opinion/trump-farmers-bailout-trade-tariffs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/opinion/25wed1-02/25wed1-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0

Dell Cameron,"Chelsea Mannings legal team went into damage-control mode Thursday after a headline by the Daily Beast suggested that prosecutors had accused her of lying or mistakenly giving false testimony during her 2013 court-martial.
Citing an unsealed court filing, the Beast reported that prosecutors believe Manning may have given false or mistaken testimony when recounting the events surrounding her 2010 disclosure of classified material to the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks.
A former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, Manning did not testify during her court-martial but did address the Ft. Meade military court regarding her motives for leaking some 700,000 classified documents, saying she intended to spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and U.S. foreign policy in general as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Manning was arrested and confined earlier this month after being held in contempt for refusing to answer questions before a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia. 
In a motion filed on March 1, Mannings legal team stated that during preliminary discussions, the prosecution indicated that they had reason to believe that Ms. Manning may have made statements inconsistent with her prior testimony. 
At most, we know that the grand jury probably relates to the 2010 disclosures, and related people and organizations, the attorneys wrote. And despite repeated requests by Ms. Mannings legal team for information about the nature of the expected grand jury questions, the prosecutor has only generally revealed that he believes some of Ms. Mannings statements at the court-martial were either false or mistaken, and that the grand jury would benefit from hearing more details about Ms. Mannings contacts and communications with respect to the 2010 disclosures.
A spokesperson for Manning issued a statement following the Beasts report, clarifying: At no point in the Courts record have prosecutors accused Chelsea Manning of providing false or misleading testimony. Headlines indicating otherwise are misleading. The allegation, in other words, had not been heard by the judge until it was raised by her attorneys. 
Its not uncommon for defense attorneys to preemptively refute allegations made by prosecutors outside of the courtroom. (Doing so is usually a sign the defense believes the accusations can be easily shot down, damaging the prosecutions credibility.) It is also not uncommon for news outlets to publish stories based on what one side of a case claims the other has said privately. 
Following the statement, the Daily Beast altered its original headlineChelsea Manning May Have Given False Testimony in WikiLeaks Trial, Say Prosecutorsto focus on allegations raised by her legal team about unlawful surveillance. 
The motion stated that shes experienced all manner of intrusive surveillance since her release from prison in 2017, including surveillance vans parked outside her apartment, federal agents following her, and strangers attempting to goad her into an absurdly contrived conversation about selling dual-use technologies to foreign actors.
Manning has stated that her refusal to testify in the case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is an act of protest against the use of grand juries themselves. 
I will not participate in a secret process that I morally object to, particularly one that has been historically used to entrap and persecute activists for protected political speech, she said.",Chelsea Manning’s legal team went into damage-control mode Thursday after a headline by the Daily Beast suggested that prosecutors had accused her of lying or mistakenly giving false testimony during her 2013 court-martial.

MARIA ABI-HABIB,"Some worried that the Indian incursion, effective or not, still carried a high risk of military reprisal from Pakistan.
The Pakistanis are bound to react, conventionally and not through a proxy like a militant group, said Rahul Bedi, an analyst at the London-based Janes Information Group, which tracks the defense industry. Where they react and when is something that only Pakistanis know.
The American government has typically been a broker between India and Pakistan, conducting shuttle diplomacy in similarly heated situations. But President Trump has taken a hard line on Pakistan while drawing closer to India since coming to office in 2017.
India controls much of Kashmir, while Pakistan controls a smaller part of the region, which was left in an undetermined state after the British partition of India in 1947. It has seen decades of violence from militants seeking independence.
In the run-up to Indian elections this spring, and with Mr. Modi facing a fierce a re-election fight, voters have demanded that New Delhi respond to the Kashmir attack with force against Pakistan.
What they hit is speculation for now they say they hit a terrorist camp, but a lot of intelligence sources say those camps in Pakistan had been cleaned out in recent days, Mr. Bedi said.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"There is only so much time for forecasters and emergency managers to prepare for the next hurricane season that begins in June, said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist and union steward at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
You cant change the date of hurricane season. Thats what were running up against, said Mr. Blake, who has been working without pay during the shutdown. You lose those weeks.
Day-to-day weather forecasting has not stopped during the shutdown. But instead of spending time integrating new data sources into existing forecasting models, to try to improve their accuracy in measuring a storms track and intensity, most researchers have been furloughed, Mr. Blake said. A significant upgrade to the Global Forecast System model scheduled for completion by the end of March appears likely to be delayed.
Julie Kay Roberts, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Hurricane Center and other government agencies involved in weather forecasting, said the upgrade required about 50 more days of work.
NOAA will resume implementation work on this upgrade when appropriations are restored, she said in a statement, adding that the existing model will continue to run operationally with no degradation to performance or skill.
As we near the beginning of hurricane season in May, we will ensure all necessary preparation has taken place, Ms. Roberts said.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“The limitation we had with Maria is we had no cash to burn,” said the governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló. Emergency managers and business leaders also are concerned about the logistics of getting aid into Puerto Rico. Maria created a bottleneck at the Port of San Juan, which slowed everything from food to electrical poles. “What am I most worried about?” Mr. Byrne said. “A ship sinks in the channel in San Juan, and we can’t bring anything.” Manuel Reyes Alfonso, executive vice president of MIDA, the island’s food industry association, said wholesale and retail businesses continued to experience delays in receiving cargo. “We are not where we’d like to be, or where we should be,” he said. He worries about a trucker shortage and about slow fuel delivery for generators. Puerto Rico had fuel after Maria, but no easy way to get it to people, leading to endless lines at gas stations and a black market for diesel sales. FEMA had to bring in a fuel barge for its operations. Food could also be scarce again, Mr. Reyes said, because Puerto Rico continues to impose a tax on inventories. Eliminating the tax could increase food stores to an average of 37 days from 26, according to a survey that the food association conducted of its members in February. A legislative effort to do away with the tax has stalled, Mr. Reyes said, in part because lawmakers have yet to figure out how to make up for the lost revenue. Photo Puerto Rico officials worry that the island remains vulnerable to another storm because repairs to the power grid have been slow in some areas, including Las Piedras. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Rodrigo Masses, president of the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association, said he had advised businesses to double their fuel storage capacity, keep their generators in shape and designate an emergency contact off the island to relay information in the event cellphone service fails again. “We’re still not out of the crisis. If we’re hit by another hurricane like this one, we’re going to lose power again. We’re going to lose connectivity again,” he warned. “But the private sector is going to be much better prepared.” Once the Corps of Engineers departs, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, will be tasked with completing unfinished repairs to the power grid. At a hearing last week of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in Washington, lawmakers sounded skeptical that Prepa, which has come under fierce scrutiny over its early response to the storm, is up to the job. Representative González-Colón has asked FEMA to extend the Corps’ stay. “We sure want to know that you really are ready,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Prepa’s new chief, Walter Higgins, at the hearing. “We feel that we are ready,” Mr. Higgins said. But, he added, “I don’t doubt that we will have some growing pains.” In Las Piedras, which sits on the hills south of El Yunque National Forest, people who have electricity say it goes out often. “If a little bit of wind blows through, we will lose power,” said Roberto Rosado, 53, who still has metal shutters on his sliding doors. “We just lost power now. This is an everyday occurrence.” Mayor Miguel López, who is known as Micky, recently blocked two of the three power crews from leaving his town. “There was no other option,” said Mr. López, whose unorthodox strategy succeeded in keeping the linemen at work. His director of emergency management, Xavier Muñoz, said the one upside of Maria was that it had scared residents into taking hurricane plans seriously. “Shelters are going to get full,” he predicted. “I have 220 cots right now, and I think that’s not going to be enough.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Ed Cara,"It might take less alcohol than we think to damage the heart and shorten our lifespans, suggests a new study published today in The BMJ. For many, the threshold might be fewer than one drink a day. Using existing population data, the researchers studied over 600,000 people across 19 countries and separated them into different groups, based on their self-reported level of drinking. Then, after accounting for factors like age, education, and smoking history, they compared their levels of various conditions such as heart failure, stroke, and fatal aneurysm (a bulged blood vessel that can rupture). They also calculated the average life expectancy for each group. Mirroring past research, they found that relatively heavy drinkers were more likely to die earlier. Having 10 or more drinks per week was associated with a life expectancy one to two years shorter than average, while 18 or more drinks was associated with a life expectancy around 5 years shorter. The link between drinking and a shorter lifespan only seemed to fade away when looking at people who drank five or less drinks a week. The researchers weren’t able to find a clear-cut benefit of moderate drinking for heart health, something that other research has found. Alcohol consumption overall was associated with fewer heart attacks when compared to not drinking at all. But there was no level of drinking that was associated with a lower risk of other conditions like stroke, heart failure, or fatal aneurysms (bulged blood vessels), among other things. “The key message of this research is that, if you already drink alcohol, drinking less may help you live longer and lower your risk of several cardiovascular conditions,” said lead author Angela Wood, an epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, in a statement. Studies dating back decades have suggested there’s sort of a J-curve when it comes to drinking and heart health. Drinking no alcohol is worse than drinking a little, while drinking a lot is much worse than either. But while some scientists as well as the alcohol industry have touted this research as proof that moderate drinking can keep you healthy and alive longer, other scientists have pointed out glaring flaws in the theory. Many studies didn’t account for past drinkers who quit drinking entirely when they included them as a part of the non-drinking population that was compared to drinkers. These former drinkers tend to have quit partly because they were in poor health, so not separating them can skew the numbers in favor of drinking. And more recent studies have found the supposed health benefits of drinking disappear once you account for those errors in experiment design. Other research meanwhile has long shown that regularly drinking at any level increases your risk of cancer, especially in women—a link that a paltry number of people know exists, according to recent surveys. There’s also the problem of defining what moderate drinking actually is. The UK lowered its drinking recommendations for men in 2016, and now suggests that no one drink more than approximately one drink a day. But other countries haven’t. The US, for instance, still says that men safely can drink up to two drinks a day. “This powerful study may make sobering reading for countries that have set their recommendations at higher levels than the UK, but this does seem to broadly reinforce government guidelines for the UK,” said Jeremy Pearson in a statement. Pearson is associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, a charity that helped fund the current study. “This doesn’t mean we should rest on our laurels, many people in the UK regularly drink over what’s recommended.” The same is true in the states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than two-thirds of Americans report drinking more than the recommended amount at least once a month. On a related note, the US government’s major research arm—the National Institutes of Health—is the middle of a controversy over an ongoing study intended to prove whether moderate drinking can be healthy for the heart. The $100 million NIH study, which began last year and is set to run for another five years, was largely funded through donations indirectly made by five major alcohol companies. Recent reports by the New York Times have alleged that several of the lead scientists involved in the study, as well as NIH officials, solicited these donations beforehand by implying their eventual results would vindicate the alcohol industry. Other reports have also alleged the NIH has tried to ignore or steer funds away from studies critical of the industry in recent years.

NATASHA SINGER,"“It’s about finding or identifying issues that we know in the next two, three, five, 10 years, the students who graduate from here are going to have to grapple with,” said Mehran Sahami, a popular computer science professor at Stanford who is helping to develop the course. He is renowned on campus for bringing Mark Zuckerberg to class. “Technology is not neutral,” said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. “The choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.” Photo From left, Jeremy Weinstein, Hilary Cohen, Mehran Sahami and Rob Reich of Stanford are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects — fake news on Facebook, fake followers on Twitter, lewd children’s videos on YouTube — of the industry’s build-it-first mind-set. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance. “We need to at least teach people that there’s a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,” said Laura Norén, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. “You can patch the software, but you can’t patch a person if you, you know, damage someone’s reputation.” Computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited by ABET, a global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs. Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses. But until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students. “Compared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps,” said Joi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab. One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning — computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course. “As we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,” he said. (Mr. Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.) Last fall, Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges — such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions like hiring or college admissions. “It was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically,” said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course. Photo The aim of the new courses, like Ms. Norén’s, is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times In another Cornell course, Karen Levy, also an assistant professor in information science, is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies. “A lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,” Professor Levy said. “If data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.” The Harvard-M.I.T. course, which has 30 students, focuses on the ethical, policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence. It was spurred and financed in part by a new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm of Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder. The curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data — like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records — to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans? Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled “Ethics, Public Policy and Computer Science.” The expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami’s popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year. The new ethics course covers topics like artificial intelligence and autonomous machines; privacy and civil rights; and platforms like Facebook. Rob Reich, a Stanford political science professor who is helping to develop the course, said students would be asked to consider those topics from the point of view of software engineers, product designers and policymakers. Students will also be assigned to translate ideal solutions into computer code. “Stanford absolutely has a responsibility to play a leadership role in integrating these perspectives, but so does Carnegie Mellon and Caltech and Berkeley and M.I.T.,” said Jeremy Weinstein, a Stanford political science professor and co-developer of the ethics course. “The set of institutions that are generating the next generation of leaders in the technology sector have all got to get on this train.” Continue reading the main story","Laura Norén, who teaches a data science ethics course at New York University, said, “You can patch the software, but you can’t patch a person if you, you know, damage someone’s reputation.”",2018-02-12T19:29:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Universities Rush to Roll Out Computer Science Ethics Courses,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/business/computer-science-ethics-courses.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/03/business/03TECHETHICS-1/03TECHETHICS-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
Tom McKay,"After the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14th resulted in at least 17 deaths and 14 injuries, the pro-gun rights crowd trotted out a number of frustratingly familiar arguments. One of them, per Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, was that it would be impossible to effectively regulate firearms like the AR-15 used in the attack without banning all semi-automatic rifles. He might have had a point, though it’s not really one in his favor. Per a devastating piece in the New York Times on Sunday, trauma surgeons who have worked on injuries inflicted by military-style weapons want to call attention not to the exact model of the rifle, but the size and speed of the bullets they fire. To put it short: The resulting injuries are grotesque. As the Times article mentioned, civilians in much of the country are able to purchase soft-nosed or hollow-point rounds that are designed for maximum stopping power against unprotected targets. Those bullets often expand and fragment on impact, which means they can carve huge wound channels into flesh, the reason the paper noted they “are proscribed in most military use.” But even rifle rounds that don’t have those characteristics are large and powerful enough to inflict terrifying damage. Semi-automatic rifles are capable of shooting lots of them in quick succession—and the shooter’s aim isn’t as much of a hindering factor when even a wound to an extremity can cause life-threatening damage. A number of doctors spoke to the Times, including University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine Dr. Jeremy Cannon, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Here’s how Cannon described rifle round injuries: “The tissue destruction is almost unimaginable. Bones are exploded, soft tissue is absolutely destroyed. The injuries to the chest or abdomen — it’s like a bomb went off.” If a bullet hits an arm or a leg, he said, the limb often hangs at an unnatural angle. Such victims can need a dozen surgeries over months. “Some eventually decide to undergo an amputation if there is severe pain in the limb and it is dysfunctional.” “Bystanders are traumatized just seeing the victims. It’s awful, terrible. It’s just a ghastly thing to see.” Oregon Health &amp; Science University’s Dr. Martin Schreiber and the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Dr. Jeffrey Kirby, both military veterans, emphasized that rifles fire bullets at much higher velocities than small arms, creating blast waves that radiate outwards and damage tissue as they pass through the body. Per Schreiber: “You will see multiple organs shattered. The exit wounds can be a foot wide.” “I’ve seen people with entire quadrants of their abdomens destroyed.” Finally, University Hospital and UTI Health in San Antonio’s Dr. Lillian Liao, whose hospital received nine victims of the mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, described to the Times what happened: Dr. Liao was initially clinical in describing the wounds during an interview. “Muscles and skin and fat surrounding skin can be sheared off. We saw holes in intestines and bladders.” Asked about the emotional impact of the killings, she said she thought she had moved on. Then came the Parkland shootings, and the horror came flooding back. For some time now, doctors have been emphasizing that while pistol wounds are bad enough, the generally small-caliber rounds they fire tend to pass through the body in a linear path, meaning the resulting wounds are less difficult to repair. In a recent article in the Atlantic, hospital radiologist Heather Sher, whose institution treated some survivors of the Parkland attack, noted that a pistol wound to the liver would be “generally survivable” if it missed arteries, while a rifle-caliber bullet to “the middle of the liver would cause so much bleeding that the patient would likely never make it to the trauma center to receive our care.” As another lengthy profile in the Huffington Post last year covered, while rifle rounds are bad, doctors in places like North Philadelphia have noted that they are seeing an increasing proportion of patients with wounds from larger pistol calibers as well. Where once they commonly “used to see.22-caliber bullets from little handguns, Saturday night specials... now they see.40-caliber and 9 mm bullets.” As the gunshot injuries have gotten worse, more and more surviving patients are forced to live with long-term complications like colostomy bags, paralysis, and the effects of gangrene when doctors are forced to clamp arteries. It’s not pleasant. It’s cruel, which is maybe why doctors want the public to keep in mind the visceral nature of gunshot wounds when they think about the role firearms play in our society—which is ultimately tantamount to a health hazard that results in somewhere around 33,000 deaths and 70,000 injuries a year.

ANA SWANSON and ALEXANDRA STEVENSON,"In late 2013, Chinese government investigators raided the Beijing and Shanghai offices of Qualcomm. After a 15-month investigation, regulators handed the company a record $975 million fine and declared Qualcomm a monopoly. The firm was forced to slash prices and pledge to move more of its sophisticated manufacturing to China and help boost the technological abilities of Chinese companies. Today, a growing chorus of American companies have complained that China has pressured them into sharing their technology in similar ways. Fang Xingdong, a free speech activist and founder of the think tank China Labs, said their complaints had little merit. “The pressures on companies such as Huawei and ZTE in the U.S. market are much higher than those of U.S. companies in China,” he said. “The U.S. sanctions on ZTE are enough to kill the company.” If China wanted to retaliate, Mr. Fang said, the simplest option would be to emulate American actions toward Huawei. “They could ban products from Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco in government, infrastructure and other areas of the market, based on security concerns,” he added. In targeting Qualcomm, China could be seeking to influence the Trump administration by putting pressure on a company that has been politically connected in the United States, often serving as an unofficial liaison between the countries. Over the years, Qualcomm has lobbied the United States government to further its interests in China, at one point helping to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. In the late 1990s, Clinton administration officials pushed China to adopt American standards for mobile phones on behalf of Qualcomm. But Qualcomm’s ability to influence the White House is unclear: The Trump administration has focused on recruiting American companies to build up their businesses domestically, not encouraging them to go abroad. “Yes, the Chinese have a way to squeeze Qualcomm to really hurt their China revenue, and yes, Qualcomm has fought a lot of battles in the U.S. government arena,” said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “The one weakness in the Chinese approach is it’s not clear the Trump administration cares about how much U.S. firms make in China.”",Qualcomm offices in San Diego.

"Joshua Berlinger and Matt Rivers, CNN","Beijing (CNN) Fire appears to have engulfed the gilded roof of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest temple, though details on the extent of the damage are scarce even two days later. Chinese state-controlled media confirmed a blaze broke out Saturday at the Jokhang Temple in the Tibetan capital Lhasa, and reported that it was quickly brought under control. No injuries were reported. Authorities appear to be censoring mentions of the fire online and suppressing any details of the cause or aftermath. Some social media posts on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform like Twitter, appear to have been erased by government censors. The ability to re-post and comment on other posts was disabled by Monday afternoon after working earlier in the day. The status of Tibet is one of China's most sensitive politics topics. Travel to the region is heavily restricted and news about the region is often censored. Jokhang Temple is widely considered to be one of the most sacred and important sites in Tibet. Buddhist pilgrims prostrate themselves in front of the temple every day, as they have since it was first built in the 7th century. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of videos being shared online showing the fire, and could not reach authorities for comment due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Chinese state media Xinhua said the bustling Barkhor market which surrounds the temple was reopened Sunday. The temple was also open Sunday but will be closed for the next few days as monks celebrate the New Year holiday, Xinhua reported. China's state-controlled Tibet Daily News confirmed there had been a fire but it has since been put out. No one was hurt and the surrounding area is now ""back to normal,"" according to the paper. A hallowed site under a watchful eye Jokhang is one of China's most heavily-secured sites. The square outside the temple has seen a number of anti-China demonstrations by Buddhist monks over the years, protesting what they say are consistent attempts by the Chinese government to suppress Tibetan culture and religious freedom. The temple itself is constructed mainly of wood. It's age, primary building materials, constant burning of incense inside and the fact that the interiors are small and cramped, would make firefighting difficult. A CNN team that visited the temple in 2016 saw little firefighting equipment. Tibet was nominally independent following the collapse of the Qing dynasty, but was incorporated into the People's Republic of China in 1951, after the communist party won the country's civil war, to the chagrin of many in the Tibetan Buddhist community. After a failed revolt against Chinese rule in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama -- Tibet's spiritual leader -- fled to India. The Dalai Lama's former home, the Potala Palace, is located just a few kilometers away from Jokhang Temple. Simmering defiance from Tibetans sometimes boils over into large-scale riots. Activists say more than 140 people have lit themselves on fire in protest of Beijing's rule since 2009. China requires all foreign tourists to have permits and sometimes shuts down access for weeks at a time. It only rarely allows reporters to visit the region. CNN has been permitted to visit twice since 2006. However, China has been grooming the region for a boom in tourism. New villages have been built and a second rail line, connecting Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to Lhasa has been. China already has a 1,956 kilometer railway line between Qinghai and Tibet. Many Tibetans feel that the increase in visitors and the influx of Han Chinese, China's dominant ethnic group, has put their native culture and religion under siege from a government that sees religion as an existential threat to their leadership.

SCOTT SHANE and MARK MAZZETTI,"The field research to guide the attack appears to have begun in earnest in June 2014. Two Russian women, Aleksandra Y. Krylova and Anna V. Bogacheva, obtained visas for what turned out to be a three-week reconnaissance tour of the United States, including to key electoral states like Colorado, Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico. The visa application of a third Russian, Robert S. Bovda, was rejected. The two women bought cameras, SIM cards and disposable cellphones for the trip and devised “evacuation scenarios” in case their real purpose was detected. In all, they visited nine states — California, Illinois, Louisiana, New York and Texas, in addition to the others — “to gather intelligence” on American politics, the indictment says. Ms. Krylova sent a report about their findings to one of her bosses in St. Petersburg. Another Russian operative visited Atlanta in November 2014 on a similar mission, the indictment says. It does not name that operative, a possible indication that he or she is cooperating with the investigation, legal experts said. The operation also included the creation of hundreds of email, PayPal and bank accounts and even fraudulent drivers’ licenses issued to fictitious Americans. The Russians also used the identities of real Americans from stolen Social Security numbers. At the height of the 2016 campaign, the effort employed more than 80 people, who used secure virtual private network connections to computer servers leased in the United States to hide the fact that they were in Russia. From there, they posed as American activists, emailing, advising and making payments to real Americans who were duped into believing that they were part of the same cause. The playing field was mainly social media, where the Russians splashed catchy memes and hash tags. Facebook has estimated that the fraudulent Russian posts reached 126 million Americans on its platforms alone. Photo President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has repeatedly denied any government role in hacking and disinformation aimed at the United States. Credit Maxim Shemetov/Reuters The Russian operatives contacted, among others, a real Texas activist who, evidently assuming they were Americans, advised them to focus on “purple states like Colorado, Virginia &amp; Florida.” After that, F.B.I. agents found that the phrase “purple states” became a mantra for the Russian operation. Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has tracked the Russian campaign closely, said that he had no doubt that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was behind the effort, which was carried out by companies controlled by his friend and ally, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin. But he noted that the so-called trolls employed by Mr. Prigozhin took elaborate steps to obscure their identities and locations and to avoid leaving government fingerprints. “From the beginning, they built this so it could be plausibly denied,” Mr. Watts said. Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied any government role in hacking and disinformation aimed at the United States, while coyly allowing that patriotic Russians may have carried out such attacks on their own. Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called the reported origin of the effort in April 2014 “crucially important.” “That’s a little more than a month after the annexation of Crimea and the launch of Russia’s covert war in eastern Ukraine,” Mr. Weiss said. The resulting crisis “vaporized U.S.-Russian relations overnight,” he said, setting off multiple Russian efforts “to undermine the United States, both in terms of our leading role in the world, but also via our own domestic political vulnerabilities.” Mr. Weiss said the fact that private companies conducted the social media campaign simply made it cheaper and more difficult to trace. Mr. Putin has been angry with Mrs. Clinton since at least 2011, when she was secretary of state and he accused her of inciting unrest in Russia as he faced large-scale political protests. Mrs. Clinton, he said, had sent “a signal” to “some actors in our country” after elections that were condemned as fraudulent by both international and Russian observers. Mr. Mueller’s indictment does not present evidence that the campaign overseen by Mr. Prigozhin was ordered by Mr. Putin. American officials have traced other elements of the Russian meddling, notably the hacking and leaking of leading Democrats’ emails, to Russian intelligence agencies carrying out Mr. Putin’s orders. While the indictment certainly undermines Mr. Trump’s blanket assertions that the Russian interference is a political “hoax,” it does not accuse anyone from his campaign or any other American of knowingly aiding in the effort. By the beginning of 2016, the Russian strategy was in place, and the conspirators began their campaign to sow conflict. An internal message circulated through the Internet Research Agency telling operatives to post content online that focused on “politics in the USA.” “Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump—we support them),” the message read. Photo The Internet Research Agency, in St. Petersburg, Russia, was said to be the hub of the operation. Credit Dmitry Lovetsky/Associated Press The scope of the operation was sweeping. The Russians assumed their fake identifies to communicate with campaign volunteers for Mr. Trump and grass-roots groups supporting his candidacy. They bought pro-Trump and anti-Clinton political advertisements on Facebook and other social media. They used an Instagram account to try to suppress turnout of minority voters and campaign for Ms. Stein, the Green Party candidate. Applying nearly two years’ worth of political research, the Russians used all of these tactics to target voters in swing states, notably Florida, according to the indictment. By summer 2016, the Russian operatives were mobilizing efforts for coming “Florida Goes Trump” rallies across the state, all planned for Aug. 20. Using false identities, they contacted Trump campaign staff in Florida to offer their services. One operative sent a message to a campaign official saying that the group Being Patriotic was organizing a statewide rally “to support Mr. Trump.” “You know, simple yelling on the internet is not enough,” the message read, according to the indictment. “There should be real action. We organized rallies in New York before. Now we’re focusing on purple states such as Florida.” Taking to Facebook, the Russians used the pseudonym Matt Skiber to advertise the rally. “If we lose Florida, we lose America. We can’t let it happen, right? What about organizing a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town?” the message read, using one of Mr. Trump’s favorite verbal flourishes. They reached out to local organizations to build momentum for the coming rallies and assign specific tasks. They paid one unwitting Trump supporter to build a cage on a flatbed truck that housed another person wearing a costume that portrayed Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform. After the rallies in Florida, the group applied similar tactics to organize rallies in Pennsylvania, New York and elsewhere. Weeks before the election, the Russians ratcheted up social media activity aimed at dampening support for Mrs. Clinton. In mid-October, Woke Blacks, an Instagram account run by the Internet Research Agency, carried the message “hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we’d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.” Then, just days before Americans went to the polls, another Instagram account controlled by the Russians — called Blacktivist — urged its followers to “choose peace” and vote for Ms. Stein, who was expected to siphon support from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “Trust me,” the message read, “it’s not a wasted vote.” A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Stunning Three-Year Russian Plot to Influence American Voters.

Think about it. You use your cell phone number all the time. You use it when you sign up to sites and services, and sometimes you’ll use it to log into an app or a game on your phone. Your phone number can be used to reset your account if you forget your password. And, you use it for two-factor authentication to securely login to your accounts.
If someone steals your phone number, they become you for all intents and purposes. With your phone number, a hacker can start hijacking your accounts one by one by having a password reset sent to your phone. They can trick automated systems like your bank into thinking they’re you when you call customer service. And worse, they can use your hijacked number to break into your work email and documents potentially exposing your employer up to data theft.
Just think of every site and service that has your phone number. That’s why you need to protect your phone number.
How do hackers steal cell phone numbers?
It’s easier than you might think. Phone numbers can be found anywhere thanks in part to so many data breaches.
Often, hackers will find the cell phone number of their target floating around the internet (or from a phone bill in the garbage), and call up their carrier impersonating the customer. With a few simple questions answered often little more than where a person lives or their date of birth, they ask the customer service representative to “port out” the phone number to a different carrier or a SIM card.
That’s it. As soon as the “port out” completes, the phone number activates on an attacker’s SIM card, and the hacker can send and receive messages and make calls as if they were the person they just hacked.
In most cases, the only sign that it happened is if the victim suddenly loses cell service for no apparent reason.
From there, it’s as simple as initiating password resets on accounts associated with that phone number. Facebook, Gmail, Twitter and more. A hacker can use your hijacked phone number to steal all of your cryptocurrency, take over your vanity Instagram username or maliciously delete all of your data.
You can read what happened to TechCrunch’s own John Biggs when his phone number was hijacked.
In the worst cases, it can be difficult or impossible to get your phone number back let alone the accounts that get broken into. Your best bet is to make sure it never happens in the first place.
What you can do to protect your phone number
Just like you can apply two-factor authentication to your online accounts, you can add a secondary security code to your cell phone account, too.
You can either call up customer services or do it online. (Many feel more reassured by calling up and talking to someone.) You can ask customer service, for example, to set a secondary password on your account to ensure that only you the account holder can make any changes to the account or port out your number.
Every carrier handles secondary security codes differently. You may be limited in your password, passcode or passphrase, but try to make it more than four to six digits. And make sure you keep a backup of the code!
For the major carriers:
If your carrier isn’t listed, you might want to check if they employ a similar secondary security code to your account to prevent any abuse. And if they don’t, maybe you should port out your cell phone number to a carrier that does.

Lucas Matney,"Yesterday, GoPro confirmed TechCrunch’s reporting that the company was shuttering its Karma drone division and laying off hundreds of employees. Today, CEO Nick Woodman is at CES on damage control. In an interview with TechCrunch, Woodman said that the company is shifting focus entirely back to action cams, a market he insists is “absolutely” robust enough to sustain the company. Woodman didn’t comment on rumors of a potential sale beyond noting that the company was not “actively engaged” in the process of selling itself, and said that the leadership would “continue to strategize and run GoPro as though we’re going to be running this independent company ongoing, because we have to be masters of our own destiny.” While the founder asserted that he believes things would have fared differently for the company’s Karma drone program had it not dealt with its initial “horrible launch,” he said that the decision to shut it down was ultimately due to a “domino effect” that resulted from poor sales of the company’s last-gen Hero5 action camera. These poor sales led the company to drop the Hero5 Black action camera’s price from $399 to $299 and eventually led to further price restructuring including a $100 price cut yesterday to the brand new Hero6 Black. “If Hero5 Black had sold to expectations at its original $399 pricing, we would not have had to change prices across all of our cameras, and we would not have had to do a restructuring and we would have been able to continue investing in programs like our next generation Karma,” Woodman said. “But reality is reality.” The company seems to have been forced into a situation where it has to fight for stability rather than seek out new opportunities for future growth. Woodman heralds this as a return to “paying much more attention to what our customers really want from us and less about what we want from us,” as GoPro confining its ambitions to a niche market where it’s already king sounds far less positive. The company’s last gamble sitting in its product line, the newly-released $699 Fusion, is aimed at “prosumers” but resides in a saturated 360 camera market that likely won’t bring too many new customers to GoPro. Woodman concedes the mass-market promises of 360 cameras rely heavily on the software side and that the company’s ability to invest in machine learning technologies that help consumers edit down footage will be key. “I don’t think consumers want a 360 camera, I think consumers want a camera that makes it so simple and essentially automatic to capture and share themselves in exciting ways, and I think in the future that will be a 360 camera,” he said. GoPro stock is down nearly 20 percent since yesterday’s restructuring announcement.","Yesterday, GoPro confirmed TechCrunch’s reporting that the company was shuddering its Karma drone division and laying off hundreds of employees.

Kirsten Korosec,"Tesla owners may soon have a way to see (and record) damage that happens to their vehicles when they’re unattended.
Tesla will roll out “Tesla Sentry Mode” for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot, CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet Tuesday. Musk didn’t provide anymore information about when this feature might be available and how it might work.
TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla for more details.
The name suggests that this feature would stand guard, so to speak by either keeping the dash cam on while parked or having it automatically turn on if the car is hit or being tampered with. It could operate similar to aftermarket product Owl security camera; although, again, details are scant except that “regulators just approved.”
Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 22, 2019
In October, Tesla released version 9.0 of its software, which featured a number of updates including a new UI on the center display and the ability to the use the built-in forward-facing cameras as a dash cam. The dash cam feature is available only in Tesla vehicles built after August 2017.
The dash cam feature currently lets owners record and store video footage captured by their cars forward-facing camera onto a USB flash drive. Owners first must configure a USB flash drive in Windows or MS-DOS file architecture and add a base-level folder in the flash drive called TeslaCam. The configured USB flash drive can then be inserted into either one of the USB ports in the front row of the vehicle. When properly configured, the Dash cam icon pops up on the status bar with a red dot indicating that it is recording.
Owners can tap the icon to save a 10-minute video clip or press and hold to pause recording. Recordings that aren’t downloaded are automatically deleted.","Tesla owners may soon have a way to see (and record) damage that happens to their vehicles when they’re unattended.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"The whole house was shaking, you could see the floor rolling up and down, Anders Olmstead said. Different rooms in my house were going in different angles. I was pretty scared. Ive lived here my whole life. We kind of laugh off earthquakes in Alaska because youve been through so many, hundreds some of them you sleep through. Mr. Olmstead, 32, said the earthquake had knocked over his toddler daughter. He grabbed her and sheltered in place with her. He said he could hear the joints of his house snapping and things falling all around him. His house ended up being fine, he said. We got very lucky. Professor Yang said the damage around the city was definitely less than I would expect based on the intensity of the earthquake. He said the relative depth of the temblor, which struck nearly 30 miles below ground, helped mitigate its power. The citys main utilities were all up and running on Saturday, said Bill Falsey, the Anchorage municipal manager. But Mr. Falsey warned that repair work to the Glenn Highway, a major thruway in the region, could take a long time to complete. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz of Anchorage told city residents on Saturday morning that were in full recovery mode and on the road to returning to normal. Many businesses downtown remained closed, some marked with caution tape, awaiting safety inspectors to assess any structural damage. But in many shops, store managers were already taking stock of inventory. Families were cleaning up their homes, and building owners were meeting with engineers. Schools, according to officials, would remain closed until Tuesday. Still the shock had not quite warn off.

Jon Russell,"It’s the morning after the night before for AMI.
And what a night it was. The company is officially in damage control mode after it released a short statement defending its communication and behavior with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who published evidence of blackmail that used leaked messages and nude photos of the billionaire that AMI had acquired.
AMI today defended its efforts. It claimed it had “acted lawfully” with its reporting of Bezos and that it engaged in “good faith negotiations” with him. Still, despite those claims, it said it has launched an investigation into the incident.
Here’s the statement:
American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.
The company, which owns the National Enquirer among other media businesses, was accused of blackmail in an explosive essay that Bezos published on Thursday. In it, the Amazon CEO detailed AMI’s apparent offer of a ‘deal’ that would see it drop the publishing of naked selfies of the billionaire, sent to his new partner, in exchange for The Washington Post — the newspaper he owns — walking back its investigation into AMI’s connections in Saudi Arabia and relationship with President Trump.

DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and CARLOTTA GALL,"Two people close to Mr. Erdogan, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss conversations with the president, said he believes persuading Mr. Trump to abandon Prince Mohammed would be a prerequisite to any attempt to constrain or remove him. Turkish officials have been feeding graphic leaks to the news media about Mr. Khashoggis killing in part to try to turn American public opinion and thus Mr. Trump against Prince Mohammed. Yet turning the White House against the prince appears unlikely, in part because the presidents son-in-law and Middle East adviser Jared Kushner has invested deeply in Prince Mohammed as a pillar of the administrations strategies to both contain Iran and secure Israel. Prince Mohammed had grinned through a photo session on Monday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and his visit appeared to convey the continued support of the White House, Mr. Trumps subsequent comments notwithstanding. Mr. Erdogan understands this, the two people close to him said. But he has evidently calculated that the chance to weaken Prince Mohammed by tarring him with the Khashoggi killing is worth the risk of facing him as a hostile of ruler of Saudi Arabia for the next 50 years.",President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is exploiting the uproar over the killing of a Saudi critic to inflict as much damage as possible on the image of Crown Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia.,2018-10-24T00:32:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Prince and President Escalate Battle Over Khashoggi Killing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/world/middleeast/khashoggi-crown-prince-erdogan.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/world/24turkeysaudi1/24turkeysaudi1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
RICHARD FAUSSET and ALAN BLINDER,"One of four dead in Gadsden County was a man from Greensboro who had a heart attack on Thursday morning. Rescuers, faced with a mess of debris, could not immediately reach him, but neighbors and others rushed in with chain saws and tractors, pulling away tree limbs to clear a path. This town got destroyed within 24 hours, but it took us 12 hours to bounce back harder than ever, said Jay Stiles, a local firefighter. Citizens came together. Reaching Greensboro at all was difficult because Interstate 10 was closed in several locations, blocked by debris. Travel across the Panhandle was arduous everywhere. In Carrabelle, on the coast, even two National Guard trucks had to turn around when they came upon a hurricane-strewn barricade of fallen trees and broken buildings. Just before that impasse, which made communities like Apalachicola and Eastpoint inaccessible from one direction, the storm had cratered a road as if an earthquake had struck, too. Across from a pungent paper plant in Springfield, Michael Williams, 70, stood shirtless in his yard with a sign that read HELP. Anything. Food. Water. Mr. Williams, who is on disability, said he thought the storm would come and go quickly, so he had not stocked up on supplies for himself, an 8-year old boy and an autistic woman for whom he is caring. A tangle of fallen trees had blocked his truck. He was stuck, he said, and desperate.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The Californian town of Paradise has been devastated by the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. At least 81 people have lost their lives and hundreds more have been reported missing. As families across the US come together for Thanksgiving, Paradise's residents are beginning to assess the damage to their lives and the town they called home. When gale-force winds drove flames from the Camp Fire through dried-out scrub and trees into Paradise on 8 November, its people fled for their lives. In the space of a day, the flames had engulfed much of the town - home to 27,000. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Some of the victims died trying to get away, while others were discovered in the burned-out ruins of their homes. An estimated 13,000 homes were destroyed, with many of the town's mainly-wooden houses quickly reduced to ashes. The authorities are still working to search and identify bodies as the fire continues to burn in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. While a forecast of heavy rains could help extinguish the flames, it could also hinder the search for the remains of victims and cause misery for those left homeless by the disaster. Thanksgiving plans As the rest of America sits down to celebrate Thanksgiving on Thursday, those left homeless by the raging Camp Fire are contemplating their futures. A number of organisations are on hand to help with the immediate crisis, providing shelter, clothes and food. And for Thanksgiving itself, meals are being donated by several non-profit organisations - the day seen as a chance to bring together those affected to start the healing process. For Kassy Parish, 19, such generosity after the trauma of the fire has been comforting. She plans to spend Thanksgiving at her mother-in-law's, but a stranger has offered her twin sister, Alli, somewhere to sleep and invited her to join his family for the annual celebratory meal. ""It's brought out so much good in a lot of people in the area,"" said Kassy. ""A lot of people have been getting together and making sure everyone is taken care of."" Image copyright Kassy Parish Image caption Kassy Rose Parish, her twin sister Alli and their family home before the fire Kassy was staying with her mom and stepfather at their home on Skyway - one of the three main routes into Paradise - when the fire spread through the town. Their house was burned down. Her six siblings also lost their homes. Before the disaster struck, the town was a popular retirement spot and, according to the latest census, about a quarter of the population was aged 65 or over. Kassy worked as a personal carer providing support for adults in the town when they were unable to live independently. She plans to stay in the town, where everyone knows everyone. ""I know it's going to take a couple of years until Paradise is rebuilt but I have lived here all my life,"" she said. Acres of land destroyed The Camp Fire scorched 152,000 acres of land along with the thousands of the homes built on it. The blaze is still only 75% contained. The fire isn't expected to be fully under control until the end of the month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Although, there is no exact figure for the number of people left homeless, six official evacuation centres have been set up, including two in fairgrounds which had closed for the season. Some people have also taken refuge in tents or cars. Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers are helping run the emergency shelters, which slept up to 950 on one night, as well as providing meals for all evacuees. They are also dealing with a fast-spreading norovirus outbreak, which has been reported at four of them. The Red Cross is helping people search for those still missing, through their safe and well website. Sean Smith, debris coordinator for the California Office of Emergency Services told Time magazine the post-fire clean-up would be the biggest since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. One estimate puts the cost at $1.2 billion (about £900m). Along with the 13,000 homes destroyed, almost 500 businesses have also been hit. Morgan Stanley estimates insured property losses could approach $4 billion (£3.1m), while Moody's Investor Services puts the figure at $6.8bn (£5.3m). ""It's one of the worst disasters that I've seen in my career, hands down,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long told a news conference. While federal funds are expected to provide about 75% of Paradise's recovery costs, the state of California will also contribute. Image copyright Justin Sullivan The money will help rebuild streets, public utilities and buildings and possibly install a new sewer system - Paradise was the largest town in California relying on septic tanks - but families without insurance may have to bear the cost of rebuilding their own homes. Kassy and her family have set up a crowdfunding page to help them get back on their feet. Others are expected to do the same. 'Survived three fires' But for Maurine Johnson, who has lived in Paradise for more than 60 years, it is too soon to contemplate the future. The 79-year-old great-great grandmother has lost her family home and her estate agency business, built up over many years with her late husband. Her two sons have also lost their homes. She has experienced blazes before, but this one was different, she said. ""We have been through two or three fires up there and never felt threatened or worried."" Maurine, who fell over and broke her nose and damaged her teeth while visiting her sister-in-law at one of the evacuation centres, described how she fled her home with just one change of clothes and her mobile phone. She admitted she still did not appreciate the gravity of her situation, but has been cheered by other people's generosity. Image copyright AFP ""I am having to wear donated clothes,"" she said. ""It's a humbling experience when you are having to take from people."" It is this spirit of giving that has led many organisations to provide 15,000 Thanksgiving meals to Camp Fire survivors at several locations, including shelters, on Thursday. Food for the Thanksgiving Together events will be provided by the non-profit World Central Kitchen and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, while celebrity chefs will work side by side with Paradise restaurant owners to prepare the food. ""We have seen the power of food to bring communities together, especially in times of great need,"" reads a post on the World Central Kitchen website. But the question for many of those affected by the Paradise fire, is whether they will return to the town. Mayor of Paradise Jody Jones believes they will and that the town will be reborn. ""We're committed to rebuilding,"" she said. ""It's not an 'if', it's 'How long is it going to take?'"" But Maurine, who is considering winding up her estate agency business and retiring, fears many will not return. People are already moving on, she said. ""They are leaving the state - others won't be back.""

Mike Butcher,"The flood underinsurance problem is arguably the largest unsolved problem in insurance. Over the last ten years, an average of $41bn per year of flood damage has gone uncovered by insurance, leaving people, businesses and governments to pay the bill. It’s estimated that there are $50bn of losses caused by floods around the world. Currently, only $9bn of these are covered by insurance. FloodFlash, an insurtech startup that offers a way for customers to insure their property for flood risk, even in high risk areas, by employing an internet-connected water-sensor has raised £1.9m in seed funding from LocalGlobe, Pentech Ventures and InsurTech Gateway. They previously secured a pre-seed/Angel round in 2017 (Hambro Perks Insurtech Gateway and one private investor). When a flood happens, it triggers an internet-connected water-sensor and the payment is made immediately to the policy holder. A FloodFlash policy pays out a pre-agreed, fixed sum as soon as a pre-defined level of flooding occurs. A slice of the premium goes to FloodFlash in return for installing the sensor, plus automated underwriting and claims services. Founders, Adam Rimmer and Ian Bartholomew, created the company after looking at “parametric catastrophe bonds”. These are typically used by large corporations or governments to recover large sums in the event of a catastrophe, but many of the benefits they confer were previously unavailable to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Rimmer says: “Every year tens of thousands of business owners lose their livelihoods because they have been unable to take out an affordable policy that protects their business. In the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic flood, people care less about dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for damages and more about whether their business will survive at all. We believe FloodFlash’s event-based insurance is absolutely the best way for insurers to cover higher-risk areas.” FloodFlash is regulated by the FCA and is currently carrying out a live pilot for its policies with a select group of SMEs in parts of the UK with significant flood risk, including Carlisle. Insurance capacity for FloodFlash policies is provided by Everest Re through their syndicate at Lloyd’s of London. The startup has been working as part of the InsurTech Gateway, the InsurTech focused incubator since mid 2017. Tara Reeves, partner at LocalGlobe, said: “Climate change is leading to more extreme weather events, but these are often hard to insure. Parametric insurance dramatically reduces underwriting and loss adjustment costs, and those savings can be passed on to the consumer. Adam and Ian’s background in risk modelling and hydrology is uniquely suited to this challenge.” Eddie Anderson, partner at Pentech Ventures, said: “FloodFlash is a business that has global potential. There is no country on the planet where severe or freak weather does not cause havoc, whether it is flood or hurricane. We think markets around the world will welcome this innovative, cost-effective way to sell insurance that has been adapted to take into account the way we live today.”","The flood underinsurance problem is arguably the largest unsolved problem in insurance.

Danny Crichton,"Over the weekend, the Information Technology Industry Council and 44 other trade associations banded together and published a letter demanding that the Trump administration take “measured” steps to stop China’s unfair trade practices and voiced its opposition to unilateral tariffs that could damage industries as diverse as electronics and agriculture. As we have been covering on TechCrunch, the Trump administration is readying a comprehensive “all of the above” series of policies to fight China, including tariffs that might reach above $100 billion, visa restrictions on Chinese nationals, and prohibitions on Chinese capital from buying or investing in American companies. The Trump administration is expected to develop a policy here shortly as part of the conclusion of its section 301 trade investigation into China. The letter warns that tariffs in particular could lead to “a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy, provoking retaliation; stifling U.S. agriculture, goods, and services exports; and raising costs for businesses and consumers.” Interestingly, the letter leaves open the door for tariffs. From the letter: In particular, it is critically important that the Administration work with like-minded partners to address common concerns with China’s trade and investment policies. Imposition of unilateral tariffs by the Administration would only serve to split the United States from its allies, hinder joint action to effectively address shared challenges, and ensure that foreign companies take the place of markets that American companies, farmers and ranchers must vacate when China retaliates against U.S. tariffs. Considering the wide variety or organizations that signed onto this letter, it is interesting to note that free trade arguments are not being used here forcefully, but rather that America should only implement trade restrictions with the cooperation of other nations. The letter from the trade association in many ways mirrors a letter released by House Republicans two weeks ago that similarly urged the administration against imposing unilateral tariffs on aluminum and steel, tariffs that the Trump administration had already announced that it is implementing. Outside ITI, the signatories of the trade association letter included a spate of tech industry-affiliated associations, including Allied for Startups, CompTIA, the Computer and Communications Industry Association, the Consumer Technology Association, the Developers Alliance, the Internet Association, the Software &amp; Information Industry Association, TechNet, and the Telecommunications Industry Association.","Over the weekend, the Information Technology Industry Council and 44 other trade associations banded together and published a letter demanding that the Trump administration take “measured” steps to stop China’s unfair trade practices and voiced its opposition…",2018-03-19T18:25:12Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Tech industry comes out swinging against potential Trump tariffs,http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/tech-industry-opposes-trump-tariffs/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-871872458.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,damage,0
Ed Cara,"The idea that air pollution can hurt developing fetuses in the womb is not controversial. But new preliminary research presented this week seems to provide direct evidence of how this damage can happen, via the placenta. The UK researchers studied the placentas of five non-smoking women who had recently given birth to healthy children through cesarean section. Hoping to confirm that soot could move from a person’s lungs to their bloodstream and then to the placenta, they looked for a specific type of immune cell, known as a macrophage. In earlier research, the team developed a technique using a microscope to identify pollution particles, made out of carbon, inside macrophages found in the lung. Macrophages carry out lots of jobs, one of which is to swallow up dangerous foreign particles from things like bacteria and pollution. They also serve as one of the lines of defense for the fetus. When the team used the same technique on the 3,500 placental macrophages they had collected from the women, they found these black carbon particles in 60 of them. And when they looked at two placentas with a higher-powered electron microscope, they again found these particles. Each placenta, on average, had about five square micrometers of the particles. “Our results provide the first evidence that inhaled pollution particles can move from the lungs into the circulation and then to the placenta,” said Norrice Liu, a pediatrician and clinical research fellow at Queen Mary University of London, in a statement. The team’s findings were presented Sunday at the European Respiratory Society International Congress. Because the research hasn’t been formally peer reviewed and published in a journal yet, it shouldn’t be accepted uncritically. And the researchers, as even they admit, still didn’t show any direct harm caused by these pollution particles. But the chances of harm aren’t exactly in dispute. “We do not know whether the particles we found could also move across into the fetus, but our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible,” said Liu. “We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby’s body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the fetus.” Plenty of studies elsewhere have shown that air pollution exposure in developing fetuses is linked to all sorts of health problems later on in life, including low birth weight, autism spectrum disorder, and obesity. While these studies emphasize the need to drastically clean up our air for the sake of our health, as well as the health of future generations, it’s unlikely any such efforts will get far in the U.S., at least under the current administration. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency openly admitted that its new proposed emission guidelines, which would roll back regulations for coal plants, would likely kill as many as 1,400 people annually by 2030.

But new preliminary research presented this week seems to provide direct evidence of how this damage can happen, via the placenta.

Jacob Kleinman,"If your Surface Pro 4 is starting to bug out, you’re not alone. Over a thousand people have reported issues with the Microsoft-made device ’s screen flickering to the point that it’s barely usable, and some have even taken to freezing the gadget to get it working again. One person claims they got 30 minutes of use after leaving the Surface Pro 4 in their freezer for 10 minutes. It may be a tempting fix if your only computer has suddenly stopped working, but leaving technology in the freezer can lead to all other sorts of permanent damage. If you’re holding out hope for an official Surface Pro 4 recall from Microsoft, it’s just not worth the risk. The main issue to consider is that internal hardware could freeze, even if you carefully wrap your device to keep out moisture. Then, when your Surface Pro 4 returns to room temperature, that ice could melt and cause damage inside the device. One forum poster on Super User puts it particularly well: “Think of a glass of water, it doesn’t ‘sweat’ when it’s in the fridge but you take it out on a hot day and it does.” The other concern is that leaving your Surface Pro 4 in the freezer for too long could damage the device’s screen by freezing the crystals in the LCD. If that happens, Microsoft may not be willing to pay for repairs despite the flickering issue. As for an official fix, Microsoft hasn’t offered much so far. In an official statement to The Verge, the company said it’s aware of the problem and “monitoring the situation closely.” The spokesperson added that if your Surface Pro 4 is flickering you should contact customer support. In the meantime, the company is offering display repairs, but they’re not cheap. (The device, which was released in 2015, is no longer covered by its warranty.) Some customers report paying Microsoft $800 for a screen repair, though the company’s website puts the price at $450. If enough people report the issue, Microsoft should eventually recall the faulty devices (we hope). For now, hang tight and please don’t freeze your Surface Pro 4.","If your Surface Pro 4 is starting to bug out, you’re not alone.

ANTONY J. BLINKEN,"Photo Rex Tillerson at his confirmation hearing in January. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Rex Tillerson, who has clashed with President Trump and may be fired soon, has presided over the hollowing out of the State Department. The exodus of senior and rising Foreign Service officers will debilitate American diplomacy for a generation. It’s hard to imagine doing more damage to an institution and less good for America’s standing in the world in such a short period of time. Meanwhile, Mr. Tillerson’s sound instincts on the substance of foreign policy were routinely undermined by Mr. Trump and his incontinent Twitter feed. Mr. Tillerson’s obsession with downsizing our diplomacy has colored his time at the State Department. Instead of defending the department against the White House’s proposed 30 percent budget cut, he embraced it. Fortunately, Congress stopped — for now — the gutting of our diplomatic, democracy and development programs. Mr. Tillerson imposed a hiring freeze, canceled programs to diversify the department’s personnel, left empty dozens of the most senior positions requiring Senate confirmation and encouraged officers to leave by dangling $25,000 buyouts. Equally damaging, Mr. Tillerson’s insular management style alienated or marginalized many of the department’s most experienced hands. He and the small team around him seemed to view foreign policy professionals as the enemy — a “deep state” opposed to Mr. Trump’s agenda. In this they were profoundly wrong. Over the past 25 years, I’ve worked closely with hundreds of Foreign Service officers and civil servants through Democratic and Republican administrations. To a person, they take pride in checking their personal beliefs at the department’s door and working for the success of whatever administration they serve. I could not tell you the political affiliation of any of the officers with whom I served. But instead of looping them in, Mr. Tillerson’s seventh floor locked them out of policy deliberations. The result was to deny Mr. Tillerson the intellectual capital he needed to succeed when policy was debated around the White House Situation Room table. And the department found itself grievously short-handed of the assistant secretaries and ambassadors who actually implement policy around the world. It’s hard to overstate the lasting harm Mr. Tillerson’s tenure will do to America’s diplomacy. Last month, Barbara Stephenson, the head of the American Foreign Service Association, reported that “our leadership ranks are being depleted at a dizzying speed.” Since January, the department has lost 60 percent of its career ambassadors — the equivalent of four-star generals — more than 40 percent of its three-star-equivalent career ministers and about 14 percent of its two-star-equivalent minister counselors. “Were the U.S. military to face such a decapitation of its leadership ranks,” Ms. Stephenson noted in a message to her members, “I would expect a public outcry.” And the number of people applying to take the Foreign Service entrance exam has dropped by more than 50 percent. The world does not organize itself. In the absence of an engaged, diplomatically energized America, others will set the agenda, shape the rules and dominate international institutions — and probably not in ways that advance our interests or values. America’s ability to mobilize others in the pursuit of common objectives will atrophy. And a whole host of challenges that require coordinated, collective responses — epidemics that defy frontiers, hackers who breach firewalls, terrorists who form global networks, aggressors who ignore borders, rogue actors who amass intercontinental arsenals, and an ocean that rises and a planet that warms — will go unmet.

MATT STEVENS,"The U.S.G.S. by about 6:15 p.m. had downgraded the shaking to “Intensity VI.” The prominent seismologist Lucy Jones warned on Twitter that that level of shaking “throws things off shelves and can damage poorly built structures.” As of about 6 p.m., more than 6,500 people reported having felt it. Maps provided by the U.S.G.S. indicated that light to weak shaking occurred as far south as Virginia and as far north as Connecticut. Most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains experiences earthquakes infrequently, the federal agency said. Perhaps as a result, people along the East Coast took to Twitter on Thursday to express their shock and amazement. “Ok so I’m not going crazy!” one woman in northern Delaware said.

ED O’LOUGHLIN,"Derry is a city moving forward, and no one wants this type of incident, said Elisha McCallion, a Sinn Fein member of Parliament from the area. It is not representative of the city. I would encourage anyone with information about this incident to bring it to the police.
The Provisional I.R.A. was the largest and most active armed nationalist faction during the Troubles. From 1968 to 1998, more than 3,500 people died in bombings and gun attacks linked to deep divisions between the predominantly Protestant unionists who supported Northern Irelands belonging to the United Kingdom and the mostly Roman Catholic nationalists who favored a united Republic of Ireland.
The Provisional I.R.A. formally stood down after the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998, but a number of splinter groups refused to recognize the accord and have continued to organize attacks on local rivals and on security forces, killing two British soldiers, two Northern Ireland police officers and two prison officers over the past 20 years.
Republican dissidents were blamed for an increase in unrest and rioting in the Bogside area of Derry City (which unionists prefer to call Londonderry) last summer, in which the police and motorists were attacked with rocks and sometimes gasoline bombs.
Declan Power, a Dublin-based security expert and lecturer, said that sporadic and usually localized violence could be seen as an attempt by splinter groups to recruit young followers and maintain an appearance of political relevance.
Dissident groups like the Real I.R.A. and the Continuity I.R.A. are active but not in a strategic direction, he said. Most of their activity is related to holding turf for organized criminal activities like drug dealing, and directed at feuding with rivals.
Every now and then there is an attempt to do something like this, he said of the bomb Saturday night, to retain their credibility as serious republican revolutionary movements.
Such violence is now receiving more attention than before, he said, because of fears that Britains likely exit from the European Union could lead to the reintroduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland, disrupting the constitutional arrangements that underpin the Good Friday agreement.","The explosive device caused no casualties or major damage, but after receiving a warning, the police evacuated children from a youth club and hundreds of people from a luxury hotel and a masonic hall before the device exploded.",2019-01-20T15:49:19Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Northern Ireland Car Bombing Leads to Two Arrests,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/world/europe/londonderry-bombing-northern-ireland.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/world/21Nireland/21Nireland-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,1
NICHOLAS BAGLEY,"That, too, was an outrageous position. It flouted the Justice Departments duty to defend, a solemn duty, and one that goes to the heart of the rule of law. Without it, the sitting administration could pick which laws it wanted to defend in the courts and which it wanted to abandon. Laws could rise or fall based on nothing more than partisan disagreement. Thats inconsistent with a constitutional system that assigns to Congress not the president the power to legislate.
And so, at the confirmation hearing on his nomination to become attorney general, Mr. Barr said that he would review the Justice Departments position in the Texas lawsuit. Apparently he did just that but instead of mounting a vigorous defense, he doubled down on killing Obamacare. Its as if Mr. Barr said to his predecessor, Jeff Sessions: You thought your position was crazy? Hold my beer.
Does the administration really think that the very position it advanced just months ago is so untenable that it must now adopt one that is even more extreme?
The shift in legal position wont make much of a difference in the lawsuit itself. Because a group of blue states has intervened, the appeals court will hear a full-throated defense of the law. Most observers expect the court to uphold the Affordable Care Act; if so, the Supreme Court may choose not to hear the case.
But the Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over; that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress; and that it doesnt care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone.
It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, whoreleased a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. Theyll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administrations zealous commitment to taking away their health care.
Along the way, the Justice Department has trashed the duty to defend. Thats not to be taken lightly. The duty is a close cousin to the presidents constitutional duty to enforce the law. If the Justice Department really thinks that Obamacare is so blatantly unconstitutional that it cant be defended, that implies that the president is violating the Constitution whenever he applies it.","It’s not just the potential damage to the health care system and the people who depend on it.

VANESSA FRIEDMAN,"There is nothing wrong with this, or with thinking about this; it doesnt reveal a superficiality or lack of substance, which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up. 
On the contrary, it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance, and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments, and how much can be delegated.
This should be something everyone can relate to, given the current craziness around dress codes in general, be it the complete nonsense of events that request creative dress or dress to impress or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing appropriately in an office setting, a word so vague that it is practically meaningless. (Yes, Goldman Sachs, this means you.) 
To a certain extent, we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction, as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work, putting an end to unspoken uniforms. 
Thats why stylists and personal shoppers have become such a booming business, increasingly famous in their own right. In many ways, politics has been the most insulated of all professions, but clearly, even that is changing.

Jason Schreier,"One of the things I love about Assassins Creed Odyssey, a game full of things to love, is this: You cant die from fall damage. No matter what. From the start of the game, your main character (Kassandra, or Alexios if youre basic) will take reduced damage from leaping off mountains or buildings, no matter the height. Then, at level 20, youll take no damage at all. Its a brilliant feature that, coupled with freeform climbing, encourages exploration in a way reminiscent of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You can wander in any direction youd like, moving up and down with no concern for how youll get back to where you started. This is a nice contrast to other massive role-playing games, like The Witcher 3, in which you star as a grizzled mercenary who can single-handedly defeat entire armies but dies if he jumps more than five feet. Daily thoughts from a Kotaku staffer about a game were playing. The logic behind fall damage in video games is twofold. One: it makes the world feel more realistic when you cant leap off huge mountains without dying. Two: it creates an artificial barrier to prevent the player from exploring and reaching places they shouldnt be reaching. Assassins Creed Odyssey wisely throws both of those rationales out the window, accepting the fact that a game about a woman who uses VR to travel back through time doesnt need to be too realistic, and that reaching places you shouldnt be reaching in a video game is actually pretty damn cool. If Assassins Creed Odyssey influences other game developers in one way, let it be this: Fall damage is bad and should go away forever.","One of the things I love about Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, a game full of things to love, is this: You can’t die from fall damage.

No one really knows what Amma’s deal is either, or if Camille is going to be able to handle the painful emotions that come with being back in her childhood home. No one knows much of anything. Except for one thing. Everyone knows Adora Crellin is a complete monster. SEE ALSO: The scariest part of 'Sharp Objects' isn't the murders. It's the teens. Seriously, what is Adora’s damage? She’s a horrible, person-shaped monster in a fluffy pink shell with zero redeeming qualities and the personality of an arsenic-laced Ladurée macaron. The fact that she managed to live long enough to have at least one adult daughter without the town coming for her in the middle of the night with torches and pitchforks speaks volumes about how messed up Wind Gap society is. It’s possible that the episodes in the latter half of the season will shed light on why exactly Adora is the way she is. But if the end of Episode 5 is any indication, her backstory will shine more light on her personal unwillingness to be anything but an emotional vampire, instead of engendering sympathy for her. To recap, episode 5 ended with Adora telling Camille that all of her darkness and strife comes from Camille’s mysterious father, in a conversation that is notably the first time she has mentioned anything about the time in her life that resulted in Camille’s birth. The glimpse into what happened between Adora and Camille’s father could have been a moment of honesty between mother and estranged daughter, but of course Adora is only in it to punish Camille for being, in Adora’s eyes, her father’s daughter. “That’s why I think I never loved you,” Adora says to her own child, “you were born to it, that cold nature. I hope that’s come comfort.” Somebody make sure that Mother of the Year award gets returned to sender. Adora is a horrible, person-shaped monster in a fluffy pink shell, with the personality of an arsenic-laced Ladurée macaron. The problem with Adora is that she is not only the premiere citizen of Wind Gap — she acts as if she is the town itself, a physical representation of its history and values, its secrets, glory, and pomp. In a way, she’s right, in that she comes from the town’s founding Calhoun family whose tragic history of sexual violation is (for whatever batshit reason) the cornerstone of the town’s public identity. Adora’s blood, her home, and her money are all connected to the effed-up mythology of Wind Gap. So perhaps it makes sense that she has no idea how to be a person and mother divorced from the ideals of a poisonous Missouri township. Watching Adora smile with pride as her youngest daughter participates in the town’s tradition of miming Millie Calhoun’s rape is a sickening visual that nonetheless clarifies her priorities. The Crellin family, née the Preaker family, née the Calhouns, exist to reflect and encapsulate Wind Gap’s disturbing values above all else. Adora’s prime directive in being the patron goddess of Wind Gap comes out in her overwrought parenting reactions, some of which are played for laughs but are mostly flat-out weird. Her obsession with blaming one or both of her daughters for the cut on her hand betrays her need to view herself as a fundamentally good person whose peace is only disturbed by the disharmonious actions of those who won’t follow the status quo. There’s a clear line between how she views herself and how she views Camille and the town murders. Wind Gap, to Adora, is a wonderful place that is being preyed upon by outliers like murderous truckers and a daughter who refuses to conform. She’s wrong, of course, on both counts. Wind Gap is actually a nasty place that is harboring a local psychopath, and the root of Camille’s problems is Adora’s lack of affection. But no one can tell her that. Especially not Camille. Camille’s birth, which the audience understands to have been out of wedlock when Adora was young, must have been a radical departure from that younger Adora’s prescribed job as the future doyenne of Wind Gap. Maybe her pregnancy forced Adora to submit to or choose the role she inhabits now, to be a slightly hated but always shining example for the women of the town, but in making that choice she also had to emotionally eliminate the one thing that contradicted with that image. Camille was born into the aftermath of that choice. She never stood a chance to gain Adora’s love because she was an outlier before she even took her first breath. Adora chose Wind Gap, and Alan, and Marion, and even Amma over her firstborn and Camille has suffered ever since. Damaged or not, chosen or choosing, Adora is a bad person and an even worse mother. She’s bad because Wind Gap is bad, and the expectations put on women in society are bad, and maybe her mother was pretty bad too. None of it excuses her from refusing to love her own child and continuing to reject Camille thousands of times over the course of her life. She’s a straight up bad mom. And as it usually is with most bad moms, her daughters are the ones who will have deal with the fallout from having been raised by her. Anyone else need an Evian bottle full of vodka?","More than halfway through HBO’s Sharp Objects, no one really knows who killed the girl whose violent death sparked the events of the series.

CORAL DAVENPORT,"At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a disproportionately rapid evacuation of people from the tropics. In some parts of the world, national borders will become irrelevant, said Aromar Revi, director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report. You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million. The report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold. In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found. All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off. For governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they dont have to make such rapid changes, Dr. Shindell said.

Timothy J. Seppala,"If you've played SotN or any of its contemporaries like Axiom Verge or Shadow Complex you know what to expect. Controls should be mostly familiar too. Using an Xbox-style gamepad for my demo, X handled attacks and A was for jumping, while magic attacks were mapped to Y and the right trigger. My admittedly brief demo took place on a boat infested by all manner of ghastly creatures. I went from room to room as protagonist Miriam; clearing out harpy-like creatures and hulking, headless suits of armor on the main deck with edged weapons and fisticuffs. I then jumped downward through platforms and took the fight to jellyfish and barnacle-covered cannons below decks. It's worth noting that I didn't encounter any of the ""get skill to unlock new area"" tropes the genre is known for. But with each new area I entered, the mini-map in the upper right corner of the screen filled in. Once or twice, it showed doorways that weren't visible in the game with my current loadout, a coy tease that there were plenty of secrets tucked away in the haunted ship. I leveled up a handful of times and found a bunch of new gear (including a pair of ""kung-fu boots"" that increased my kicking damage), too. When it comes to magic, spells are called ""Shards"" in Bloodstained parlance, and I unlocked both fire and ice incantations. Combat is light and quick, and the aforementioned ice magic attack can counter the possessed cannon's salvos. My only gripe is that I couldn't quite get the timing right to successfully evade incoming attacks. That the evade command (a quick jump backward) was awkwardly mapped to the left bumper button didn't help either. The placement is even more perplexing considering the B button doesn't have a function assigned to it. For run-of-the-mill enemy encounters it wasn't too big of a deal. Once I found a weapon that worked for my play style -- a rapier -- I didn't take much damage. Its longer range meant I didn't have to be nearly as close while attacking enemies, and thus, offered a bit of protection compared to attacking bare-handed. And, unlike the claymore which covered even more range and did more damage, the comparatively smaller sword wasn't slow to swing.","Castlevania: Symphony of the Night ( SotN ) is one of the most influential games ever made.

Sean Gallagher,"Enlarge / U-35 under construction at Kiel in 2013. The sub—like all the others in Germany's fleet—is currently in for repairs. reader comments 5 Germany has a submarine problem. During a test dive in October, the Deutsche Marine's U-35 struck something (probably a rock) with one of its four ""X-rudders,"" the steering planes on its rear fins. The damage required the submarine to be towed back to a shipyard in Kiel for repairs—where it joined three other German navy submarines currently drydocked. The U-35 was the Deutsche Marine's only working submarine prior to the collision. The remainder of the German submarine fleet is in port at the German naval base in Eckernförde—waiting for dry docks in Kiel to open up. Germany has a total of six submarines, all of the Type 212 class. These ""hybrid"" subs—also operated by the Italian navy—are powered by a combination of a diesel engine and nine proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. They are among the quietest, most advanced non-nuclear submarines in the world. Because their fuel cells are "" air independent propulsion "" (AIP), these subs can operate submerged for weeks without surfacing. And since the PEM cell ""engines"" have no moving parts other than the electrically powered screws, they're incredibly stealthy when submerged. They can also operate in waters as shallow as 17 meters deep (55 feet), making them ideal for patrolling the waters of the Baltic. But because of backlogs in repairs and a series of unfortunate events, only two of the Type 212 class are not currently under repairs—and they are not ready for active service: U-31, the class leader—launched in 2002—has just come out of major maintenance and has a year's worth of trials ahead of it before being returned to service. It has been out of service since 2014. U-32 had a battery casualty on a trip to Norway. U-33 is in the Kiel shipyard for maintenance until February of 2018 and will likely not be back in service until May or June. U-34 is due to start a yard period in Kiel in January, and it's not certain when it will return to service. U-36, the latest submarine built for the Deutsche Marine, was completed a year ago, but it is still in acceptance trials and is not expected to be fully active until May of 2018. The reason for the backlog: a spare-parts shortage that was exacerbated by cuts made to the Deutsche Marine's budget. To save money, the service stopped stockpiling spares for the complex systems of its subs, relying instead on either purchasing parts on demand or cannibalizing subs that were out of service—much like the US Navy has had to do as a result of budget sequestration over the past four years. As a result, Germany's entire submarine service is left essentially sitting on its hands through at least the first half of 2018.","Spare parts shortage, collision damage have sidelined entire sub fleet.",2017-12-19T20:25:33Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Das boot ist kaputt: German navy has zero working subs,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/das-boot-ist-kaputt-german-navy-has-zero-working-subs/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kiel_HWDW_U35-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,damage,0
Deanna Zandt,"What with the end of the world via climate change bearing down on us, it’s important not to just consider our own mortality, but the safety and comfort of our pets as well. Dogs that spend any amount of time outdoors especially need winter care, and while their paws have circulatory systems that help them manage cold weather, snow, ice and salt can do a lot of damage. You might think about Musher’s Wax on your pooch’s paws, or—especially you live in an area with very salty sidewalks—you might consider dog booties. I never thought I’d be that pet owner who puts boots on her dog, but seeing how uncomfortable salt made my dog, Izzy, I decided it was time to bite the (silly) bullet. First I researched what kinds of boots were suitable for my dog’s breed, because the size and shape of their paws and legs can make a huge difference in how well they stayed on. We landed on Pawz, which are disposable booties that are pretty much little balloons for your dog’s feet. They don’t provide cold insulation, but they do stop the salt from getting in and burning her skin. Getting these suckers on, though, can be a real challenge— especially if you don’t have the kind of dog that’s patiently and eagerly waiting for balloons to be strapped to her feet. Luckily, the internet giveth eternally. Googling for help led me to articles about using toilet paper or paper towel rolls to aid with bootie application—but those were too big for my 16-lb rat terrier, whose legs are really skinny. Searching around the house, I found something else that would be small enough and likely sturdier: an empty medicine bottle. This, it turned out, worked perfectly. Here’s how you do it: Choose a bottle with an appropriate diameter and length for your dog’s paw and leg. It should slide over easily, but not be so wide that when you roll the bootie off of it, it snaps onto your dog’s leg in an alarming and uncomfortable manner. Cut off the bottom of the bottle. (Leave the top part alone—that screwtop/lip maintains the bottle’s integrity.) Place the bootie on the end of the bottle that you just cut. Slide the bootied bottle up your dog’s leg. Roll the bootie off onto your dog’s paw, making sure to watch for dew claws getting caught. Slide the bottle off her leg, over the bootie. Adjust the bootie for a snug fit. Repeat, and give treats, as needed.","What with the end of the world via climate change bearing down on us, it’s important not to just consider our own mortality, but the safety and comfort of our pets as well.

But if your wheelchair is damaged, what kind of recourse do you actually have? And how do you report it to an airline? Heres everything you need to know when you find your wheelchair or scooter in bad shape after a flight.
Report the damage before leaving the airport
So whats the first thing you do when you notice your mobility equipment is a little worse for wear? According to Cory Lee, founder and writer at Curbed with Cory Lee, a website devoted to accessibility tips, the very first thing you should do is file a complaint about the damage with a Complaint Resolution Officer before leaving an airport (the better to prove that you didnt incur damage in ways unrelated to your flight).

Just ask to speak to an airline attendant about a disability-related complaint at an airlines baggage office and youll be connected (sometimes by phone) with a CRO who is equipped to deal with these issues. According to the Air Carrier Access Act, an act implemented by the Department of Transportation to prevent discrimination against those with disabilities, a CRO should be available to you at all times.
 Youll also want to take photos of the damage in case youre asked to provide additional proof down the line. If its internal damage, take a video displaying the issue. As Lee wrote on his website, youll also want to make sure the photo has a date and timestamp. He suggested taking the photo where an airline can easily determine the date, like taking a photo of equipment in front of airport screens where dates are visible, too. You should also record the name of your CRO and the time and date on which you made contact for safekeeping.
File a complaint with the Department of Transportation
When you make it home, youll want to file an Air Carrier Access Act violation with the Department of Transportation, Lee added. You can do so for up to 45 days after your flight. Its a pretty simple form that can be completed online, and airlines are required to respond. Ive filed numerous ACAA violation complaints over the years and in most cases, it was resolved within a month, he said. 
According to WheelchairTravel.org, the violation will be also indicated on Air Travel Consumer Reports (and airlines dont want this, so youll have the potential to inflict real change on the part of airlines everywhere).
In addition, you should follow up on your initial complaint with the CRO with a second, written complaint via an airlines website (airlines are required to respond, too). It cant hurt and you can ensure that anything you may have missed on the first complaint is addressed on your written one (and you can include any photos and documentation, as well).
Youre likely owed full reimbursement over damage
Thankfully, if you do find yourself with damaged equipment, youre usually entitled to payment, Lee said. The Air Carrier Access Act mandates that every airline pay an individual in the event their mobility equipment is damaged.
Typically, youll be entitled to the original price of your device. If repair costs are involved, youre entitled to reimbursement for that amount, too. As WheelchairTravel.org noted, airlines are also responsible for loaner equipment, in the event you need to purchase temporary devices. If its a small, quick fix, an airline may even compensate you on the spot (but if youre still unhappy, make that clear in your initial report with a CRO). According to Lee, a complaint filed with a CRO usually takes some time, but you will hear back.
 So while it does become an annoying waiting game, know that its not totally in vain. If you run into any trouble or have difficulty understanding the process, you can contact the U.S. Department of Transportation Disability Hotline at (800) 778-4838 with any questions, too.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","The correct positioning of a car seat chest clip is at armpit level, right between a child’s nipples. This isn’t a suggestion, but a non-negotiable. Car seat safety advocate Heather Starr explains why in this Facebook post showing the chest of three-year-old girl after she was in a car accident. There’s some bruising, but the little passenger wasn’t seriously injured. Starr writes: “Had the clip been placed lower, she likely would have had organ damage and internal bleeding. (Or even been ejected from the car!) Had it been placed higher, she could have been asphyxiated.” Hence that it’s important to take action when you have a kid who keeps sliding down the chest clip (and sometimes slithering their arms out of the straps) even after being instructed not to. This problem isn’t an uncommon one—stuck in some weird restraining system for extended period of time, it’s natural for children to become curious and fidgety and sometimes defiant. “Look, mama, I pushed it down!” my daughter once announced proudly while I was driving, before I knew she was capable of such a thing. At a stoplight, I had to reach back, slide it back up and tell her to never do that again. (She hasn’t, luckily.) The Car Seat Lady, a group that advocates for safe car travel with children, came up with a way to help parents with car seat “Houdinis,” as they call them: Try the button-down shirt trick. Here’s how it works: To use this tactic, of course, you’d have to either dress your kid in a button-down shirt or keep one in your car for this purpose. As The Car Seat Lady notes, it’s a good, temporary fix because most kids can’t undo small buttons until age four or five, and it doesn’t interfere with the performance of the car seat clip, unlike some other desperate measures parents have tried (like using duct tape or string). If the button-down shirt trick doesn’t work—and it may not for older children with special needs who are determined to break through it—The Car Seat Lady recommends this escape-proof chest clip and buckle guard. Know that the button-down shirt trick should be used in tandem with teaching your kids how to sit safely in their car seat. If they need something to play with on a long drive, try a toy instead.","The correct positioning of a car seat chest clip is at armpit level, right between a child’s nipples.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Coral reefs are facing a crisis thanks to an ever-growing list of threats, from climate change to ocean acidification to pollution. In an effort to stem the rising tide of damage, the National Academy of Sciences released a major report on Wednesday chronicling the high-tech interventions we might have to use to save coral. None of the solutions are close to ready for primetime, but the fact that the premiere scientific research institution in the U.S. is talking about them shows the urgency of the problem. Were losing reefs so fast, Coral Reef Watch program manager Mark Eakin told Earther. It is so critical that we do everything we can to keep coral reefs alive and healthy. There are two main avenues to save coral outlined in the report, which was commissioned the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which itself oversees Coral Reef Watch). One level is focusing on engineering the coral themselves. Research has been ongoing on this front for years as scientists seek to unlock the secrets of so-called super corals that can survive in hot water that causes other corals to bleach and die, or acidic seas that dissolve reefs. But the report also calls out more wild interventions including freezing coral embryos and sperm in an effort to preserve biodiversity, and thawing them out in a future, hopefully cooler climate. The report notes that scientists have successfully done this with 16 species of coral, but the risks remain high that the freezing process could damage their delicate cells. The other avenue to preserve coral is to somehow protect reefs themselves at a macro scale. That delves into the science fictional realm of geoengineering. Some ideas that have been put forward and even tested on a small scale include pumping up cooler water from the depths of the ocean, creating artificial shades to cool surface water itself or altering the chemistry of seawater to make it less acidic. The latter includes natural solutions like planting seagrasses as well as more out-there ideas like electrochemically splitting calcium carbonate to make the ocean more alkaline. The National Academies report is one of the most comprehensive syntheses of all the disparate methods that could help save reefs. A follow-up report will create resources for actually implementing some of these ideas in the real world to start to turn the coral death spiral around. Coral reefs have declined 30-50 percent in all corners of the ocean since 1980, a period that has seen three global coral bleaching events driven by hot seas. Those events will only become more common as the planet warms, meaning considering these types of interventions isnt just for fun. Its literally life and death for coral as well as the millions of people who rely on reefs for food, protection from storm surge, and their livelihoods. But the interventions are far from the only solutions needed to keep reefs around. This is by no means supposed to replace efforts that are occurring to reduce the level of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, Eakin said. Its not supposed to replace local actions to protect reefs. This is what you do to repair and keep reefs alive despite. Its far cheaper and easier to deal with the threats and reduce the chances that damage will occur than it is to rebuild the ecosystem.","Coral reefs are facing a crisis thanks to an ever-growing list of threats, from climate change to ocean acidification to pollution.

Andrew Webster,"Blizzard’s team shooter Overwatch is hitting a major milestone today with the official unveiling of Baptiste, the game’s 30th hero. Baptiste is a support character described as a “combat medic” who uses an array of gadgets to aid his team in battle. That includes a device called an immortality field that prevents nearby allies from dying, healing grenades, and Baptiste’s ultimate ability, described as “a matrix that doubles the damage and healing effects of friendly projectiles that pass through it.” The reveal follows a few days of teasing, including a short trailer yesterday. Baptiste joins an ever-growing cast of characters for the colorful shooter; last year saw the addition of the well-armored engineer Brigitte, a Wild West gunslinger called Ashe, and everyone’s favorite hamster Wrecking Ball. According to lead hero designer Geoff Goodman, the concept for Baptiste started around the idea of a “gadget healer” character. “We were playing with various gameplay concepts around deploying gadgets / devices as a way to support and heal your team,” Goodman tells The Verge. “From a pure gameplay standpoint, this hero was built to both give support players new options and gameplay to support their team, and also to appeal to players who might not play support often.” Baptiste joins a crowded field of Overwatch characters, and Goodman admits that it’s “an increasing challenge” to come up with new heroes that feel distinct. “We’re always wary about making heroes that overlap too much and don’t feel unique enough to stand on their own,” he says. That said, the designer believes that Baptiste’s unique healing abilities, combined with his combat skills — which include “an accurate hit-scan 3-round burst rifle” as a primary weapon — should provide plenty of new strategic options for players. Right now, high-level Overwatch play is dominated by a particular composition that combines three damage-absorbing tank characters with a trio of healing supports. It’s known as “goats,” and it’s particularly prevalent in the Overwatch League at the moment. Interestingly, Goodman doesn’t see Baptiste fitting particularly well in this composition; instead, the new support hero might shake things up a bit. “I think we’ll see Baptiste played with Ana for some longer range damage dealing and damage boost ultimate comboing,” says Goodman. “Ana can also fire through his ‘amplification matrix’ and get both boost healing and boosted damage, depending on who she hits. I also think its possible we’ll see Baptiste paired with Bastion, which can be really scary when you can buy him precious time with ‘immortality field’ and boost his already scary damage with ‘amplification matrix.’” (Goodman says that the design team has “an open line of communication with [professional] players, which can be helpful to gain their perspective of the game. Ultimately though, we’re designing heroes for everyone and hope players of all levels enjoy playing them.”) As for how Baptiste fits into the ever-evolving Overwatch lore, Blizzard describes him as a former soldier with a tragic childhood, who was forced to join the infamous Talon mercenary group. But when he realized the group was up to no good, he had trouble leaving. Per Blizzard: Talon would not let him go. Baptiste knew too much, and they sent operatives after him to silence him. Agent after agent came for him, including Baptiste’s former comrades. To stay under the radar, Baptiste drifted from place to place, aiding in humanitarian efforts around the globe. The few Talon members who managed to track him down were never seen again. Now, Baptiste works toward a better world, healing where he can and fighting when he must. He knows that he cannot undo his past — but that making a difference now is what matters. Or you can just watch yesterday’s teaser. Luckily you won’t have to wait long to try out the intriguing hero; Baptiste is available in beta today through Overwatch ’s public test region, with a full release to follow after.",Today Blizzard revealed the latest hero for its online shooter Overwatch: a character named Baptiste who uses an array of healing gadgets to offer new strategy for support players.,2019-02-26T19:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Overwatch’s 30th hero Baptiste is here to shake things up,https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/26/18234492/overwatch-baptiste-hero-reveal,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bi-q_IcQYXp3Sn11bdzJSz2Hm78=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14121846/OVR_Baptiste_Intro.png,the-verge,The Verge,damage,0
Tom McKay,"International shipping concerns are worried about a wave of major nautical blazes that have resulted in death and injury among crew as well as damage to ships and cargo running in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
Per the Journal, major fires at sea have included the loss of the Italian carrier Grande America, which sunk in the Atlantic in the Bay of Biscay with 2,000 cars on board, causing a massive oil slick and necessitating the rescue of dozens of crew members by a British naval frigate. The blaze started on March 10 and ended two days later with the loss of the vessel; afterwards, Porsche was forced to renew production of its limited run of 911 GT2 RS cars, of which four were on board.
It was the fourth such incident in the last four months, according to the Journal:
The disaster was the fourth big ship fire in the past four months, and followed a handful of fires last year that included one that heavily damaged the megaship Maersk Honam, owned by Denmarks A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the worlds largest container ship operator by capacity, and killed five crew members.
Maersk officials say the string of incidents is likely a coincidence, but it has raised alarms among operators, insurers and shipping customers, and focused more attention on the safe handling of the big quantities of goods that move on increasingly large and packed oceangoing vessels.
Another blaze overtook the Japanese car carrier Sincerity Ace on New Years Eve while 3,500 cars were on board, resulting in five deaths. In January, other incidents included a blaze on Hapag-Lloyds Yantian Express off the east coast of Canada, an explosion on Vietnamese tanker Aulac Fortune near Hong Kong that killed one sailor, and a fire on the Singapore-registered APL Vancouver near Vietnam that burned for days.
According to the Journal, no cause in the 2018 fire on board the Honam has been determined, but its operator, Maersk, has since banned stowing dangerous goods and those that could be difficult to extinguish if they caught fire under deck. Transport and logistics insurer TT Club told the paper they estimate approximately two-thirds of ship fires are the result of poor practice in the overall packing process of such dangerous cargo, which they said comprised six million containers annually or around 10 percent of all shipments. Out of those six million, 1.3 million are believed to be improperly stored or mislabeled, the Journal wrote.
The issue has grown worse in the era of mega-ships, the Journal added, because the scale of some cargo vessels (sometimes carrying tens of thousands of containers) means that screening cargo is more difficult:
Products like barbecue charcoal can burst into flames when the temperature rises and others like fish food and pool-cleaning agents generate oxygen that can intensify the blaze.
The National Cargo Bureau, a surveying body that assists the U.S. Coast Guard to enforce safe navigation, said 4% of 31,000 boxes it checked in 2017 contained dangerous cargo that wasnt properly secured... Another survey of 1,700 vessel stowing plans said 20% of the plans werent in line with existing dangerous-goods rules.
The numbers of containers and stow plans we check are very small, Ian Lennard, president of the National Cargo Bureau, told the Journal. So if you extrapolate them for the whole industry, the problem is immense.
Ship Technology wrote last year that misdeclared cargo is a major issue in maritime shipping, but also noted that regulations concerning fire suppression technologies in use on cargo ships were originally designed for smaller general cargo ships of a bygone era, and arent suitable for todays megaships. The publication noted that in particular, carbon dioxide systems used to flood cargo holds are often ineffective due to large amounts of oxygen held in containers, and that fires that move to deck are difficult to suppress. Fire detectors are also not mandated on deck, Ship Technology wrote, and on very large vessels that means crew may never see a fire before it develops into an inferno.
Massive fires on huge ships also raise serious environmental concerns, as toxic chemicals and other pollutants are often dispersed over a large area. According to Hakai Magazine, owners used to beach destroyed vessels or ship them to Africa or Asia to be junked, though they are increasingly deciding to clean up and repair the vessels rather than dispose of them.

Matt Novak,"Britain is scheduled to crash out of the European Union on Friday, potentially causing severe economic damage. But that hasnt stopped the British government from attending to other issues. Like proposing new rules that could make social media companies legally responsible for some content uploaded by users.
The British government released a paper this morning outlining its concerns about online harms, and expressing displeasure that voluntary efforts have not led to adequate or consistent steps to protect British citizens online. The paper explains that tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, need to do more to ensure that harmful content doesnt make its way to their platforms.
Parts of the paper were leaked last week but this is the publics first proper look at a proposed crackdown on social media companies that have become more and more popular with governments around the worldespecially in the wake of last months Christchurch massacre where a white supremacist terrorist killed 50 people in New Zealand and broadcast his attacks on Facebook.
For too long these companies have not done enough to protect users, especially children and young people, from harmful content, Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement to CNN. That is not good enough, and it is time to do things differently.
The new government paper proposes that a UK regulatory body should be set up to regulate online safety, though Prime Minister Mays government hasnt decided whether to give that responsibility to an existing organization or to create a new government body. The paper will be revisited by the government in 12 weeks time, assuming that Britain is still a thing by then.
One of the big issues thats addressed in the paper is what responsibility technology companies have to ensure that dangerous content, including everything from child pornography to terrorist recruitment materials, be restricted. American law, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, says that tech companies arent responsible for the content thats posted on their sites. Tech companies only have to remove illegal content once theyre made aware of it. The UK has followed a similar tradition over the years, but that could soon change.
The paper explains that social media companies in the UK currently have no responsibility to ensure that harmful content isnt on their platforms until theyre made aware of its existence. But the proposal would like to change some aspects of that.
From the paper:
 [C]ompanies will be required to ensure that they have effective and proportionate processes and governance in place to reduce the risk of illegal and harmful activity on their platforms, as well as to take appropriate and proportionate action when issues arise. The new regulatory regime will also ensure effective oversight of the take-down of illegal content, and will introduce specific monitoring requirements for tightly defined categories of illegal content. 
The proposal claims that harm is occurring on both public and private channels of communication, but acknowledges that its difficult to police private channels. The proposal explains that any requirements to scan or monitor content for tightly defined categories of illegal content will not apply to private channels.
One of the most alarming proposals for free speech advocates will likely be the disinformation sections of the new UK paper. The proposal includes measures that would require users not to misrepresent their identity on social media in order to disseminate or amplify disinformation and maintaining a news environment where accurate content can prevail. Obviously, both of those assertions are highly subjective and the former would require some kind of identity verification regime to enforce.
But governments around the world are increasingly frustrated by inaction in Silicon Valley and theyre sometimes willing to suppress lawful speech in order to move the balance of power. In Singapore, for example, the government has moved to outlaw fake news and allow officials to demand the removal of speech that it deems incorrect. But the big tech companies have called it an overreach that threatens free speech.
And even the United States is seeing a major backlash against speech online. Republican Congressman Devin Nunes recently filed a $250 million lawsuit against both Twitter the company and Twitter parody accounts for content that he claims is abusive, hateful and defamatory.
Currently, content that qualifies as parody is protected speech in the U.S. but that could easily change under the Trump regime now that the courts have been packed with increasingly conservative judges. President Donald Trump himself has called for action against both social media companies and the news media in general, which he calls the enemy of the people.
But President Trumps increasingly authoritarian rhetoric barely makes the nightly news anymore. And it seems that the U.S. could easily be next for imposing some kind of speech guidelines for tech platforms. Britain is just one of many countries that are looking hard at companies like Facebook.
The era of self-regulation for online companies is over, Jeremy Wright, Britains digital secretary, said in a statement to the New York Times.
Technology can be an incredible force for good and we want the sector to be part of the solution in protecting their users. However, those that fail to do this will face tough action.

While Title IX was not particularly controversial when enacted, arguments over it deepened through the years.

If I took the whole panoply of inequality and absolute criminal activity against women, he said in the 2010 interview, I think the most egregious conduct where the most damage was done by the way they were treated was in education. Many of the premier institutions wouldnt let women in. Others had quotas. Others would let women in but would confine them to the womens curriculum.
He credited his first wife with inspiring him to take up the cause. After meeting Marvella Hern at a national speech contest, which she won, he learned that she had wanted to enter the University of Virginia in 1951 but was told that women need not apply. (She attended Oklahoma State University instead.)
So, he said, I got a cram course on something I knew absolutely nothing about.
His education on the issue led to his memorable speech on the Senate floor two decades later. In it he derided the stereotype of women as pretty things who go to college to find a husband, go on to graduate school because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children and never work again.
The desire of many schools not to waste a mans place on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions, he said. But, he added, the facts absolutely contradict these myths about the weaker sex, and it is time to change our operating assumptions.","“If I took the whole panoply of inequality and absolute criminal activity against women,” former Senator Birch Bayh said in 2010, “I think the most egregious conduct — where the most damage was done by the way they were treated — was in education.”",2019-03-14T14:12:38Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Birch Bayh, 91, Dies; Senator Drove Title IX and Other Historic Legislation",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/obituaries/birch-bayh-dead.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/obituaries/00Bayh-10/00Bayh-10-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,damage,0
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy. A few, however, engaged in a pretty ugly form of victim-blaming; observing that the conservative districts that suffered damage voted for politicians who deny climate sciencethe implication being these Americans got what was coming.
At the time, Earther called out this sort of victim shaming as wrong and counterproductive. But we didnt have much evidence for how widespread such attitudes are. Now, a social scientist to whom we posed that question last October has gone and taken a first stab at answering it, and the result is both alarming and unsurprising: A lot of people think this way.
As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about

In fact, roughly a third of Americans who understand that climate change is real and driven by human activities agree with the idea that climate deniers get what they deserve when disasters strike their communities, according to the new research, which hasnt yet been peer-reviewed.
 We were not too surprised though we are a bit disappointed, Matthew Motta, a postdoctoral researcher studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author on the study, told Earther.
Motta and his colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis and Emory University used an online survey tool to poll 4,056 individuals. Respondents were first asked to identify their political leanings on a 7-point scale. The poll then asked whether they think climate change is real and human-driven. Those who answered yes were asked whether they agree with the sentiment that people who dont believe in climate change get what they deserve when natural disasters strike.
Of the 54 percent of respondents who were on board with the scientific consensusa fraction that tracks other national surveys but is a bit lower than one published last weekthe authors found that more than a third think climate deniers are getting their due when a hurricane flattens their town or a wildfire engulfs their city. Nearly 70 percent of these victim-blamers identified as Democrats, with more ideologically liberal respondents tending to dish the blame more. 
 While previous research has shown that people who hold strongly partisan views tend to dislike the other side more, this finding takes things a disturbing step further. As the authors put it, a substantial number of Americans are wishing, or at least accepting, physical harm as a sort of political retribution. And lest any right-of-center readers see this as vindication that the libs are a bunch of assholes, Motta pointed out that this sort of victim blaming likely isnt limited to Democrats. 
I think it would go the other way as well, he told Earther, citing violent crime as a potential issue that might engender ill will from conservatives if, for instance, the victim was opposed to carrying weapons. Thats a hypothesis he and his colleagues are planning to explore in future work, but one need look no further than Trumps awful tweets on Californias wildfires for evidence that partisan victim blaming is bi-directional.
While the findings should be taken with a grain of salt until the study is published in a peer-reviewed journal, if the truth is anywhere close to these survey results, its bad news. Not only is it deeply shitty to spit on others suffering, blaming people for their misery is, in Mottas extremely evenhanded assessment, not a solid science communication strategy. Communications experts often cite discussing shared values and common ground as effective strategies when talking about climate change with a skeptical audience. Shaming people for their beliefs is kind of the opposite.
Theres also the reality that those who suffer most from natural disasters generally have the least power to effect change in our global fossil fuel-driven energy system. With only a handful of years left to rein in the worst consequences of a warming climate, the only people we should be shaming are the oneswho got usinto this mess in the first place.","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy.

Rhett Jones,"Researchers at the non-profit AI research group OpenAI just wanted to train their new text generation software to predict the next word in a sentence. It blew away all of their expectations and was so good at mimicking writing by humans theyve decided to pump the brakes on the research while they explore the damage it could do.
Elon Musk has been clear that he believes artificial intelligence is the biggest existential threat to humanity. Musk is one of the primary funders of OpenAI and though he has taken a backseat role at the organization, its researchers appear to share his concerns about opening a Pandoras box of trouble. This week, OpenAI shared a paper covering their latest work on text generation technology but theyre deviating from their standard practice of releasing the full research to the public out of fear that it could be abused by bad actors. Rather than releasing the fully trained model, its releasing a smaller model for researchers to experiment with.
The researchers used 40GB of data pulled from 8 million web pages to train the GPT-2 software. Thats ten times the amount of data they used for the first iteration of GPT. The dataset was pulled together by trolling through Reddit and selecting links to articles that had more than three upvotes. When the training process was complete, they found that the software could be fed a small amount of text and convincingly continue writing at length based on the prompt. It has trouble with highly technical or esoteric types of content but when it comes to more conversational writing it generated reasonable samples 50 percent of the time. 
In one example, the software was fed this paragraph:
In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.
Based on those two sentences, it was able to continue writing this whimsical news story for another nine paragraphs in a fashion that could have believably been written by a human being. Here are the next few machine-paragraphs that were produced by the machine:
The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovids Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.
Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.
Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.
GPT-2 is remarkably good at adapting to the style and content of the prompts its given. The Guardian was able to take the software for a spin and tried out the first line of George Orwells Nineteen Eighty-Four: It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. The program picked up on the tone of the selection and proceeded with some dystopian science fiction of its own:
I was in my car on my way to a new job in Seattle. I put the gas in, put the key in, and then I let it run. I just imagined what the day would be like. A hundred years from now. In 2045, I was a teacher in some school in a poor part of rural China. I started with Chinese history and history of science. 
The OpenAI researchers found that GPT-2 performed very well when it was given tasks that it wasnt necessarily designed for, like translation and summarization. In their report, the researchers wrote that they simply had to prompt the trained model in the right way for it to perform these tasks at a level that was comparable to other models that are specialized. After analyzing a short story about an Olympic race, the software was able to correctly answer basic questions like What was the length of the race? and Where did the race begin?
These excellent results have freaked the researchers out. One concern they have is that the technology would be used to turbo-charge fake news operations. The Guardian published a fake news article written by the software along with its coverage of the research. The article is readable and contains fake quotes that are on topic and realistic. The grammar is better than a lot what youd see from fake news content mills. And according to The Guardians Alex Hern, it only took 15 seconds for the bot to write the article. 
Other concerns that the researchers listed as potentially abusive included automating phishing emails, impersonating others online, and self-generating harassment. But they also believe that there are plenty of beneficial applications to be discovered. For instance, it could be a powerful tool for developing better speech recognition programs or dialogue agents.
OpenAI plans to engage the AI community in a dialogue about their release strategy and hopes to explore potential ethical guidelines to direct this type of research in the future. They said they will have more to discuss in public in six months.

By Saturday, Cyclone Idai had dissipated, but not before causing widespread infrastructural damage throughout eastern Africa and claiming more than 200 lives,reports Al Jazeera.
The Mozambican city of Beira, the fourth largest in the country, is 90 percent destroyed, according to a preliminary estimate by Jamie LeSueur of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). With a population of more than 500,000, Beiras recovery is bound to be long: Aid workers couldnt reach the city until Sunday because flooding cut off roads, and IFRC team lead LeSueur said almost everything is destroyed. 
Mozambique had received some5.5 to 7.4 inchesof rain in 24 hours in the week before the storm even hit. Seven people died then, and more than 30,000 were already experiencing displacement, according to ReliefWeb. The cyclones heavy rainfallit was expected to drop up to 18 inches onto Mozambiquehas only made things worse. 
This cyclone was, indeed, unusual, as its the seventh cyclone in the Indian Ocean this season. Thats more than double the average for this time of year. Unfortunately, although the cyclone has fizzled out Mozambiques Institute of Meteorology expects conditions of extreme rain, thunder, and wind to persist throughout the country until Thursday.
Meanwhile, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs activated an international charter Monday, which should help agencies map out the damage and necessary response through satellite imagery. 
The United Nations is requesting $40.8 million in U.S. dollars for emergency relief. The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations has already allocated 150,000 Euros to Mozambique to provide shelter and health needs and another 100,000 Euros to help Malawi with relief efforts. 
So far, agencies estimate that the cyclone has impacted about 850,000 people in Malawi and Mozambiquehalf of whom are children. The flood waters have also taken down 145 houses and four major bridges in Zimbabwe, according to ReliefWeb. Schools and clinics have likely suffered extensive damage throughout the region, as have crops and local water supplies, per the World Meteorological Organization. Currently, healthcare and clean water are high priorities for government relief efforts, according to Al Jazeera.
Its hard to say whether climate change had an influence on this cyclone, which was big but not unprecedented for the region. Butthe strongest cyclones have grown more common in the Southern Indian Ocean since 1994, according to a 2018 study, and their frequency is likely to continue increasing as our oceans warm. Overall, climate change is forecasted put more pressure on southern Africa in the future, through more heavier rainfall events and more drought.

On Thursday, Patrik Maldre, an Estonian analyst at FireEye, gave a brief translation of an account of the man’s arrest in the Estonian newspaper, Postimees. Update on alleged FSB Agent in #Estonia : •20 yrs old •Entered Estonia legally •“Very good” IT skills •Trained &amp; instructed by FSB •Mission: Gain #cyber -enabled &amp; physical access to Estonian IT networks •Unsuccessful in all cases, monitored &amp; arrested https://t.co/1VqTiUxXkx — Patrik Maldre (@pmaldre) November 8, 2017 The man has reportedly been charged with ""Non-violent acts of an alien directed against the Republic of Estonia"" and ""Preparing a computer crime."" Potential Russian agents with technical skills is of particular interest both to American and Estonian authorities. Estonia has been particularly deft at ferreting out spies. In 2014, Estonia caught two former KGB officers on the Narva River. Russia has been long suspected of meddling in the 2016 American presidential election, particularly through faux accounts and ad buys on various social media networks. The Estonian government is particular sensitive to Russian activities, seeing as the countries are neighbors—Estonia was also occupied by the Soviet Union for half of the 20th century. Estonia was subjected to a nationalistic, politically motivated denial of service attack originating from Russia in 2007. ""Acting against the Republic of Estonia as an agent of the special service of a foreign country is without a doubt a serious crime, and we will figure out all the essential facts as soon as possible,"" State Prosecutor Inna Ombler told ERR, Estonia’s public broadcaster. ""Right now, we can say without releasing any details that greater damage was prevented.” ERR noted that Russian authorities, including the embassy in Tallinn, have been formally notified. ""Russia's diplomatic institutions are keeping a close eye on the development of the situation,"" the embassy told ERR. ""Our consuls are ready to provide assistance to the Russian citizen when a request from him to this effect is received."" On Thursday, Denis Mosyukov, press attaché of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, told TASS, the Russian news wire, that the embassy is helping the man get a lawyer and ""figure out what's going on.”","""We can say without releasing any details that greater damage was prevented.""",2017-11-10T10:45:20Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Estonia arrests suspected FSB agent accused of “computer-related crime”,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/estonia-arrests-suspected-fsb-agent-accused-of-computer-related-crime/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-657176662-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,damage,0
Reuters Editorial,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The United States’ sudden change of course on Syria is surprising and risks damaging the fight against Islamic State, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Thursday after the United States decided to withdraw from Syria. 
U.S. officials said on Thursday the United States would end its air campaign against Islamic State in Syria when it pulls out troops, sealing an abrupt reversal of policy which has alarmed Western allies as well as Washington’s Kurdish battlefield allies. 
“IS has been pushed back but the threat is not yet over. There is a danger that the consequences of this decision will damage the fight against IS and jeopardize the successes already achieved,” Maas said. 
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said the U.S. decision was a cause for concern and added that the decision did not make it any easier for the United Nations to achieve a good solution for Syria during negotiations on its post-war order. 
“The president has given his direction but the speed, format and consequences must now be urgently discussed with partners. I assume the Americans won’t withdraw in a mad rush but rather be aware of their responsibility not only toward their own troops but also toward others.”

The Pioneer,"While using teeth-whitening products can make your smile brighter, they might also lead to tooth damage, researchers have warned.
The study, led by researchers from the Stockton University in the US, found that hydrogen peroxide -- the active ingredient in whitening strips -- can damage the protein-rich dentin tissue found beneath the tooth's protective enamel.
Human teeth is made up of three layers -- the outer tooth enamel, an underlying dentin layer and connective tissue that binds the roots to the gum.
Unlike most studies which have focused on tooth enamel, the new study focused on dentin, which makes up most of the tooth and has high levels of protein -- most of which is collagen.
The team demonstrated that the major protein in the dentin is converted to smaller fragments when treated with hydrogen peroxide. In additional experiments, they treated pure collagen with hydrogen peroxide and then analysed the protein using a gel electrophoresis laboratory technique that allows the protein to be visualized.
""Our results showed that treatment with hydrogen peroxide concentrations similar to those found in whitening strips is enough to make the original collagen protein disappear, which is presumably due to the formation of many smaller fragments,"" said Kelly Keenan, Associate Professor at the varsity.
The researchers pointed out that their experiments did not address whether collagen and other proteins in the teeth can be regenerated, so it is unknown if the tooth damage is permanent. 
Further, they plan to characterize the protein fragments released when collagen is treated with hydrogen peroxide and determine if hydrogen peroxide has the same impact on other proteins in the teeth.
The findings were presented during the 2019 Experimental Biology meeting held in Orlando, Florida.","Whitening products may cause tooth decay Daily Pioneer Over-the-counter teeth whitening strips damage teeth and gums, warn experts News-Medical.net How whitening strips can damage your teeth Medical News Today Can Whitening Products Really Damage Your Teeth? …",2019-04-10T15:19:52Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Dailypioneer.com'}",Whitening products may cause tooth decay - Daily Pioneer,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/pioneer-health/whitening-products-may-cause-tooth-decay.html,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2019/story/images/big/whitening-products-may-cause-tooth-decay-2019-04-10.jpg,,Dailypioneer.com,damage,0

Beth Mole,"Enlarge / Picture of the US embassy in Havana, taken on October 3, 2017. reader comments 8 American victims of mysterious attacks in Cuba have abnormalities in their brains’ white matter, according to new medical testing reported by the Associated Press. But, so far, it’s unclear how or if the white-matter anomalies seen in the victims relate to their symptoms. White matter is made up of dense nerve fibers that connect neurons in different areas of the brain, forming networks. It gets its name from the light-colored electrical insulation, myelin, that coats the fibers. Overall, the tissue is essential for rapidly transmitting brain signals critical for learning and cognitive function. In August, US authorities first acknowledged that American diplomats and their spouses stationed in Havana, Cuba, had been the targets of puzzling attacks for months. The attacks were carried out by unknown agents and for unknown reasons, using a completely baffling weaponry. The attacks were sometimes marked by bizarrely targeted and piercing noises or vibrations, but other times they were completely imperceptible. Victims complained of a range of symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, headaches, balance problems, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nosebleeds, difficulty concentrating and recalling words, permanent hearing loss, and speech and vision problems. Doctors have also identified mild brain injuries, including swelling and concussion. White-matter changes are often seen following brain injuries, and the extent and duration of changes can determine cognitive impairment. That said, without brain scans and tests prior to the attacks, it’s difficult to know if the abnormalities were related to the attacks or if they are from previous injuries. None of the victims reported blows to the head, however. US officials now report that 24 Americans were injured in the attacks but wouldn’t comment on how many showed abnormalities in their white matter. The officials told the AP that most had recovered and some were even back at work. But about a quarter of the victims reported symptoms that were either persistent or took a long time to clear up. All of the victims will likely be tracked by doctors for life. Doctors treating the victims were tight-lipped about their treatments and findings, the AP said. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed concern for victim privacy and about releasing medical information that could reveal the effectiveness of the attacks. Nevertheless, doctors at the University of Miami and the University of Pennsylvania are working with government agencies to write up a report on the victims’ conditions and newly developed treatment protocols. Officials told the AP that the doctors would submit their report to the Journal of the American Medical Association. Meanwhile, FBI investigators and US intelligence agencies are still struggling to understand the mysterious attacks. The attacks were initially speculated to be “sonic attacks” based on audible noises heard by some of the victims. But scientists have largely ruled out the possibility that sounds could cause traumatic brain damage. The AP notes that shock waves from explosions in combat have been known to cause concussion and white-matter damage in soldiers. Of course, none of the victims reported experiencing an explosion. The agents behind the attacks and their motivation remain unknown. At the end of September, US officials drew down the staff at the US embassy in Havana due to the safety risks. The embassy is now operating only with emergency staff. In October, the US also expelled 15 Cuban diplomats over the issue, saying the Cuban government wasn’t doing enough to protect Americans there. In its report Wednesday, the AP quoted Secretary Tillerson as saying: What we’ve said to the Cubans is: small island. You’ve got a sophisticated intelligence apparatus. You probably know who’s doing it. You can stop it. It’s as simple as that. Cuba has denied any involvement with the attacks.","Authorities still stumped by attacks, but doctors are figuring out damage, treatments.",2017-12-06T19:25:03Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Victims of mystery attacks in Cuba left with anomalies in brain tissue,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/victims-of-mystery-attacks-in-cuba-have-anomalies-in-brain-white-matter/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-857224434-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,damage,0
John Timmer,"reader comments 0 Tuesday evening, Columbia University's Earth Institute hosted a panel that was meant to focus on an issue we're likely to be facing with increasing frequency: the need to move entire communities that are no longer viable due to rising seas or altered weather. But the discussion ended up shifting to how people in at-risk locations aren't moving, and the entire governmental structure in the US is focused on keeping them right where they are. As a result, the entire US population is already paying for climate change, whether we accept the science behind it or not. And things will almost certainly get worse. Staying put That's not to say that climate-driven migrations aren't an issue. They've happened in a number of countries, and the panel noted that China, in particular, has been fairly aggressive about moving communities that the government feels cost too much to support. It's also happening a bit in the US with coastal villages in Alaska and Louisiana. But the wildfires on the edge of urban areas in California provided the panel with a perfect backdrop: climate risks in areas we're not just going to walk away from. There was also the perfect panelist for this: Lisa Dale has tracked climate-related issues in the Western US. She said a number of trends are colliding out west. One of these is the warming and drying climate, which has led to a hotter fire season and produced fires that reach higher temperatures. As a result, the amount of the US Forest Service budget that goes toward firefighting has more than tripled from 16 percent to half the agency's budget. That drains its ability to take preventative actions on fire risks, even as many western states are seeing development on lands that border wilderness managed by the federal government. Despite all that (and the steady flow of images of destroyed homes), development isn't slowing down, and people who are living on the wildland-urban interface aren't thinking of leaving. Dale said that surveys of people who had actually lost their homes to fire indicated that more than 90 percent preferred to rebuild. Michael Gerrard said the responses to increasing flood risks aren't much different. Climate change is enhancing these through rising ocean levels, changing patterns of rainfall, and increased intensity of storms. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handles this issue, only evaluates flood risks based on historical events, even though climate change is altering those risks. Gerrard also called the results of FEMA's evaluations ""perverse,"" since declaring an area high-risk allows its residents to obtain federally subsidized flood insurance, in effect ""subsidizing continued development in high-risk areas."" A few years back, the government actually considered bringing the insurance costs up to something closer to market rates. But a huge outcry from those living in these areas caused Congress to back down, leaving this subsidy in place. And, as panel member Alex de Sherbinin noted, FEMA does not have the ability to do anything other than offer post-disaster response. No change in sight Overall, the panel saw little hope of the market or government shifting matters so that our housing better reflected changing risks—""markets haven't yet processed what's inevitable,"" as moderator Radley Horton put it. Mortgages ""are a barrier to property prices reflecting reality,"" Gerrard argued. Local governments don't want to deal with relocating anyone out of harm's way because it means they'll lose tax revenue. And the federal government has generally acted to block restrictions on land use. Which means that we're going to be stuck paying these costs for the indefinite future. Dale said that there had been some successes when it came to fire risks. Private insurance companies have brought rates up to match risks and compelled owners to take measures like clearing underbrush, while local communities have rolled out fire-education programs. But flood risks have proven much harder. There have been a few relocation programs, but Gerrard called them ""very few and very expensive."" Yet, unlike the erratic danger of wildfires, the rising oceans can't really be handled in a way that minimizes risk. Horton said that it's estimated that about two million US residents will need to be relocated before the century's out due to rising oceans, and, if that rise accelerates faster than we expect, we could be looking at situations like the complete loss of far-southern Florida. At that point, the societal costs for our policy decisions get quite a bit larger.","When it comes to floods and wildfires, the damage is shared with the public.",2017-12-06T22:28:36Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",We’ve all managed to end up paying the costs of climate change,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/weve-all-managed-to-end-up-paying-the-costs-of-climate-change/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/710937main_climate-fire-lg-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,damage,0
Ed Cara,"New research funded by the National Institutes of Health suggests an experimental drug can slow down the brain damage caused by a form of multiple sclerosis (MS), an incurable neurological disorder that eats away at the protective coating of our nervous system. But it’s still unclear whether the drug can noticeably improve the crippling symptoms sufferers experience. The long arms, or fibers, of most neurons are covered with something called myelin. Myelin doesn’t just protect our nerve fibers, though, it boosts the speed of the electrical signals that neurons use to communicate with one another. People with multiple sclerosis have a mutinous immune system that goes after and destroys myelin, wreaking havoc on the central nervous system. This damage shows up as lesions and chronic inflammation that gradually shrink brain tissue. There is no clear cause of MS, though factors like infections and genetics are thought to play a role. The symptoms of MS, which include muscle weakness, constant fatigue, and trouble walking, can be devastating but unpredictable. Most victims have an initial acute attack that lasts for a few days, then disappears. From there, people will experience flare-ups of the disease, followed by remissions of symptomless months or even years. But around 10 to 20 percent of MS sufferers experience a primary progressive form of the disease, meaning their symptoms continuously get worse from the start, with few—if any—periods of remission. There are some medications available to treat the former type of the disease, known as relapsing-remitting MS. These drugs can reduce how often attacks happen, as well as their severity. But there had been little help for people with primary progressive MS for decades. In 2017, the antibody-based ocrelizumab became the first FDA approved drug for both forms of the disease. The experimental drug, known as ibudilast, is approved in Japan as an medication for asthma and dizziness, but has never been approved in the U.S. for any condition. It was tested out in a Phase 2 clinical trial, called the SPRINT-MS trial. More than 250 patients with primary progressive and secondary progressive MS (a later stage of the disease that many with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop) were randomly assigned to receive either ibudilast or a placebo. Both groups took their medication daily for nearly two years, and were routinely subjected to brain scans every six months. These scans showed that people on ibudilast had noticeably less brain shrinkage than did those on placebo. On average, ibudilast patients had about 2.5 milliliters less brain tissue loss than the control group, or around a 50 percent difference in the rate of brain loss. The findings were published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. “These findings provide a glimmer of hope for people with a form of multiple sclerosis that causes long-term disability but does not have many treatment options,” said Walter J. Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, in a statement. Phase 2 trials aren’t intended to definitively tell us if a drug actually works, but rather, if it’s safe for patients to use. And on that aspect, ibudilast also passed. People on the drug did experience more side-effects than the placebo, such as headache, depression, and gastrointestinal symptoms, but they were largely tolerable. However, it’s not still known if people taking ibudilast will have any improvement in the course of their symptoms or overall brain function. Those questions will, hopefully, be answered in the near future. “Our hope is that the benefit of ibudilast in slowing brain shrinkage will also translate to decreased progression of associated physical disabilities in a future phase 3 trial.” lead author Robert Fox, vice-chair for research at the Cleveland Clinic’s Neurological Institute in Ohio, said in a statement. It’s estimated that 400,000 Americans currently have MS, with more than two million cases worldwide. And while the disease isn’t immediately fatal, people with MS are known to live seven years shorter than average, often with a much worse quality of life.

Jessica Conditt,"Clunker Junker is a cooperative space shooter for two players. Each crew member has a handheld, gun-like controller that stretches from palm to elbow; it's made to be held in the left hand, with a crank on the right side, a navigation cube on the base, and an LED spout on the front. The spout fits into openings in the four crates, representing different aspects of the spaceship -- movement, shields, weapons and engine. Players stick their navigation cubes into squares cut in the top of two of the boxes; one person controls where the ship goes while the other manages the direction of the turrets. When the on-screen ship takes damage (and, trust me, all Clunker Junker players will take damage at some point), flaps on the front of the affected boxes slam down, their innards glowing red and demanding repairs. Fix up the ship by sticking the LED gun into the appropriate hole and turning the crank until the box glows green again. Then close the flap and get back to steering the ship or shooting with the turret -- or fixing whatever else has broken in the interim. Clunker Junker is a fast-paced, communication-driven video game that doubles as a solid arm workout. Its creators at experimental studio HNRY know how to build physical experiences with real impact: Last year, they took home the alt.ctrl.GDC award at the Independent Games Festival for their Fear Sphere project.

Ed Cara,"Since the earliest days of mobile phones, a small but steady contingent of environmental activists, conspiracy-inclined folks, and some scientists have warned about the hidden damage they could be causing to our bodies, due to the radio frequency energy cellphones use to communicate with cell towers. They fear that this non-ionizing radiation could penetrate our cells and cause damage, increasing our risk of brain and head cancer. But scientists elsewhere have dismissed this potential link as, at best, unproven and, at worst, utterly implausible. In a surprising move this week, however, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) weighed in on the debate, warning people, especially kids, to stay away from cellphones whenever possible. The agency also issued guidelines on how to reduce exposure to radio frequency energy. “Although the science is still evolving, there are concerns among some public health professionals and members of the public regarding long-term, high use exposure to the energy emitted by cellphones,” Dr. Karen Smith, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer, said in a statement. Aside from brain and head cancer, the guidelines note, radio frequency energy has been suspected of causing infertility, headaches, and memory or learning problems. The release of the guidelines hasn’t come without its share of drama. In 2014, KCRA reported, Joel Moskowitz, the director of University of California Berkeley’s Center for Family and Community Health at the University’s School of Public Health, sued the CDPH after they refused to make public a draft of the guidelines they had first developed in 2009 but chosen to hold back. In legal briefs, the agency argued that the guidelines might have confused and alarmed the public since it then resembled guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The courts ruled in Moskowitz’s favor, and earlier this March, the CDPH released a draft, updated as of 2015, to the San Francisco Chronicle. The current guidelines are a bit more extensive than the 2015 draft, including more steps on how to avoid radio frequency exposure. They include keeping your cellphone off your body, keeping it away from your bed at night, and removing headsets when not on a call. It also advises not using the phone when the signal is weak and not using your phone to stream music and video or download large files—activities that can increase the amount of radio frequency energy cellphones emit. And it warns people not use products advertised as radio frequency blockers, since some of them might actually raise your exposure levels. Of course, there’s still the larger question of who to believe about cellphones. The World Health Organization has categorized radio frequency energy as a Class 2B environmental agent, meaning it might be “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration’s official stance is “that the weight of scientific evidence does not show an association between exposure to radio frequency from cellphones and adverse health outcomes.” And even throws shade at the WHO by pointing out that coffee, power lines, and talc powder are also Class 2B agents. For now, it’s fair to say there hasn’t been a smoking gun piece of research tying cellphones to brain cancer. And while there’s unlikely to be a study that definitively disproves such a link (it’s hard to prove a negative), the scales do lean pretty heavily toward cellphones being safe to use. Then again, there’s also no harm in using your cellphone less, and given that we’re starting to find that too much screen time can be bad for our mental health, especially for teens, it might be worthwhile to spend more time away from your phone anyway. Those inclined to wait for a better answer, though, might want to keep an eye on the COSMOS project, an ambitious study currently tracking the cellphone usage and health of more than a half million people scattered across Europe. The study, which began in 2007, will follow these people for the next 20 to 30 years.","Since the earliest days of mobile phones, a small but steady contingent of environmental activists, conspiracy-inclined folks, and some scientists have warned about the hidden damage they could be causing to our bodies, due to the radio frequency energy cellp…",2017-12-15T23:40:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",California Warns People to Limit Exposure to Cellphones,https://gizmodo.com/california-warns-people-to-limit-exposure-to-cellphones-1821342200,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--_pP9Htix--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/vpqyen36cnrtg8m7u0wh.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,damage,0
Ron Amadeo,"reader comments 13 Coming soon to a smartphone near you: it's Gorilla Glass 6, the latest version of Corning's ubiquitous smartphone display cover. Gorilla Glass typically sits between the display and the outside world protecting your precious pixels from damage and receiving touch input. Lately, manufacturers have been using it for the back of the phone, too. Every year, Corning says the newest version of Gorilla Glass is better than last version. Gorilla Glass 4 survived drops ""up to 80 percent of the time"" when dropped ""face down from one meter,"" while Gorilla Glass 5 survived "" 80 percent of the time"" from 1.6-meter drops onto a rough surface. This new glass concoction is designed to take multiple drops, though, with Corning saying it can survive ""15 drops from 1 meter onto rough surfaces."" (One meter is a little more than three feet.) This year, the company is tackling repeated damage that is inflicted on a display. While a brand new piece of Gorilla Glass might survive any single drop, the micro abrasions incurred from multiple drops weaken the display panel and make it more likely to break next time.

Rhett Jones,"For more than 18 months, US diplomats have come down with similar illnesses that include mild brain damage and hearing loss after they claim to have heard unusual sounds. The incidents began in Cuba but reports have now spread to other countries. As authorities have ramped up efforts to treat any potential cases, almost 200 people have reportedly come forward to be tested. The State Department has had little to say about the incidents that began in Havana in the fall of 2016, and the resulting information vacuum that has left the door wide open for conspiracy theories and other unverified claims. For now, no one can say for certain what is happening in these cases, but it appears US diplomats are being targeted in some sort of attack that’s left experts baffled. In the beginning, officials believed that some unknown “sonic device” was being used against the victims, but other theories have emerged in the meantime. Some American diplomats reported hearing strange sounds, of which an audio recording was later released to the public. Symptoms varied between victims but the list included “hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, balance problems, visual difficulties, headaches, fatigue, cognitive issues and sleeping difficulties.” Since then, we’ve seen reports of diplomats falling ill in China. On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that 26 Americans have been “medically confirmed” to have been injured in wave of incidents, and diplomats who have served in at least seven cities in four countries have sought testing. Nearly 200 employees from the US diplomatic mission and their family members have elected to take part in a new screening program that US officials, speaking anonymously, told the AP is part of “an abundance of caution.” Of those Americans, fewer than a dozen were said to have been transported to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for further review by medical professionals. The AP described a previously unreported incident that had officials worried about President Trump’s recent visit with Kim Jong-Un: As President Donald Trump was heading to Singapore for a historic summit with North Korea’s leader, a State Department diplomatic security agent who was part of the advance team reported hearing an unusual sound he believed was similar to what was experienced by U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China who later became ill. The agent immediately underwent medical screening — part of a new U.S. government protocol established to respond to such potential health incidents anywhere in the world. And while the president was flying to the Southeast Asian city state, the U.S. delegation preparing for his arrival was exchanging urgent messages with the State Department headquarters back in Washington, including the agency’s Diplomatic Security and the U.S. Secret Service. Four US officials told the AP that it turned out to be a false alarm, but there is a heightened awareness among security officials as the White House prepares to meet with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin next month. Suspicions of Russian involvement in the attacks were raised last September when an unnamed USAID officer and his wife were flown out of Tashkent, Uzbekistan for evaluation after they reported events that echoed what happened in Havana. The State Department later said that it isn’t “going to discuss ‎every case individually,” but “We can confirm that there was no incident in Uzbekistan.” At this point the only medically confirmed cases have occurred with diplomats stationed in Cuba and one stationed in China. The US has issued an alert warning Americans traveling to China to seek medical attention if they experience “auditory or sensory phenomena” similar to what was reported in Havana, and the State Department recommended anyone traveling to Cuba should “reconsider” their plans. Since reporters first blindsided spokesperson Heather Nauert with questions about the incidents last August, the State Department has been reluctant to give on-the-record details about its investigation. It still refers to these cases as “specific attacks” without saying what is specifically happening. We’ve seen numerous theories for what could cause these kinds of symptoms floated over the last year, including weaponized microwaves or radio waves and malfunctioning surveillance gear. The fact that they don’t know how the attacks occur tends to obscure the fact that we don’t know why they’re occurring in the first place. What does seem to be clear is that authorities are so concerned that they’re rushing to address any potential incident that arises. And the longer the mystery goes on, diplomats abroad are only more susceptible to private fears that they may be a victim.

Kris Holt,"The latest patch also adds a new car, weapon attachments and a designated marksman rifle, as well as some weapon balance changes. Pistols deal a little more damage and most sub-machine guns received a boost. On the other hand, several shotguns and assault rifles now deliver one fewer damage point per round. The map selection option distinguishes PUBG slightly from other popular shooters, since Fortnite has just one ever-changing map and Overwatch players have no choice over the map into which they're funneled. Organizing players into separate queues might lead to longer wait times for a match, especially if there's a big imbalance in the number of people trying to get into one map. Some players hated Miramar so much they deleted the map from their game files to avoid playing on it, so map selection is likely to prove a popular feature. PUBG also has a new War Mode event, in which 10 teams of five duke it out on Miramar. After each death, players respawn on one of the planes that fly over every 40 seconds and drop in with a gun, grenades, helmet and vest already in their inventories. Teams earn points through kills and knockdowns, and the first squad to 200 points wins. Finally, PUBG has placed a temporary block on players trading items outside of the Steam market. The ""personal trade"" feature was intended to let friends swap items without any money changing hands, but, inevitably, some players sold their skins through third-party sites.

Tom McKay,"California’s devastating Carr Fire is now measured to have spread to over 89,000 acres on Sunday, resulting in at least five deaths, hundreds of destroyed structures, and severe damage to western parts of the city of Redding after it ravaged the nearby communities of Shasta and Keswick. Per SFGate, officials now say that the blaze destroyed 517 structures, damaged 135 others, and some 5,000 others are now at risk of being burned down. The five deaths included Melody Bledsoe and her young great-grandchildren Emily and James Roberts, whose bodies were found in their home in Redding. Two firefighters, bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith of Pollock Pines and Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke, also lost their lives, SFGate wrote: Steve Crawford from Cal Fire described it as “unprecedented. It’s burning in every direction all at the same time.” The neighborhood where Bledsoe and her great-grandchildren died experienced what officials described as a “flash fire,” leaving residents little time to escape. “It was probably the scariest thing I’ve ever seen,” said Redding Police Chief Roger Moore, who lost his own home in the River Ridge district while he was patrolling the area Thursday. Additionally, SFGate wrote Redding officials have received reports of looting. According to the LA Times, the Carr fire is just five percent contained despite the continual efforts of 3,400 firefighters and is still headed towards “residential areas west and south of downtown Redding.” Some 38,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders, with 260 National Guard personnel deployed to enforce those orders and staff roadblocks. At least 13 missing persons are reported, Sgt. Todd Cogle told the paper, though early indications are that some of those are safe and may have had to flee their homes without notifying friends or relatives. A number of other fires are burning across California at the same time, some large enough to result in their own states of emergency. Those include the largely uncontained Cranston Fire some 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles and the Ferguson Fire in Yosemite National Park, the latter of which will take at least two weeks to control. Though the cause of the Carr Fire has been widely reported to be a vehicle malfunction on Highway 299, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Times that vegetation across the state is already “explosively dry,” having reached that state months before the worst heat waves typically arrive in September. Research has shown the Western wildfire season is now much longer and resulting in bigger blazes. “It’s a lot easier to get bad fires under these conditions,” Swain said, “because you don’t need as much of a push from the winds.” “We now have very strong evidence that global warming has already put a thumb on the scales, upping the odds of extremes like severe heat and heavy rainfall,” Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh told the Associated Press. “We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet.” The AP wrote the fire is part of a nationwide trend of larger, more destructive wildfires linked to a changing climate: In the United States on Friday, there were 89 active large fires, consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years. Experts have also pointed to explosive urban growth into areas which were formerly wildlands across California, resulting in more human exposure to wildfires. Capital Public Radio writes : Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics, said extreme fires such as these will become more common in California’s populated areas... “I think the trend is really that we moved into the wildlands, more than that the fires from the wildlands moved into our space,” Gilless explained. [The California state government] can lessen their severity, Gilless said, by thinning forests, strengthening building codes for new and existing homes and making roadways and utility corridors safer. Climatologist Bill Patzert warned the LA Times that with the highest temperatures not expected to arrive until closer to September, the worst is yet to come. “The large picture, of course, is that we’re living in a warmer world,” Patzert said. “Temperatures are much higher this summer—next summer—than they were 50 or 100 years ago.” [ SFGate / LA Times ]","California’s devastating Carr Fire is now measured to have spread to over 89,000 acres on Sunday, resulting in at least five deaths, hundreds of destroyed structures, and severe damage to western parts of the city of Redding after it ravaged the nearby commun…",2018-07-29T17:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","California's Devastating Carr Fire Is Now at Least 89,000 Acres, With Five Dead and More Missing",https://gizmodo.com/californias-devastating-carr-fire-is-now-at-least-89-00-1827955856,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---ZXNcmXH--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/aevy2wcrvdycvdbgff4k.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,damage,1
Tom McKay,"Facebook has been taking a lot of heat for myriad controversies in the US, including its jaw-dropping data privacy screwups and allegations it is maybe wrecking democracy by helping fuel online echo chambers. But as skeptical as many stateside are getting of Mark Zuckerberg and crew, the company’s role doing damage in other countries is beginning to attract more scrutiny. According to a Saturday report in the New York Times, participants on both sides of Sri Lanka’s ongoing tensions between the majority Sinhalese Buddhist population and the country’s Muslim minority have become intimately familiar with the way Facebook can be used to perpetuate conflict. While Sri Lanka’s long-running civil war between the government and Tamil separatists ended in 2009, in its wake ethnic persecution has grown to the point where the government was recently forced to declare a state of emergency. The situation is particularly bad because, as the Times detailed, for many Sri Lankans Facebook is for all purposes their primary portal to the internet, and the company has made little effort to act as a responsible gatekeeper: Time and again, communal hatreds overrun the newsfeed—the primary portal for news and information for many users—unchecked as local media are displaced by Facebook and governments find themselves with little leverage over the company. Some users, energized by hate speech and misinformation, plot real-world attacks. A reconstruction of Sri Lanka’s descent into violence, based on interviews with officials, victims and ordinary users caught up in online anger, found that Facebook’s newsfeed played a central role in nearly every step from rumor to killing. Facebook officials, they say, ignored repeated warnings of the potential for violence, resisting pressure to hire moderators or establish emergency points of contact. In the Facebook-fueled popular imagination, the Times wrote, one small town named Ampara became the “shadowy epicenter of a Muslim plot” to destroy the Sinhalese population. In one particularly notorious incident, a family of Tamil-speaking Muslims who ran a restaurant there became involved in a dispute where an angry customer believed that they had put sterilization pills in his food—almost certainly something he had seen in a viral Facebook meme. An angry mob beat the man running the register, Atham-Lebbe Farsith, and then “destroyed the shop and set fire to the local mosque.” Farsith now has to hide because he is recognizable to many from a misleading Facebook video suggesting he really did put a sterilization pill in the food. In other cases, Sinhalese extremists have posted photos of improvised weaponry to Facebook and subsidiaries like WhatsApp before deadly riots. While Facebook is sometimes compared to an absentee landlord in developing countries where it has displaced traditional media yet has little on-the-ground presence, this passage in particular makes it sound a bit more like a guy selling cigarettes to minors: But where institutions are weak or undeveloped, Facebook’s newsfeed can inadvertently amplify dangerous tendencies. Designed to maximize user time on site, it promotes whatever wins the most attention. Posts that tap into negative, primal emotions like anger or fear, studies have found, produce the highest engagement, and so proliferate. This sort of thing sounds exactly like what’s happened in Myanmar, where activists have accused Facebook of doing nothing to moderate content. As a result, the site is spreading disinformation and propaganda, building much of the furor behind the ethnic cleansing of the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Social media analyst Victoire Rio told BuzzFeed the company’s response was “grossly insufficient” and “only reinforces our belief that Facebook is not doing anywhere near as much as they should and could do to prevent the spread of hatred in Myanmar.” In Indonesia, the Times added, rumors of outsiders kidnapping children as part of organ-harvesting rings spread rapidly on Facebook, and as a result, “locals in nine villages lynched outsiders they suspected of coming for their children.” Similar rumors ended up with similar results in India and Mexico. When Sri Lankan researchers with the Center for Policy Alternatives and government officials asked for help, Facebook directed them to the reporting tool; it’s unclear how many Sinhalese-speaking moderators the site has, but 25 such positions have been unfilled since June 2017. “You report to Facebook, they do nothing,” Center for Policy Alternatives researcher Amalini De Sayrah told the Times. “There’s incitements to violence against entire communities and Facebook says it doesn’t violate community standards.” Sometimes, Facebook uses entire countries as testing grounds for changes to their platform—like in 2017, when the company rolled out changes to the news feed segregating posts from most Facebook Pages including media organizations in a separate feed in six countries including Sri Lanka. The result was plummeting engagement, and the Times writes one possible effect of that experiment was fewer people reading credible news even as attacks on Muslims in Sri Lanka were reaching a fever pitch. Even turning off Facebook doesn’t work: When the government blocked the site earlier this year as part of emergency measures, the Times wrote an estimated three million users simply turned to VPNs to gain access. While Facebook didn’t create ethnic tensions in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, or elsewhere, it’s becoming clear that the company’s role as a gatekeeper for millions of internet users is also coming with responsibilities it is either ill-equipped to handle or simply wants to brush off. Even in the US, where it was founded, the company has been largely opaque about its rules and how it implements them, and it’s repeatedly punted when asked to do more content moderation or flag misinformation on the platform.

Bryan Menegus,"Since news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Facebook has been running damage control: public apologies, a hasty ad campaign, and reportedly delaying the launch of its voice assistant-enabled home speaker. Now we know what that device might have looked like. Made public today, a patent application simply titled “Electronic Device” shows what appears to be Facebook’s competitor to Google Home and Alexa. The application, which was filed December 29, 2016, contains no information on the internals or capabilities of this device. Rumored among the features for the home speaker was a touch screen. And although this gadget’s final illustration is technically labeled as the “bottom,” there appears to be a screen with a row of buttons running across it. The configuration of parts on the “bottom” are also a oriented in a way that suggests it’s supposed to be placed vertically along its flatter edge. Unlike the Alexa Show, which has its speaker ports beneath its screen, the array of 44 holes shown on the device’s top suggests Facebook’s speaker might have worked horizontally (voice-only) or vertically (with video). Bear in mind, however, that there’s no way of knowing if this design represents anything close to a final product, or if it’s simply one of many designs that Facebook has mocked up. Facebook rightly intuited that consumers were not keen to share even more personal data with the company in light of recent events, and currently its home speaker is reportedly delayed until later this year at the earliest.","Since news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Facebook has been running damage control: public apologies, a hasty ad campaign, and reportedly delaying the launch of its voice assistant-enabled home speaker.

Ed Cara,"The destructive shadow sometimes cast by our genes extends even longer than we assumed, a new study published recently in Science suggests. Rare, undetected gene mutations may help explain some people’s common conditions like kidney damage, heart failure, and infertility. We typically think our genes can harm us in one of two broad ways. Certain combinations of genes can collectively raise our risk for conditions like obesity and autism, when combined with other factors like our lifestyle or early environment. Or more classically, a disease is thought to be clearly caused by a single wayward mutation in either one or both copies of a gene (one copy of every gene is typically passed down from each parent). These diseases, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia, are known as a Mendelian disorder. But the researchers behind this new study say their findings upturn this popular narrative, while also suggesting that many people’s health problems brought on by single-gene mutations are getting misdiagnosed. The researchers first created a formula that calculated how likely it was that someone had a disease caused by a single gene mutation, based on their diagnosed symptoms. Then they used this formula, which they called a phenotype risk score (PheRS), to perform a unique excavation of anonymous electronic health records. The records, aside from including the patients’ medical history, also contained their genetic data. They studied 21,000 people, all of European descent, and mapped out their risk scores for over 1,200 genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and Marfan Syndrome. These diseases are caused by variations in more than 1,000 genes. So the researchers looked at 6,000 rare variants of these specific genes to see if they were associated with the disease. Some of these variations are already known to cause disease, but the vast majority weren’t. They ultimately identified 807 people who appeared to have a risk score indicative of a genetic disease. And when matching the suspected genetic disease to genes known to cause it, they found 18 variants in total were significantly associated with 17 diseases. Only eight of these 807 patients had been diagnosed with the corresponding Mendelian disease, though. And nine of the variants they found had never been identified as a possible cause of disease before. “Our findings suggest that the phenotypic burden of rare variants in Mendelian genes may be greater than previously thought,” the researchers said. Some of the people with genetic diseases were particularly devastated by them. Sixteen patients at some point in their lives needed to get an organ transplant, either of the liver or kidney. Other variants might have been responsible for people’s heart failure or infertility. Thirteen of the diseases they identified had been previously categorized as “recessive,” meaning people would need to inherit the same mutation from both parents to come down with symptoms. But the researchers found people who had milder symptoms of these diseases, despite only inheriting one copy of the genetic mutation. This pattern is already well known with one particular single-gene recessive disease, sickle cell anemia. People with only one bad copy are considered to have sickle cell trait, which often requires much less or even no treatment to manage. But the findings suggest that even milder versions of these disease can lead to noticeable, misidentified health problems, the researchers say. They also found that some patients had two different copies of the same gene, which collectively led to a genetic disease. Standard genetic testing might fail to catch cases like this. These findings suggest that there’s no clean break between simple diseases caused by a lone gene and complex health problems thought to be influenced by lots of genetic factors. And our definition of genetic disease as either dominant or recessive might need to be tweaked, too. “In view of our findings, familiar medical categories such as ‘complex’ versus ‘genetic,’ or ‘dominant’ versus ‘recessive’ begin to appear more like continuums,” said lead author Lisa Bastarache, a data scientist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Center for Precision Medicine, in a statement. Bastarache and her team believe their technique can and should be used to uncover even more genetic diseases, including in other populations. “Phenotype risk scoring can easily be applied in any electronic medical record system that is linked to DNA,” she said. “Our work looked at only a small sample of the human genome, about 6,000 variants. The opportunity for additional discoveries using this method is huge.” Earlier detection of these diseases wouldn’t be just a scientific boon. Eleven of the diseases they found are known to have treatments, some of which could help patients who don’t realize they have a genetic disease avoid the worst of their symptoms.

Rhett Jones,"Yahoos ongoing legal troubles related to the biggest data breach in history appear to be coming to a close. It has submitted a settlement to a U.S. district court agreeing to pay victims $50 million along with some other benefits. Anyone who spent time undoing damage from the breach should pay attention. The settlement was submitted to the court in the Northern District of California late on Monday and still requires approval. In it, Yahoo agrees to put $50 million into a fund for victims with claims and it will provide two years of credit monitoring service from AllClear. The latter package is valued by Yahoos lawyers at around $350. While its unlikely Yahoo will pay AllClear full price, that part of the deal could be the best win for anyone who was affected in the devastating hack of 3 billion users data. Businesses and individuals who suffered financial losses directly related to the hack also have the option to seek reimbursements. Any user who can show documented losses of time can file a complaint and be awarded $25 per hour up to 15 hours for a maximum total of $375 in compensation. Any user who does not have documentation but lost time is eligible for up to five hours of compensation totaling $125. Users who paid for a premium Yahoo email account can request a 25 percent refund. Yahoo did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the settlement. Assuming its approved, the settlement should close the door on Yahoos obligations related to hacks that began in 2013. The company did not disclose the breaches until 2016 and the number of users that it admitted were affected continued to balloon over time. In late 2017 it finally put the number of victims at 3 billion users. Its failure to disclose the breach resulted in a $35 million fine from the SEC earlier this year. The revelation of the hack came after Yahoo had already agreed to a $4.83 billion acquisition by Verizon. The deal briefly stalled before Verizon was given a $350 million discount. Verizon subsequently formed a subsidiary, Oath, that will pay out $15 million worth of the user settlement. A holding company set up for Yahoos Asian investments, Altaba, will pay the other $35 million. According to the Associated Press, some experts estimated that Yahoo could have faced up to a billion dollar payout if the case had gone to court.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / A Chevrolet Bolt EV self-driving test car like this one was involved in two incidents in San Francisco. reader comments 0 Since the beginning of the year, there have been six collision reports involving autonomous vehicles officially filed to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Of those, two involve humans mildly attacking the car in question. According to state law, companies that operate self-driving cars must submit a report to the DMV detailing any such incident. Since the Golden State began keeping such records, there have been a total of 58 such reports, including the six in 2018. The most recent incident involving light violence was in San Francisco at the intersection of Duboce Avenue and Mission Street on January 28 at 10:55pm. According to the report, a Cruise AV was “stopped behind a taxi” when the driver got out, “approached the Cruise AV, and slapped the front passenger window, causing a scratch. There were no injuries and police were not called.” Just a few weeks earlier, nearby, in the heart of the Mission District on January 2 at 9:27pm, a Chevy Bolt was stopped. The car was attempting to make a right-hand turn from northbound Valencia Street onto 16th Street and was properly waiting for pedestrians to cross 16th. Suddenly, a “different pedestrian form the southwest corner ran across Valencia, ignoring the ‘Do Not Walk’ sign.” This man, according to the report was “shouting, and struck the left side of the Cruise AV’s rear bumper and hatch with his entire body. There were no injuries, but the Cruise AV sustained some damage to its left rear light. The police were not called.” As per the state law at the time (which has since changed, the new law takes effect on April 2), a human driver was behind the wheel. There is no mention as to what the human did in response to this unseemly action. Both incidents were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.","“No injuries, but the Cruise AV sustained some damage to its left rear light.”",2018-03-06T21:05:22Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Self-driving cars have been assaulted twice so far this year in San Francisco,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/self-driving-cars-have-been-assaulted-twice-so-far-this-year-in-san-francisco/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-629988204-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,damage,0
"Hamilton Nolan on Splinter, shared by Hudson Hongo to Gizmodo","For the one thousandth time, an authoritative new report tells us with great certainty thatif we do not take drastic, immediate action to slash carbon emissionshumanity faces catastrophic damage from climate change. Here are two words: Carbon tax. You place a tax on carbon. You make it expensive to emit carbon. You change the economic feasibility of burning fossil fuels. You create a strong economic incentive to develop clean energy. Capitalism dictates that companies do whatever makes them a profit. Companies do not have souls. They will continue to extract, refine, and burn fossil fuels as long as it is profitable. They know that they will not be the ones to pay the future costs. They simply take the present profits. If you make the business of extracting, refining, and burning fossil fuels unprofitable, it will in short order cease to exist. This is the single most direct path to cutting carbon emissions. Climate change is the ultimately the result of people wanting to make money. Tax it until it is impossible to make money on it. You can mitigate the costs of a carbon tax. You can give tax credits to curb its impact on low-income people. You can even cut other taxes in the exact amount of a carbon tax to result in no new tax burden at all. In a borderline sane world, even Republicans would be able to get behind this plan. And indeed, many Republicans have already said they favor a carbon tax. Unfortunately, those Republicans are not the ones who hold the power to implement a carbon tax. The logic of capitalism also dictates that corporations should capture as much political power as possible in service of increasing profits, and our political system is a result of this dynamic. Therefore even though it is abundantly clear that climate change is one of biggest problems facing mankind, the most powerful nation on earth is controlled by a political party that will not even admit that climate change exists. They do this in service of short-term corporate profits. This is the system that we have acquiesced to. A carbon tax is a basic, easy to understand idea. It directly solves the problem at hand. Smart people have known for decades that it is foolish for us not to have some form of carbon tax. A well designed and quickly implemented carbon tax could quite literally save hundreds of millions of people from facing catastrophic risks to their lives over the next few decades. There is absolutely no indication that we will get a carbon tax any time soon.","For the one thousandth time, an authoritative new report tells us with great certainty that—if we do not take drastic, immediate action to slash carbon emissions—humanity faces catastrophic damage from climate change.

Hard-boiled eggs may not get nearly the love that scrambled, fried, or poached eggs do, but they’re … Read more Read The video above, from youtuber infrared213, demonstrates what happens to a super-heated hard boiled egg so you don’t have to find out for yourself. Around the 38-second mark, a gentlemen barely prods the egg and it explodes with the force of 10,000 cockadoodledoos. Let’s see it again: So what’s happening here? How does a seemingly harmless egg turn into something that shouldn’t be allowed on an airplane? A new study from researchers Anthony Nash and Lauren von Blohn, and presented at the Acoustical Society of America, might have the answer. The New York Times reports that the researchers took a look at the phenomenon after a diner at a restaurant claimed to receive burns and hearing damage from a reheated hard boiled egg that exploded in his face. To test things out, they microwaved nearly 100 eggs to see if an exploding egg could really be loud enough to cause hearing damage. Their data suggests that’s not the case, but they did learn why the explosions happened in the first place. I love deviled eggs more than is decent, but I used to hate making them. It wasn’t the difficulty… Read more Read The yolks of the eggs they tested ended up being hotter than 212 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to boil water ( super-heated stuff is dangerous, people ). When an egg cooks inside its shell, tiny pockets of water form throughout. Then, if the yolk heats up, it heats the water pockets. But because the water is under pressure in the shell, it wouldn’t boil unless something disturbed that delicate balance. If the egg cracks at all—boom. Bits of piping hot egg fly everywhere and could definitely cause burns. So, uh, just don’t do that, okay?",Thinking of finishing off that soft boiled egg in the microwave?

Matt Brian,"When Fortnite's seventh season began last week, teasers depicted an Ice King wielding a mighty looking sword. So today's unveiling shouldn't come as much of a surprise. According to the patch notes, the Infinity Blade will only spawn on Polar Peak -- which hosts a castle that until today was almost entirely encased in ice -- and is capable of not only destroying rival players (dealing 75 damage), but structures as well. When a player picks up the ""mythic melee weapon"" from its pedestal for the first time, they will be granted full health and shields. It will also increase those two vitals to 200 points (up from the usual 100), regenerate after damage is taken and the player will move 30 percent faster than everyone else. Also, whenever the holder slays an enemy, 50 health points will be granted instantly. The original Infinity Blade. Those buffs don't come for free, however. When the Infinity Blade is picked up, players will lose all other weapons and inventory items. Building materials, however, will still be available. Much like Thanos' gauntlet, there is only one Blade and when the wielder is knocked out or eliminated, it will be instantly dropped. Although Fortnite season seven is less than a week old, it's already shaping up to be the best season yet. With a new winter biome, Stormwing planes, ziplines and now a mythical sword, players have tonnes of new content to get stuck into.

Reuters Editorial,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Buffered by three oceans and the United States to the south, Canada has for decades had the luxury of being able to pick and choose its newcomers. So few asylum seekers crossed the U.S. border illegally over the years that Canada didn’t consistently track the numbers. People gather luggage from a shuttle bus as they arrive to cross the US-Canada border into Canada in Champlain, New York, U.S., February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie That has changed dramatically over the past 14 months. U.S. President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration and his move to strip Haitians, Salvadorans and others of their temporary legal status have had a broad effect on Canada’s refugee system, Reuters interviews with social service providers, government officials and a review of Canadian immigration data show. More than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries. This unexpected northward migration has overwhelmed Canada’s system for processing asylum claims, leading to the worst delays in years. Aid agencies are also struggling to house asylum-seekers because of a shortage of accommodation in the four cities most affected by the migration wave - Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver. (For graphics on the impact see tmsnrt.rs/2HCp4aD ) While some of this has been reported, this story offers the most complete picture to date of the unintended effect of Trump’s immigration policies on the United States’ northern neighbor. The Canadian government was forced to set aside C$173 million in its latest budget to pay for extra patrols at border crossings to cope with the influx, as well as security screening and processing of refugee applications. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has discussed the situation with the Trump administration, but it has been careful not to publicly blame the U.S. president’s policies for triggering the migration wave. Nevertheless, it is already making preparations for more people to cross the border once the weather warms. “We will be ready,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said in an interview. Aid agencies who are at the forefront of dealing with the influx say they are struggling and need more funding, a comprehensive long-term plan and better coordination with Ottawa. “It’s going to get worse. The numbers keep climbing,” said Ilona Beiks, vice president of the Inland Refugee Society of British Columbia, which had to turn away refugees last year for the first time in its 35-year history because it did not have enough money to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers. The influx shows no signs of abating. More than 1,500 asylum seekers walked across the border in January. Those working with refugee claimants say this is no blip: It’s the new normal. Since January 2017 Reuters has sought to obtain the numbers of asylum seekers who walked across the U.S. border into Canada in the years prior to Trump’s election. The Canadian government has said no national historical data is available. WORSENING DELAYS Trump’s tougher immigration policies have had a major impact on Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board, which determines refugee claims. It has become so overwhelmed with cases it is ignoring legislated time limits for dealing with them. All refugee claims are supposed to be processed within 60 days. Increasingly, the board has failed to meet those targets. In December 2017, 86 percent of hearings did not happen within prescribed time frames, according to previously unpublished data reviewed by Reuters. That was up from 66 percent in December 2016, a month after Trump was elected president, and 26 percent in December 2015. On Feb. 20 the board said it will effectively prioritize those applicants who have been waiting months or years. This will mean a longer wait for more recent arrivals than the current 20-month average estimated time for processing claims. The government is “committed to an efficient and fair asylum system,” said a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the government department responsible for the Immigration and Refugee Board. Canada’s refugee tribunals have historically been leery of claims made by people who come through its wealthy southern neighbor. But of the more than 2,500 claims finalized last year, 53 percent were granted refugee status. Rulings reviewed by Reuters indicate the tribunals are giving credence to claimants who say they feared deportation or racist attacks following Trump’s election on a platform advocating more restrictions on immigration. A man talks to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer before crossing the US-Canada border into Canada in Champlain, New York, U.S., February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie ACCOMMODATION SQUEEZE Asylum seekers are walking across the border into some of the tightest housing markets on the continent. Last summer, thousands slept in Montreal’s Olympic stadium. In Toronto, 31 percent of the people sleeping in city-run shelters in January were refugee claimants – up from nearly 19 percent a year ago, according to city data. In November, Toronto approved the booking of more hotel rooms for refugee claimants through the end of 2018, at a cost of about C$20 million, according to city documents. The city is working on a more comprehensive refugee plan but it needs more help from the federal government, said councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam. The status quo, renting thousands of hotel beds, “is absolutely unsustainable,” she said. “We are not saying ‘No’ to refugees. We are saying, ‘Absolutely: Come and live in Toronto. Build your life in Toronto.’ But we cannot do this without the support of other orders of government,” she said. Toronto’s mayor “has raised this issue repeatedly with the federal government,” the mayor’s spokesman, Don Peat, wrote in an email. The federal government says it won’t give cities more money for asylum seekers, who are barred from accessing a C$762 million federal fund that is for permanent residents or people who have already been granted refugee status. A spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said asylum seekers can access provincial programs. Some agencies Reuters spoke with, however, said that isn’t enough and that a national effort is needed. Toronto is not alone in asking for help. Vancouver has asked the British Columbia provincial government for more money for refugee aid agencies, said city spokesman Jag Sandhu, and the province has promised C$6 million a year over three years. Winnipeg is coordinating with the Manitoba government to find accommodation for refugee claimants, the city said. ‘WE’RE STRUGGLING’ Canada has no formal system for integrating refugee claimants and depends heavily on aid agencies that operate independently but are funded through a combination of government grants and private donations. Dozens of agencies in Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Montreal are taking the lead in housing and feeding new arrivals and helping them find schools and employment. Of 17 organizations Reuters spoke with, 11 said interviews with border crossers confirmed that many were fleeing because of Trump’s immigration policies. “We know the numbers have increased because of what’s going on in the U.S.,” said Toronto-based doctor Meb Rashid, who runs the provincially funded Crossroads Clinic. The number of patients at the clinic grew 40 percent in a year and people now wait several weeks for an appointment, Rashid said. “We’re struggling, I have to be honest with you.” Two aid groups said they have had to turn people away, one has had to intensify its fundraising, two have had to extend their operating hours to meet demand, while six who help to house new arrivals are struggling to find accommodation for them. The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council in Winnipeg has seen its refugee claimant caseload increase fivefold in the past year, said executive director Rita Chahal. “The impact has been huge,” she said, adding that the organization had to launch its first fundraising drive in years to meet the additional costs. The Canadian government has dispatched lawmakers to diaspora communities in the United States to persuade people not to come. But it has said little about what conversations it has had with Washington on stemming the migration. The spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said Canada has a “long-standing, solid working relationship” with the United States. Meanwhile, the contingency plans being developed to deal with the expected surge in border crossers include redeploying police and border agents to overwhelmed areas and setting up accommodation such as tents and trailers at ports of entry, said a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency. “There is an expectation the numbers will go up... as the weather gets better,” said a source familiar with the Canadian government’s thinking. “And who knows what the next order coming from down south will be?” Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Ross Colvin","TORONTO (Reuters) - Buffered by three oceans and the United States to the south, Canada has for decades had the luxury of being able to pick and choose its newcomers.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Residents of the Carolinas struggled to return to normalcy on Tuesday after taking a beating from Hurricane Florence, but their efforts were hindered by standing water and additional flooding expected from already swollen rivers. At least 32 people have been killed since Florence came ashore as a hurricane on Friday, including 25 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed when Florence spawned at least 16 tornadoes on Monday in Virginia, where dozens of buildings were destroyed, the National Weather Service reported. Waterways were expected to keep rising on Tuesday in places like Fayetteville, North Carolina, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state, according to the weather service, hampering efforts to restore power, clear roads and return to homes. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday, including portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Sixteen rivers in the state have reached major flood stages, with three more expected to peak in the next two days, he said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state, but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” he said in a news conference. Officials said residents should not attempt to return to the counties along the state’s coast around Wilmington yet due to ongoing risk of flooding. The storm dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. On Tuesday, the storm’s remnants were continuing to soak the mid-Atlantic region and southern New England with heavy rain. Property damage from the storm is expected to come to $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure. The risk modeling agency Air Worldwide on Tuesday said insured losses from Florence’s winds and storm surge will range from $1.7 billion to $4.6 billion. Those figures do not include losses from continuing flooding. President Donald Trump is expected to travel to the region on Wednesday, CNN and local news media reported. ROAD CONDITIONS ‘STILL CHANGING’ Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. “Road conditions are still changing,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “What’s open now may become impassable.” Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. A portion of a motel collapsed from the weight of water, which made only the roof of the Starlite Motel visible in Spring Lake in Cumberland County, said Sherita Brooks of the county’s Division of Social Services. More than 347,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday morning, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina’s Emergency Management department has opened four mass feeding kitchens and has plans to open four more shortly. Gasoline shortages were a problem. In Wilmington, dozens of cars lined up for fuel at a Kangaroo Express service station. “It is ridiculous that we don’t have enough fuel supplies back in this area,” Stephanie Schauer, 39, a contractor, said as she waited her turn at the gas pump. “It’s been days since the storm.” Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Miami; Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee: Jessica Resnick-Ault and Barbara Goldberg in New York; Anna Mehler Paperny in North Carolina; and Rich McKay in Atlanta; Writing by Brendan O'Brien and Bill Trott; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Jonathan Oatis","Residents of the Carolinas struggled to return to normalcy on Tuesday after taking a beating from Hurricane Florence, but their efforts were hindered by standing water and additional flooding expected from already swollen rivers.",2018-09-18T16:44:03Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Travel snarled by flooding as Carolinas size up Florence's damage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence/travel-snarled-by-flooding-as-carolinas-size-up-florences-damage-idUSKCN1LX126,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180918&t=2&i=1305636267&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE8H1DJ,reuters,Reuters,damage,0

""Therefore we cannot ever let Islam become a large part of our society. Muslims are naturally my (our) enemy due to their deep antagonism and bias against non-Muslims.""
Ricketts' son, team chairman Tom Ricketts, has apologized, saying in a statement ""the language and views expressed in those emails have no place in our society."" 
""These emails do not reflect the culture we've worked so hard to build at the Chicago Cubs since 2009."" 
""I deeply regret and apologize for some of the exchanges I had in my emails,"" the elder Ricketts said in a statement. ""Sometimes I received emails that I should have condemned. Other times I've said things that don't reflect my value system. I strongly believe that bigoted ideas are wrong.""
Here are others connected to professional sports franchises whose comments made headlines: 
Houston Texans owner Bob McNair
After former pro quarterback Colin Kaepernick pioneered the kneeling National Anthem protests over what he said was social and racial injustice, the late Houston Texans owner Bob McNair complained. In 2017 he said, ""We can't have the inmates running the prison"" while discussing the protests at a meeting between owners, team executives and National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell, according to Bleacherreport.com. 
In a statement posted to Twitter by the team, McNair later apologized.
""I regret that I used that expression,"" the statement said. ""I never meant to offend anyone and I was not referring to our players. I used a figure of speech that was never intended to be taken literally. I would never characterize our players or our league that way and I apologize to anyone who was offended by it.""
But McNair took back the apology a year later. He said he was actually referring to league executives when he used the term ""inmates,"" not players, according to Bleacherreport.com. 
McNair died of cancer in November at age 81. 
Former Atlanta Hawks controlling owner Bruce Levenson
Bruce Levenson, who served as Atlanta Hawks managing partner and team representative on the NBA Board of Governors, sold his controlling stake in 2014 after sending an email he said was ""inappropriate and offensive.""
In a 2012 email addressing the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season-ticket holders, Levenson referred to what he saw around the arena where his team played. 
First, he wrote, the spectators were 70% black. The stadium's bars were 90% black. There were few fathers with sons at games. The cheerleaders were black. Hip-hop always blared in the arena. Rap or gospel acts dominated the postgame entertainment.
""Then I start looking around at other arenas. It is completely different. Even (Washington) DC with its affluent black community never has more than 15 pct black audience,"" he wrote.
He didn't stop there. In the email to then-Hawks General Manager Danny Ferry, Levenson wrote that before his Atlanta Spirit Group bought the Hawks in 2003, thousands of tickets were dispersed, mostly in the black community, to make the arena appear less empty. The ticket giveaways continued after the Atlanta Spirit Group took over. 
""My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base,"" he wrote. ""I never felt uncomfortable, but I think Southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority.""
Though Levenson derided as ""racist garbage"" claims on fan websites that the arena was unsafe or in a bad part of town, he also said he had ""bitched that the kiss cam is too black"" and demanded ""white cheerleaders"" and ""music familiar to a 40-year-old white guy.""
Former Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry 
The remarks involved South Sudan-born player Luol Deng and were made during a conference call about free agents.
""Ferry talked about the player's good points, and then went on to describe his negatives, stating that 'he has a little African in him. Not in a bad way, but he's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back,'"" said a letter from J. Michael Gearon Jr., a minority owner of the Hawks.
The general manager also described the player ""as a two-faced liar and cheat,"" the letter said.
""We were appalled that anyone would make such a racist slur under any circumstance, much less the GM of an NBA franchise on a major conference call. ... Ferry's comments were so far out of bounds that we are concerned that he has put the entire franchise in jeopardy,"" Gearon wrote. 
Ferry later apologized for what he said were ""insensitive remarks.""
""I was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players,"" he said in a statement released by the Hawks.
""I repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process. Those words do not reflect my views, or words that I would use to describe an individual and I certainly regret it.""
In September 2014, Ferry took an indefinite leave of absence from the team. 
Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling
Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after the revelation of inflammatory statements he made during a recorded conversation with friend V. Stiviano.
In a 10-minute audio clip posted by TMZ, Sterling chastised Stiviano for posting pictures online of herself with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson.
According to TMZ, Sterling made the comments during an argument with Stiviano, who is part African-American.
""In your lousy f***ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he said.
""If it's white people, it's OK?"" asked Stiviano, according to the recording. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?""
In another recording released later, Sterling, a married lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, explained he was jealous Stiviano was with black men. 
""The girl is black. I like her. I'm jealous that she's with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell, can I in private tell her, you know, 'I don't want you to be with anybody'?"" Sterling said in the new tape, according to RadarOnline.
In May 2014, Sterling told CNN he was sorry for what he said but felt he was ""baited."" 
""When I listen to that tape, I don't even know how I can say words like that. ... I don't know why the girl had me say those things,"" he said. 
""You're saying you were set up?"" CNN's Anderson Cooper asked.
""Well yes, I was baited,"" Sterling said. ""I mean, that's not the way I talk. I don't talk about people for one thing, ever. I talk about ideas and other things. I don't talk about people.""
Former Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott
Marge Schott, who owned the Reds from 1984 through 1999, was known to use slurs to refer to African-Americans, Jews and LGBTQ people, according to Bleacherreport.com. 
MLB hit her with a one-year suspension and a fine after she was quoted in 1992 as saying, ""Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far,"" according to the Society for American Baseball Research. 
In 1996, she was suspended again after more praise of Hitler and insults of Asian-Americans and LGBTQ people, SABR reported.","The billionaire patriarch whose family owns the Chicago Cubs and iconic Wrigley Field this week joined a long, infamous list of people connected to sports franchises who stirred controversy with ignorant and racist statements.",2019-02-06T23:05:31Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Another pro sports franchise is doing damage control over racist statements.

PETER BAKER and KATIE BENNER,"He remains deeply mistrustful of the Justice Department, according to people who have spoken with him, primarily because of his animosity for Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation because of his campaign work for Mr. Trump. Even periodic reminders that Mr. Wray has cleaned house of several F.B.I. holdovers has not soothed Mr. Trump, associates said. “I think the president should exercise restraint,” said Christopher Ruddy, his friend and chief executive of Newsmax Media. “He should use the Reagan model. You shouldn’t get involved in these investigations, leave it to the lawyers, leave it to the people outside the White House. Avoid the Nixon model where you get involved in the investigations and you fire prosecutors and the other stuff that could be perceived as obstruction.” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, said the president should not fire Mr. Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein or Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation, because “they’re perfect foils” where they are now. They and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump last year, have become representations of the “deep state” that Mr. Trump says he is fighting. “They have given us every single talking point that we have needed,” Mr. Nunberg said. “All I need to do is quote them. Their mind-set is they know better. It’s this gilded Washington, ‘we know best and you’re just not smart enough to understand.’” The president’s demand for an investigation into the informant and the release of confidential information stunned Justice Department officials and put Mr. Rosenstein in an awkward position. Rather than resist, Mr. Rosenstein released a statement agreeing to an inquiry. The next day, Mr. Trump summoned him and Mr. Wray to the White House, which then announced that the department and F.B.I. would disclose information to House Republicans who have been demanding it. The drama culminated in an unusual pair of meetings at the Justice Department and Capitol Hill on Thursday, with the attendee list and venues shifting until the last moment. The Justice Department and F.B.I. offered essentially the same limited verbal briefing they had offered earlier this month — an offer ignored by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.",The president’s allies say he has every right to manage the executive branch and every reason to be outraged at possible misconduct aimed at his campaign.

Brendan Hesse,"Google is on the cusp of launching the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL (we presume), and more Pixel smartphones in the wild means an even greater number of devices that will suffer drops, falls, dunks into liquid, and who knows what else. To help with repairs, Google has finally created an official repair service for Pixel device. Dubbed the Repair Center, Googles service covers both in- and out-of-warranty damages, and its site even offers a handy list of quick fixes and troubleshooting solutions for smaller problems. Once you detail your devices damagea process well walk you through in a little bitGoogle will give you a quote for the estimated cost of your repairs, plus instructions on sending in your damaged phone. Prices can range from free repairs for accidental damages or problems protected by your warranty, up to a few hundred dollars (or more) for serious issues like water damage. On the plus side, Google is covering all shipping and packaging costs. As for the repair time, you should be able to receive your device back within seven to 12 business days, depending how you shipped it and how much work Google has to do to bring your device back to life. Open the Google Repair Center page and click the large blue Start a repair order button. You can also scroll down the page to find a list of solutions for common Pixel phone problems, like unresponsive screens or slow charging. Check these first, and you might not even need to send in your device for a fix. Find and input your serial number or IMEI After clicking to begin the repair order, the next screen will require you to input your phones IMEI or serial number. You can find this in your phones system settings. Open the settings menu from the app screen, then go to System &gt; About Phone and scroll down to your MEID. Tapping the MEID number will display several more numbers, including your IMEI. If youre unable to access your phones settings to find your IMEI due to screen damage or other technical issues, you can also find its serial number on either its original box or by opening your SIM card tray. Insert a small pin into the hole on the side of your Pixel phone and push gently until the tray is released. The serial number is listed on the tray (you may have to remove the SIM card to see it). Whats your damage, smartphone? Once youve inputted your devices serial/IMEI number, youll see a page that allows you to confirm that the device Google found is actually your phone. Once youve double-checked, youll next be asked to identify the specific issue youre having with your device. If youre not sure, there are links at the top and bottom of the list that offer more explanation, but you should probably know what you did. Er. What your phone did. All by itself. Shipping and payment selection After selecting any and all applicable issues, click next, and youll be taken to the coverage page, which lets you know whether your phone and specific damages are covered by Googles Preferred Care plan. If so, you can immediately file a claim for free repairs. If not, you will have the option to pay for repairs. Once youre ready to ship your device to Google, you can either pack it up in your own own box, have Google send you a prepaid box (which arrives in 1-2 business days), or visit a local Google Repair Center partner for in-person service. Before you seal the deal on service, youll get to review the Repair Center terms of service agreement, as well as a quote for the costs of resurrecting your dead or dying device.","Google is on the cusp of launching the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL (we presume), and more Pixel smartphones in the wild means an even greater number of devices that will suffer drops, falls, dunks into liquid, and who knows what else.

Nick Summers,"The policy also grants riders to £2,500 in annual medical expenses cover, £2,000 for dental repair, £200 for phone damage caused during an accident, £700 for jury service cover, and £1,500 annual cover for overnight hospital stays, as well as £750 for accompanying family members. Taken as a whole, Deliveroo says the insurance policy is ""cheaper than comparable products for people working in the on-demand economy."" In addition, cyclists can take out public liability insurance — legal cover should they injure a member of the public or cause property damage — for 65 pence per week, covering costs up to £2 million. Deliveroo has enjoyed extraordinary growth since it launched in 2013. The company stood out with its legion of lycra-clad couriers — removing the requirement for restaurants to have their own drivers — and big-name restaurant partnerships including Byron, Zizzi and PizzaExpress. The way it employs riders, however, has been called into question. Delivery personnel are currently treated as self-employed, limiting their rights and job security. Some ministers believe they should be classified as ""workers"" instead — a fuzzy middle-ground between self-employed and full-time work that would give them the right to the national living wage, minimum levels of paid holiday, and basic protections against discrimination. Uber falls into the same camp. Some of its drivers have successfully challenged their self employed status, much to the company's chagrin. (It's currently trying to appeal the decision.) The government is now debating regulatory reform. In July, Matthew Taylor completed an independent review of modern work practices for the government. As part of that work, Deliveroo argued that the law should be changed in one of two ways : create a whole new category of employment, or allow companies to offer self-employed people additional rights. Two parliamentary groups have since argued that gig economy drivers should be treated as workers by default. The UK government needs to make a decision. According to the Guardian, it was going to make an announcement later this month. Those plans have been shelved, however, due to fears that right-wing party members will kick up a fuss. That would reflect poorly on a government that is already struggling with Brexit negotiations. It's not clear, then, if or when the law will be updated to reflect the rise in Deliveroo and Uber workers. In the meantime, individual cases will be examined by the courts, providing legal precedent for subsequent people who believe they deserve better rights.","Deliveroo is combating criticism of its employment practices with a new sickness and accident insurance policy for riders.

THOMAS ERDBRINK,"Iranian officials put the epicenter of the quake inside Iran, near the border town of Ezgeleh. The region is a patchwork of farms and is home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran. Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, some 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage. The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Kerbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake occurred. Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When ordinary Iranians learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts, some started organizing aid groups themselves. In 2003, more than 20,000 people were killed and an ancient citadel was destroyed in the southern city of Bam. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.

Jon Fingas,"As with Qualcomm's previous ITC tussle, the new ITC case is conspicuously focused only on those iPhones that use Intel's wireless chipsets. Apple has declined to comment. With these back-to-back lawsuits, though, it's clearer than ever that the companies are trying to force each other's hand. Qualcomm in particular rejects Apple's claim that its royalty demands are excessive, and it could use the threat of bans on cutting-edge iPhones as a strong bargaining chip. Even if the lawsuit and ITC complaint take a while (ITC cases are usually faster), there's a good chance that bans on the iPhone 8 and X could do tangible damage to Apple's bottom line and push it to the negotiating table.

Meanwhile, Junkrat's concussion mines need more accurate targeting to do the most damage, preventing players from spamming them in a general direction and getting kills as easily. A major catalyst for the adjustment is competitively ranked and eSports-level play like the Overwatch League. For more information on why it's changing so drastically, I can point to an IGN video showing which character pros hate the most, and writer Nico D.'s essays about "" Why Does Everyone Hate Mercy."" Pro gamers who have been critical of the character seem happy with the move, even as regular players who enjoy the character must adjust to life with some new restrictions. eSports site Dexerto points out a number of reactions from league players including the San Francisco Shock's André 'iddqd' Dahlström, who tweeted ""Words cannot describe how happy I am.

Andrew Freedman,"Just a few days after a powerful storm caused widespread damage across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, another potent nor'easter is tracking toward the region. This one won't be quite as strong as the last event, which was so massive that it caused damage as far away as the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, but it will have more cold air to work with, making a foot or more of snow more likely, especially across interior portions of New England. The storm will exacerbate the coastal flooding that never completely dissipated in the wake of the last intense storm and astronomical high tides that hit beginning on March 1. In coastal Massachusetts, the first nor'easter severely weakened or destroyed shoreline infrastructure in many communities, making the high waves and coastal flooding from this upcoming storm even more of a threat. SEE ALSO: This one picture sums up climate change's growing role in coastal flooding In general, as sea levels rise in response to global warming, weather ""bombs"" like the two storms in the last week will be capable of causing more severe coastal flooding, since their storm surge will ride on top of a higher baseline of water. And anytime that a major storm coincides with astronomical high tides, as the March 1-4 event did, look out for records to fall along with seawalls. National Weather Service snowfall forecast for New York City. Image: nws. Coastal storms, including weather systems that undergo the process known as bombogenesis, in which the minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, are not unusual at this time of year along the East Coast. However, it is rare to see two back-to-back intense storms, both of which would qualify as ""bomb cyclones"" or ""weather bombs,"" occur within a few days of each other. [Coastal Flooding] Watch issued for Northeast MA (Cape Ann) for the Thursday AM high tide (3a - 5a); potential 2.5 - 3.0 foot storm surge along w/ tides yielding minor to moderate coastal flooding considering now vulnerable shoreline per recent storm (winds below in knots) pic.twitter.com/dD7zYQdIcC — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 6, 2018 The back-to-back nature of these weather systems is largely due to a favorable weather pattern across the North Atlantic, with a blocking area of high pressure over Greenland preventing storms from moving quickly out to sea, and a see-saw pattern of atmospheric pressure, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, in a phase that favors East Coast storms. The snowfall forecast for major cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is an extremely difficult one, given multiple factors that could cut down on totals, or conversely, drastically raise them. So far, the consensus forecasts call for about 6 to 8 inches to fall in the Philadelphia area, with much more snow to the northwest of the city, and similar amounts in New York City. Quite a gradient in snowfall across RI and MA for Wednesday's storm. Nothing in Boston but almost a foot in Bedford, MA (near I-195/128). 2-4"" for Providence but over a foot in NW RI. Note: Ratios likely less than 10:1 for some of these areas, so snow totals will be less overall. pic.twitter.com/MeNuIhoSET — Jason Furtado (@wxjay) March 6, 2018 The Hudson Valley of New York, however, could pick up a foot-and-a-half of snow. In Boston, the snow is expected to mix with rain for much of the time, cutting down on totals there. Weather Twitter on Tuesday morning was a mix of fascinating discussions on the dynamics behind this storm, and fretting about snowfall totals in the areas where a 20 mile change in the storm track would make a huge difference — including in New York.

Stefanie Duguay,"As of Dec. 17, Tumblr will no longer allow “ adult content,” defined as that which shows “real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples, and any content — including photos, videos, GIFs and illustrations — that depicts sex acts.” Before this, the platform’s lenient policies contrasted significantly with those of Facebook and Instagram, which have stricter content moderation guidelines. This update follows the removal of Tumblr’s app from Apple’s app store after child pornography was found on the platform. However, it also reflects broader changes following Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo, Tumblr’s parent company. Katrin Tiidenberg, a researcher who has studied self-expression on Tumblr, conjectures that this change may have more to do with advertising sales than protecting users. Regardless of Tumblr’s motives, this update will seriously affect LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) youth who rely on Tumblr and its communities for self-discovery and support. ‘Safer’ online spaces Since LGBTQ identities have often been stigmatized, the internet has been pivotal in helping those with diverse gender and sexual identities learn about themselves and find each other. Tumblr has provided a safe space for this through many of its key features (e.g. pseudonymous accounts, reblogging) and the communities it attracts. Given this, it’s not surprising that a large Australian survey found LGBTQ youth use Tumblr much more frequently than the rest of the population. Many respondents indicated content on Tumblr broadened their understanding of sexuality and gender and facilitated self-acceptance. The Tumblr logo is displayed at Nasdaq in New York in July 2013. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Tumblr has served as an essential outlet for LGBTQ youth in relation to other popular platforms. Alexander Cho, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Irvine, has written about Tumblr’s “ queer ecosystem ” where “users circulate porn, flirt, provide support to deal with homophobia as well as advice on coming out…” Cho has found that queer youth of colour experience Facebook as a space of “ default publicness ” and prefer Tumblr for sharing intimate and personal content. LGBTQ people have also found Tumblr to be powerful for self-representation. Through sophisticated hashtagging practices, transgender people share art, stories and engage in dialogue that challenges cisgender norms. Researcher Tim Highfield and I have explored how sharing queer GIFs – short, looping media — not only allows LGBTQ youth to engage in Tumblr’s fan communities but also playfully displays queer culture en masse. This broad representation of LGBTQ identities may dissuade homophobic harassment, as some of the queer women I’ve interviewed perceive less discrimination on Tumblr. What’s porn got to do with it? Porn is a portion of the multiple forms of media resonating among LGBTQ users. This media allows them to knit together non-mainstream identities and survive in a world where heterosexuality is ubiquitously portrayed across social media and broadcast outlets. Not all LGBTQ content contains genitals, “female-presenting nipples” or sex acts, but not all content with these elements constitutes what we would generally think of as pornography. Much of the sexualized content circulated among LGBTQ Tumblr users make available depictions of sexuality that are frequently rendered invisible or marginalized. These can take the form of fan art, remixed film clips of sensual embraces and selfies. This media allows LGBTQ people to see themselves as sexual beings — something that is particularly important for young people developing a sense of sexual and gender identity. Even if you disagree with teenagers accessing this type of content, Tumblr’s new policy bans it for everyone regardless of age. Formerly, users could voluntarily mark their blogs as “NSFW” (Not Safe for Work) if they posted occasional nudity and “adult” if posting substantial nudity. This provided a sort of checkpoint to hinder younger users in accessing this content. Now even adults won’t be able to access “adult content.” This means that young people over 18, who may be facing formative life changes, like starting post-secondary education or moving away from home, won’t have access to media that may help them learn about their identity and feel supported while doing so. Commercial platforms shape culture Strict content moderation policies tend to have negative outcomes for already marginalized users. In my research with Jean Burgess and Nicolas Suzor, we found that some queer women experienced Instagram’s content moderation as overly stringent. Instagram asks users to report content and responds through automated mechanisms. Therefore, queer women’s content was subject to removal based on other users’ whims and the banning of certain hashtags like #lesbian. Tumblr’s new updates promise a similar mixture of user reporting and automated content detection tools. Several scholars have begun to critically examine how platforms’ decisions shape our social and cultural norms. In Canada, Chris Tenove, Heidi Tworek and Fenwick McKelvey have pointed out that content moderation is not standardized and lacks federal oversight. Platforms often apply content moderation categories, such as “adult content,” without transparency or accountability. Tumblr’s CEO, Jeff D’Onofrio, said : “There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community.” It seems that with this new change, youth who want to encounter sexual content will need to relocate. While some young people may turn to pornography sites, many of these sites are not designed with diverse sexual and gender identities in mind. Youth entering these sites may be more likely to encounter stigmatized, stereotypical and demeaning representations of women and transgender people. Even LGBTQ-friendly pornography sites don’t have the elaborate community networks unique to Tumblr. Such communities help youth to make sense of sexual content in relation to who they are becoming as they grow up. Tumblr’s decision means LGBTQ youth will have one less outlet where they can learn about sexual identity and gain support from peers who are like them and sharing content for them.

"Story by Holly Yan and Madeleine Stix, CNN
Video and photos by Madeleine Stix and Tawanda Scott Sambou, CNN","Story by Holly Yan and Madeleine Stix, CNN Video and photos by Madeleine Stix and Tawanda Scott Sambou, CNN Updated 8:53 AM ET, Sat March 31, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN) Craig Troxell steps precariously across a customer's roof, marking hail damage from yet another Oklahoma storm. He still smells of the freshly cut grass from the swanky side of town, where he had just mowed lawns to make a few extra dollars. But Troxell, 50, isn't a landscaper nor roof salesman by trade. He's a full-time high school science teacher who works four jobs to make ends meet. ""Teacher morale gets worse every year,"" said Troxell, who also drives a school bus before and after school. ""I've heard a lot of my (teacher) acquaintances walk away and get a different job. They don't want to do it anymore."" Oklahoma is among the bottom three states for teacher salaries, where educators often work about 10 years before reaching the $40,000 salary mark. And they haven't gotten a raise from the state in 10 years. While educators nationwide have seen slight paycheck bumps over the past decade, when adjusted for inflation, teachers have actually lost 3% of their income from 2006 to 2016, according to the National Education Association. Lawmakers agreed on an average teacher raise of $6,100, $1,250 for support staff and a $50 million increase in education funding -- a measure Gov. Mary Fallin signed into law Thursday. But many teachers say it's not enough. So on Monday, Troxell and thousands of other teachers will walk out -- prompting some schools to shut down indefinitely. ""We're at the end of the rope,"" Troxell said. He's far from alone. Several teachers told CNN they're working multiple jobs in food delivery, retail, rideshare driving, restaurants and even surrogate pregnancy to pay the bills. Some now rely on a food bank to feed their own children. The teacher with six jobs Almost every morning, Jonathan Moy's two daughters ask him the same heartbreaking question: ""Are we going to see you today?"" He gets visibly emotional thinking about how many days he tells them no. ""It's really tough when your daughters get sad because you tell them you're not going to see them,"" said Moy, 40. ""And it almost breaks your heart, because it's not their fault. It's not my fault. It's the situation that we're in."" Moy teaches high school algebra, drives a school bus in the afternoon, coaches football and wrestling, umpires Little League baseball and drives for rideshare services. All of that combined, Moy said, brings home about $36,000 a year after taxes. ""Last night I drove Lyft and Uber for six, seven hours,"" Moy said. ""When you have to do that to help supplement your income, it's tough when you don't get home when your kids go to bed."" But he fights off the exhaustion by the time the bell rings at Yukon High School, just west of Oklahoma City. As 32 teenagers fill his classroom, Moy's demeanor is as cheerful as the yellow and blue lights strung all across his ceiling. ""Half of teaching is having them just enjoy coming into school,"" Moy said. ""If you can actually get them to enjoy coming into your classroom with your atmosphere, your jokes or just having a good time, that's half the battle."" When explaining a new algebra concept, Moy draws analogies to jelly beans and tacos. He plays ""Hotel California"" and ""Roll With It"" as students practice factoring polynomials. Moy's unorthodox style has paid off. ""I was looking at your STAR (standardized) test we took,"" he told his class of mostly freshmen. ""You started the year at a 7th grade level. Now you're above a 12th."" Freshman Zach Ennis said Moy has made algebra easier to learn. ""I really like him, he's a really good teacher. He explains stuff really good,"" Ennis said. Ennis said he supports his teacher walking out next week, even though he might have to make up school days in the summer. ""It's kind of sad that he has to do that many jobs,"" Ennis said. ""He should be able to concentrate just on teaching."" Moy said he wants to keep teaching in Oklahoma, where he was born and raised. But he and his wife Kendra, who's an elementary school teacher, can't understand why educators in their state are paid so little compared to neighboring Texas and Arkansas. ""The salary in Fort Worth (Texas) is starting at $51,000 to work at Fort Worth public schools,"" Moy said. ""In Oklahoma, the starting pay is $31,000. And even if you've been teaching 25, 30 years, it's really tough to get to that level of income as a teacher."" Despite their meager incomes, the Moys said they spend a combined $2,000 on their classrooms each year -- including crayons and glue sticks for Kendra Moy's 3rd grade students. At her school, the entire student body qualifies for free or reduced lunch. Their 10-year-old daughter Karlie said she wishes her dad could go to more of her basketball and softball games. But she understands why he keeps teaching and working so many jobs. ""I just want him to do what he likes,"" she said. ""He's just trying to help our family out."" The teacher who's also a surrogate mother When Allyson Kubat started teaching at Mustang High School, the school had no debate program. Just three years after launching one, Kubat's getting ready to take her undefeated debate team to the most elite tournament this June. ""We're going to nationals this year, which is kind of crazy,"" said Kubat, 29. It will be her final act as a teacher. ""I decided, as hard as it is, that next year I'm not going to be teaching anymore,"" Kubat said. She realized the 60 to 90 hours a week she works to support her kids meant that she rarely got to see her kids. The epiphany came when her 9-year-old daughter called her after school one day. ""She said, 'Mom, are you coming home today? Or are you going back to work?' Because I leave work (at the school) and I go to my second job, or my third job, and I don't get home until she's in bed or almost in bed."" Kubat's other jobs include event coordinating, food delivery and surrogate motherhood -- a venture that puts a significant strain on her body but pays more than her teaching salary of about $33,000. ""One of my students asked, 'So what's your other job?' Because the kids in this state know that their teachers are not just teachers,"" she said. ""They know that we have to do something else to survive."" Her husband, Clint, is an office manager who doesn't make much more than his wife's teaching salary. Before she started her second surrogate pregnancy this week, he said, the couple had already budgeted for that income. After this school year, Kubat will become a full-time event planner -- a bittersweet move, given how passionately she loves teaching. ""It is hard to give up what I've worked so hard to become,"" Kubat said. But she's tired of sacrificing crucial family time for teaching. ""It's time to stop being a martyr."" The rookie teacher and waitress By 8 a.m., Jennifer Winchester is teaching language arts to 5th graders. By 8 p.m., she's hoisting trays of enchiladas at a Mexican restaurant. As a first-year teacher, Winchester ""always understood"" she would struggle financially. ""In college, they would show us the pay increments... from zero to 25 years,"" Winchester said. She said a guest speaker came into her college class and ""literally begged us to stay in Oklahoma,"" telling prospective teachers to think of the kids and realize ""it's not their fault."" So Winchester pursued her passion, even if it meant moonlighting as a server to help pay the bills. ""I can remember back in the 4th grade, my teacher told my mom at a parent-teacher conference, 'If she doesn't become a teacher, I'll be very disappointed.' Even in the classroom, I'd help other students,"" Winchester recalled. Now, as a professional teacher, she again finds herself going the extra mile for students. Despite her $31,000 teaching salary, she spent about $1,200 getting her classroom in shape for this school year, buying new shelves and books and replacing worn-out desks. ""I tried to stop tracking those receipts, because it depresses me,"" she said. While she hasn't suffered the years of frustration her veteran colleagues have, Winchester said she plans to walk out with them Monday. ""They've had it bad for a long time, and I don't want it to continue,"" she said. On a personal note, she said, a $10,000 raise would mean ""I won't have to have two jobs."" Winchester's long-term goal is to be a high school counselor. But she doesn't want to take on a master's degree in counseling until she's paid off her $23,000 in student loans. For now, she's hoping her nearly 10-year-old car ""with as many dents as you can find in it"" doesn't break down, since that could spell financial disaster. She fantasizes about owning a slightly nicer car one day. ""My goal is to have automatic windows and locks,"" she said. The teacher with 2 degrees and 2 mall jobs Shontée Branton has bachelor's and master's degrees in early childhood education. But when she gets to the checkout lane at the grocery store, she has to turn around. ""In my mind, I'm like, 'What do I need to put back?' Because I know I can't afford all of this,"" said the 1st-grade teacher at Epperly Heights Elementary. ""Maybe I want the strawberries, but I can make it without."" Branton, who's been teaching for nine years, said she makes about $36,000 a year. She supplements that by tutoring, teaching summer school and working at Macy's -- both on the retail floor and in the human resources office. ""Normally, I leave from the school and go straight to Macy's and clock in,"" she said. '""There's times I leave my house at 7 in the morning, and I don't come home until 10 o'clock at night."" That's when her 3rd-floor apartment looks more like a mountain summit. ""I literally come home and sit in my car for 30 minutes because I can't muster the strength to go up the stairs,"" she said. Branton said she's thinking about moving to Texas, where a teacher with her experience and education can earn about $20,000 more a year. But she feels a calling to teach in Del City, where she grew up and where all the students at her school qualify for free or reduced lunch. ""I grew up with a single-parent home; both parents struggled with drug abuse,"" she said. ""When I see those kids, I see myself. And I had a teacher or two who believed in me."" Branton said she's walking out Monday not just for teachers' raises, but for another key demand: more funding for education in the state. She said she never wants to teach an overstuffed class of 34 students with only 25 textbooks again. ""A lot of people are saying we're walking out on our kids. And that's been one of the most hurtful things, because we feel like we're walking for our children,"" Branton said. ""People are expecting us to do a job without the proper resources. And not only is it not fair to educators, it's not fair to the kids."" ""It would have to be the kids. I mean, that's non-negotiable,"" Branton said. ""Yes, I need more money. I'm tired of working multiple jobs. But in the grand scheme of things, if we educate these kids, then that's better for society."" If neither of those demands are fully met, Branton said, Oklahoma could lose yet another teacher. ""If it's not passed, I probably will leave,"" she said. ""It would be the hardest choice."" The state superintendent's response Joy Hofmeister says the teachers' frustration is justified. ""Our teachers are right -- they have been underpaid,"" the state superintendent said. ""We know that the frustration is high, that it's something that comes after a decade-long reduction to public education funding."" But ""the legislature can't reverse in one bill the cuts that have come over a decade."" She said the main reason why it's been so difficult to increase spending for teachers and education is because in 1992, the state constitution was changed to require a supermajority approval -- 75% of the legislature -- before taxes could be raised. ""It's been 28 years since Oklahoma has raised taxes,"" Hofmeister said. ""We've been operating with the same dollars as 2008, but with more than 50,000 more students."" She said it's ""unconscionable"" that some teachers work three to six jobs to make ends meet. ""Our teachers deserve better,"" she said. ""And that was answered with this historic teacher pay raise. This is an important step forward. But it's not the only thing that is needed."" The food bank that serves teachers Lori Decter Wright admits there's a stereotype about those who rely on food banks. Maybe they work at fast-food restaurants. Maybe they got hit with an unexpected medical bill. Then, starting around 2015, she noticed a shocking trend: teachers, including some with master's degrees, also needed supplies of cereal, beans and canned vegetables. ""We have teachers near the poverty level,"" said Decter Wright, executive director of Kendall Whittier, Inc. -- a ministry that runs an emergency food pantry in Tulsa. ""I really had to start asking the question, 'What is going on in Oklahoma that full-time, working professional teachers have to rely on services like ours to make ends meet?"" Michael Turner is one of the teachers who came in to the food pantry, embarrassed that he needed assistance. ""You're used to taking care of yourself. No one likes to ask for help, and that's pretty tough,"" said Turner, a recently divorced father of a special needs daughter. Turner said he ""answered a call to action"" when he became a special needs teacher. ""There was a big push in the state of Oklahoma to hire veterans to teach special ed at the middle school level,"" he said. ""It's very, very difficult to be a teacher... I knew that it was hard, but teaching today is much more difficult."" And when he comes home to his own child, he faces the guilt of seeing a kitchen pantry with empty shelves. Turner says he's grateful for the food pantry's assistance and regrets not reaching out for help months earlier. ""I always fought the notion that I would be the one asking for services, asking for help,"" he said. ""I'd much rather be giving it.""","Craig Troxell steps precariously across a customer's roof, marking hail damage from yet another Oklahoma storm.

Andy Greenberg,"With the rise and fall of dark web black markets like Alphabay and the Silk Road, law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned that even anonymity tools like Tor and cryptocurrencies won't hide criminals from the law's long reach. But the most recent takedown of another massive cybercrime forum carries a different lesson: It's still possible to create an online black market even outside of the dark web's cover, grow it to a half-billion dollar operation, and get away with it for the better part of a decade. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against no fewer than 36 people, accused of acting variously as administrators, moderators, and sellers of illegal hacking and fraud services on a black market forum known as Infraud. A coordinated action by Homeland Security Investigations and cops in Australia, Britain, France, Italy, Kosovo and Serbia arrested 13 of those named, and took down the website itself, replacing it with a seizure notice. The indictment accuses those dozens of defendants, located from Moldova to the Ivory Coast to Bangladesh, of trading in stolen credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, compromised accounts, and materials to create counterfeit cards. They were also allegedly involved in malware, money laundering, and so-called ""bulletproof"" hosting services designed to host other illegal online operations. In total, the forum's members are accused of causing $530 million dollars in damage to companies and individuals. ""Infraud was truly the premier one-stop shop for cybercriminals worldwide,"" the Justice Department's Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Rybicki told reporters in a press conference. The forum's members are accused of causing $530 million dollars in damage to companies and individuals. But just as noteworthy as the staggering scale of that busted operation—one of the largest in history—is its relative impunity. The majority of the defendants, according to the Justice Department's statements, seemingly remain at large. That includes Infraud's creator, the Ukrainian Svyatoslav Bondarenko. And after seven years online, Infraud also achieved longevity that's far greater than most online black markets. The Silk Road, for instance, despite running as a carefully anonymized Tor Hidden Service and only using the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, persisted on the dark web for two and a half years before it was seized and its administrator arrested. The more recent go-to bazaar for dark web contraband, AlphaBay, lasted just three years. Infraud remained online well over twice as long as those fellow black markets, while at times hiding in plain sight. The forum was initially hosted as a traditional website, reachable at the URLs infraud.cc and infraud.ws, though it may have later moved to Tor or other better hidden addresses. The administrators' most effective tactic to evade law enforcement for so long may have been an old-fashioned one: They ran the site from a server in a country beyond US law enforcement's reach, likely Russia, says former FBI cybercrime agent EJ Hilbert, who's now a vice president of cybersecurity at security firm Gavin DeBecker and Associates. Hilbert speculates that the site used the same sort of ""bulletproof"" hosting that site's vendors offered for sale, which keeps servers far from American and Western European cops, anonymizes their operators, and frequently moves them to stay a step ahead of investigators. ""They were sitting in countries outside the jurisdiction of Western law enforcement,"" says Hilbert. ""That’s why something like this can remain live for an extended period of time."" In fact, since March of 2011, less than a year after allegedly founding Infraud, Bondarenko declared that all buying and selling of contraband with Russian victims would be banned from the forum. That tactic, frequently used by Russia-based crime sites, effectively dissuades Russian law enforcement from pursuing most domestically hosted cybercrime. Berkeley computer security researcher Nick Weaver argues that form of ""arbitrage""—running a crime scheme with profitable victims in one locale, while hosting in another that's safer from prosecution—can provide more effective shielding for criminals than Tor. ""You find a place where the local laws are happy and host there,"" Weaver says. ""A cybercrime forum that is 'no damage to Russia' is generally allowed in Russia, no need to use Tor."" 'A cybercrime forum that is ""no damage to Russia"" is generally allowed in Russia, no need to use Tor.' Nick Weaver, University of California at Berkeley That geographic strategy is a well-worn one for cybercriminals, and it long predates both the dark web and Infraud. But given the scale and long life of Infraud's criminal activity, the site shows just how effective it remains even now. And Hilbert argues that the recent decline in Russian-American relations—particularly around Russia's own state-sponsored hacking operations —won't help. ""With our government's animosity to the Russians, and their animosity to us, there’s no reason for them to assist on crimes that don’t impact their people,"" says Hilbert. Just how US, Australian, and European authorities did eventually shut down Infraud remains unclear, and the Justice Department declined to make any officials available to answer WIRED's questions. As part of the indictment, the Justice Department described a complex organizational chart of Infraud's alleged staff—from members to VIP members to moderators to super moderators to administrators—which Hilbert suggests could mean they spent years slowly flipping members to identify others in the organization, or gain more information about the site's hosting. Despite many of Infraud's defendants remaining free, the Justice Department's Rybicki emphasized that the takedown represents a win for the global fight against cybercrime. ""The charges and arrests announced today are a victory for the rule of law,"" he said. ""Law enforcement across the globe acted swiftly to take Infraud’s cybercriminals off the Internet."" The Infraud bust will no doubt put a serious dent in the cybercriminal underground. But if seven years counts as a ""swift"" operation, the next Russian black market administrators may be taking comfort in the prospect of a long career ahead of them.

"Jamelle Bouie, Jamelle Bouie","Watched by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Vice President Mike Pence, U.S. President Donald Trump shows an executive order on immigration that he signed in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday in Washington. President Trump created the child-separation crisis when he imposed a “zero tolerance” policy for border crossings. Where the Obama administration detained families ahead of civil proceedings conducted in immigration court, the Trump administration decided to pursue criminal prosecution of immigrants and asylum-seekers, arresting parents and separating them from their children, with the explicit notion that the trauma could serve as a deterrent to others who might seek asylum. Now, Trump wants credit for ending the crisis he created, calling an executive order he signed on Wednesday “very compassionate.” But the order neither ends the crisis nor produces a more humane status quo. It’s a public relations stunt, meant to dampen criticism without changing the fundamentals of the policy. “Zero tolerance” is still in effect, and Trump’s manufactured crisis may well get worse. The executive order, titled “ Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation,” does three things. It continues the zero tolerance policy of prosecution for illegal entry, but directs the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together in custody, instead of separating parents and placing them with the Department of Justice. Families will remain in DHS custody for the duration of their criminal and immigration cases, which may mean months of waiting in detention facilities. The order neither ends the crisis nor produces a more humane status quo. As it stands, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is running out of space for the adults it already has in custody. To accommodate new detainees, the president has allowed other departments, including the military, to provide additional space. Thousands of children will move into facilities without the staff or equipment to handle them or their needs. Trump’s executive order also directs Attorney General Jeff Sessions to challenge a 1997 ruling that prohibits long-term immigration detention for children, either alone or with their parents. This gets to the name of the executive order, which isn’t just rhetorical flair. Under the terms of the Flores settlement, the federal government can hold children for a maximum of 20 days. Given the likely length of immigration proceedings, there’s a strong chance that Trump’s order will compel a violation of the settlement. Only Congress can fully resolve the problem, and it seems highly unlikely to come to any kind of immigration agreement. You don’t have to look too closely to see the outline of a clear—and cynical—political gambit. President Trump signs an executive order ending child separation, but to carry it out, officials violate a federal court order. That requires a judge to step in and admonish the administration, after which Trump pulls back, resuming family separation with the help of an easy scapegoat. Either way, the situation for migrant parents and children looks bleak. Yes, they’ll be kept together, but in conditions that weren’t designed for mass detention of families. And the haphazard nature of the policy only raises the real possibility of abuse and neglect, seen already in the facilities used for child detention. There’s a reason critics have called these concentration camps; in both form and function —isolated tent cities and steel-wire enclosures that hold people targeted for their racial and cultural identities—they resemble the reconcentración zones of Spain’s Cuban occupation or the internment camps reserved for Japanese Americans during the Second World War. With this executive order, the policy of separating families appears to cease. But child internment will continue, with families together as prisoners in federal custody. Young children will still be locked in “tender age” camps; asylum-seekers will still be criminalized as dangers and threats to national integrity. And there’s still the matter of those children already separated from their parents. According to former Immigration and Customs Enforcement head John Sandweg, there’s a real chance of permanent separation. “You could easily end up in a situation where the gap between a parent’s deportation and a child’s deportation is years,” said Sandweg to NBC News. Of the thousands of children taken and detained by the Trump administration, some may never see their parents again. However this ends, irreparable damage has already been done.

Ed Cara,"Starting in 2015, doctors in Massachusetts began noticing a wave of typically young patients coming down with unexplained, sometimes permanent short-term memory loss. The only connection found between these patients was a history of recreational drugs; either heroin or cocaine. But these drugs almost never cause the kind of brain damage that results in amnesia, leading the doctors to believe something else had to explain why so many people were losing their memories at the same time. A new case report, published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine, might solve the puzzle once and for all: It suggests that a powerful, previously rare opioid—fentanyl—is most responsible for the symptoms. The report details a 30-year-old Maryland man with a history of heroin use who had recently returned home from a residential addiction treatment program. He had been sober for over a month, but one morning, family members found him in his room with drug paraphernalia. At first, the man was hard to wake up, and once he awoke, he couldn’t stop asking the same questions over and over, which worried his family enough to take him to a local hospital. After being transferred to another hospital in West Virginia with “persistent memory impairment,” the man was tested for drugs and his brain was scanned via MRI. The man showed the same sort of lesions along his hippocampus (and basal ganglia) that others have had. He tested positive for cocaine, but his urine also contained the broken-down remnants of fentanyl. It’s the first case of this “amnesiac syndrome” that has been definitively linked to fentanyl; other victims have only been tested for or reported general opioid use. “We are getting more and more evidence that fentanyl plays an essential role in this syndrome,” Alfred Demaria, an epidemiologist and medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), told me. Demaria is not affiliated with the current report, but he and his colleagues at the MDPH have worked with some of its co-authors to track cases in the state. The legions seen in these patients were caused when the brain’s oxygen flow to the hippocampus was temporarily cut off. A cocaine or heroin overdose can stop a person’s breathing and heart. But fentanyl, its analogs, and other synthetic opioids are much more potent than heroin, making an overdose likelier. Fentanyl might also act independently on the hippocampus to help cause the syndrome. “It seems to rev up the metabolism of the hippocampus,” Demaria explained. This supercharging then might make the effects of any oxygen deprivation to the area caused by an overdose all the more damaging. “But the exact mechanisms of how this happens is going to be beyond [what we can find] from survelliance,” he added. “We need more research.” Fentanyl being the primary culprit also lines up well with the timeline of cases. In 2016, the MDPH looked through old hospital records, eventually finding 14 people within the state whose symptoms fit the bill for the syndrome. But the cases only dated back to 2012, with most having occurred after 2014. Right around that same time, fentanyl use started becoming more common. The drug is regularly prescribed by doctors as a powerful painkiller following major surgery, but the kind available illicitly has been mostly shipped over from China. The drug and its nearest cousins are typically cheaper to produce than heroin, and less is needed to accomplish the same high, so dealers are incentivized to sell it. Oftentimes, though, users don’t even know they’re taking fentanyl, since many dealers secretly cut their marketed heroin or other drugs with it. This surge in fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has also led to more deaths. In 2016, they were responsible for more than half of the fatal overdoses seen across at least 10 states and around 20,000 deaths total that year. According to Demaria, the tally of known amnesia cases is now somewhere around 20. But while the current report details a Maryland patient, he hasn’t heard of any dedicated effort to track cases elsewhere. Doctors and health departments have certainly become more aware of the syndrome and even reach out to the MDPH for advice, Demaria said, but it’s difficult for anyone to justify devoting limited resources to study an interesting, but seemingly rare side-effect of fentanyl overdoses when there are much more pressing problems. “We’re faced with this dilemma that we have thousands of people dying of overdoses,” he said. “We’re struggling with a huge epidemic; we’re struggling to keep people alive.” That isn’t to say that those afflicted by the syndrome have necessarily been fortunate. At least two of the 14 patients the MDPH initially studied in 2016 were found to have memory and learning problems more than a year after their initial amnesia. So it’s likely that many overdose survivors’ ongoing cognition problems have gone unnoticed by doctors. “It’s another consequence of this terrible epidemic of opioid use, especially with the introduction of fentanyl,” Demaria said “We’re seeing more overdose deaths and more frequent injections, which leads to more bloodborne infections... it’s really a bad circumstance we’re in right now.” [ Annals of Internal Medicine ]","Starting in 2015, doctors in Massachusetts began noticing a wave of typically young patients coming down with unexplained, sometimes permanent short-term memory loss.

Cameron Kunzelman,"Dark Souls mechanics explainer illusorywall has created a new video to show exactly how fall damage works in that game. It’s worth knowing about. In this entry of Dark Souls Dissected, we get an explanation of the different kinds of fall damage in Dark Souls. I’ll admit that I wasn’t exactly sure how this worked before. I assumed that it was just specific heights that would kill a player, but as the video explains, there are a whole host of design decisions centered around fall damage that impact the broad design of the game. As illusorywall points out, there are two different ways that the designers used fall damage: killboxes (which kill players when they move through them) and a formula that takes a percentage of health based on fall height and equipment load. Illusorywall moves through how all of those different methods are used in the game. The close attention to the game’s rules around fall damage provides a great picture of how the designers of Dark Souls used fall damage as a part of the game’s broader risk vs reward system. In the same way that you have to make some calculations about picking a fight or entering a boss room, Dark Souls also often demands that you choose between a faster route (and taking some fall damage) or a slower route that preserves your health.

The study presented at ENDO 2019, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in New Orleans, La., says that the repeat miscarriage may be caused by sperm DNA damage rather than by a problem in affected women.
“Our study suggests that it may be useful to investigate if male partners of women with RPL have abnormalities in their reproductive function,” said lead researcher Channa Jayasena, MD, Ph D, of Imperial College of London, UK.“It also opens up a new potential ‘drug target’. It may be possible to design future drugs to stop sperm DNA damage to treat couples with RPL and reduce the risk of miscarriage,” added Jayasena.
Between one and two per cent of couples have recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as the consecutive loss of three or more pregnancies before 20 weeks gestation.
“Affected women undergo many tests to determine the cause, but many cases have no identified cause,” said Jayasena.Male partners of women with RPL do not routinely undergo an assessment to see if they play a role. “However, we know that sperm plays an important role in the formation of the placenta, which is critical for the survival of an unborn baby,” said Jayasena.
The study was designed to assess whether male partners of women with RPL may have an increased risk of sperm DNA damage, which is known to impair fertility.
The researchers compared 50 healthy men whose partners had not experienced miscarriages with 63 men whose partners were affected by RPL. They measured levels of sex hormones such as testosterone, the number, and behaviour of sperm using a microscope, and further molecular tests.
Also, they measured the level of damage to sperm DNA, and level of a chemical entity called reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells such as sperm in the semen of men.
They found out that the men affected by RPL had twice sperm DNA damage compared with the unaffected men. Men whose partners had suffered miscarriage also had a four-fold increase in the number of reactive oxygen species compared with unaffected men.","Damage to sperm DNA can lead to repeat miscarriages The Siasat Daily Washington: A new study has revealed that in some cases, recurrent pregnancy loss may be caused by sperm DNA damage in the male partner.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"In the absence of proactive tools to prevent dirtbags from nonconsensually uploading intimate photos to the internet, victims of revenge porn have little surefire recourse to ensure the photos stop circulating online. Its an exhausting and devastating game of whack-a-mole, and even when images are effectively scrubbed, the damage has been done. Thats why Facebooks announcement today that its ramping up its program to police nonconsensual image-sharing feels like a glimmer of hope in the fight against revenge porn.
But Facebooks latest effort, as promising as it is, remains frustratingly vague, leaving vulnerable users with key questions unanswered.
Facebook announced in a blog post on Friday its new detection technology that will help flag and remove intimate photos shared on its platform without the subjects consent. By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, we can now proactively detect near nude images or videos that are shared without permission on Facebook and Instagram, Antigone Davis, Facebooks global head of safety, wrote in the post. This means we can find this content before anyone reports it, which is important for two reasons: often victims are afraid of retribution so they are reluctant to report the content themselves or are unaware the content has been shared.
The technology Facebook announced on Friday will detect intimate photos that have already been uploaded to Facebook and Instagram. A specially-trained member of Facebooks Community Operations team will then review the images and remove them from the platform if they are found in violation of the social networks Community Standards. The team will also disable accounts that have shared said content in most cases, according to Davis.
Facebooks new detection tech will work in tandem with the pilot program it announced last year, which lets users preemptively submit intimate photos to the company that they dont want to be shared on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger. The images are reviewed by a team of five Facebook employees, hashed, and then any images matching the hashes will be prevented from being uploaded to the services.
In addition to bolstering its efforts to scrub the site of revenge porn, Facebook is also launching a support hub for victims called Not Without My Consent, where victims can find organizations and resources to support them, including steps they can take to remove the content from our platform and prevent it from being shared further and they can access our pilot program, Davis writes.
What remains unclear is how Facebooks new AI tool will be able to identify whether the intimate photos it flags have been uploaded without someones consent. While its sometimes legitimate for tech companies to keep the intricate inner workings of anti-harassment tools under wraps so that bad actors cant abuse or exploit them, in this case, we need to understand more about this new technology. Facebook doesnt have to release a detailed blueprint of its detection tech, but it should be able to tell us how its able to determine the intent behind a user sharing an intimate photo. This is a tool meant to help some of Facebooks most vulnerable users, and leaving them in the dark about crucial functionality challenges faith in the system.
Facebooks initial efforts to combat revenge porn made it inherently obvious that a photo someone is trying to upload is being shared nonconsensually, given that the would-be victim has preemptively shared the image to ensure it isnt posted online. That is not the case with Facebooks new detection technologythese photos are flagged after theyve already been uploaded, and its unclear whether theyre the ones that have been reported to Facebook. How will this detection technology be able to discern a lingerie photo that someone uploads confidently of themselves versus a photo of a woman in lingerie that was taken in private by a former partner who is now vindictively posting it across his social media pages? Or, how will this new detection tech be able to differentiate revenge porn from a nude work of art or a historically significant photo?
Moderating large platforms like Facebook is difficult business, and the companys efforts to better police revenge porn and protect victims is good and necessary, but it needs to ensure that transparency remains at the forefront.
We have reached out to Facebook for comment on how its new detection technology will be able to identify whether an intimate photo has been shared without someones consent, and will update when they respond.
Update 1:30pm ET: Facebook told Gizmodo in an email that its detection technology was trained on revenge porn in order to better understand what these types of posts would look like, and so it is able to identify whether an intimate or nude image or video is shared without someones consent. However, they didnt provide any further details on how it would work. AI, as stands, has yet to prove that it can understand even basic human nuances, but Facebook seems confident that it will understand whether a post is vindictive.","In the absence of proactive tools to prevent dirtbags from nonconsensually uploading intimate photos to the internet, victims of revenge porn have little surefire recourse to ensure the photos stop circulating online.

Merrit Kennedy,"The pipeline on rural farmland near the small community of Amherst, S.D., was likely damaged when it was installed in 2008, federal investigators say. DroneBase via AP Federal investigators say that construction damage was likely to blame for an oil spill earlier this month from the Keystone pipeline in South Dakota. The Keystone Pipeline is a 2,687-mile crude oil pipeline that runs from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, where it then splits, with one portion running to Illinois and the other to Texas. It is owned by TransCanada, the same firm that is seeking to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. The spill happened on rural farmland near the small community of Amherst, S.D., and was initially estimated to have released some 210,000 gallons of crude. Federal investigators say that they now have an ""unconfirmed lower spill estimate,"" without specifying how much. According to a report released by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the company detected a pressure drop in the pipeline early in the morning on Nov. 16 and started to shut it down three minutes later. They say the spill was likely caused because of mechanical damage that occurred when this portion of the pipeline was built in 2008. The damage, the investigators add, was probably caused by a weight installed at the time. ""Such weights are used in places where changing water levels could make a pipeline float,"" NPR's Jeff Brady reported. The federal agency says that TransCanada received a special permit in 2007 allowing it to operate at a stress level higher than regulations typically allow. The company got a permit for it to be operated at a stress level of 80 percent of what the steel pipe should be able to handle at a minimum, as opposed to the typical 72 percent. According to the report, the company was also required to inspect or monitor the pipeline more closely than usual. The PHMSA says it is still investigating the incident. TransCanada said earlier this week that it was starting to operate the pipeline again with reduced pressure starting Tuesday. A spokesman told The Associated Press that a ""safe, controlled and gradual startup"" of the pipeline has begun. It wasn't immediately clear when the pipeline would be back to full capacity. Last week, the company stated that some 170 people were working to clean up the site, and that they had recovered some 44,730 gallons of crude. It added that the crude had not caused any ""water issues"" to date. ""Keystone has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010, according to documents reviewed by Reuters,"" the wire service reported. The separate Keystone XL pipeline, subject of major criticism from environmental groups, cleared a major regulatory hurdle earlier this month when it was approved by the Nebraska Public Service Commission. However, NPR's Colin Dwyer reported that ""the regulators rejected TransCanada's preferred route through the state, suggesting another one farther east that would avoid the state's Sandhills region."" That route change has complicated the process of building the more controversial pipeline, because it involves counties that had not previously been included in the path.","The leak was initially estimated to have released some 210,000 gallons of crude.

Scott Horsley,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the mission of the EPA on December 7, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Pete Marovich/Getty Images The nation's top environmental official kept busy Wednesday trying to clean up his own reputation, while a White House spokeswoman offered only a tepid defense. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt gave interviews to Fox News and the Daily Signal in which he defended a controversial housing arrangement and insisted he was unaware that two top aides had been given pay raises over the objection of the White House personnel office. The efforts at damage control come during a high-profile week for Pruitt, who's led the administration's push to unravel much of the Obama administration's climate agenda. On Monday, Pruitt announced plans to roll back automotive fuel economy standards, even as he was ducking questions about what appeared to be a sweetheart housing arrangement in an apartment owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist. The deal, first reported by ABC and Bloomberg, allowed Pruitt to live in the apartment for several months last year while paying $50 a night. Pruitt insists the arrangement was vetted by EPA ethics officials, and the agency produced a memo last week justifying the lease as fair-market rent. Others have questioned that because Pruitt paid only for the nights he was actually in residence. Reps. Don Beyer, D-Va., and Ted Lieu, D-Calif., have asked the agency's inspector general to investigate. Two Republican lawmakers from Florida, Carlos Curbelo (who is running for re-election) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (who is retiring from Congress), have joined Beyer in calling for Pruitt's resignation. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked during Wednesday's press briefing why the president, who campaigned on a promise to ""drain the swamp,"" would be satisfied with a Cabinet member enjoying such a favorable rental arrangement with a lobbyist. ""The president's not,"" Sanders said. ""We're reviewing the situation. When we have had the chance to have a deeper dive on it, we'll let you know the outcomes of that, but we're currently reviewing that here at the White House."" Trump spoke to Pruitt by telephone Monday night, but White House officials declined to describe the details of the call. ""The president thinks he's done a good job, particularly on the deregulation front,"" Sanders said. ""But again, we take this seriously, we're looking into it and we'll let you know when we finish."" Pruitt is also under scrutiny for pay raises granted to two staffers who previously worked for him in Oklahoma and followed Pruitt to the EPA. According to the Atlantic, the White House personnel office vetoed the raises, but they were granted anyway under authority from the Safe Drinking Water Act — a move that also allowed an EPA staffer to skirt limits on former lobbyists. In his Fox interview, Pruitt said he was not involved in granting the pay raises and that he'd taken steps to reverse them. ""My staff and I found out about it yesterday and I changed it,"" he said. Pruitt was previously a favorite of the president's. The EPA leader has promoted fossil fuel development and encouraged Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. Pruitt, who is skeptical of the scientific consensus surrounding climate change, has felt the heat himself on numerous ethical fronts. Watchdogs have questioned his first-class travel habits, his round-the-clock security detail and his frequent visits to Oklahoma, where he's believed to have further political ambitions.","EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is fending off a series of ethics investigations, amid lukewarm support from the White House.",2018-04-04T21:47:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Dogged By Scandal, EPA's Pruitt Turns To Damage Control",https://www.npr.org/2018/04/04/599591486/dogged-by-scandal-epas-pruitt-turns-to-damage-control,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/04/04/gettyimages-887736278pruitt_wide-d8773a150594a1ab67f57e1b91d0fbe5a3f6de24.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,damage,0
Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"After all of those years of humans holding dolphins in shackles, mocking them with cutesy depictions in the media, and forcing them to do tricks under inhumane conditions at theme parks, the cetaceans may finally have their revenge. They’re attacking our fisheries. Dolphins are really smart, and like us humans, they need to eat. So it should be of no surprise that when dolphins are near fisheries, there seems to be a six times greater chance of net damage, according to a new study on Northern Cyprus, which has taken to investigating the occurrence. “Over-fishing in the Mediterranean has become so pervasive that it has created a vicious cycle for the dolphins and fishers [in Northern Cyprus] as they compete for the remaining fish,” the authors write in Human Ecology. By now you’re probably aware that people around the world are concerned that we’re taking too many fish out of the ocean. But fish catchers are also increasingly reporting looting from the likes of seals and cetaceans, a group that comprises dolphins, whales, and porpoises. Europe demonstrates a clear example of this conflict: Half of the Mediterranean stocks are overfished, and fisheries report between 500 euros to 20,000 euros in annual damage per fishing boat, thanks to dolphins. The researchers were specifically interested in the situation in Northern Cyprus—due to political disputes, it does not follow the same fishing regulations as the rest of the European Union. They polled 140 fishing vessel captains about their experience with dolphins, monitored dolphin presence with underwater microphones, and even deployed 46 of their own experimental fishing nets on 14 fishing boats in order to actually quantify the extent of the dolphin fish-stealing problem. Of the 140 captains, 131 reported observing dolphins in the past year. The instruments also picked up dolphin sounds year-round. The net damage wasn’t huge—around 1.4 square meters lost per 80 meters of net—but this increased by a factor of six in areas with more dolphins. There wasn’t enough data to make a statistically significant claim—but there was enough data to blame dolphins for some of the damage. The dolphin-fishery war has created a cycle. We fish, there’s less fish, the dolphin go looking for fish, they steal ours, so we go fishing more. What do we do? The researchers suggest better fishery management and more regulations. Loud underwater noisemakers might act as defense, but their impacts on dolphins and other species haven’t been studied. Plus, that seems really mean. Or we just surrender. Perhaps dolphins would be a better dominant species to rule the Earth than humans have been.

Ed Cara,"People living with opioid addiction are increasingly using the inhalation method to get high, warns a new review published Monday in JAMA Neurology. The technique known as “chasing the dragon,” which involves heating up heroin and inhaling its fumes through a pipe, may be safer in some ways than injection, but it comes with its own set of devastating side effects, including irreversible brain damage and dementia. The doctors behind the study, led by neurologist Ciro Ramos-Estebanez of the Cleveland Medical Center, were inspired to study the topic after coming across a strange case in 2015. A young woman suffering from opioid intoxication had fallen into a coma. The coma was caused by a buildup of spinal fluid in her brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus. The woman’s spinal fluid had become trapped by chronic inflammation in the brain caused by inhaling heroin. She ultimately recovered from her coma, though with lasting cognitive impairment, after doctors performed emergency surgery that drained the lodged spinal fluid. It was the first case of hydrocephalus linked to inhaled heroin ever reported, and it made Ramos-Estebanez and his team eager to understand the phenomenon better. “This is something that’s unrecognized by physicians—people don’t really think about it. And that’s a problem,” Ramos-Estebanez told Gizmodo. “It’s something we can’t neglect anymore.” Looking at more than 30 studies and case reports, which included the cases of two other patients at their hospital, the team settled on some basic observations. For one, while there’s sparse information on how often addicts are inhaling heroin, the little data that does exist suggests it’s the fastest growing method of use, the team found. In countries such as Sri Lanka, Norway, and India, over two-thirds of heroin users admit inhaling it regularly. In the US, injection is still the most common method, but inhalation is increasing, especially in cities and areas east of the Mississippi. It’s also becoming more popular among teens. In 2014, the team found, 21 percent of all inpatient hospital visits due to heroin abuse among 12- to 19-year-olds involved inhalation. The extent of damage caused by inhaling heroin also runs along a spectrum. At its mildest, it can cause memory loss and mild but long-lasting cognitive impairment; at its worst, it can kill off and create sponge-like holes in the brain’s white matter, the bundles of connective fiber that allow brain cells to talk to one another. That can lead to seizures, problems speaking, progressively worse dementia, coma, and death. Ramos-Estebanez and his team also developed a theory as how and why this damage happens. The high temperatures used to vaporize heroin, they speculate, metabolize it into a chemical that can cross the blood-brain barrier with greater ease. And because how fast it gets to the brain, these chemicals aren’t metabolized by the body into a relatively less toxic substance. The end result is a potent high that is more directly dangerous to the brain. “Most people who take heroin intravenously don’t develop this condition,” Ramos-Estebanez said. “You’re actually washing out the dose a bit before it gets to the brain.” Inhaled heroin is usually heated on top of aluminum foil to create the fumes. That has led some doctors to wonder if traces of melted aluminum embedded into the vapor are more responsible for the brain-damaging effects. But Ramos-Estebanez notes that little evidence supports that theory. Since there are newer tests that can find aluminum in the brain, though, he supports studies that can definitively settle the debate. Ultimately, Ramos-Estebanez wants doctors and the public to treat inhaled heroin as an emerging public health problem. Being able to recognize its signs in opioid users earlier might just be life-saving, too: Some small studies have identified a few drugs that seem capable of preventing further brain damage if administered quickly enough. Some countries, including the UK, allow doctors to offer free foil to heroin users so they can inhale the drug rather than inject it. And while these users don’t seem to have the same health problems typically linked to inhaled heroin, Ramos-Estebanez notes that these users are often given support and treatment to wean themselves off addiction at the same time, and they have their doses supervised. “You’re inhaling it in a controlled manner, same as how methadone is used in other countries, so it’s like taking any other medication,” he said. “But if you don’t do it a controlled manner, with heroin off the streets, then you’re going to end up in a hospital with a coma.” Outside of these sites, Ramos-Estebanez wants to dispel the notion that inhaling heroin is necessarily safer than other routes, such as injection. Many people, for instance, may inhale to avoid the risk of catching bloodborne diseases through contaminated needles. “‘Chasing the dragon’ is not as safe as portrayed. And this isn’t something some doctor is saying to scare people away, it’s reality,” Ramos-Estebanez said. “It’s a heavy cost for patients, their families, and society itself.” In addition to creating accurate criteria that doctors can use to diagnose people who have brain damage caused by inhaled heroin, Ramos-Estebanez and his team are also currently trying to establish a registry so cases can be better tracked and studied.

ANI,"A new study has found that degradation of cartilage due to osteoarthritis could be prevented with the help of exercise.
The study, published in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, demonstrates the benefits of exercise on the tissues that form our joints.
The researchers have shown for the first time how mechanical forces experienced by cells in joints during exercise prevent cartilage degradation by suppressing the action of inflammatory molecules which cause osteoarthritis.
During exercise, the cartilage in joints such as the hip and knee is squashed. This mechanical distortion is detected by the living cells in the cartilage which then block the action of inflammatory molecules associated with conditions such as arthritis.
The researchers showed that this anti-inflammatory effect of physical activity is caused by activation of a particular protein, called HDAC6, which triggers changes in the proteins that form primary cilia.
Pharmaceutical drugs that blocked HDAC6 activation prevented the anti-inflammatory effects of physical activity, while other drug treatments were able to mimic the benefits of exercise.
Changes in length of the primary cilia, which are only a few 1000th of a millimetre, provided a biomarker of the level of inflammation. Cilia got longer during inflammation, but treatments that prevented this elongation successfully prevented inflammation.
Su Fu, a Ph.D. student at Queen Mary University of London and study author, said: ""We have known for some time that healthy exercise is good for you - now we know the process through which exercise prevents cartilage degradation.""
Professor Martin Knight, lead researcher of the study added: ""These findings may also explain the anti-inflammatory effects of normal blood flow in arteries which is important for preventing arterial diseases such as atherosclerosis and aneurysm.""
The researchers hope that these findings will help in the search for treatments for arthritis which affects over three million people in the UK causing stiff and painful joints.
The researchers suggest the results may lead to a whole new therapeutic approach known as mechano-medicine in which drugs simulate the effect of mechanical forces to prevent the damaging effects of inflammation and treat conditions such as arthritis.

Lee Berthiaume,"OTTAWA -- Jody Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet this week has stoked long-standing frustration, disappointment and anger among Canada's veterans, who say they have been ignored and betrayed by the Trudeau government.
The Liberals went out of their way during the last federal election to court former service members, as Justin Trudeau promised to improve service delivery and reinstate a lifelong disability pension for veterans after years of Conservative cuts and inaction.
That pension, first introduced after the First World War, was abolished by the Conservatives with unanimous support in the House of Commons in 2006 and replaced by a suite of rehabilitation programs and financial compensation for injured soldiers.
Since then, the Liberals have run through three veterans-affairs ministers in as many years -- Kent Hehr, Seamus O'Regan and Wilson-Raybould -- while making little headway on improving service delivery and breaking their pension promise.
The government has increased some supports and benefits for veterans and unveiled its own so-called Pension for Life program that will roll out in April, but that program has been widely assessed as falling far short of Trudeau's original pledge.
""Our key concern is there's been a betrayal of the commitment that the prime minister made in the election of 2015,"" said Brian Forbes, chair of the National Council of Veterans Associations, which represents more than 60 veteran groups.
""That is felt very strongly in the veterans' community.""
The Liberals have also been roundly accused of ignoring the various ministerial advisory groups and other mechanisms established after the 2015 election to solicit feedback from the veterans' community about its needs and concerns.
All of which had sowed seeds of discontent even before Wilson-Raybould was handed the veterans-affairs portfolio on Jan. 14, taking over from O'Regan in a move widely regarded as a demotion from her previous role as justice minister.
Now, while parliamentarians and Canadians at large wonder about the truth surrounding Wilson-Raybould's discussions with the prime minister's office about SNC-Lavalin, many veterans feel they have been forgotten. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has added responsibility for veterans to his duties, but only temporarily.
""It's like the veterans are the last priority in this story,"" said Aaron Bedard, an Afghan War veteran from B.C. who led an unsuccessful legal battle against the government to reinstate the old disability pension. ""We don't have a minister of veterans affairs anymore.""
Even before Wilson-Raybould's departure, some veterans and veterans' groups had questioned the number of ministers who have handled the portfolio under the Liberals -- and what that says about their importance to the government.
Not that the trend has been unique to the Liberals; all told, there have been seven veterans-affairs ministers in the past decade, not counting Sajjan. The Conservatives had three in less than two years, leading up to the last election.
That in itself creates difficulties, says Scott Maxwell, executive director of Wounded Warriors Canada, which helps former service members with mental-health injuries, because new ministers take time to find their footing.
""It just makes it difficult to get the work done,"" Maxwell said in an interview earlier this month, before Wilson-Raybould's resignation. ""That's something we've tracked as a barrier.""
Yet Wilson-Raybould was also different in that many of her predecessors were seen as up-and-comers getting promotions and looking to impress, not senior ministers getting a demotion. While she repeatedly denied that description, insisting that working for veterans was vitally important, it nonetheless stuck with some veterans.
""When you're saying you're being demoted and you're being sent to veterans affairs, it's a slap in the face for us,"" said Daniel Tremblay, an Afghan War veteran from Ottawa who is now struggling with back problems and post-traumatic stress.
""It should be a promotion, not a demotion. That way you know the individual wants to be there and cares for us.""
The Trudeau government is scrambling to contain the damage caused by Wilson-Raybould's resignation, which followed a Globe and Mail story saying the Prime Minister's Office had pressured her to intervene in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin.
Yet her resignation also makes a difficult task for the government even harder, as the Liberals already faced an uphill climb selling their Pension for Life program ahead of this year's federal election.
It's difficult to assess how veterans' concerns affect federal elections given that the community is spread across the country, but anecdotal evidence has suggested many former service members voted Liberal in 2015 -- largely because of the disability-pension promise.
That appears almost certain to change in October -- although the question is who veterans will actually support.
Bedard, who worked with the Liberals in the last election, said the Conservatives have repeatedly reached out to him and other veterans over the past year or so. And he believes many who feel betrayed by Trudeau will follow him in voting for the Tories under Andrew Scheer or, barring that, Maxime Bernier's upstart People's Party of Canada.
""It's just lip service everywhere,"" Bedard said.
""I'll do everything in my power to make sure he's out. And I know every veteran I talk to on the phone and all of my closest friends that are passionate, advocate-type veterans will do anything to get this guy out. He betrayed us.""
Yet others still remember the deep cuts to frontline work at Veterans Affairs Canada that were imposed by Stephen Harper's government and the Conservatives' refusal to reinstate the disability pension after a decade in power.
""The (veterans-affairs) file has been mismanaged for a decade or more,"" said Nova Scotia veteran David MacLeod, who was forced to leave the military in 2010 for medical reasons.
""Based on mismanagement alone, I will not be supporting any of the major political parties in the coming election. I support one of the smaller parties or a credible independent candidate.""","Wilson-Raybould resignation stokes anger, frustration within veterans community CTV News ‘Damage is done’ in Indigenous community over Wilson-Raybould’s treatment: Kinew CTV News The House: The damage done by the SNC-Lavalin scandal CBC.ca Liberals risk 'bran…",2019-02-16T14:12:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ctvnews.ca'}","Wilson-Raybould resignation stokes anger, frustration within veterans community - CTV News",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/wilson-raybould-resignation-stokes-anger-frustration-within-veterans-community-1.4300051,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4296185.1550101952!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Ctvnews.ca,damage,0
Stephen Shankland,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at Stanford's Human-Centered AI conference.
Stephen Shankland/CNET
The technology industry must realize its marvelous advancements also the source of profound anxiety and potentially disastrous societal changes, California Governor Gavin Newsom warned at a conference on AI at Stanford University in the heart of Silicon Valley.
""There is an empathy gap in technology,"" Newsom said at a conference run by the new Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. With technology comes transition and dislocation, he said, and now with AI and automation, ""There's an anxiety that is real.""
The tech industry used to be an easier ally for politicians -- companies with strong brands that were important in consumers' lives. But relations have become strained with problems like Facebook enabling election interference, YouTube helping radicalize terrorists and company employees protesting military projects. No longer is it as easy to position new technology as an unalloyed boon for society.
Newsom even mentioned the buzzword that encapsulates our newfound disenchantment: ""techlash.""
Newsom elected as governor in 2018, had moments of optimism. He lauded the Stanford institute's mission to advance AI technology in ways that help people, and boasted of his state, ""The future happens here first. We're America's coming attraction.""
But he devoted more time to tech harming large swaths of working-class people: Uber's Otto self-driving trucks putting drivers out of work, Creator (formerly Momentum Machines) making fast-food workers obsolete, Kightscopepatrol robots replacing security guards.
Uber, Creator and Knightscope didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
But complaints about disruption aren't new as technology arrives. Some people lose jobs, but typically, new technology leads to better productivity, new jobs, and economic growth, the argument goes.
Newsom is worried also about the new jobs today's technology is creating new jobs -- mostly contractor positions short on benefits and security. That amplifies the rich-poor divide, he said. That trend line is dangerous for companies that need consumers who aren't desperate to save every penny.
""I'm passionate about enlightened capitalism, but businesses cannot thrive in a world that's failing...We truly do rise and fall together,"" he said. ""We need your guidance, we need your counsel, but we need your empathy as well.""",Those who embrace disruption won't have a business if economic damage means they don't have any customers.,2019-03-19T01:19:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Tech suffers an 'empathy gap,' California governor Gavin Newsom warns - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/tech-suffers-an-empathy-gap-california-governor-gavin-newsom-warns/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/WVy4b40eGm_ujbpEURjx0MmFkfI=/724x407/2019/03/19/bf095fe6-b057-4ee2-aadf-0d85473f51f3/20190318-california-governor-gavin-newsom-01.jpg,,Cnet.com,damage,0
Reuters Editorial,"EASTERN GHOUTA, Syria (Reuters) - Hunkered near one of Syria’s hottest front lines for seven years, the eastern Ghouta district of Ein Terma sustained more damage than most areas in the conflict. 
Its markets are now full and children throng the streets where shells were falling a year ago. But for the people who have returned to live there, the recovery is gradual. 
As the eighth anniversary of the civil war arrives this week, Ein Terma’s battered streets attest to the long road ahead for Syria’s war-smashed towns and cities. 
Many inhabitants have lost neighbors, friends or relatives as the population scattered through years of conflict. Despite government work, rubble still clogs many streets and the water and electricity supply is only partial. 
Jobs are scarce, and for people who stayed in the area when it was controlled by the rebels, family paperwork for births and deaths in that period must be done anew. 
Samiha Fares and her five children left their home in 2012, early in the war, as rebels gained control over the district. 
She had been working for the Ein Terma municipal government and the rebels threatened her children and installed rockets on the roof of her house, she said. 
The family quickly moved to Jormana, a district located just across the front line from their old home in Ein Terma. When government forces recaptured the area at the end of March last year, Fares returned with her children. 
Their house was empty and scorched by fire. “My children calmed me. At least our house was still there and we could live in it,” she said. She found an old carpet and mattresses and blankets to sleep on. But the financial situation was difficult. 
President Bashar al-Assad’s forces retook eastern Ghouta during a fierce offensive under massive bombardment. 
As the rebels surrendered, people who did not want to come back under government control left to opposition-held Idlib in Syria’s far northwest. 
According to the United Nations commission of inquiry on Syria, up to 50,000 people were “evacuated” in this way to the northwest. 
The Syrian war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, has driven around half of Syria’s pre-war population from their homes, 5.7 million of them living as refugees in neighboring countries. 
HARDSHIP 
Fares’ own income went on necessities for the family. During the fighting, she pulled her oldest son out of university so he could contribute, working to help pay the rent. 
She was divorced so they had no other adult income and she renovated their war-damaged house with money paid as compensation to her daughter from a car accident. 
But the once tight-knit neighborhood has changed. “I don’t know any of the neighbors. They’re all strangers. They all came from somewhere else, from other villages,” said Fares. Their relationship is limited to superficial greetings, she said. 
However, the upstairs neighbor came back to see the house and may now renovate it and return there. “Everybody is waiting for the summer to come back,” Fares said hopefully. 
Hisham al-Zaqawi is also finding things difficult. He was a jeweler and confectioner before the war, and he stayed in Ein Terma throughout the fighting when it was under rebel control. 
He says he distrusted the opposition, but when the army retook eastern Ghouta, his two brothers chose not to come back under government control and joined the exodus to Idlib. 
During the years of siege, food became so expensive that he had to sell his business and even his own wife’s jewelry. There are more job opportunities now, he said, but he struggles for work. 
His two older children were born before or early in the crisis, but his three-year old daughter Sham must be registered with the government. The procedure is straightforward, but the fee is expensive, he said. 
“Currently I don’t have a good job. I’m sitting without one. If there was a job in renovating or anything like that I wouldn’t say no. I’d work.”

Peter Banerjea,"Running a startup or a small business is hard, and with the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) net neutrality repeal, it’s about to get a lot tougher. The repeal affects internet-based startups, companies running ecommerce stores and all businesses with any web presence -- even just a static website. On December 15, 2017, the FCC repealed its net neutrality rules of 2015, which had prohibited ISPs from blocking or throttling, or slowing down, any websites or apps, as long as the content was lawful. The 2015 rules also prevented ISPs from engaging in paid prioritization -- i.e., creating fast data transmission lanes for specific types of content -- in exchange for premium pricing from companies and consumers, and creating slow lanes for those who pay less. Related: Net Neutrality Is Quashed, at Least for Now: Will That Repeal Stall Your Startup? Paid prioritization now gives ISPs the right to create differently priced internet packages based on the type of content consumers wish to access. Only consumers on premium packages would get to access all sites at normal speeds. Those paying less would only get access to a handful of sites at normal speeds and the rest will be slow. From a business’ standpoint, paid prioritization means that ISPs can ask companies to pay in order to have their websites run at normal speeds. This might not make much difference to large corporations with deep pockets, but startups and small businesses would certainly find this challenging. Here are three major ways in which the net neutrality repeal can damage your business. 1. Decrease organic and paid traffic. Site speed plays a huge role in traffic acquisition. According to a study by Section.io, if your site takes 2 seconds to load, the average bounce rate is 9.6 percent, but at 4 seconds, the bounce rate almost doubles to 17.1 percent. Throttling or paid prioritization would slow down your website further, making most visitors leave even before it loads. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Over time, a high bounce rate will also affect your Google search rankings. Slow page speed and less time spent on page both affect SEO negatively. What if your primary source of traffic is ads? Unfortunately, paid prioritization would slow down your landing pages too. A large chunk of your advertising dollars would be wasted on visitors who click but leave after getting tired of waiting for your page to load. 2. Reduce conversions. Several studies have indicated that slower websites lead to fewer conversions, directly affecting revenue. For example, it is estimated that a page slowdown of just one second would cost Amazon $1.6 billion in sales each year. This is bad news not just for ecommerce businesses, but also for SaaS companies trying to get sign-ups on their websites. 3. Diminish performance and user experience. Blocking and slowdowns will affect all internet-based software and mobile apps. For instance, text messages were never explicitly protected by the FCC net neutrality rules. Karyn Smith, general counsel at Twilio, told me in an email, “Each year wireless carriers block over 100 million text messages consumers have opted in to receive. Carriers urge them to move to the short code system, which is 500 times more expensive. Once they pay for access to that fast lane, suddenly the messages that were being blocked go through.” Smith believes the net neutrality repeal will now allow ISPs to engage in similar activities with other applications such as SaaS tools, audio/ chat/video communication tools, Internet of Things (IoT) applications, etc. Consequently, many applications would not perform optimally, or might even get blocked. Before the net neutrality rules came into effect in 2015, there were several violations. AT&amp;T had blocked FaceTime unless customers upgraded their plans and Verizon had blocked Google Wallet to promote its own payment service. The repeal will now allow ISPs to renew these practices. Related: The FCC Repealed Net Neutrality -- Here's What That Means for You When will this take effect? The net neutrality repeal is not yet effective. The FCC’s new rules must first be published in the Federal Register -- which hasn’t happened yet -- after which it will take 60 days for it to come into effect. As Jon Brodkin from Ars Technica writes, “That means the current net neutrality rules could technically remain on the books until April 2018, although the FCC leadership won't be going out of its way to enforce them in the meantime.” When the new rules come into effect, ISPs might initially take an indirect route to target small businesses. Ryan Singel, a media and strategy fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society and founder at Contextly, told me in an email interview that ISPs will “most likely try to get access fees from intermediaries such as Level 3, Cogent, etc., that deliver traffic for thousands of other sites. These are companies that traditional webhosts contract with to connect to the larger internet and eventually to consumer broadband networks.” Singel believes they will target intermediaries because “it's simpler to try to get payment from just a few players who then have to pass the costs backwards to web hosts and then companies.” Moreover, “these kinds of negotiations are typically behind the scenes and there's too much political pressure right now for ISPs to be caught trying to shakedown individual companies.” Who is opposing it? The good news is that the FCC and ISPs are now facing intense opposition on several fronts. Twenty-two states including New York, California and Mississippi are suing the FCC over the ruling. The Internet Association -- a group of tech companies including Amazon, Facebook, Google and more -- is also planning a lawsuit. The Governors of New York, Montana and New Jersey have made executive announcements that their states will not purchase contracts from any ISP that violates net neutrality. California has introduced a bill to uphold net neutrality and Seattle is about to follow. The Senate is now shy of just one vote from overturning the FCC ruling. This legislation faces steeper obstacles in the House, and then if President Trump vetoes it, it will require a two-thirds majority in Congress. However, just the Senate vote can still be a victory because it can be interpreted by courts as the will of the people and is likely to influence judgments. And finally, there’s public opinion. Eighty-three percent of voters, including 75 percent of Republicans, are in favor of net neutrality. Related: John Oliver Once Again Hilariously Advocates for 'Net Neutrality' Rally more forces. What can you do to support state governments, politicians, tech companies and advocacy groups to restore net neutrality? Build more awareness about the issue by speaking to your local startup and small business groups. Educate your customers and social media followers on the implications of fast/slow lanes in simple terms like Burger King did in this video. Express your concerns to your local political representatives, support advocacy groups financially or join lawsuits. The FCC repeal can cause substantial damage to your business, but you have to power to act and restore internet freedom -- and protect your company as well as millions of other American small businesses.","Web traffic, conversions and operations will all be impacted.",2018-02-16T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",3 Ways the Net Neutrality Repeal Can Damage Your Business,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/308678,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180215214548-GettyImages-892269212-crop.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,damage,0
Jon Russell,"Fortnite, the world’s most popular game right now with some 200 million players, has just announced that its much anticipated Season 8 is available.
For those of you who don’t play Fortnite, the title takes on an episodic approach with new features, tools and maps released every few months. That keeps things fresh, gamers engaged and the money flowing since each new season offers a Battle Pass which costs around $10 and unlocks a load of goodies, including skins and emote dance moves.
Season 8 is pretty much what the leaks this week suggested. The theme is pirates with new skins that include a gigantic banana suit, pirates and snakes, and pirate cannon is a new weapon that’s been added. Cannons can dish out 100 damage when there’s a direct hit, or administer 50 damage of those in the impact area — it can also be used to fire players to new locations.
The map is also a major Fortnite focus, and Season 8 has added lava to the existing volcano. Stepping on lava gives layers 1 damage point per touch while there are volcanic vents that can be used to send a player or vehicle into the air using a gust of hot air.
On the gaming playing side, the major addition is ‘Party Assist’ mode which lets players bring their friends into Fortnite’s daily or weekly challenges. Those challenges are important to players since they unlock treasures, including skins, and, in fact, those who played Season 7 could earn a free Battle Pass for Season 8 by completing the right challenges. That might have saved a few million parents $10.
Those are the main additions, though game-maker Epic Games has chucked in a few little touches — including extending the somewhat comical ‘infinite dab’ feature from 11 hours to 12, meaning that your character will keep dancing a little longer when left in the lobby.
I can’t help but think Season 7 was a greater leap — since the addition of planes and ziplines really changed how players get around — but we’ll have to see how the gaming public reacts. This time around, a lot of the focus is on skins and emotes, rather than features.
A recent report suggested Fortnite’s revenue had dipped in January, but that was pretty unfair because its the month that followed a surge in spending around the December Battle Pass and also, more generally, a surge around the Christmas holidays.
Sources told us recently Epic Games banked $3 billion in profit across its entire business in 2018, thanks in particular to Fortnite, and it needs to keep its season releases compelling if that streak is to continue. There’s a lot riding on Season 8.","Fortnite, the world’s most popular game right now, has just announced that its much anticipated Season 8 is now live.

Claire Reilly,"NASA When Hawaii's Mount Kilauea volcano went into overdrive in May, the world watched as lava erupted from fissures in the Earth and steadily rolled across Hawaii's Big Island, destroying everything in its path. Turns out NASA had a pretty good view of the destruction too. The space agency released satellite imagery, taken on Wednesday, July 25, showing the massive extent of the hot lava flow from Kilauea all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The image shows a long flow of lava (pictured in yellow) snaking across the island and running from fissure 8 on the volcano down to Ahalanui Beach on the island's east. The image also shows the vegetation around the lava flow (shown in red) and clouds above the island (in white). The image was captured by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) radiometer on board NASA's Terra satellite. According to NASA, ASTER is capable of capturing images across 14 spectral bands, from visible to infrared wavelengths (the infrared channels detected the lava flow, hence the yellow colour). This isn't the first time the Terra satellite has spied out massive natural disasters like this. The school-bus-sized satellite, which orbits around Earth every 99 minutes, previously captured Kilauea's massive volcano fissures, as well as the 2017 California wildfires.",Lava everywhere!

James F. Haggerty,"Equifax. United Airlines. Uber. What do these three companies have in common? The answer may not be as obvious as you think. All three faced crises in recent months, to be sure, but so did many, many others. Long before the string of negative headlines, CEO mea culpas and congressional scoldings, what bound these companies together is that they all screwed up their initial response -- and in the process took what may have been manageable events and turned them into full-fledged PR nightmares. Our research, in fact, has shown that, in nearly every case, it is not the severity of the event itself, but rather a fumbled initial response that is the defining characteristic of any corporate crisis with staying power. For my new book Chief Crisis Officer: Structure and Leadership for Effective Public Response (ABA Publishing, 2017), we looked at hundreds of companies that confronted crises, from the physical (like an accident or plant explosion) to the virtual (like a data breach or legal matter). In every case where the event did negative reputational damage, the first few days -- sometimes weeks -- were characterized by curt, tone-deaf responses, lack of empathy or a fallback to legalistic, usually unfeeling, technicalities. Related: 10 Commandments of Successfully Managing a Business Crisis Indeed, of the major crises that have made headlines in the past decade, we couldn’t find a single event where a fumbled response didn’t play a central role in causing the event to spin out of control. Think BP, Volkswagen, or the Sony and Target data breaches. Each time, the bungled response was like pouring gasoline on a fire: it fanned the flames of public outrage, allowing the heat surrounding the event to rise to uncontrollable levels. And in this age of social media, if you are not ready to instantly respond at the speed of a Tweet or Facebook post, you’re likely to face a similar firestorm, regardless of the actual substance of the issue at hand. And, in most cases, there is another unifying element: the crisis event in question struck so closely to the central mission of the organization that they clearly should have seen it coming. Consider the recent example of Equifax. One might reasonably expect that the one potential crisis the company should have been ready for was a data breach, given that they’re in the data business. But clearly, there was little planning at Equifax regarding how to respond publicly in the face of such event. Indeed, since the company disclosed in early September that the private data of 143 million customers had been breached, a series of self-inflicted blunders have not only torched its reputation, but -- perhaps just as damningly -- exposed the shocking lack of preparedness for this worst-case scenario. Related: If a PR Crisis Happens to Your Community, Will You Know What to Do? 5 Tips. Or consider United Airlines. As the graphic video of a passenger violently dragged off United Flight 3411 was going viral, United failed to recognize the severity of what they originally referred to as an “overbook situation.” Even after CEO Oscar Munoz tweeted out an apology “for having to re-accommodate these customers,” he “emphatically commended” employees on following protocol in a companywide email. It was only days later, after it was clear that the firestorm was only growing, that United directly apologized to the victim Munoz had initially called “disruptive and belligerent.” Uber, too, faced a series of events touching the core of their operations, including passenger safety, the treatment of drivers and employees, and municipal regulations. Uber’s founder and recently ousted CEO Travis Kalanick earned his reputation as the bawdy boy wonder of Silicon Valley by running Uber like a frat house. When all those issues came to roost this year, Uber scrambled to outrun trouble. By the time the company came around to recognize the damage, the various scandals had transformed into a major reputational crisis. In each case, the companies in question chose to ignore a problem until it had evolved into a full-blown crisis. More than this, in each case it was a crisis they should have seen coming: Equifax is in the data business; United Airlines and Uber in the passenger business. Going back further, consider BP’s reaction to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. They’re in the business of drilling for oil. You mean to tell me no one in the organization ever thought about what might happen if a drilling rig caught fire and collapsed? So what is to be done? As a first step, companies should get over this notion that there are just too many potential crises out there to plan for any one effectively. I’ve heard this cliché repeated in the conference rooms of Corporate America for nearly two decades. It’s untrue. No matter its size, there are a limited number of scenarios -- be it 10, 30 or 50 -- that any company might face. There may be variations, of course, but the core universe is limited and definable. Figure out what those potential crises are and plan your reaction now. Related: 3 Steps Effective Leaders Take When Dealing With Crisis Moreover, with technology facilitating response, you can execute on any of those potential crisis scenarios at the speed of Twitter, Facebook or other modern forms of communication. Crisis plans shouldn’t be binders gathering dust on corporate shelves, nor a complicated set of protocols buried in your corporate server somewhere. Technology exists today to have an executable plan accessible for a range of scenarios from any computer, tablet or smartphone. Like a football coach who has his color-coded playbook on a laminated sheet in front of him on the sidelines, your organization’s crisis team needs to have the plan at their fingertips. The right technology can alert the team, bring them together, and give them the tools, checklists and templates to craft a response at the speed of the modern crisis. Finally, leadership. Company leadership needs to step up and put the type of planning, protocols and technology in place to ensure efficient and effective response. Just as that same football coach wouldn’t send his players onto the field and only then make up the plays, companies should take pains to ensure that tomorrow’s potential crises are part of the planning process today.","If you have a plan, you can do a whole lot of damage control.",2017-12-04T12:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",The Crisis Won't Kill Your Business If You Get the Response Right,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/304187,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171201173510-GettyImages-688024845.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,damage,0
Stan Schroeder,"Apple's iPhone XS and XS Max are finally getting into the hands of the consumers, and what's the first thing they do? They drop the phones onto concrete, of course. Well, maybe not all consumers. YouTube channel TechSmartt performed the first drop test of Apple's new iPhones on Thursday, which is especially interesting given that Apple said the iPhone XS and XS Max have ""the most durable glass in the world."" SEE ALSO: Apple heard you like iPhones so it put a tiny iPhone in your mobile browser TechSmartt dropped the new XS and XS Max — as well as last year's iPhone X — from three (loosely defined) heights: pocket height, head height, and roughly 10 feet. Obviously, this isn't the most scientific of approaches, but still interesting enough, and quite daring: Can you really expect any phone to escape a 10-foot drop onto concrete unscathed? You can see how the new iPhones fared in the video (above). Watch it before reading further if you hate spoilers. Neither phone suffered much visible damage after the pocket-height drop. When dropped from head height, the iPhone X's glass cracked, while the iPhone XS escaped with nearly no damage. The iPhone XS Max did have some ugly scratch marks, though. Finally, when dropped from 10 feet of height, the iPhone X suffered additional damage (not surprising, given it was already cracked). The iPhone XS, amazingly, again emerged with nearly no visible damage. The XS Max did not fare that well as its front glass cracked in the upper left corner. We'll likely see many similar drop tests in the future, but Apple's latest and greatest phones fared quite well in this one. Both the iPhone XS and XS Max survived pretty severe drops with minimal damage, and while this doesn't exactly prove Apple's claims about the durability of the glass used on these devices, it's a good indication that these phones are, indeed, quite tough to break. Hours after the first video, TechSmartt also posted a video that tests whether the iPhone XS and XS Max are really as waterproof as Apple claims (which is up to IP68 specifications) — or even better.

The island nation of Tonga lost its primary connection to the Internet when an undersea fiber cable was damaged Sunday, forcing Tonga to rely on a satellite dish while the country waits for a repair ship to arrive, news reports say.
The outage could last a week or more.
Reuters reported as follows:
The outage, which the cable's owner said may have been caused by a ship's anchor, also knocked out overseas phone calls and is hampering money transfers, airline bookings, university enrolments as well as Facebook connections to family and friends.
In the capital, Nuku'alofa, a satellite dish was hastily mounted on Monday to provide limited and slow backup connectivity, prompting hundreds of people to queue outside a government telecom office where the signal is most reliable.
""You just wait for your turn to have your 20 minutes to access... it's currently hot here in Tonga at the moment but they've put up a tent outside, with chairs, so people can wait,"" Tonga police spokeswoman Sia Adams said, according to Fox News.
The cable is owned by Tonga Cable Ltd., which was formed by the government of Tonga in 2009 ""to build and manage a submarine fibre optic cable to connect Tonga to an international network service.""
Tonga is an archipelago consisting of 171 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, though most are uninhabited and two-thirds of Tonga's 106,000 residents live on the island of Tongatapu. The cable is 514 miles long and links Tonga to Fiji.
""As is the case for many Pacific islands, there isn't enough population or funding for more than one cable to run from the main island, according to Christian Patouraux, chief executive of Singapore-based Internet company Kacific,"" Fox News reported.
Because capacity is dramatically limited, Tonga Cable said it may block social media websites. About 80 percent of Tonga's international Internet traffic consists of social media, Tonga Cable Ltd. Director Paula Piveni Piukala told Radio New Zealand.
""We may block Facebook, YouTube and social media, in the meantime, so that we can maximize the small bandwidth that we have from the satellite on what is important for the country,"" Piukala said.
An exact date of restoration is not available. The cable was severed in two spots, about 6.2 miles from Tonga, Piukala told Reuters for an article published Wednesday.
""We haven't really ascertained the cause, but most likely it was a boat with an anchor has dragged the cable, or something of this sort,"" Piukala said.

Jessica Boddy,"Are you always careful to apply sunscreen before a day outdoors, but find yourself getting burned anyway? It might be due to your application technique. Dermatologists say that most people don’t put on a thick enough layer sunscreen, and new research—in which scientists put varying amounts of sunscreen on volunteers’ butts—shows how those thin applications of sunscreen fail to provide the SPF listed on the bottle. Truthfully, it’s hard to really know whether you’ve applied enough sunscreen. The FDA tests SPF on humans at a thickness of 2 milligrams per square centimeter of skin—but in the real world, most people just squirt an unmeasured dollop into their hands and rub it in a thin layer over their skin. For the average face, a quarter-teaspoon of lotion is needed to get the SPF listed on a given sunscreen. Body surface area varies a lot, but the American Academy of Dermatology recommends slathering on one fluid ounce, or a shot glass’ worth, to get the listed SPF. In this new experiment, the researchers are the first to look at how thick and thin sunscreen applications result in different amounts of UV damage to DNA, according to the study published Tuesday in Acta Dermato-Venereology. They found that when applied typically, SPF 50 sunscreen offered just 40 percent of expected protection from sunburn. Thankfully, that reduced protection from both sunburn and also Sun-caused DNA damage is actually pretty adequate if a person is using a high SPF like 50, according to the paper. Which is why using a product that’s only SPF 15 isn’t a good bet. To figure this out, the researchers applied sunscreen layers of varying thicknesses to the “upper buttocks” of 16 fair-skinned people and exposed them to UV light using a specialized lamp. Some people were exposed to UV rays just once, and others were exposed repeatedly for five days to simulate the sunlight one might get on a vacation. The researchers even calibrated some of the UV ray intensity to match what one might experience in Florida, Brazil, or Tenerife. After those exposures, the researchers did tiny punch biopsies of the areas to quantify how much the UV rays had damaged the skin cells’ DNA. To do so, they used chemical analyses to count the number of thymine dimers, or mis-bonded pieces of DNA that are related to the formation of skin cancer. (The researchers chose to use the participants’ butts because its an area of the body seldom exposed to the sun, and it’s also fatty and easy to take a biopsy from.) For unprotected skin, the damage was greatest under repeated exposure, even at low UV ray intensity. But that damage was reduced considerably with even just a thin layer of sunscreen, akin to typical use (0.75 milligrams of sunscreen per square centimeter). With the thickness tested by the FDA, 2.0 milligrams per square centimeter, damage was reduced even more—but not by much. “If you use sunscreen suboptimally, applying it at 40 percent of the thickness it’s tested at, you’re still getting a very good level of protection from DNA damage,” Antony Young, a dermatologist at King’s College London and study author, told Gizmodo. But the researchers only tested broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50. Forty percent of SPF 50 would translate to SPF 20—that hovers just above the FDA minimum suggestion of broad spectrum SPF 15. Most dermatologists will suggest at least an SPF 30, especially for fair-skinned people. But with a typical slather of SPF 30, you’d be getting the protection an SPF 12 sunscreen. And, more alarmingly, SPF 15 sunscreen would only offer around SPF 6. These numbers are all estimates based on protection from SPF 50 sunscreen in this study, of course, and will most definitely vary in practice. For context, when applied correctly, a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 blocks 93 percent of UVB rays (the UV rays that cause skin burning), according to the American Cancer Society. SPF 30 blocks 97 percent, SPF 50 blocks 98, and SPF 100 blocks 99 percent. The thought that we aren’t getting as much sun protection as we think we are is a very concerning one. The American Cancer Society estimates that 91,270 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States this year, and that over 9,000 of them are expected to be fatal. Rates of melanoma have also been on the rise in the last three decades. Plus, Young said our misapplication of broad-spectrum sunscreen is also putting us at risk for premature aging. That’s because we’re probably blocking fewer UVA rays than we think, which contribute to the breakdown of collagen. Down the line, that can cause saggy skin, wrinkles, and spots. To avoid these things, Young has a few tips. The first is to apply sunscreen twice. Do the first layer, wait 10 or 15 minutes, and then do another thorough layer just like the first—using this strategy might help more people reach the right thickness of application, he said. Secondly, Young urges people to purchase sunscreen products with a higher SPF, like 50, to combat the protection being lost from thin application. And of course, you’ve got to reapply sunscreen every two hours, or after swimming or toweling off. But no sunscreen can fully protect you from DNA damage from the sun, which is why dermatologists recommend you also seek shade and wear protective clothing, including a hat. “Even with sunscreen, we see some genetic changes,” Steven Feldman, a dermatologist at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was not involved with the recent study, told Gizmodo. “Wearing a big floppy hat or a protective shirt might not be such a bad thing, either.” [ Acta Dermato-Venereology ]","Are you always careful to apply sunscreen before a day outdoors, but find yourself getting burned anyway?

"T'Jae Ellis, Army Research Lab Public Affairs","The damage-sensing network is integrated into a conceptual composite UH-60M Black Hawk rotorcraft. (Photo Credit: US Army photo ) ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. — For the first time ever, a team of researchers successfully developed and tested networked acoustic emission sensors that can detect airframe damage on conceptual composite UH-60 Black Hawk rotorcraft. Researchers with the US Army Research Laboratory and the US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center said their discovery opens up possibilities for new onboard features that could immediately alert the flight crew to the state of structural damage like matrix cracking and delamination as they occur, giving the crew greater opportunity to take corrective actions before catastrophic failure. ARL has been studying several possible alternatives to rotorcraft airframe health monitoring. This effort, which began almost two years ago, makes a strong case for integrated real-time damage sensing methodologies on future airframe structures. The sensing method can be used to reliably detect and locate the initiation and growth of damage that may occur during service. ""Future Army airframe structures are required to be lighter, safer and ultra-reliable,"" said Dr. Mulugeta Haile, research aerospace engineer. ""To achieve these the Army must adopt a combined strategy of implementing advanced structural design methods, improved structural materials and integrated damage sensing and risk prediction capabilities."" The approximate cut-out location of the test article and location of group sensors. Sensor groups 1 and 2 are shown. Groups 3 and 4 are on the opposite side. (Photo Credit: US Army illustration) He said the team turned to acoustic emission tests because other methods such as ultrasonic and radiography require an external energy source in the form of a directed wave. ""The external energy has the undesirable effect of interfering with other systems of the aircraft. In addition, other methods are not as good as AE in detecting early damage,"" he said. Acoustic emission sensing is a passive non-destructive technique for detection of damage in the very early stage, and long before the structure experiences catastrophic failure. Unlike other methods, Acoustic emission detects damage in real-time (or at the instant the damage is happening). The fact that AE is passive means that it does not require an external energy to detect damage. It relies on the energy that is initiated within the structure, Haile explained. ""The novelty of the current work is that we introduced several new concepts on wave acquisition control and signal processing to recover damage related information in networked acoustic emission sensors,"" Haile said. ""The Eureka moment was when the sensing network consistently identified and located the initiation and progression of damage during a prolonged fatigue test that lasted over 200,000 cycles — a feat that has never been achieved before."" The ARL sensing network is composed of several lightweight transducers encapsulated in 3-D printed non-intrusive sensor mounts. Sensors of the network are optimally distributed in multiple zones to maximize coverage as well as probability of damage detection. The data acquisition process is embedded with a software controllable timing parameter to reject reflections of a direct wave, as well as waves coming from non-damage related events. Meanwhile, the signal processing algorithm is augmented with a layer of adaptive digital filters to minimize effects of signal distortion during location analysis. REUTERS/Denis Sinyakov Dr. Jaret Riddick, director of the Vehicle Technology Directorate, along with Haile, Nathaniel Bordick and other ARL partners, collaborated to elucidate detailed mechanisms for full-scale damage detection in complex rotorcraft structures using the distributed sensor architecture. Key to the technique is the development of signal distortion control parameters, acquisition timing control, and 3-D printed sensor capsules. ""The downtime due to routine inspection and maintenance represent the major fraction of the life cycle cost of Army platforms, because we are not using the platform and we have to pay for inspection, which in most cases reveals no damage. So the idea is to integrate a reliable damage sensing network and perform maintenance only when necessary,"" Riddick said. Currently, the Army sustains its fleet using phase maintenance paradigm, which is a periodic calendar-based practice that requires inspection and maintenance at fixed time intervals. Flickr/The National Guard The process is highly inefficient, costly and entails extended downtime. The newly developed sensing network will enable condition-based maintenance or maintenance on demand. It has the potential to drastically cut the life cycle cost of Army vehicles. The work also supports the Army's long term vision of maintenance-free aircrafts. ""Large-scale AE monitoring is a data-intensive process with several million hits being received by each transducer per flight,"" Halle said. ""This puts a higher load on the internal bus and circuitry of any data acquisition hardware. In general, most hits are not related to damage. Rather, they are noises from moving parts such as the clicking or rubbing noises of fasteners, panel connections, and vibrations from other non-damage related sources. Unwanted AE hits also arise due to reflections of an already received and processed AE wave. The challenge is to develop a system which is sensitive only to damage related hits and insensitive to all other hits."" ""Most of the available AE-based structural health monitoring is for simple plate-like structures, despite most airframe structures not being simple plates,"" Bordick said. ""Not much has been done on integrated full-scale airframe health monitoring using AE. The problem is quite complex. I'm glad that we were able to successfully develop and demonstrate the sensing network.""","(Photo Credit: US Army photo ) ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. — For the first time ever, a team of researchers successfully developed and tested networked acoustic emission sensors that can detect airframe damage on conceptual composite UH-60 Black Hawk rotorcr…",2017-11-21T15:35:25Z,"{'id': 'business-insider', 'name': 'Business Insider'}","For the first time, Army sensors can detect aircraft damage as it occurs",http://www.businessinsider.com/army-sensors-can-detect-aircraft-damage-as-it-occurs-2017-11,http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5a1445cff914c35b018b5412-1190-625/for-the-first-time-army-sensors-can-detect-aircraft-damage-as-it-occurs.jpg,business-insider,Business Insider,damage,0
"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Coin cell or “button” batteries are small, shiny, and feel tingly on the tongue. If you’re a toddler, that puts them into the category of “belongs in my mouth.” But a swallowed button battery can begin burning a hole through a kid’s esophagus in hours, causing pain, severe injury, and sometimes complications leading to death. A new study hints—but does not prove—that one way to limit the damage is to give the child honey as you rush them to the hospital. Researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia put CR2032 batteries onto samples of esophagus tissue in the lab, and into the esophagus of live, anesthetized piglets. (CR2032 batteries, responsible for 90 percent of these injuries, are the size and shape of a quarter—big enough that they tend to get lodged in the esophagus.) In both sets of experiments, honey was able to limit the damage caused by the battery. The researchers tested other substances too, including maple syrup, juice, and a medication called Carafate, but honey did the best job. Based on their results, the researchers say parents should give honey to a child who has swallowed a battery. It’s still important to get the battery out of the kid’s body as soon as possible, so your top priority should be rushing to the hospital. This means the best case scenario may be to speed there with your child sucking on one of those honey bear bottles in the back seat. But this is experimental and we don’t know if it will actually work. Anesthetized piglets are not the same as alert, active toddlers. “History is littered with examples of medical interventions that were promising in animal studies but didn’t pan out in humans,” says pediatrician Clay Jones. “I worry that jumping from porcine data to recommendations for action in human ingestions is premature and I would like to see better data. But I would certainly understand if a parent gave their child honey while seeking out appropriate medical care, as long as they are over a year of age.” Honey isn’t recommended for infants under a year old, because there is a small risk of a baby contracting infant botulism. (By a year old, we usually have a good enough population of gut bacteria that Clostridium botulinum can’t grow in the intestines.) In an emergency, perhaps the risk of botulism would be outweighed by the benefits of the honey treatment—but we don’t know yet, because we don’t know yet if the honey is truly beneficial. For example, is a child going to be able to suck down enough honey to make a difference? Will the honey interfere with efforts to remove the battery? And if the child needs to be anesthetized to remove the battery, isn’t it dangerous to have a stomach full of honey? Anesthetized piglets are not the same as alert, active toddlers. “My expectation is that, in real people with real ingestions, the benefit will be minimal or vanish completely,” says emergency physician Stuart Spitalnic. But it’s not like anybody is going to do a trial giving children batteries and testing what happens. Both doctors agree that honey is probably not super dangerous in a button battery emergency, but if you try it, you should realize that it’s experimental, and that it’s not a reason to delay treatment. “There is always a hidden downside... useless or minimally useful treatments that waste time have the danger inherent in delay and the further danger of false reassurance that treatment has begun resulting in more delay,” Spitalnic says. The bottom line: he’d grab honey on the way out the door if he had some at home, but wouldn’t waste time stopping by the store. I would probably do the same.","Coin cell or “button” batteries are small, shiny, and feel tingly on the tongue.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Jack Stewart,"More than a million people have been told to leave their homes, get away from the coast and low lying areas, and get to safety, as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas and Virginia. But a new group of temporary, risk-taking, residents is getting ready to ride out the storm. Drone pilots are watching forecasts, and staging in areas where they’ll be safe, but useful, ready to rush into action as soon as possible, as a now vital part of the disaster response. “When we’re pre-deployed, we have our rations—it’s an ongoing joke of beef jerky and pretzels,” says Hadley Doyle-González, who runs SMG Drones, in Palm Beach, Florida. “We have a ridiculous amount of batteries,” she says. “We need to be able to fly for 24 hours with no power.” During Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida this time last year, she was deployed to Naples, and holed up in a hotel. She made sure all her equipment was in waterproof cases and moved her car to higher ground. When the winds died down, she headed out to capture high resolution images of houses, buildings, or utilities, which can show damage early, and get help and repairs, as well as insurance money, to where it's needed. “You’re charging every battery you have to the nth degree,” says Craig Besse, flight ops manager for Airbus Aerial, who was also deployed in Irma's aftermath. You need 20 to 30 gallons of water per person, and to make sure your truck is loaded with food, water, and fuel. “Get that last shower in,” he says, before supplies are cut off. Then, it’s about being flexible. “It’s not going to go the way you expected.” LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones As Hurricane Florence continues its unstoppable march toward the Atlantic coast, both Besse and Doyle-González are managing teams of drone pilots and going through those same final preparations. They are just a few of the expected thousands of drones and pilots getting ready to fly over the damage left by the storm. When Florence hits the coast, it will bring torrential downpours, wind blasts, coastal erosion, and the possibility of a storm surge of seawater causing flooding. The National Hurricane Center has predicted ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall."" Accuweather is warning that the angle at which the storm will impact the coast—nearly perpendicular—means the winds on the east side will be particularly effective at driving waves, and that surge, onto shore. It’s predicting $60 billion in economic impact and damage. Air travel, of course, will be disrupted. The FAA says to expect flight cancellations and airport closures. Air traffic controllers will evacuate tall towers in extreme winds, but stay on duty on a lower, secure level. Airport workers will disable airport surveillance radar antennas so they spin freely, to save them from wind damage, and get up and running as quickly as possible once the threat has passed. The assembled drone pilots, though, won't wait for commercial aviation to restart before they take off. Insurance companies are the biggest clients for their services, so they can figure out where to send resources, and in some cases, to settle claims within hours. Utility companies employ drone pilots to spot downed power lines. Infrastructure engineers can see flooded roads. And they can do it all long before it's possible or safe to reach these areas on the ground. At the Airbus Aerial headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, Jesse Kallman, president of the imaging company, has taken over a conference room, with a team of 10. Together they’re putting well prepared plans into action, to combine data from Airbus’ satellites, fixed wing aircraft, and drones. Insurance companies are sending over databases of where their policy holders are concentrated. Utilities are spelling out where they have vulnerable infrastructure like long power lines. The company is also pulling together pre-event data: ""before” pictures to contrast with the “after.” Getting those “after” images is the challenge. No aircraft can fly in the storm itself, and even when it passes, they have to get into place to start work. “We work with the satellite team to try to understand the optimal times to acquire data, and work through all the types of data needed,” says Kallman. A detailed understanding of the path of the storm can give them a head start. “Once the weather clears, we want to be prepared to get planes and drones up in the air,” says Jonathan Gadd, who manages drone and planes at EagleView, another imaging company, for which Doyle-González is subcontracting. It’s not just quadcopters that can be useful. Small, manned planes can also cover more distance, but at a greater cost. EagleView is working to stage 15 fixed-wing aircraft in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida. Planes are not only useful for supplementing drones for image capture, particularly on long runs, but they’re also crucial for transport. EagleView’s pilots can act as couriers, flying into affected areas, collecting hard drives of video and image data, and flying them to HQ in Rochester, New York. Drone operators train for this type of work, and know enough to stay out of the way of first responders. The FAA is appealing to amateurs to do the same. Professional drone pilots can apply for emergency certificates of operation from the sky safety regulator if they need to work in areas that have been blanketed with temporary flight restrictions. Combining this bird's eye view with some clever computing lets insurance agencies move faster than ever before, like Allstate did after Hurricane Irma. “We had a customer in Orlando, and we called him, and said we believe your roof has damage,” says spokesperson Justin Herndon. “That was before he filed a claim.” The man had money in his bank account within five hours. Well after the storm has gone, drones can help with the heavy lifting. In hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico last year, utilities used drones to restring downed power lines in hard to access areas. But now, America's drone pilots are lying in wait for Florence's rage. “This one’s supposed to linger—it’s going to be a lot slower of a go time than what we’re used to,” says Doyle-González. Teams will have to spend more like 48 hours surviving on their jerky and pretzels, sitting and waiting, sleeping while they can. Then they’ll be ready to start work—even if it means a few days before their next shower.

(Photo: Register file photo) Buy Photo DYERSVILLE, Ia. — A vandal has caused thousands of dollars in damage to the Field of Dreams by driving a vehicle onto the site made famous by the 1989 movie, according to the Dubuque Telegraph Herald. Workers at the site outside Dyersville found the damage Tuesday morning and were still assessing the costs and needed repairs, according to the Telegraph Herald. Owner Denise Stillman says a vehicle made deep gashes in the outfield and damaged a sprinkler system. The damage was especially severe because the ground was soft following warm weather and rain. Images of the vandalism by the Field of Dreams movie site shows track marks across the diamond. Stillman says repairs will continue through the summer but the field will remain open. Thousands visit the eastern Iowa field at no charge, running around the bases and walking to the surrounding cornfields. There are also plans to install a security system to protect the field, according to a GoFundMe site that was made to fund the repairs.

Alexandra Ulmer,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Venezuela’s eastern coast, home to largely poor fishing communities, on Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings as far away as Colombian capital Bogota and knocking power out in parts of Trinidad. But the quake’s depth - 76.5 miles (123 km) below the surface - appeared to have mitigated the damage. Venezuelan officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries and two sources at state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] told Reuters the OPEC member’s refineries and oil fields were operating normally. PDVSA did not immediately comment. Venezuela is not in a good shape to deal with a natural disaster. It is already wrestling with a crippling economic crisis with medicine running short, hospitals barely able to function and some severe shortages of basics such as chicken and milk. The tremor - one of the country’s strongest ever - hit at 5.31 p.m. (2131 GMT). Along Venezuela’s picturesque palm tree-dotted northern coast, residents said the long quake was terrifying and frightened people into dashing into the streets. “I had gotten into bed to watch the news on TV and my bed started to move as if it was made of water,” said Elia Sanchez, a doctor in Cumana, the capital of the eastern state of Sucre that was the closest to the coastal epicenter. “We had to go down nine floors, it felt like it would never end.” Rosymer Rodriguez, also in Cumana, said she could not see any significant damage but that people were still fearful. “There are still people in the street. There are people packing bags in case there are aftershocks,” said Rodriguez. Damage in Caracas was limited, but the quake did tilt the top five floors of an abandoned 45-story skyscraper known as the ‘Tower of David’, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. The tower, originally intended to be a bank center but abandoned since 1994 and later occupied by squatters for years, dominates Caracas’ skyline. It features in the U.S. television spy drama “Homeland”. Pictures after the quake showed the building’s top floors, which are unfinished, leaning sideways. Out east, the governor of Sucre called for calm. “Do not fall victim to psychological terror, messages about a tsunami and all that,” said governor Edwin Rojas, who belongs to President Nicolas Maduro’s Socialist Party. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for additional information. ANDES, CARIBBEAN HIT The quake was felt in capital Caracas, neighboring Colombia and nearby island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia, to the west and north. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were initial reports of some cracks to buildings, cars damaged when concrete debris fell on them, and loss of electricity. Traffic jams formed on highways in Port of Spain, but there were no immediate reports of casualties there either. Colombia’s government said the country was unharmed too, although workers dashed out of high-rise blocks in the mountainous capital Bogota. “It was a moment of panic, we thought the worst,” said Jimena Valencia, a 29-year-old administrator in the north of Bogota. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Center canceled an earlier warning of a possible tsunami along the coast near the epicenter, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Cumana. United States Geological Survey geophysicist Jessica Turner said the quake’s depth would have dampened some of the shaking. “A 7.3 magnitude quake is going to cause some damage, particularly as in this area, structures are vulnerable. The Earth is able to absorb some of the energy, but a 7.3 quake produces a lot of energy,” she said by telephone.

Nick Douglas,"As Facebook finally starts to shrink, it’s become pretty normal not to use it that often. If you only check it once or twice a week, you might find out that your mom tagged you in an embarrassing photo or political meme five days ago and all your friends have been piling on. Here’s an idea: Temporarily deactivate Facebook. It’s really easy— here are Facebook’s instructions —and you won’t lose any of your data. Eight years ago, this was called a “super-logoff,” and some teens and adults did it to maintain control over their profiles whenever they weren’t actively online. Deactivating your Facebook account doesn’t delete it, it just hides it from everyone until you re-activate. If you’re really checked out of Facebook, but you don’t want to lose your account, you could just deactivate for weeks at a time, like during a job search. (Because your potential employer is definitely Facebook-stalking you.) There’s a big downside: While you’re deactivated, you’re completely invisible. No one can message you, and no one can invite you to events. If that triggers your FOMO, you’re better off just editing all your privacy settings to contain the damage.","As Facebook finally starts to shrink, it’s become pretty normal not to use it that often.

Jason Parker,"The new Wild West mode announced earlier this week won't help you much with these challenges, but it's still a lot of fun. Epic Games It's Thanksgiving week here in the States, which means a lot of people will have more time to play Fortnite: Battle Royale. It also means it's a great time to grind through Battle Pass challenges while the population in the game might be higher than usual. This week's set of challenges will be a test of your grenade throwing abilities especially if you ponied up for the Battle Pass this season. All four of the paid challenges this week have to do with explosive damage whether it's a rocket launcher, grenade launcher, dynamite or grenades. If you haven't finished last week's challenges, here's our guide. As always, these leaked challenges are subject to change at the time they officially go live early Thursday, so check back later Thursday morning for any changes by Epic Games. Without further ado, here are this week's leaked challenges: Free Pass Challenges Get 30 seconds of airtime in a vehicle (0/30) Get a score of 10 or more on different carnival clown boards (0/3) Stage 1: Consume mushrooms (0/5) - Hard Battle Pass Challenges Deal damage to players with a clinger, stink bomb or grenade (0/300) Deal damage to opponent structures with dynamite (0/10,000) Rocket or grenade launcher eliminations (0/3) - Hard Stage 1: Deal damage with grenades to opponents (0/100) - Hard How to get 30 seconds of airtime in a vehicle There's a couple of ways to approach this challenge. You can do it by making sure to take jumps in all your vehicles over the course of the week or you can take it out in as little time as possible. I suggest playing a group game mode like Food Fight, grabbing your vehicle of choice, then head to any of the corrupted areas. Those purple volcanoes will launch you and your vehicle high in the air and it shouldn't take too long to get 30 seconds of airtime. How to get a score of 10 or more on different carnival clown boards This is a fun change from other challenges, but it won't necessarily be easy. When you start a game, balloons will inflate in different holes on the board and you need to pop them quickly then move on to the next in an effort to get 10 in a row. You'll have to do this at three separate locations to complete the challenge. What might make it especially difficult is that other players can just pick you off while you stand there. I would suggest playing Food Fight or another 50 vs. 50 mode so you have some safety while you play. Here's where all the carnival clown board locations are on the map: You'll need to score 10 or more at three of the four locations to complete the challenge. Jason Parker/CNET How to do stage 1: Consume mushrooms This challenge is a little easier than last week's similar challenge of eating apples, because you could only eat apples when you are already hurt. For this one, it doesn't really matter which game mode you play as long as you can find mushrooms. I like the area around the house east and just south of Pleasant Park (it's where one of the dance floors often pops up). There are often tons of mushrooms around that area, but your mileage may vary. How to deal damage to players with a clinger, stink bomb or grenade I'm not great with grenades, but I think I have a pretty good solution for this challenge. Your best bet here is to play Food Fight or any other group game, then -- as the fighting gets intense at the end -- make sure to switch to whatever grenade weapon you have available and start letting them rain down. Fortunately, 300 is not that high of a number, so it shouldn't take too long to complete the challenge. How to deal damage to opponent structures with dynamite The hardest part of this challenge will probably be finding the dynamite to begin with, but once you have it, it should be pretty quick. This challenge looks like it was made for Food Fight mode, because it's the perfect way to tear down the enemies base to get at that mascot. After a few games, it should be easy to get 10,000 points of damage. How to get rocket or grenade launcher eliminations Like all of these, you'll need to find the weapons first, but you'll want to play a big group game mode once again to be the most effective. When a bunch of people on the other team are clustered together around a structure, let lose with the heavy artillery. If you're lucky, with only three to complete the challenge, you could possibly do this in one shot. How to do stage 1: Deal damage with grenades to opponents The first stage of this quest will also help you with the dealing damage with grenade weapons challenge above so it's working double duty. I still like group modes for these quests because it likely means more opponents in a concentrated area. From there, follow the directions for stage two.",Explosive damage seems to be the theme in this week's challenges as you power through more tiers of your Battle Pass.,2018-11-22T09:00:48Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Fortnite season 6, week 9 challenges and how to complete them - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/fortnite-season-6-week-9-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/,https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/90Rvu5eEr9PpgI_42UUV_ngVYyQ=/724x407/2018/11/21/69847118-93ca-41e3-9878-ea0ef9b71d8e/fortnite-clownboard.jpg,,Cnet.com,damage,0
"A.A. Newton on Vitals, shared by A.A. Newton to Lifehacker","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does. As it turns out, a face full of painful lesions—not to mention unsolicited, tone-deaf advice from family and strangers alike—has a way of driving people into hiding. Throw in a whole internet’s worth of unverified anecdotes about banishing acne for good and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Zits are unfair. We didn’t ask for them, we certainly don’t deserve to have them into adulthood,… Read more Read Treating acne is maddening. Even if your breakouts are under control, you may be left with dark spots, red spots, dents, and/or bumps—the ghosts of hell-zits past. Today’s super-saturated skincare market offers thousands of products that claim to fade acne scars, but frankly, very few of them work. Before you drench your face in retinol and acids to fade your acne scars, you should figure out what caused them in the first place—and if they’re even scars at all. What The Heck Are Acne Scars, Anyway? Scar tissue forms when an injury or illness damages your skin’s ability to produce collagen, the protein that gives skin its structure. As Dr. Meghan Feely, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York and New Jersey, explained to me in an email, the same process causes acne scars. Inflammation—redness, pain, and/or swelling—from deep-rooted zits can injure surrounding skin cells, altering the collagen they produce to repair injured skin. Depending on the amount of collagen the damaged cells produce, she explained, patients are left with either atrophic or hypertrophic scars. Atrophic scars happen when acne-damaged skin cells don’t produce enough collagen to refill the injured area, leaving indentations in the skin. Any dimpled, dented texture you notice after a breakout heals is caused by atrophic scarring. Typically, these scars present in one of three patterns: ice-pick (deep and narrow, like pinholes), boxcar (wide and squared-off), and rolling (wide and rounded). The shape and size of atrophic scars depends on the extent of the tissue damage, as well as how your skin typically heals from injury. When acne-damaged skin cells overproduce collagen, they leave hypertrophic scars, which are raised and often shiny. Hypertrophic scars occur more frequently in severe wounds that don’t close early on in the healing process: a surgical incision is less likely to leave a raised scar than, say, a massive cyst that repeatedly gets its head scratched off. However, whether or not you get hypertrophic scars mostly comes down to genetics. If your family members tend to develop raised, bumpy scars, you probably will, too. Generally, only very severe acne leaves scars. Age and family history influence their development to some extent, but according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Diane Madfes, the biggest scarring predictors are the acne’s depth and duration. The deeper the zits, and the longer they go untreated, the more likely they are to cause permanent damage—which acne scars are, unfortunately. If you’re not sure what you’re dealing with, gently run your fingers over the spots in question. If they’re indented or raised, you have acne scars; if they’re smooth, but discolored, you have something else. If My Dark Spots Aren’t Acne Scars, What Are They? Not all breakouts leave scars. Mild lesions may not go deep enough to damage collagen-producing cells, and some deep-rooted zits don’t stick around long enough to cause permanent structural damage. However, inflammation from a breakout can piss off cells closer to the surface of your skin, causing them to function abnormally for awhile. This process is what causes some zits to leave dark or red spots when they heal. The color of a post-acne mark depends on which cells were damaged. Dark spots are caused by damaged melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment that gives our skin its color. These spots are usually brown, but can be purplish or bluish depending on your skin tone. This type of discoloration is called hyperpigmentation. Some breakouts leave red spots when they heal, which is a sign of damaged or irritated surface-level capillaries. Your body’s first response to illness or injury is usually to increase blood flow to the affected area, causing temporary redness and swelling known as erythema. Erythema usually dissipates once a wound has healed, but sometimes capillaries around the healing site are too damaged to immediately return to their normal, pre-injury state. Both of these conditions are caused by inflammation and persist after it clears, so their full names are post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or erythema—PIH or PIE for short. The superficial cell damage behind PIH and PIE is temporary, though the marks can take months or years to fade. If your post-acne marks aren’t clearly brown or red, you can figure out if they’re PIE or PIH by pushing on them gently with a fingertip. PIE temporarily disappears when pressed because doing so cuts off blood flow to the affected capillaries. Unlike blood, melanin is static, so PIH marks will look the same regardless of how much you poke at them. What Can I Do To Prevent Scarring And Pigmentation? The likelihood of developing scars, PIH, and/or PIE is mostly down to genetics, but as Dr. Madfes explains, inflicting additional trauma on already inflamed skin makes things worse: “Some people tend to pick at the acne scar, or the acne bump, because they feel a raised surface. [...] Light trauma should not cause marks, but if someone’s going to pick, try and get out the pus, or manipulate the area, [they’re] going to increase the incidence of scarring and hyperpigmentation.” Anything you can do to encourage proper healing, on the other hand, is good. Besides resisting the urge to squeeze, Dr. Madfes recommends keeping open lesions “moist and covered” until they heal—she specifically says Vaseline is a great wound protectant—and using a moisturizer with ceramides. However, she emphasizes that the best way to prevent picking—and, by extension, PIH/PIE or scars—is to resolve the acne that causes it in the first place. How Do I Get Rid of Them? Mild PIH and PIE—with no accompanying active acne—will resolve with on their own within a year. If that’s too long to wait, sunscreen is the surest way to speed up the fading process. When your skin darkens from sun exposure, your PIH does too; wearing a broad-spectrum, high-SPF formula every day protects your skin from further damage and helps it heal properly. Sunscreen is a wonder of technology. It’s the closest thing we have to an anti-aging miracle, and… Read more Read However, most people who seek treatment for PIH/PIE and scarring also have active acne—and every specialist I spoke to for this story agrees that resolving chronic acne is the first step to treating post-inflammatory marks. Mild acne can be effectively treated with over-the-counter products; Dr. Madfes recommends starting with a product containing micronized benzoyl peroxide like the Acne.org treatment or this cleanser from Differin. Non-micronized particles are too big to penetrate pores, and their irregular size and shape makes them prone to clumping together—which renders the medication less effective and more irritating. The retinoid adapalene —now available over the counter as Differin —effectively treats acne and PIH, as do ingredients like niacinamide and azelaic acid, although to a lesser extent. (I use and love Melazepam, which is a 20% azelaic acid cream.) Whichever treatment you choose, be patient: topical medications take at least three months to show results. Where’s a dermatologist when you need one? A recent investigation by Women’s Health details a… Read more Read Moderate to severe acne benefits from professional intervention, and the earlier, the better. If your insurance covers it, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. If you’re uninsured or have shitty insurance, find a skilled esthetician—a licensed professional who specializes in skincare techniques. Esthetician licensing requirements vary by state, and their individual areas of expertise range from waxing to laser resurfacing, so really do your research: check out their website, do a critical scan of Yelp reviews, and/or get recommendations from friends and family. (This also applies to dermatologists, by the way.) When you request an appointment, specifically ask to see an acne specialist. If there’s a long wait, put your name on the cancellation list and check in every few weeks. At your appointment, give the dermatologist or esthetician a detailed history of your acne—including medications you’ve tried in the past, any you take now, and your tendency to develop PIH, PIE, or scars—so they can decide how best to treat you. Both dermatologists and estheticians aim to resolve acne before treating pigmentation or scarring, but many medications and procedures do both at once. Topical retinoids (tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene) are proven multitaskers, and dermatologists frequently prescribe them to treat acne and hyperpigmentation. (Insurance companies notoriously skimp on topical prescription coverage, so if your tube of tretinoin costs two hundred dollars— not an exaggeration —look for manufacturer coupons and discount pharmacies to lower the price.) For patients with active acne and pigmentation to address, estheticians favor chemical peels. Licensed esthetician and acne specialist Mary Freihofner told me that she uses glycolic, mandelic, and salicylic acid peels for her acne clients with hyperpigmentation—but once the lesions have healed, she thinks microdermabrasion works faster. Erythema may not respond to hyperpigmentation treatments, and in those cases, Freihofner finds Vitamin C peels to be quite effective. A professional facial with a peel usually costs between eighty and two hundred dollars, depending on your location and the specific treatments you choose. If Acne Scars Are Permanent, What Can I Do About the Ones I Have? There are effective ways to treat acne scars, but they don’t come cheap. Since scarring is caused by damaged tissue in the dermis—the middle layer of skin—treating it requires some level of penetration. Many dermatologists, including Dr. Feely and Dr. Madfes, treat acne scarring by way of dermal resurfacing techniques, most of which involve lasers. Certain types of lasers can penetrate the epidermis—the outermost layer of skin—to stimulate collagen-producing cells in the dermis, reducing the appearance of scars over time. Lasers are less invasive than traditional surgical techniques, but all dermal penetration has risks: you don’t want to damage any nerves or blood vessels while you’re poking around down there. This is why laser resurfacing is performed only by specially trained, licensed professionals—and why it’s often expensive. One laser resurfacing session can cost anywhere from a hundred bucks to well over a thousand, depending on how much time under the laser you need. These procedures are elective and not technically medically necessary, so insurance won’t cover them; always get a quote before scheduling a session. You don’t necessarily have to see a dermatologist for laser therapy, though; many skincare clinics offer the same services. Raelle Levicke, a licensed esthetician and laser technician at About Face Skincare in Philadelphia, swears by fractionated lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments. She explained that surface-level treatments—chemical peels, microneedling, and microdermabrasion—are somewhat effective at fading hyperpigmentation, but they literally don’t go deep enough to treat scar tissue. Fractionated lasers are her weapon of choice for acne scars and severe hyperpigmentation, but she prefers IPL treatments for treating erythema. Depending on the case, her patients see results after two to four sessions. I know from experience how horrible it is to feel like you’re doomed to cycle between painful breakouts and scars forever, so if there’s one point I want to really hammer home, it’s this: find a licensed professional who specializes in acne treatment. A dermatologist who’s normally up to their eyeballs in melanomas—or an esthetician who mostly gives relaxing facials—will probably treat you differently than someone with years of experience treating acne. There’s someone out there who can help you—don’t give up until you find them.","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does.
