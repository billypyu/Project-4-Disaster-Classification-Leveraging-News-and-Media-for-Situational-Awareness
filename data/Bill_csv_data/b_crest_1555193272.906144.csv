NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"Six years ago my daughter and I set off on a hike. She was 14 when we took our first 200-mile backpacking trip on the Pacific Crest Trail, the great ribbon running through mountains and deserts from Mexico to Canada. It was just the two of us and a few million mosquitoes. One great thing about hiking with my daughter is that mosquitoes love to dine on her, thus neglecting me. On that trip, even DEET repellent and a head net couldn’t fend them off: “Dad! I just counted! I have 49 mosquito bites on my forehead alone!” She was an old hand at outdoor masochism, for we had been going on family backpacking trips since before she turned 2. First, she and I resolved to complete the Pacific Crest Trail in my home state, Oregon. Then we decided to spend a few years hiking across Washington State. After that, how could we not complete California as well?",My daughter and I finished hiking one of “our” properties: the Pacific Crest Trail.,2018-08-31T16:47:39Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Six Years, Four Feet, 2,650 Miles",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/opinion/pacific-crest-trail.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/sunday-review/02Kristof-slide-TCS8/02Kristof-slide-TCS8-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Our limited human eyesight can really constrain our understanding of the universe. We can see only a thin swath of light’s wavelengths, those waves with peaks 390 to 700 nanometers from crest to crest. This means we miss any light-emitting details coming from other wavelengths, such as from radio and microwave light, as well as infrared, ultraviolet, and x-ray. Scientists have released new views of Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, taken by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument on the decommissioned Cassini spacecraft. They represent lots of data that has been combined and smoothed out, and they show a clear view of what the moon looks like under its dense atmosphere. The center, yellow image shows how Titan would look to human eyes. Around it are the six new infrared representations, rendered in colors that human eyes can see. Each color (red, green, and blue) represents a ratio of the brightness of two different infrared wavelengths. This method is meant to highlight the materials that comprise the moon’s features while reducing image artifacts from combining the raw files. More about that here. The VIMS instrument records the infrared wavelengths of light that aren’t scattered by Titan’s particle-filled atmosphere the way visible light wavelengths are. It’s sort of like putting on a pair of red-filmed glasses to decode a secret message. But decoding this message required many observations from Cassini stitched together, according to a NASA release. And Titan looked different each time Cassini passed over, with different levels of sunlight or changes to the planet’s atmosphere over time, requiring extra effort to make these seamless views. The images show the complex surface of Titan hiding beneath its atmosphere. We already know this moon is a strange place—it’s 50 percent larger than Earth’s moon, and has liquid hydrocarbon oceans at its surface with rivers, lakes, and even methane rainstorms. Some have even speculated that the carbon and nitrogen in the moon’s atmosphere might be the building blocks for a strange Titan biology. Nearly a year after Cassini’s final plunge into Saturn, its data continues to yield awesome science. Now maybe it’s time for our scientific probes to pay Titan, or other potentially life-containing moons, a visit.

"Paul P. Murphy, CNN","(CNN) As the Carolinas' swollen rivers crest, their ""polluted floodwaters"" are dumping out into the Atlantic, visibly discoloring the water offshore, federal experts have noted. It was estimated that Hurricane Florence would drop more than 10 trillion gallons in North Carolina alone. Now, that water is making its way through inland waterways and carrying sediment and debris slowly out into the Atlantic. ""Here you can see that the Pamlico Sound is particularly dirty,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday in a tweet, citing satellite images. The water has grown noticeably darker in recent days. Along with sediment, floodwaters also might pick up sewage and chemicals, along with livestock waste from breached hog lagoons. North Carolina officials have gotten reports of breaches.","As the Carolinas' swollen rivers crest, their ""polluted floodwaters"" are dumping out into the Atlantic, visibly discoloring the water offshore, federal experts have noted.",2018-09-20T17:55:47Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",This satellite image shows Florence's floodwaters polluting the Atlantic,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/floodwaters-pollute-atlantic-florence-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920105231-01-florence-pollution-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.,"The C.D.C. continues to function, of course, but caretaker directors overseen by a chaotic White House lack the political backing they need to charge up barricades waving a saber. (Most C.D.C. directors do not carry weapons, but those in the Public Health Service, like the current acting director, Anne Schuchat, hold the rank of admiral and wear a naval uniform that comes with a sword.) Mr. Trump admires bold military leadership so much that he surrounds himself with generals who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, men with nicknames like Mad Dog. About 4,500 Americans died in Iraq, and about 2,400 in Afghanistan. American flu deaths are not just far greater. They are also more predictable than ambushes or I.E.D.s. In recent years they have varied within a regular range, from 12,000 in a mild season to 56,000 in a bad one. It was screamingly obvious that this season might well be bad. Australia, where the flu peaks in August, just endured a particularly vicious year, and the British papers blared headlines about “Aussie Killer Flu” heading north. Genghis Khan moved with more subtlety. But the C.D.C. issued no unusual warning and appeared to do less than usual to promote the intervention that matters most: flu shots. It also missed a P.R. opportunity: This is the 100th anniversary of the 1918 “Spanish flu,” which killed at least 50 million worldwide, and the 50th anniversary of the 1968 “Hong Kong flu,” which killed one million. Even though shots are easier to get than ever through pharmacies, schools and workplaces, it is a rare year when 40 percent of Americans have gotten the shots by November. Worse, those numbers have been slipping. Last November, 2 percent fewer American had gotten flu shots than in November 2016. Coverage among Hispanic adults fell precipitously, by 7.7 percent. The C.D.C. called that “discouraging,” but offered no explanation. In previous years, the C.D.C. usually held autumn events to encourage flu shots. Led by the director, they could involve detailed discussion of the looming viral threat. Dr. Fitzgerald, new to office, did not hold one. Dr. Price’s tenure focused less on public health than on repealing the Affordable Care Act, a mission Mr. Trump demanded. “He better get the votes,” Mr. Trump told a crowd. “If he doesn’t, I’m going to say, ‘Tom, you’re fired!’” One day before he actually was fired — or at least forced out — Dr. Price spoke at a flu-related event and got his own shot in front of the crowd. But by then, he had been under fire for three weeks over his travel, and the room was full of political reporters, who shouted questions as he fled, jacket still in hand. Flu preparedness never made the front burner — and now flu is here with a vengeance. Few may remember, but the 2009 swine flu pandemic was one of the first crises of Barack Obama’s presidency. In April, a spike in deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness caused panic in Mexico, closing schools and restaurants. Almost immediately, the same symptoms struck a Queens high school where students had just returned from spring break in Cancun, and the virus was soon ricocheting around New York City. Two days later, health and Homeland Security officials declared a public health emergency. Three days after that, on his 100th day in office, Mr. Obama made a prime-time broadcast from the White House urging Americans to take precautions and asking Congress for $1.5 billion to flight the flu. By October, a new vaccine was ready in record time, and the president and his wife got their shots on camera. Ultimately, that flu proved not very lethal, but the country was as ready as it could be. Mr. Trump has an opportunity here. Because he is over 70 and overweight, he represents the cohort of Americans most in danger right now: the elderly with underlying morbidities. Has he had the shot? In a 2015 radio interview, he boasted that he had never had one, saying, “I don’t like the idea of injecting bad stuff into your body.” (Paradoxically, some germophobes fear the very vaccines that can protect them because they are made with killed, weakened or chopped-up versions of those germs.) Nonetheless, he appears to have had one this season. He was examined by a White House doctor in January who said his vaccinations, “to include his seasonal influenza, are all up-to-date.” He should now acknowledge getting one and urge all Americans to do so. Influenza is not the only battleground on which bold public-health leadership could save lives. Smoking killed 480,000 Americans last year. Drug overdoses killed 64,000. Car crashes killed 37,000. Gunshots killed 33,000. The opportunities for heroism are endless. Donald G. McNeil Jr. is a science reporter for The New York Times.

Johnny Lieu,"Long thought to be extinct in the Australian state of New South Wales, the crest-tailed mulgara has made an unexpected return after a century missing. The marsupial, presumed to be extinct in the area, was found by researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) at Sturt National Park near Tibooburra who were working on a project to restore and promote desert ecosystems. SEE ALSO: The cutest, most Instagram-famous pets of the internet ""The crest-tailed mulgara was once widely distributed across sandy desert environments in inland Australia, but declined due to the effects of rabbits, cats and foxes,"" Rebecca West, a UNSW ecologist, explained in a statement. Image: reece pedler ""The species weighs around 150 grams (5.29 oz) and has pale blonde fur and a thick tail with a distinctive black crest."" The discovery comes at an ideal time for researchers, who are looking to reintroduce mammal species into the Sturt National Park which haven't been seen for 90 years. Introduced species like rabbits, cats and foxes will be eradicated in two 20 square-kilometre fenced exclosures to make way for extinct mammals like the greater bilby, the western quoll and the western barred bandicoot. You're more likely to find a crest-tailed mulgara in central Australia, where they are widespread in the southern Simpson Desert. It is a carnivore, feeding on invertebrates, lizards and small mammals. Oh, and it is rather adorable, of course.","Long thought to be extinct in the Australian state of New South Wales, the crest-tailed mulgara has made an unexpected return after a century missing.

Romain Dillet,"It’s still quite hard to buy physical goods using bitcoins or ethers. Coinbase plans to (partially) solve that issue with a new partnership with WeGift. Coinbase customers in Europe and Australia can now convert their tokens on their Coinbase account into digital gift cards for popular stores. For instance, you’ll be able to buy gift cards for Uber, Tesco, Google Play, Marks and Spencer and more. The feature is now live in the U.K., Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands and Australia. While WeGift promises gift cards for dozens of merchants, most of them are restricted to customers based in the U.K. If you live in another country, you’ll only get a handful of options. For instance, in France you can only buy gift cards for Décathlon, Bloom &amp; Wild, Global Hotel Card and Ticketmaster. Coinbase says that it will adding be more retailers in the coming months. In some cases, WeGift offers you the fiat equivalent of your cryptocurrencies as well as a tiny bonus. For instance, you get £102 in Uber gift cards if you spend the equivalent of £100 in bitcoins. In the U.S., Coinbase also partnered with Shift for a traditional Visa card. But many European cryptocurrency companies who provided Visa cards had to go back to the drawing board because Visa stopped working Wave Crest Holding — Wave Crest Holding was the card issuer for all European cryptocurrency cards. Gift cards aren’t as convenient as receiving money on your bank account or a debit card. But they’re a great way to avoid telling your bank that you made money by speculating on cryptocurrencies.

KIRK JOHNSON,"“People don’t know what goes into one little piece of trail,” Mr. Beebe said as he stood on the edge of the hole in well-worn hiking pants that had frayed at the cuffs. Distance hiking is about muscle and endurance, but also myriad fussy details of management — calories, hydration, dry socks and blisters. For Mr. Beebe, fire was just one more wrinkle. He had hiked more than 1,700 miles of the 2,650-mile trail by his first conversations with Ms. Prevo, and as he described his journey — and his mental map for the miles ahead around the blazes that were ripping through Oregon and Washington — she found herself deeply impressed. He was charming, she thought, but better yet, a nerd. “The way that you tackle a problem, and pick apart the various resources and stuff that you have for it — that’s a strange thing to love about somebody,” she said, looking at Mr. Beebe across a coffee shop table in Portland recently. “But I was just really attracted to that.” Mr. Beebe and Ms. Prevo have been out together five times now to work on fixing parts of the Pacific Crest Trail. They are planning for Ms. Prevo’s own solo hike on the trail in 2020, after she finishes an engineering degree. They intend to walk the first 86 miles from Canada, heading south together — the stretch Mr. Beebe, for all his improvisation, was unable to complete. He plans to be back in school by then anyway. He dropped out several times over the years, but intends to resume a study of computer science, partly inspired, he said, by a woman he met while he was walking in the woods.","Mark Beebe and Tara Prevo met over online conversations about hiking the famed trail.

Emme Hall,"Volkswagen has been on a bit of a motorsport tear lately. First it sent the I.D. R, a purpose-build electric race car with 680 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque, up Pikes Peak, obliterating the 5-year-old record of 8:13.878 with a time of 7:57.148. Then it set a land-speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats of 210.16 miles per hour in a souped-up 2019 Jetta. Impressive accomplishments, both. Nobody except racing driver Romain Dumas got to drive the supersweet I.D. R, but Volkswagen recently invited me out to Bonneville to have my own go in the 2019 Jetta land-speed record car. And my oh my, what a go it was. The 2019 Jetta sports a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, good for just 147 horsepower. So in order to break a speed record, some serious modifications were in order. The folks at THR Manufacturing swapped out the 1.4T for the a 2.0-liter engine (that you'll see in the soon-to-be-released Jetta GLI) and modified it with new connecting rods, pistons, valves, camshafts, turbocharger and exhaust system. The basic block and crankshaft are stock, but all told, this thing now puts out a whopping 600 horsepower. Power gets to the front wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. Special wheels and tires, as well as a limited-slip differential, help provide traction on the salt while stopping power is improved thanks to a rear-mounted parachute. As you'd expect, the interior is totally stripped out in order to save weight, save for a full roll cage, racing seat and fire suppression system. A full roll cage and not much else adorns the inside of the Bonneville Jetta. Volkswagen When I arrived in Bonneville, I told myself I'd be happy if I hit 185 mph. My previous personal land-speed record was 160 mph, achieved on the front straight at Laguna Seca Raceway in a 2018 Dodge Challenger Hellcat. I figured topping that speed by 25 mph was an achievable goal that would still push me just above my comfort level. The team buckled me into the Jetta's five-point harness, showed me how to pull the chute and let me roll up to the starting line, palms sweating and tummy aflutter with nerves. Imagine my surprise when I found myself at 120 mph during my practice run in what seemed like 10 seconds, with nearly 4 miles to go on the 5-mile track. ""Oh hell,"" I thought. ""This is going to be easy."" Turned out to be not quite so easy. I won't spoil the surprise here, but my second run was, shall we say, far from perfect.

(Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP) Photo: Jay Janner, Associated Press Llano River expected to crest at similar level Wednesday as rescue operations continue At least one body has been recovered while authorities carry out rescue efforts and brace for more flooding Tuesday afternoon throughout the Hill Country. Meteorologists say the Llano River, which came close to a record-breaking level Tuesday will crest again at a similar spot Wednesday morning. Deputies with the Burnet County Sheriff's Office removed the body from the floodwaters of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson at about 1 p.m. near Kingsland, according to Spectrum News in Austin. Texas Game Warden Search and Rescue teams are now involved in multiple air and water rescues along the river as calls for service come in ""one after the other,"" according to a Tweet from the department. Christy Baught, a floodplain administrator for Llano County, said other local agencies are also assisting with rescue operations, as the flooding has placed residents in serious danger. ""The Llano River has hit major historic flood stage,"" reads a post from the Llano County Office of Emergency Management. ""It is currently at 40' and has almost topped the bridge in Llano. Anyone living within 1/4 mile of the river should evacuate immediately to higher ground."" RELATED: Missing driver recovered from Sabinal River identified The Llano River crested around noon at 39.9 feet, just short of the 1935 record of 41.5 feet. The National Weather Service predicts that Wednesday morning's crest will reach a ""similar height."" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Operations Center to a state of increased readiness in response to the ongoing flooding. ""When severe weather strikes, Texas will ensure our responders and local officials have what they need to respond and protect those in harm's way,"" he said. ""I also urge all Texans to take their safety into their own hands by closely monitor changing weather conditions and heeding warnings from local officials."" The flooding has shut down several roadways and bridges in the area, and at about 9:30 a.m., the FM 2900 bridge in Kingsland, Texas, collapsed from the pressure of the raging floodwaters, according to a report from KEYE-TV in Austin. The National Weather Service reported Tuesday morning that more than 10 inches of rain has inundated portions of the Llano River watershed since early Monday. The water has rushed into the river, causing it to rise to almost unprecedented levels. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Gillespie and Llano counties through 7 p.m. Tuesday and a flood warning along the Llano River in Llano County, Sandy Creek near Kingsland and the Pedernales River at Johnson City. The Llano River is in a major flood stage, meaning there will be ""extensive inundation of structures and roads."" Such a stage calls for ""significant evacuations of people and/or transfer of property to higher elevations,"" according to NWS's website. Baught said the Llano County Office of Emergency management has set up shelters at the First Baptist Church of Llano, Inman's Kitchen an the Kingsland Community Center. She did not know if anyone was missing in the storm. Flooding has also affected other rivers in the Hill County. The National Weather Service said Guadalupe River, Sandy Creek and Nueces River are facing a ""dangerous situation."" RELATED: Rain suspends search for person still missing in Texas flood According to the Austin American-Statesman, homes near Robinson City Park, Scotts Acres, Castell, the FM 2900 Bridge in Kingsland, Kingsland Lodge and Marble Falls are expected to face severe flooding. The following school districts have cancelled or delayed classes today: Llano ISD has cancelled all classes Rocksprings ISD has cancelled all classes Burnet CISD has cancelled all classes Fredericksburg ISD has cancelled all classes Hunt ISD has cancelled all classes Ingram ISD has cancelled all classes Leakey ISD has cancelled all classes Junction ISD has cancelled all classes Medina ISD has cancelled all classes Marble Falls ISD has cancelled all classes Harper ISD has cancelled all classes The Hill Country and other portions of South Central Texas have been hammered by heavy rain and flooding this month. Last week, four people were swept away as flood waters rushed through Junction, Texas, after storms dumped almost a foot of rain into the South Llano River. Three victims have been found and authorities on Monday temporarily called off the search for the fourth until the rain passed. Patrick Ojeda was swept away on Friday as he tried to drive across a bridge over the Sabinal River in Uvalde County. He was found a mile downstream.

Karen Dillon,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Frigid floodwaters pushing down the Missouri River left ruins, death and drowned livestock in their wake across the U.S. Midwest’s farmland, and were expected to crest in northwest Missouri early Friday, with more cities and towns under threat. 
Voluntary evacuations were advised in the small riverfront city of St. Joseph, Mo., where the nation’s longest river is expected to crest about 6 a.m. local time. 
Debris-laden river water is expected to rise by between 29 and 31 feet (8.8 and 9.4 meters), just two feet below the height of protective levees, officials said, as the waters then head toward Kansas City about 55 miles (88 km) south and more population centers in Kansas and Missouri downstream. 
“This is serious, water could easily breach those levees,” David Roth of the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. 
The estimated crest height could quickly change just from a few degree differences in snow melt up stream, he said. The river could top levees or breach weak spots, he said. 
“Just an unexpected precipitation could fall upstream or temperatures spike up,” he said. 
Midwest daytime temperatures are already about 10-degrees Fahrenheit above normal, he said and will hit as high as 60 in parts of the Midwest Friday, including St. Joseph and Kansas City. 
Flooding of the Missouri River was triggered by last week’s so-called “bomb cyclone” storm that has already inflicted damage estimated at nearly $1.5 billion in Nebraska, killed at least four people in Nebraska and Iowa and left a man missing below Nebraska’s collapsed Spencer Dam.[L1N21809A] 
“This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk,” said Ed Clark, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in the agency’s spring outlook. 
Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency for his state Wednesday as high water forced evacuations of several small farm communities. 
The declaration allows state resources and assistance to be provided directly to counties and municipalities in need. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska, making federal funding available in nine counties there that bore the brunt of last week’s floods. 
The threat of extensive flooding lingers over the wider region and could grow dire in coming weeks with additional rainfall and melting snow runoff, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials said on Thursday.

Jonathan Shieber,"In an effort to tie the top gamers and streamers more directly with their fans, a new company called Quarterback has just raised $2.5 million to create and manage fan-based leagues for the superstars of the esports and streaming world. The company raked in its seed round from investors led by Bitkraft Esports, which is quickly building one of the most complete portfolio of gaming related startups in the industry. Additional investors include Crest Capital Ventures, Deep Space Ventures, UpWest Labs and angel investors. Essentially, it’s a platform for creating gaming leagues and content driven not by game publishers, leagues, or existing streaming sites like Twitch, but by the gamers themselves. It gives streamers and players a new way to reach their audience, the company claims. Founded by serial entrepreneur, Jonathan Weinberg, who acted as the chief executive for Round Robin and held a leadership role in the mobile game studio Spartonix, Quarterback is the latest attempt to get more revenue into the hands of gamers. Leagues created on Quarterback can host daily challenges, give away prizes and compete against fan clubs devoted to other top players. Esports streamers and gamers are among the most bankable influencers, pitching to a new generation of consumers that don’t track traditional media sources. The ability to host and own their own channels gives these streamers an ability to create their own game libraries, cultivate a next generation of talent, and encourage one-to-one interactions on platforms that they control. “Most streamers and pros struggle to monetize their fan-based and lose touch with their audience when the fans break-away to play their own games,” says Jens Hilgers, a founding partner of Bitkraft Esports Ventures. “Quarterback solves this problem in a unique way by helping streamers become an integral part of their fan’s game-play.”","In an effort to tie the top gamers and streamers more directly with their fans, a new company called Quarterback has just raised $2.5 million to create and manage fan-based leagues for the superstars of the esports and streaming world.

(CNN)Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.
Upstream from Scribner, Nebraska, on the Elkhorn River, a flood gauge measured its second highest crest: 17.65 feet. The flood gauge just downstream from the town stopped reporting on Wednesday when minor flooding was taking place; it could have been affected by ice floes.
The images show how the Elkhorn River temporarily made the town of Scribner an island. It appears, looking at satellite imagery, the only connection for the almost 900 residents of the town was Highway 275.
Normally, the Logan Creek Dredge, the river that flows into the Elkhorn River, is barely visible. It, too, far exceeds its usual banks.
Downstream in Waterloo, Nebraska, the Elkhorn River rose to 24.64 feet, the highest ever measured.
It beat the previous record, set in 1962, by more than 5 feet. The Platte River, to the left in the image, also was at historic levels farther upstream, in Leshara, Nebraska.
How much water was flowing in the Platte River is apparent by how far it exceeds its banks between North Bend and Fremont, Nebraska.
The 28,000 residents of Fremont were cut off during the height of the flooding. While no injuries were reported, authorities were conducting rescue missions across the city.
In Ashland, Nebraska, the Platte River also saw record levels of flooding. The river there 24.35 feet on Saturday was over a foot higher than ever recorded.
The river swelled so much there, it cut through swathes of farmland, turning the highest points into islands.
Offutt Air Force Base sits along the Missouri River just south of Omaha, Nebarska. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs Inc. shows much of the base sitting in Missouri River floodwaters.
Floodwaters made it into some 30 buildings on base and nine aircraft were evacuated because of the flooding, officials said. They included eight variations of a C135, and one E4B, an advanced airborne command post known as a ""doomsday plane.""
One of the most dramatic images shows the mouth of the Platte River where it meets the Missouri River near La Platte, Nebraska.
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Office said it's still not safe enough to allow residents of the Hanson and Chris Lakes area back into their homes. A flood gauge just downstream on the Missouri River pegged its level at 40.62 feet on Saturday, over 4 feet above the historic crest.","Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.",2019-03-18T21:54:42Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Satellite images show Nebraska and Iowa rivers swallowing towns,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/us/nebraska-iowa-floods-before-after-satellite-images-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318151844-oafb-missour-after-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,crest,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrew J. Hawkins,"Last year, Porsche unveiled the production version of the Mission E — an all-electric four-door that looked like a worthy rival to Tesla’s Model S. But rather than stick with that alluring and mysterious moniker, the Volkswagen-owned performance automaker opted for a new name: the Taycan. The name, which was announced at an event celebrating the automaker’s 70th anniversary, roughly translates to “lively young horse” in German, a reference to the leaping horse at the heart of the company’s crest. Also, it’s apparently pronounced “tie-con,” but it’s probably already doomed to a lifetime of mispronunciations. “lively young horse” in German “Our new electric sports car is strong and dependable; it’s a vehicle that can consistently cover long distances and that epitomizes freedom,” Porsche AG chief Oliver Blume said in a statement. The internet, as it is wont to do, immediately started dragging Porsche for the new name. ⚪️Single Taycan (is a stupid name) pic.twitter.com/gW1iBgEKj8 — max finkel (@2Fast2Finkel) June 8, 2018 Taycan’t be serious.

The car also has a range of just under 300 miles and is compatible with Europe’s growing fast-charging network. Porsche is part of the Volkswagen Group, and like many of its corporate brethren, it was caught up in the massive emissions cheating scandal that broke in 2015. The company even recalled 22,000 of its diesel SUVs this summer for containing the so-called “defeat devices” that were used to skirt emissions tests. And as countries and other automakers increasingly push toward electric vehicles, the pressure is on to take a big foothold in that section of the market. For both Porsche and fans of electric vehicles, the Taycan can’t come soon enough — even if it does sound kind of like a Liam Neeson movie.","Porsche unveiled the production version of the Mission E — an all-electric four-door that looked like a worthy rival to Tesla’s Model S.

"ANDY NEWMAN, BENJAMIN WEISER and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM","They joined the plot, were arrested and, ultimately, convicted, despite their lawyers complaints of entrapment. Also in 2003, Mr. Hussain filed for bankruptcy, claiming debts of $177,000. He continued his various ventures, sometimes in partnership with family members. They bought a hotel, now called the Crest Inn Suites and Cottages, in Gansevoort, north of Albany. In 2008, his family started Prestige Limousine. That same year, according to court documents, some hotel guests sued him for taking reservations for cabins that had not even been built yet. It was in 2008 that Mr. Hussain, posing as a wealthy jihadist named Maqsood and driving a series of luxury cars provided to him by the F.B.I., recruited four men for what he said was a plot to bomb synagogues in the Bronx. Mr. Hussain drove with the men to a synagogue in Riverdale, where one of them put what he believed were bombs outside. They were fake. The four men were arrested and convicted. But after the trial, the judge, Colleen McMahon, took the extraordinary step of writing to federal prosecutors in Albany, saying that Mr. Hussains trial testimony suggested he may have perpetrated a fraud during his earlier bankruptcy proceedings. She noted Mr. Hussain testified about receiving substantial sums of money during his bankruptcy case from a family trust in Pakistan, which he did not disclose to the court or his creditors.","Maria Lopez, of Amsterdam, N.Y., joined hundreds of mourners Monday night at a candlelight vigil for 20 people killed in a limousine crash.",2018-10-09T23:36:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Limo Owner’s Past: F.B.I.

Virginia K. Smith,"When we last rounded up our staff’s Weekly Upgrades, our editors were moving into new apartments, working outdoors, trying new finance, and improving our own emergency preparedness. This week, we’re whitening our teeth, managing stress, making time to see new friends, and inventing our own furniture DIYs. What upgrades did you make this week? Let us know in the comments. I’ve had an IKEA RAST nightstand kicking around the house for a while. It was marvelously cheap (under $15 I think) and has been repurposed in many ways over the years. Recently, I plopped it on top of my desk. Now I have the perfect height standing desk! It takes up so little room that I still have a space next to it to put my laptop when I prefer to sit. beth skwarecki, health editor I am currently reading “The Pisces” by Melissa Broder, which is just as good as everyone is saying it is, if not a bit * too * real (minus the Merman, of course). alicia adamczyk, staff writer I’m approaching tech week for a theater show I’m in, so I’m not so much “upgrading” my life as I am trying to maintain normal levels of sleep, food, and friendliness. So far, I have only managed to achieve one of these three goals, but I look forward to getting a little “rest and relaxation” this weekend. And maybe pizza. Undoubtedly pizza. david murphy, senior tech editor I replaced my shower curtain liner and my shower is a much more pleasant place now. It was $3 at IKEA. claire lower, food &amp; beverage editor I got a document organizer. No longer will my desk be a mess of papers! Nothing can stop me now! patrick allan, staff writers We got a family membership to a local indoor pool and have basically been living there on weekday evenings. It’s one of the best lazy-parent decisions I’ve made. My kid can get all her extra energy out and I can get a little exercise, too. We’ll eat a picnic dinner there with paper plates, and then shower, get into pajamas and head home. Sometimes, my kid will even pass out in the car. Total win. michelle woo, parenting editor I cleaned my shower of soap scum, after hearing the pro-body wash elite complain how bar soap leaves soap scum on shower walls. Turns out it comes off super easily with regular old dish soap. Didn’t cost me anything, only took about 3 minutes. I will still not use body wash. joel kahn, sr. video producer I got drinks again with a reader I met during my “Pick My Brain” month. Every time, we end up talking about the state of tech and whether the future is going to be garbage. He got a job in San Mateo, so we’re getting one last drinks next week before he moves. Now I’ll have a new geek friend in Silicon Valley! nick douglas, staff writer This week I hopped on the bandwagon (or what seems to be a bandwagon based on my Instagram feed?) and tried whitening my teeth with activated charcoal. The results weren’t incredible, but they were good enough that I’ll keep doing it. Plus, it’s cheaper than Crest WhiteStrips and much less painful, so I count it as a win. virginia k. smith, managing editor","When we last rounded up our staff’s Weekly Upgrades, our editors were moving into new apartments, working outdoors, trying new finance, and improving our own emergency preparedness.

Lydia Dishman,"“Sometimes the best way to improve your work is to stop working,” says Elizabeth Schwartz. She should know. The chief operating officer at Austin-based software startup Square Root took a five month sabbatical to hike the Pacific Crest Trail in 2016, after working at the company for six years. During her talk at SXSW this week, Schwartz revealed that the motivation for hitting the trail (not informed at all by Cheryl Strayed’s Wild ) was more about the burst of inspiration to do it that continued to keep her up at night, and the serendipity of her brother getting laid off and having the time to start the hike with her. “There’s never a right time to take a sabbatical” Schwartz explained. Especially when your job is as all-encompassing as hers. But she made the case to her boss, Square Root’s founder and CEO, Chris Taylor, and he granted her the leave, which was only partially paid. Before she left, Schwartz, a self-professed planner, mapped out all of her job’s responsibilities on a spreadsheet and started to delegate “up, down, and sideways” across the organization. Although she wasn’t totally out of touch while on the trail, Schwartz started realizing she didn’t need to constantly check in with the staff. Trust in people to do their jobs, she said, was key to having them step up and be accountable–not to mention more engaged and productive. And that’s what so many organizations struggle with. Companies that attempt to one-up each other to attract and engage employees are rolling out amazing perks like massages, pet cloning, and paid international travel, among other things. This may be successful in the short term, but even unlimited vacation is just theoretical if the culture doesn’t support and encourage employees to take advantage of it. For several years of tracking, Gallup’s poll numbers remain stubbornly stuck on engagement. Only about a third of American workers are engaged on the job. The upshot, Schwartz maintained, is that leadership needs to model the behaviors that reinforce their trust in staff to do their jobs well. Although she admitted that Square Root hasn’t had another person take a long sabbatical, she as an executive modeled how it could be done. And acceptance and flexibility ( especially to work remotely ) are crucial to building a company where people want to work. For Schwartz, taking an extended leave reset her perspective and transformed her leadership style to one that was more hands-off. Taking inventory of her daily tasks helped her see what she could delegate and what needed more focus. That’s arguably the biggest productivity hack of all.","Elizabeth Schwartz’s five-month hike on the Pacific Crest Trail was an exercise in letting go and trusting that work would still be there when she got back. “Sometimes the best way to improve your work is to stop working,” says Elizabeth Schwartz.

Marcia Bjornerud,"It’s an abnormally hot day in September and I’m standing in a cattail marsh in eastern Wisconsin, trying to change the way my students view the world. They’re all distracted—by the heat, homesickness, or the fact that they’ve lost a phone signal. The guys on the university hockey team are snickering about something. I’ve brought them here, in the first week of our introductory geology course, to investigate a mystery: Just in front of us, rising improbably from the flat expanse of the marsh, is a hill. About 50 feet high and twice as wide, it is made up of layers of loose sand and stones of many types. As we climb to the top, we can see that the hill snakes across the landscape like an upside-down river valley. My question for the students is: How did it form? Geology has a PR problem; people associate it with musty museum collections and avaricious mining companies. As I hope my students will learn, though, looking at the planet through a geologic lens is something like strapping on an augmented-reality headset. It invites you, from your vantage point in the present, to summon up Earth’s deep past and far future—to see these parallel worlds with your own eyes, like digital overlays. Not far from the marsh, for instance, is a limestone quarry. The slabs of gray rock seem unchanging now, but your headset reveals that they were once a coral reef in an inland sea. Below the former reef is a layer of golden sandstone, whose perfectly round quartz grains, pounded smooth by the ancient surf, speak of a beach that existed long before life came ashore. There are AR tools for mapping and modeling, but so far none is as immersive as geologic insight. From the crest of the serpentine hill, I coax the students into posing hypotheses about its origin. They try various overlays. Was there a river here once? That would account for the sinuous form but doesn’t explain why it’s a ridge, not a valley. OK, how about a glacial deposit? That explains the variety of stones, but a bulldozing ice mass doesn’t leave behind neat layers. The students are getting curious, drawn into the mystery, a little aggravated by it. Suddenly, someone has a crazy idea: Maybe this whole area used to be under ice, and may­be we’re standing in the dried-up bed of a river that flowed in a tunnel under the ice. The headsets are working now: We’re just 20 minutes from campus, but we’re half a mile under a Pleistocene glacier. The mood on the bus back to campus is buoyant. We’ve connected with something old, wild, and real. Most humans are chronophobes. We worry about where the time has gone, whether we’re spending it wisely, how much of it we have left. Geology puts things in temporal perspective; it reminds us that, while the current version of the world is ephemeral, it’s also intimately connected to countless others, long past and still to come. If I’m successful, my students will finish the class seeing backstories everywhere in nature, their sense of place and time on this old Earth irrevocably altered.

ALEX SCHECHTER,"Whats impossible to control, especially in a high-altitude place like Colorado, is the weather. On Day 3, After successfully climbing 1,000 feet out of Paradox Valley, I hurtled down Highway 90, euphoric to finally arrive at the Colorado-Utah state line. We posed by the Welcome to Colorado sign and snacked on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches wed made at the hut that morning. Then, I got back on my bike, headed up Highway 46, and had a sense of foreboding as soon as I hit the saddle. The temperature was quickly dropping, the sky was leaden, and ahead of me was a nine-mile ascent, in the cold, with the likelihood of a storm breaking right over me. Joe pulled up 50 yards ahead, and when I rode up, he lowered the window and stuck his head out. Well? he asked halfheartedly, nodding toward the back seat. Begrudgingly, I packed up my bike and got in the car. Its a bittersweet feeling to give up when you know your goal is unattainable. With a little more training, or some sunshine, I felt I could have tackled this final haul into Utah. On the plus side, I knew Id made the right decision. As we began to drive, now in the warm safety of Joes car, the road took a ruthless pitch up the back of La Sal Mountain, easily the steepest road Id encountered so far. The curves were sharp, the shoulder was narrow, and most noticeably the rain was coming down hard. Toward the crest, as we neared the 8,000 foot mark, still 20 miles from Moab, the view suddenly widened, and across some meadows we could follow the contour of Mount La Sal, almost within reach, to where its peak was wreathed in white wispy cloud.

Gene Cherry,"(Reuters) - Nearly all rivers and waterways in North and South Carolina will crest Sunday, but most will remain at dangerous flood levels for days to come, the U.S. National Weather Service warned, more than a week after the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people. Swaths of rivers near the Atlantic coast will not crest for days to come, such as the lower Cape Fear River near Wilmington, N.C., one of the hardest hit communities, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “This isn’t over,” Oravec said early Sunday. “Large sections of rivers near the coast won’t start cresting until at least early in the week, maybe later.” “All that water is going to take a good while to recede,” he said. “Damage can still be done. It’ll be a slow drop.” Meanwhile, remnants of the once mighty storm, brought heavy rains northwest up the Ohio Valley, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. Officials in towns and cities in both North and South Carolina were filling sandbags and finalizing evacuation plans, eyeing some rivers that are swollen by heavy rainfall on Saturday. In Conway, South Carolina, where President Donald Trump visited this week, images posted by the city on Saturday showed water lapping at homes in an area where residents were being evacuated. In Lee’s Landing in Horry County, some residents used boats to get to safety as the Waccamaw River spilled into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported. “If you can get out, get out,” Joseph Tanner, the county’s fire rescue chief, said in an interview with WBTW News 13. More than two dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, the NWS said. At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm, with most of those in North Carolina. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters. Nearly 550 roads remained closed, the state’s department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence. Duke Energy Corp said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. The company is testing the water for possible contamination, Duke officials said in a release Saturday. “The company is bringing in additional construction material from across the state to repair the breach as soon as the flood waters recede,” the release said. The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to state officials. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

 You could quit eating or drinking those things, but for most of us, that's the most unrealistic option. You could also go to your dentist for a professional whitening treatment, but those are particularly costly, and can be very painful especially if you have sensitive teeth. 
 Luckily, there are plenty of affordable options nowadays that give you professional whitening results from the comfort of your own home. Crest Whitestrips are some of the more prolific at-home whitening kits, lining drugstore shelves just about everywhere. 
 I've used Crest Whitestrips on and off for a while now, doing a set of strips every once a year or so. I usually just pick whatever options are available at my local drugstore, as every different pack I've tried has worked very well. All of the strips are thin, almost invisible, and have a no-slip grip that actually stays put. I love the convenience of these — it's easy to use them while watching television or while sitting at your desk at work. 
 While I love them, though, some of my peers have cautioned against using them, calling them unsafe or unhealthy for my teeth. Even though they didn't back these claims with any significant evidence, it was enough to make me question if I should search for a new whitening solution. 
In an effort to make an informed decision about how I chose to white my teeth, I reached out to a renowned New York City Orthodontist, Dr. Janet Stoess-Allen, DMD. Stoess-Allen practices at Park Avenue Orthodontics and is a member of the American Dental Association, American Association of Orthodontics, and New York County Dental Society, among others. 
Crest Whitestrips adhere to your teeth and whiten quickly.
 Amazon 
How do Crest Whitestrips work? 
 While my own experiences have proved to me that these products do work well, I could not tell you the how or why. So, Dr. Stoess-Allen helped me better understand just that. After looking at the ingredients list for a few different Whitestrips products, it was clear the consistent ingredient in every product was hydrogen peroxide. Dr. Stoess-Allen says that hydrogen peroxide works to remove surface and deep stains on the teeth, as well as whiten them simultaneously. 
 While you can also try bleach gels, pens, or whitening toothpastes (most of which also contain this ingredient), Whitestrips are particularly effective because they contact your teeth most directly. When comparing Crest White Luxe Glamorous Whitestrips to bleach gels and pens, Dr. Stoess-Allen found the strips to be the most effective bleaching agent. 
 Are they safe? 
 Dr. Stoess-Allen confirmed that ""None of the listed ingredients in Crest Whitestrips have [been] shown to be unhealthy or dangerous to the enamel of teeth"" — she even recommends the products to her own patients. The concern may come from the use of hydrogen peroxide, which can be harsh when used in high percentages, or can make gums a little sore or teeth a little sensitive. But Dr. Stoess-Allen shared that ""If the percentage of hydrogen peroxide is 10% or less, it is a very safe home-use product."" Potential gum or tooth discomfort aside, the Crest White Luxe Glamorous Whitestrips' hydrogen peroxide concentration is 9.5%, which is, according to our expert, a perfectly safe level. 
 Bottom Line 
 ""From the data that I have collected from recent studies,"" Dr. Stoess-Allen shared with us, ""it appears that the Crest Luxe White Glamorous Whitestrips is the most effective DIY tooth bleaching product."" She personally recommends these strips to her patients who are being treated with Invisalign clear aligners, explaining that ""They can simply remove the aligners and still bleach their teeth even while undergoing tooth movement."" 
 Ultimately, this is an affordable product that gives serious results and is approved by the experts. If you're looking to spruce up your smile and make it really shine, you know what to do.","Insider Picks writes about products and services to help you navigate when shopping online.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska. Tsunami watches were issued for California, Oregon, and Washington State. A few hours later, all watches and warnings had been canceled, leading many Twitter users still-half asleep at their computers to wonder: Why is it so damn hard to predict a tsunami’s strength ahead of time? The reason has to do with the fact that the ocean is very large, and our earthquake and tsunami monitoring infrastructure is relatively limited. As geophysicist Mika McKinnon explained to Earther, a tsunami did arrive, and we predicted its timing pretty damn well. The thing that was—and always is—difficult to predict is the tsunami’s size. “It’s easy to predict when a tsunami will arrive, it is very difficult to predict how big it is going to be,” McKinnon said. “There is a tsunami right now, it just happens to be under a foot tall.” To understand why, it’s useful to start at the source of the event. Tsunamis are essentially massive ripples, emanating out from an area where water was displaced. Think throwing a stone in a pond, only now, the stone is a meteorite the size of a bus, or an undersea volcanic eruption. Or, in this case, a large earthquake. All of these events displace water, creating ripples. Trouble is, it’s very difficult to tell how much water. “How can you tell how the displacement of water was distributed?” McKinnon said. “You’re not going to be able to measure it in the open ocean, where the distance above background is a few inches over a few kilometers. You have to wait for the wave to come to shore and shoal,” the process by which tsunami waves bunch up on shore, the crest-to-crest distance becoming shorter as the height of the wave grows taller. That said, tsunami forecasters aren’t entirely in the dark. McKinnon explained that after an earthquake occurs, the event is thrown into a tsunami modeling system, which gives “a good estimate on travel time.” To determine if a tsunami wave is going to propagate widely, forecasters then turn to the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) network, a series of ocean buoys maintained by NOAA that detect the pressure of waves from a passing tsunami. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami.” A series of graphics tweeted out by the National Weather Service Tsunami Alert Center this morning show the location of those DART buoys relative to the recent quake, and predicted arrival times for the tsunami wave. Looking at the prediction maps tweeted out over the last few hours, you can see that arrival times don’t change very much—again, the speed of a tsunami, which depends largely on the depth of the ocean, is something we’re quite good at predicting: The final piece of the puzzle for understanding a tsunami event is tide gauges (those orange dots on the Tsunami Alert maps), which measure ocean surface displacement near the shore. It isn’t until we have that tide gauge data—plus any human observations—that we can really say how big the tsunami event is going to be. Tsunamis look different from the normal ebb and flow of the tide. As the National Weather Service explains, when they come ashore they move like a “fast-rising flood or a wall of water.” Another tell is if the water drains away suddenly, exposing the ocean floor and appearing like a very low tide. Powerful tsunamis that cause large changes to the water level can lead to flooding over a mile inland, according to the NWS. Sometimes, as was the case this morning, we get lucky and tsunami events are minor. But it’s important to note that even if a tsunami generates little flooding, it can still be deadly. Monster waves or no, tsunamis carry a lot of energy. Plus, the first wave isn’t necessarily the largest one, and depending on the bathymetry of the shoreline, waves can pile up and become bigger in certain locations. (Bays can funnel water in, causing waves to interfere constructively and get taller.) That’s where human reports are very useful, but in the case of this morning’s tsunami, such reports were few and far between. Fact of the matter is, there just aren’t that many people living on the south coast of Alaska. Given the complexity of the situation, McKinnon said it’s a good idea to stay out of the water for a few hours after a tsunami warning is lifted. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami,” McKinnon said. “They get in the water because it looks like a normal surf, and there are really intense currents and they die.”","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska.

Arman Tabatabai,"Artificial intelligence applied to information security can engender images of a benevolent Skynet, sagely analyzing more data than imaginable and making decisions at lightspeed, saving organizations from devastating attacks. In such a world, humans are barely needed to run security programs, their jobs largely automated out of existence, relegating them to a role as the button-pusher on particularly critical changes proposed by the otherwise omnipotent AI.
Such a vision is still in the realm of science fiction. AI in information security is more like an eager, callow puppy attempting to learn new tricks minus the disappointment written on their faces when they consistently fail. No ones job is in danger of being replaced by security AI; if anything, a larger staff is required to ensure security AI stays firmly leashed.
Arguably, AIs highest use case currently is to add futuristic sheen to traditional security tools, rebranding timeworn approaches as trailblazing sorcery that will revolutionize enterprise cybersecurity as we know it. The current hype cycle for AI appears to be the roaring, ferocious crest at the end of a decade that began with bubbly excitement around the promise of big data in information security.
But what lies beneath the marketing gloss and quixotic lust for an AI revolution in security? How did AL ascend to supplant the lustrous zest around machine learning (ML) that dominated headlines in recent years? Where is there true potential to enrich information security strategy for the better and where is it simply an entrancing distraction from more useful goals? And, naturally, how will attackers plot to circumvent security AI to continue their nefarious schemes?
The year AI debuted as the It Girl in information security was 2017. The year prior, MIT completed their study showing human-in-the-loop AI out-performed AI and humans individually in attack detection. Likewise, DARPA conducted the Cyber Grand Challenge, a battle testing AI systems offensive and defensive capabilities. Until this point, security AI was imprisoned in the contrived halls of academia and government. Yet, the history of two vendors exhibits how enthusiasm surrounding security AI was driven more by growth marketing than user needs.","Artificial intelligence applied to information security can engender images of a benevolent Skynet, sagely analyzing more data than imaginable and making decisions at lightspeed, saving organizations from devastating attacks.

"Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone, CNN","(CNN) After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend. At least 44 people have died since the hurricane slammed into the coast last week. While the rain subsided, some rivers are still rising, and North and South Carolina officials warn the flooding danger is far from over. ""The Cape Fear River will crest again this weekend, along with the Lumber River,"" the North Carolina Department of Transportation tweeted Friday, adding that the Neuse will rise Monday. ""Additionally, new areas are flooding with little warning. Due to this, travel isn't recommended south of US 64,"" it said. While some roads are not flooded, they may have damage and hazardous debris that makes it dangerous to drive or walk on them, state officials said. In South Carolina, emergency officials issued a stern warning on avoiding the roads: ""I know we sound redundant, but it bears repeating: Turn around, don't drown!"" the state's emergency management department tweeted. A week after Hurricane Florence made landfall, the trillions of gallons of water it dumped over the Carolinas are slowly moving toward the sea and leaving a path of destruction behind. Residential streets have turned into rivers and freeways have morphed into waterways. Storm recovery will cost $1.2 billion In North Carolina, flooded rivers have left thousands of evacuees living in shelters and hundreds of roads underwater. The water has receded in some places, but as it moves downstream, officials say, thousands of people could be in danger until next week. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Friday a number of rivers -- the Waccamaw, Lynches, Little Pee Dee and Big Pee Dee -- are forecast to crest east of Interstate 95 this weekend and early next week. Residents were warned the confluence of the Big Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee rivers -- where they merge -- could reach flood levels even greater than those seen during Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the state's resources and personnel have shifted to the Pee Dee region. Authorities have said 23 out of the 46 counties in South Carolina could potentially be impacted by flooding. Residents in those areas are still recovering from the 2015 catastrophic floods in the Carolinas as well as from the widespread damage of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 In Conway, South Carolina, authorities said residents could see damage in homes that have not flooded before. Officials are also worried about contamination and environmental hazards from the storm, including the potential effects of coal ash. Coal ash is an industrial waste created by coal-burning power plants, and can carry health risks. Flooding from the Cape Fear River caused breaches in a dam at a cooling lake at Duke Energy's LV Sutton Plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, prompting the company to shut down the natural gas plant Friday, Duke Energy said in a statement. ""Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches -- one large and several smaller -- on the southern end of the impoundment,"" the statement said. It noted there are two coal ash basins on the site, but said there was ""no visible ash in the cooling lake. A landfill containing disposed ash from the site has not been affected by the cooling lake, it said. An earlier statement from Duke Energy explained the LV Sutton coal power plant was retired in 2013, and today the plant operates as a natural gas plant. Most of the people died in North Carolina Of the 44 people killed, three have been in Virginia, 32 in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina, officials said. The deaths include two mental health patients killed in South Carolina's Horry County. The women, Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van when sheriff's deputies couldn't open the doors of the vehicle, authorities said.","After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend.",2018-09-22T09:59:04Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",44 dead as Florence-weary Carolinas face more flooding and rising rivers,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/us/florence-carolinas-flooding-saturday-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920235843-03-florence-flooding-0920-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAX LAKIN,"Over coffee at Café Beaubourg in Paris in 2014, Christiansen gave Fournier and Marty, who are 48 and 43, respectively, his pitch: “I’m determined to build a garden of pleasure and creativity,” he told them. They weren’t sure what to make of this “Australian man full of fantasy,” as Marty recalled. It helped that the project provided a reason to travel regularly to Los Angeles, where they had been consulting on Balazs’s Chateau Marmont. “There’s something so free in L.A., especially today, that we don’t find anywhere else in the U.S.,” Marty said. THE ARCHITECTS LEFT the shell of Christiansen’s main house mostly intact, restoring its pink stucco facades and laying a new roof of yellow, green and burgundy ceramic tiles made in Morocco. The interiors — much like Studio KO’s other work — are lavish but not ostentatious, precise but not severe. Sunlight splashes in through a wall of arched windows and shimmers on newly installed parti-colored Venetian terrazzo floors. Hockney’s “ Caribbean Tea Time ” (1987), a folding screen of Cubist collage panels that depicts an ecstatic reverie of leisure, dominates the living room. The back parlor, painted Majorelle blue, its mirrored ceiling burnished with a delicate patina, includes a daybed in a leopard coverlet that’s a homage to John, who now lives in Palm Springs. When they began renovating the exterior, Marty was surprised to find a greenish layer under the bleached pink, a shade he described as “mint syrup poured into milk.” He and Fournier were eager to replicate the effect, so they gently distressed the walls until a faint turquoise appeared through the deep Chablis. Christiansen, true to form, branded the property Flamingo Estate, complete with a logo made to look like a family crest that’s weathered generations; the perimeter of the house is lined with dozens of terra-cotta pots, hand thrown by Moroccan craftsmen, engraved with tiny flamingos.","Perched on a hill planted with fruit trees, one home in Eagle Rock takes the Los Angeles fantasy to new heights.",2018-09-14T15:35:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How a Love of Jane Fonda and the Color Pink Created a California Dream House,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/t-magazine/los-angeles-dream-house-flamingo-estate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/t-magazine/13tmag-flamingo-slide-GWA6/13tmag-flamingo-slide-GWA6-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ROGER COHEN,"This brave young team raised the hopes of 1966 with its spirit and cohesion. More than 26 million viewers in England watched the semifinal on ITV. The national dejection at the defeat is overwhelming. The “Three Lions,” depicted on the crest of the England shirt, and their coach, Gareth Southgate, return home with justified pride. In Trippier, the goal-scoring wing back who has been a discovery of the tournament, and the central defenders — Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire — England now have a solid foundation for the future. By beating Colombia in a penalty shootout in the first knockout round, England laid to rest the demons of defeat in penalty shootouts in 1990 against West Germany (semifinal), 1998 against Argentina (last 16) and 2006 against Portugal (quarterfinal). That’s important psychologically. In the end, winning is about character. There’s no greater test of it than those unforgiving shootouts. To beat Colombia that way was particularly important for Southgate, whose missed penalty in the Euro 96 semifinal against Germany condemned England to defeat. The miss has haunted the coach ever since — to the point, he confessed in Russia, that he could not listen to the “Three Lions” song, with its refrain of “Football’s coming home,” for two decades. That anthem has been echoing around England again. The English are long-suffering when it comes to soccer, and so patient. My nephew, Jamie Walden, commented: “Football’s still coming home. Just going to take a bit longer than expected.” All that’s needed now is a match-winning English midfielder of composure and vision, the difference between good average and glory. Such players — a Paul Pogba of France, a Modric — do not grow on trees. They are the providers of magic. I confess that I do find one solace in this defeat. If England had won the World Cup, the jingoism from The Daily Mail and all the “Brexit” cohorts would have been intolerable. We’d all have had to listen to how the glory and character of England had been restored by Britain exiting the European Union. So I salute Croatia and its midfield geniuses for more reasons than one.

Most of this may be lost on the armchair soccer fan, though the storytelling implicit in the design will not. (In any case, the kits are available in two fits: athlete and stadium, or looser, for the weekend fan.) Though the kits rely on the color palettes of national flags, the difference is often in the pixelated details. 
Chile, France, U.S.A. they are all red, white and blue, Ms. Looker said, which can make them hard to distinguish. We bring it up all the time internally.
What to expect? The United States jerseys have a throwback patriotism with (in the home kit) direct references to the jerseys worn by the 1999 team that transformed the profile of womens soccer in America: white, with red and blue stripes on the sleeves. 
The names of the 50 states are printed in gray on the back, and three stars over the crest nod to the three championships the United States has won. The away kit has tonal abstractions of stars and stripes on red (though they read a little blotchy from afar).
Also tonal are the roses and assorted other florals on the four burgundy-red quadrants of the England jerseys, which is why Frances hexagonal blue polka dots on white stand out, as does the Norwegian snowflake pattern that fades from red to blue, giving their home jersey an Empire-waist effect and uniting the shorts and top.
By athlete request Chile, Nigeria, South Africa and Korea have the same pattern that the mens teams wore in the 2018 World Cup, though the fit has been customized for the women.

Cory Doctorow,"""The Gentle Author"" is the maintainer of Spitalfields Life, a blog that has featured a brilliant and moving series of essays about the history of East London; Author is also sharply critical of the plans by giant property developer Crest Nicholson to redevelop the site of a Victorian chest hospital and dig up an ancient tree called the Bethnal Green Mulberry. Gentle Author was surprised to learn that his sworn enemies at Crest Nicholson had used one of his photos of the endangered Bethnal Green Mulberry -- the very tree they were planning to kill -- in the promotional materials they were using to sell the plan, as part of a false narrative about the history of the tree, downplaying the damage their plans would do.

Then, Kevin Maguire, Company Secretary to Crest Nicholson wrote back and said, essentially, ""Sure, we'll pay you, but we demand confidentiality about this 'license fee' and you have to swear that you'll stop criticising our plan to knock down the tree whose picture we took from you without asking for permission."" So Gentle Author, who never offered confidentiality and has no intention of being bullied, published Maguire's letter and their amazing, blazing response, which includes this lovely phrase: ""You underestimate me if you think that I will permit you to gag me by making it a condition of payment."" “by accepting this payment you agree that you shall not publish or cause to be published any false, misleading, derogatory, or disparaging comments about Crest Nicholson.” You well know that I am critical of your proposed London Chest Hospital development and your attempts to secure permission to dig up the ancient Bethnal Green Mulberry, so I am unwilling to sign a document which would grant you recourse to take action against me if I were to write anything that you might choose to interpret as “false, misleading, derogatory, or disparaging.” You underestimate me if you think that I will permit you to gag me by making it a condition of payment.

"Aaron Kessler, CNN","(CNN) When a hurricane hits, people often focus too much on its category -- which only measures wind -- and not on the massive amounts of rain that accompany a storm. For days, federal and state emergency managers cautioned that Hurricane Florence's danger was primarily about rainfall and catastrophic flooding, as rivers overflowed throughout the Carolinas and into Virginia. Especially now that pockets of sunshine have broken out, and the rain is gone, it's easy to think the worst is over. But take a look: the map below shows gauges monitored by the National Weather Service that measure where rivers were flooding on Saturday, a day after Florence made landfall in North Carolina. That might not look too bad, all things considered, right? But take a look at how many more flooding events were recorded by Sunday night. And finally, here is what things looked like along the rivers as of Tuesday afternoon. Four days after Florence made landfall, 45 gauges now measure flooding along rivers throughout the region. And there could be more challenges ahead -- the Cape Fear River in North Carolina may not crest until later Tuesday or even Wednesday, where it could reach an estimated 61.5 feet near Fayetteville. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster warned residents that the waters hadn't crested there either in many areas. He said with the wind and rain gone, the state's emergency resources are being marshaled to combat river flooding. ""We've had two threats. One is the hurricane with the wind and the water and the surge, and that part is over,"" McMaster said. ""But the second part, which has been predicted with great certainty, is the flooding, and we know it's coming.""

Jerry Hildenbrand,"Audio and science All headphones are ""noise canceling"" on some level because they block outside sounds by covering your ears. But even the heaviest and tightest pair of headphones can't block all outside noise, such as an airplane engine, so companies like Bose and others have turned to science to tackle the problem. Sound travels in waves, and that's not just a random term applied to them. They have crests and valleys, just like a wave in the ocean, and the larger the distance between the top of a crest and the bottom of a wave (the amplitude) determines the loudness. The distance between each crest (or each valley) determines the frequency, and a higher frequency means a higher pitch. These seemingly arbitrary measurements are actually fairly easy for a microprocessor to measure with a high degree of accuracy. Inside a pair of noise-canceling headphones, you'll find a microphone array whose only job is to measure the noise and build the waveform while there is no music or other audio playing through them. A microprocessor recreates this waveform — which should have the exact same properties as the original — so it can be played back through the headphones. If everything stopped here, you would only hear the same noise being played back at whatever volume you have your headphones set to. But this is where the important stuff is done, and a process known as destructive interference is employed. The sound wave that the headphones build from the original audio is played 180-degrees out of phase with the original. The crests of the original wave are perfectly aligned with the valleys of the rebuilt copy, which brings the total amplitude back to zero, or no sound. This is actual science. The peak of a crest is the sound wave's compression, the low point of a valley is its rarefaction. When both are the same measurement away from the median point, and you subtract the rarefaction from the compression, the total amplitude is zero. A zero amplitude signal is a flat line that would make no sound at all. Active noise cancellation can never be perfect, but it can get very close. Because of this, you can notice a soft whine or buzz coming from a set of headphones with noise cancellation enabled when you have no other audio playing, but more often than not it's of such low volume you hardly notice. And because of the destructive interference happening, any part of the audio you want to hear that matches the waveform exactly will be affected and altered. Again, this is usually so little of an effect most people never notice it. The last thing to know is that you need to provide adequate power for any of this to happen, and as the battery in any pair of headphones with ANC drains, the effect can't be applied as well. Just keep your headphones charged, and even if you end up with a seat on the row with the wing, your next plane ride can be filled with peace and quiet. This post may contain affiliate links.

RORY SMITH,"I was surprised, he said. I dont know anyone in Bari. I have barely ever been there.
More surprising still, however, is that De Laurentiis eventually said yes. Napoli and Bari are, strictly speaking, rivals, but suddenly the same family owned them: the older De Laurentiis in charge of the former, and his son, Luigi, given control of the latter.
It was not, needless to say, a universally popular move. Though Baris fans were broadly welcoming They saw we were serious people, Aurelio De Laurentiis said there was dissent in Naples. Get out of our city, read one banner, slung from railings in the city the night the Bari purchase was announced.
De Laurentiis insists that owning another team will not draw his focus from his first love. Napoli is Napoli, Bari is Bari, he said. His son, meanwhile, is adamant that the expertise he and his father have gleaned on the Tyrrhenian coast now can be applied on the Adriatic.
We started from zero, Luigi said of Bari. We had to create the brand, starting with a new crest, and then do all of the things necessary for a team: a season-ticket campaign, a website, the marketing, the social media, the jerseys, finding sponsors.
The rationale, the younger De Laurentiis said, is obvious. Bari has a national appeal; we are the only team in our division being broadcast nationally, he said, the result of a partnership with the streaming service DAZN. Apulia itself has seen a boom in tourism in recent years; the opportunity, the younger De Laurentiis said, was too good to ignore.
The plan, needless to say, is to restore Bari to the top flight, even if that would create a battle with the games authorities over whether two teams in the same competition can have the same ownership.
Bari is a recognizable brand, Luigi said. It is not Frosinone. It has played in Serie A. It has a long list of famous former players.
It is not the sort of team, in other words, that Aurelio De Laurentiis would denounce as a sparring partner, a club whose only purpose is to pad out the standings and to pick up a paycheck. De Laurentiis might compulsively court controversy. He might prod and poke and provoke his rivals, and soccers authorities. He might do it all in the name of entertainment. He is, though, as good as his word. Bari is putting his money where his mouth is. He thinks soccer needs to change. So he is trying to change it.",The Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis is pressing for changes that would punish teams that he feels don’t take their responsibilities seriously.,2019-01-21T07:00:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","On Soccer: Film in His Blood, a Soccer Revolution in His Plans",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/sports/napoli-aurelio-de-laurentiis.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/sports/21onsoccer1-print/00onsoccer-delaurentiis-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even if there werent countless movies, poems, art, spoken lore and books about Harlem, you could visit it today and still feel a lingering sense of that history, despite the gentrification tsunami that has washed over all of New York City.
But what you could not do is see Harlem the way photographer James Van Der Zee saw Harlem.

A new exhibition, scheduled to take place from March 7 to April 27 at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, features Van Der Zees photographs from the 1920s through the 1950s, and illustrates this signature style in a powerfully understated way. In photo after photo, his human subjects are buoyed by their inanimate backdrop. And in the unpeopled photos, with just a storefront or restaurant facade, the windows and signs appear to be longing for human contact. Van Der Zee renders a certain reverence for the living community that makes the shops and churches and stores central to its livelihood.

Black-and-white photographs often evoke a particular era, but taken by a black photographer less than 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, of a place where black Americans could strive and thrive, these photos become a coat of arms: a visual symbol that represents the achievements of a most regal family, replete with the uniformed cavalry, the shield of the church, the motto of salvation and the crest of the horizon.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, which is bearing the brunt of Florence’s deadly deluge and where rivers are still rising while thousands of homes and roadways remain submerged. Trump’s trip to the state follows criticism for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000 in the U.S. territory. Trump plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina at about 10:30 a.m. local time and return to Washington D.C. at 6:15 p.m., according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), quadrupling its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way”. Florence has already killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina where local media reported that two mental health patients drowned on Tuesday when the sheriff’s van the women were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned about 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of interstates 40 and 95. In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised”.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, where thousands of homes and roadways remain underwater and swollen rivers threaten more flooding less than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Trump, who has been criticized for his response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, at about 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) and return to Washington at 6:15 p.m. (2215 GMT), according to the White House.

One person was killed in Virginia by a tornado that spun off from Florence. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday.

As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad. In addition to the deaths, Maria devastated the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, whose 3 million citizens are Americans but do not vote in presidential elections, and left much of the island without power for months. Critics said the Trump administration was slow to recognize the extent of the damage and slow to help.

Sean Collins Walsh,"Built in 1969 and designed to withstand a 50-year storm, the two-lane causeway in Kingsland that succumbed to a raging Llano River was the third Central Texas bridge to be destroyed by floodwaters in recent years. Experts say it likely won't be the last as climate change and construction exacerbate the natural factors that led meteorologists to name the Hill Country ""flash flood alley."" With more than 53,000 bridges, Texas has more than any other state, and many were built in the mid-20th century based on federal weather data from the 1950s. Intense rain events are now more common, and rapid exurban development has created more impervious cover, leading to more runoff. ""It's inevitable that we will see more major bridge damage in the future, likely sooner rather than later,"" said Bruce Melton, an Austin-based civil engineer and founder of the nonprofit Climate Change Now Initiative. ""The 100-year storm is now the 25-year storm in Austin. PHOTOS: Major flooding throughout Central Texas on Tuesday"" The river crested at 39.9 feet Tuesday in the city of Llano, the closest flood gauge upstream from Kingsland, according to the National Weather Service. That was the highest flood level recorded in Llano since the record-setting 1935 mark of 41.5 feet. Most bridges on Texas Department of Transportation-constructed roads are built to withstand 25- or 50-year storms, while interstate highways are designed to withstand 100-year storms, said Travis Attanasio, a civil engineer in the Fort Worth area and an officer with the American Society of Civil Engineers. Some large Texas cities in recent years have started requiring bridges to be designed to withstand 100-year floods. A 100-year storm is a rain event that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year based on federal weather data. Those data, however, are being re-evaluated to reflect higher rainfall totals in recent years. Texas, for instance, has seen 500-year floods in each of the last three years. TxDOT spokesman Chris Bishop said the RM 2900 bridge was built with the assumption that the water levels in the Kingsland area, where the Colorado and Llano rivers meet at the top of Lake LBJ, are expected to stay stable. ""That section is considered to be for the most part a constant-level lake, so it’s not expected to do this. It normally would handle that, and it has for 50 years,"" Bishop said. TxDOT will not be able to estimate the reconstruction cost until after its inspectors evaluate the damage, Bishop said. Replacing a bridge of that type and size typically costs about $20 million, Attanasio said. In 2015, the deadly Memorial Day weekend flooding along the Blanco River destroyed two bridges between Blanco and Wimberley. As the state took a year to rebuild them, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a temporary span for the Fischer Store Road Bridge upstream from Wimberley. Austin bridges The city of Austin maintains six bridges over Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake, including the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and the Pleasant Valley Road bridge at Longhorn Dam. Most of those bridges are at or near the 100-year flood plain, said Pirouz Moin, interim city engineer. Redbud Trail downstream from Tom Miller Dam at Lake Austin is one of the bridges in the 100-year plain, but it is slated to be replaced if voters approve a $160 million transportation bond on Nov. 6. The city also is updating its flood plain maps, which could place several city bridges under the specification. Moin said new bridges are built to withstand 100-year floods. However, it is impossible for many of Austin’s roughly 1,700 bridges to be built at that height because they are in low-lying areas and could not serve roads that feed into them or provide access to surrounding properties. Requiem for a causeway The opening of the RM 2900 bridge came during a golden age for Kingsland, as the tiny town saw a population boom and a series of major construction and transportation projects. Local merchants bought a newspaper ad encouraging residents from nearby Sunrise Beach, Sandy Harbor and Blue Lake Estates to ""cross the bridge and save in Kingsland,” according to Highland Lakes Weekly. The unincorporated city now has about 6,000 residents and is home to the Antlers Hotel, where 1973's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was filmed. The bridge has become a vital connection between the town and smaller communities on the other side of the Llano River. Each day about 5,600 drivers use that stretch of RM 2900, according to TxDOT traffic estimates. Although video of the bridge breaking apart seems to show that the flood's wall of water simply overpowered it on Tuesday, Attanasio said the bridge likely met its end because of debris that accumulated underneath it. ""More than likely it was some kind of debris that hit the support columns, whether it be a large tree or a boat that broke away,"" he said. ""Weird stuff washes down the creek when it rains.""

These everyday backdrops are just a few of the locations viewers can see today's most popular rockets thanks to a new YouTube video designed to provide a sense of scale to the vehicles of aluminum and carbon that vault satellites, experiments and humans to orbit. Tim Dodd, also known by his online persona as the Everyday Astronaut, created the ethereal video in partnership with artists Oli Braun and Matthew Nayman, who helped with renderings of the rockets. Dodd creates videos and photos as part of his mission to ""bring space down to Earth for everyday people."" ""It's really hard for people to grasp just how big rockets are,"" Dodd told Florida Today. ""Hopefully there's something in this video that you've seen with your own eyes. Maybe it's a Walmart, or maybe it's the Arc de Triomphe (France) – hopefully something in it you've seen with your own eyes so you have a sense of scale."" Indeed, the video that's clocked thousands of views so far features SpaceX's massively popular, 230-foot-tall Falcon Heavy rocket in New York City and in front of a Walmart; United Launch Alliance's 236-foot-tall Delta IV Heavy in India; an evolved version of NASA's upcoming Space Launch System (384 feet) next to the Brooklyn Bridge; and SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket (about 350 feet) in a field with Dodd standing next to it, to name a few. ""It's very humbling to realize how hard it is to get off our planet and how much brilliant engineering and mechanics goes into spaceflight,"" he said. Dodd, 33, was inspired to become the Everyday Astronaut in April 2014 when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral on a mission with supplies for the International Space Station. A bright orange Russian flight suit he purchased a year earlier as a joke suddenly became the center of his new online personality – Dodd dons the suit for all his videos. ""I'm happy,"" he said in mid-2017, just the Everyday Astronaut persona was starting to take off. Since then, his YouTube videos alone have generated millions of views and his channel has more than 100,000 subscribers. ""I'm going to keep doing this until I either run out of ideas or run out of energy, and so far, I'm still going,"" he said. Follow Dodd on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube at @EverydayAstronaut.

Philip Elliott,"The “blue wave” took a little longer to crest than usual, but after several days of vote counting it looks like Democrats beat the historical average for the midterm elections. With more races called since Election Night, Democrats have netted 30 seats in the House and are leading in five others. On average, the midterms mean the White House, on average in all 25 non-presidential cycles in the last century, loses 29 allies in the House. It appears House Democrats are just past that benchmark, outpacing the gains of at least 12 other midterm election cycles since 1918. Typically, the party controlling the White House — in this case, Republicans — loses seats in midterm elections. In the last hundred years, only three times has the party in the White House seen gains in non-presidential years. It wasn’t just the the House. Democrats picked up at least seven governors’ offices. The Senate map remains contingent on incredibly close races in Arizona and Florida; Democrats appear to have an advantage in Arizona, while Republicans in Florida have the advantage for now. Mississippi, which backed Donald Trump’s presidential bid in 2016 with 58% of the vote, won’t pick its Senator until a Nov. 27 runoff. All of which is to say: There was a resettling of America’s politics this week. Voters in large numbers — 52 million and counting — decided House Democrats were the right roadblocks for Trump and said a record 100 women should be part of that mix. Voters booted Republicans from governors’ mansions in Michigan and Wisconsin, and held it in Pennsylvania, three states that were crucial for Trump’s 2016 win and his 2020 re-election bid. And the Senate, which began with Democrats facing a terrible uphill climb, is likely to fight to a draw. Democratic activists and strategists are still debating — some, quite aggressively and publicly — what fueled their successes. All corners of the still-fractured Democratic Party were trying to claim credit, and there’s plenty of reason for each tribe to celebrate. Even so, the fight for credit suggests the silent 2020 presidential primary is already underway. Still, the midterms were among the most divisive in recent memory. One Trump ad — deemed too racially charged by several networks to air — suggested Democrats were inviting hordes of immigrants into the country illegally to commit crimes against Americans, including police officers. Another, from a House incumbent in California, linked a former official in Barack Obama’s White House to the Muslim Brotherhood. Robocalls into some Southern states appealed to racism in messages against African-American candidates. They were also the most costly ever. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates the still-being-invoiced 2018 midterms cost a record $5.2 billion, a 35% increase over the last non-presidential federal cycle. Outside spending from groups like super PACs topped $1.3 billion. And Trump, as he was leaving Friday for a quick weekend in Europe to attend a World War I memorial, suggested much of the process was rigged and Democrats had won only through shadiness. “There’s a lot of bad stuff going on in this country, and we’re finding out, and I’m getting to the bottom of it. And I’ve done a hell of a job,” he said, offering no evidence for his assertions. During the flight to Europe, Trump repeatedly tweeted baseless claims that the Florida vote counting was “election theft” and “potential corruption.” “How come they never find Republican votes?” he tweeted. All of which could render Washington a morass for the next two years. Democrats are working out who will lead them, with Nancy Pelosi returning to the speaker’s role for the first time since 2011 and other leadership roles going to potential future speakers. Republicans appears to be retrenching, now more Trumpy than ever. And yet, people from both parties in the Capitol would do well to dig into the numbers behind this week’s blue wave. Democrats had history on their side, and they did even better than the norm. Republicans were at a disadvantage, particularly because they could never keep focus on the growing economy because the president kept hijacking the national conversation. And voters — in record numbers — decided they wanted to be part of the political process.

Jennifer Kutz,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the National Trail System, which oversees more than 50,000 miles of trails across the U.S., and makes sure historic sites like the Pacific Crest Trail are around for years to come. One of the most magical parts of traipsing around the wilderness is the chance to see local fauna: catching a glimpse of a hawk circling a field, floating by a beaver dam on your kayak, or spotting a baby deer in your hometown park. You can use Google Images to learn more about the wildlife you encounter while hiking: to find out if what you just saw was *really* a coyote, or if that spider whose web you demolished is as scary as it looks. Over the past year, Google image searches for animals have approximately doubled. We took a look at Google Images trends to find some of the most uniquely searched animals (and bugs!) in each U.S. state. Take a look to find out where you should travel to spy an orca whale, and where to *avoid* if you never want to see a leopard shark in real life.

ROGER COHEN,"That Netanyahu is facing indictment on bribery and other charges proved no obstacle to Likud increasing its seats to 35 from 30 in 2015. In the near term, Israeli politics and its democracy will hinge on Netanyahus attempts to secure immunity from prosecution while in office. He may make acquiescence to such legislation a condition for coalition partners joining the government. It will not be pretty.
We could see a coup détat against democracy, something very dangerous, Tom Segev, a prominent historian, told me.
For now, Israelis seem prepared to shrug. The not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper conclusion to the Mueller report reinforced a feeling that the cloud of corruption that has hung around Netanyahu for years should not be taken as proof of it.
In the longer term, Israeli politics will turn to the question of annexation. At the last minute, to shore up the right, Netanyahu promised to start annexing the West Bank if he won another term. The United Right and other extreme parties will not let him forget it.
Still, there is no reason to take Netanyahu at his word. He made himself kosher with the Obama administration through his Bar Ilan speech of a decade ago supporting a Palestinian state, only to do nothing to favor one and everything to block one.
Annexation could see the same fate because its problematic. Netanyahu is happiest in the gray zone where Israel controls millions of Palestinians without having to confront the question of whether they vote or are granted Israeli citizenship. He does not want to jeopardize good relations with Egypt and the Saudis. Hes quite happy with a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank that once saw itself in the role of leading the way to a Palestinian state but has become the feeble enabler of Israels gray-zone domination.
Netanyahus annexation decision may hinge in the end on the long-incubated Trump plan for Israel-Palestine. Its said to exist. Maybe it really does. God knows. The fact that strong pushback from the United States on partial annexation is no longer assured says it all: The rightist nationalist wave has yet to crest.

Ed Cara,"The toothpaste aisle, like so much of life, is filled with plenty of claims that seem too good to be true. One of these false promises, a recent study in Scientific Reports suggests, might be that toothpaste can stop our teeth from eroding. Researchers in Brazil and Switzerland worked together to test nine brand-name toothpastes. The toothpastes, all commonly found in Brazilian or European stores, included regional brands such as Elmex as well as those internationally sold such as Sensodyne. For five days, once a day, they doused samples of enamel taken straight from human teeth in citric acid, swished them around in toothpaste slurry and artificial saliva, and had them brushed by toothbrushes. After they were rinsed and dried, they measured how much enamel eroded off the surface. The very act of brushing our teeth with toothpaste causes enamel erosion, even as it helps prevent bacteria from building up as plaque. This erosion can eventually cause the bony tissue underneath the enamel, known as dentine, to become exposed to the open air, leading to hypersensitivity and creating the opportunity for cavities. Some toothpastes, including those found in the US and in the study, are marketed as containing ingredients or a special formation that can at least mitigate this damage or repair sensitive teeth. But by experiment’s end, the toothpastes branded as either anti-erosive or desensitizing failed to prevent erosion significantly better than the plain one (Colgate Cavity Protection) the researchers used. All the brands were fluoridated. “The test showed that some [toothpastes] caused less surface loss than others, but they all resembled the control toothpaste [for] this criterion,” said senior author Ana Cecília Corrêa Aranha, a dental researcher at University of São Paulo’s School of Dentistry, in a statement. The study isn’t the first to blow up the idea that anti-erosive toothpastes are anything special compared to the generic stuff. But Aranha’s team did find some factors that might promote better erosion protection. Toothpastes that contained tin, had higher concentrations of calcium and phosphate, or only had small particles, for instance, were associated with less surface loss. Fluoride, though having plenty of other benefits for teeth, such as helping prevent cavities and tooth decay, didn’t have any big influence on enamel erosion, contrary to what some earlier research has suggested. Ultimately, the researchers believe the findings affirm that there’s no one single step we can take to keep our teeth healthy from either bacteria or enamel loss. “Dental erosion is multifactorial. It has to do with brushing, and above all, with diet,” Aranha said, referencing research that’s long shown how acidic foods like soft drinks can speed along erosion, especially when coupled with harsh toothbrushing. “Food and drink are increasingly acidic as a result of industrial processing.” Not all hope might be lost, though, if you’re trying to find a toothpaste that can do something meaningful about erosion. In a statement made to Gizmodo, the American Dental Association said that it had awarded its first seal of acceptance for a product in the enamel erosion category last November, the Crest brand “ Pro-Health Advanced, Deep Clean Mint ” toothpaste (it was not one of the brands included in the current study). “To earn the ADA Seal of Acceptance in this category, safety and effectiveness must be demonstrated via two independent clinical studies assessing the product’s ability to prevent or reduce enamel erosion from dietary acids,” the organization said. “The ADA supports additional research on dental erosion. Patients should talk to their dentist about what dental products will work best for their specific needs,” it added. The researchers next hope to study how to better protect against erosion in real-life test subjects. In the meantime, brush gently, and use a toothbrush with bristles labeled as “soft.” [ Scientific Reports ]","The toothpaste aisle, like so much of life, is filled with plenty of claims that seem too good to be true.

Rhett Jones,"Long before Wikileaks was promoting “radical transparency” in the digital age, CounterSpy was publishing a magazine that named CIA station chiefs and exposed covert operations. Now, 23 issues from its 32-issue run have been pulled from the CIA’s own archives and digitized for your perusal. We can neither confirm nor deny that the agency is happy about this. CounterSpy started publishing from its headquarters in Washington, DC in 1973. Its staff and contributors were made up of journalists and former intelligence agents who wanted to expose the CIA and other intelligence apparatuses as corrupt organizations. It ran stories about subjects like the CIA’s efforts to undermine labor movements around the world and psychological warfare conducted under COINTELPRO. The spooks at Langley weren’t fans but were certainly readers. The article that made CounterSpy infamous ran in the Winter 1975 issue. “Chiefs of Station: Who They Are &amp; What They Do” advocated for revealing the names and assignments of CIA station chiefs. It also named about 100 chiefs in the process, including Richard Welch, who was later murdered by Marxist terrorists in Athens in December of 1975. The article became a touch point for CIA officials to criticize Philip Agee, a former agent who wrote another piece in that same issue. Both Agee and Counterspy were blamed for Welch’s death, despite the fact that Agee didn’t write the article and Welch was already exposed as an agent in 1968. Long after he stepped down as director of the CIA, George H.W. Bush continued to hold Agee responsible for Welch’s murder. Barbara Bush did the same in her 1994 memoir—until Agee sued her for libel. The claim was removed from later printings of the book. More recently, current CIA Director Mike Pompeo repeated this account while denouncing WikiLeaks and comparing their practices to Agee’s. In the process, Pompeo incorrectly claimed that Welch was named by CounterSpy as the CIA’s Athens station chief (the magazine listed him as Lima station chief). CounterSpy shut down in 1984 following infighting and a staff exodus. Before it collapsed, Agee took some of the CounterSpy team and started CovertAction Information Bulletin, which published in one form or another until 1985. In the first issue, Agee attributed the split, in part, to pressures brought on by CIA harassment of CounterSpy staff. It’s almost impossible to find old issues of CounterSpy, but the CIA likes to collect publications that are critical of its activities. And thanks to a series of executive orders modifying how classified information is handled, the agency is also required to release non-exempt historically valuable records after 25 years. Try searching the CIA’s CREST archive for CounterSpy and you’ll find about 20,000 items. Dr. Susan Maret, an academic and intelligence researcher, combed through that mess for everyone and found 23 issues which she provided to AltGov2. They’ve all been digitized for searchability and are almost entirely intact, although that most infamous issue from 1975 has been heavily redacted. Check them out here.

Jessica Conditt,"However, just a few years ago, ESPN didn't have any interest in professional gaming. Former ESPN president John Skipper made the following notorious statement about eSports in 2014: ""It's not a sport. It's a competition. Chess is a competition. Checkers is a competition. Mostly, I'm interested in doing real sports."" Soon after, Skipper received a crash course in eSports. Other ESPN executives saw its business potential -- the industry was expected to exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2018 -- and they pushed for him to take it seriously. They made their case and took Skipper to the 2015 League of Legends world finals at Madison Square Garden. As Skipper looked over a stadium packed with 11,000 screaming, hyped-up gaming fans, he saw dollar signs. ""It was great fun and interesting to me,"" Skipper told Recode in 2016. ""I saw the crowd that was there and learned that the sport mattered to those people. Those were young, predominantly male consumers, and that's what matters to us."" ""Those were young, predominantly male consumers, and that's what matters to us."" Young, male viewers are ESPN's bread and butter, and they're exactly the type of audience member dominating the eSports scene. Last year, in its first detailed report on the industry, Nielsen found 71 percent of the overall eSports audience was male, with the most engaged fans between the ages of 13 and 40. As an added bonus for ESPN specifically, these fans were into traditional sports as well. More than half of US-based respondents expressed interest in football and basketball, for instance. These viewers were also big users of social media and streaming services, often tuned into the latest apps and websites. ESPN+ slides perfectly into this market, but it doesn't offer any eSports -- yet. Skipper left ESPN in late 2017 and was replaced by Jimmy Pitaro, president of ESPN and co-chair of Disney Media Networks. ESPN's subscriber numbers had been slipping for years -- it lost 13 million between 2011 and 2017. Subscriber fees compose more than 60 percent of ESPN's revenue feed, and today the network has 88 million US subscribers, its lowest figure since 2003. But the company is still making bank off of these viewers, charging more than $7 per subscriber, the most of any cable network. That fee has risen significantly since 2003, keeping revenue up year over year, even as subscribers flee. ""We do not think of eSports as a fad."" Still, a shrinking userbase is rarely good for business, and while ESPN has dragged its feet on eSports streaming, other services have filled the void. Twitch, for one, boasts 15 million daily active users -- 81 percent of who are male, while 55 percent are between the ages of 18 and 34. Disney CEO Bob Iger noted in 2017 that an online-only ESPN streaming service would be one of the potential saving graces for the network as it attempted to secure new (mostly young and male) viewers. Pitaro, the new head of ESPN, told Engadget he's ""actively engaged in several conversations"" about eSports, a goldmine of the network's ideal viewers. ""We are going to continue to expand our investment in eSports and that includes within both the ESPN app and ESPN+,"" Pitaro said. ""We are believers in eSports and we see this as an opportunity for the ESPN business."" This is a vastly different tone than the one established by Skipper, even though his tune changed once eSports' revenue potential became impossible to ignore. For now, most of ESPN's eSports coverage exists online, rather than on TV or as part of ESPN+. The industry isn't going anywhere and ESPN now has its foot in the door -- eSports are expected to crest $2 billion in revenue by 2021, according to SuperData Research. Under Pitaro, ESPN will eventually attempt to take part of that money for itself through ESPN+. ""We do not think of eSports as a fad, we cover eSports online and we are actively looking at various options to bring that content to ESPN+,"" he said.

"Shellard, A., Szabo, A., Trepat, X., Mayor, R.","Collective cell chemotaxis, the directed migration of cell groups along gradients of soluble chemical cues, underlies various developmental and pathological processes. We use neural crest cells, a migratory embryonic stem cell population whose behavior has been likened to malignant invasion, to study collective chemotaxis in vivo. Studying Xenopus and zebrafish, we have shown that the neural crest exhibits a tensile actomyosin ring at the edge of the migratory cell group that contracts in a supracellular fashion. This contractility is polarized during collective cell chemotaxis: It is inhibited at the front but persists at the rear of the cell cluster. The differential contractility drives directed collective cell migration ex vivo and in vivo through the intercalation of rear cells. Thus, in neural crest cells, collective chemotaxis works by rear-wheel drive.",Neural crest cells migrate far and wide through a vertebrate embryo during development.

The Conversation,"Accounts by mariners of freak or rogue waves out in the ocean have long been a common occurrence but until relatively recently remained anecdotal. That is, until January 1 1995, when a huge wave was observed and recorded at the Draupner Oil platform in the North Sea.
It was one of the first reliable measurements of a freak wave in the ocean and at a height of 25.6 meters, it was over two times the height of the waves that surrounded it.
Appearing seemingly from nowhere, this seminal observation initiated many years of research into the possible causes of freak ocean waves. Various theories exist, perhaps the most simple of which is that ocean waves are random and while freak waves are rare, they are entirely predictable. Other theories have suggested that under certain conditions waves can become unstable, causing small waves to grow into much larger freak waves.
We decided to see if we could recreate this wave in the laboratory, to understand more about how freak waves happen in the first place. Clearly it is not possible to recreate waves that are 25 meters high and several hundred meters wide in a laboratory. So we reduced the scale by maintaining the same ratios of wavelength to water depth and wave height. Although our wave was 35 times smaller than the actual Draupner wave, the same physical processes dictated the behavior of the waves we produced.
The height of ocean waves is limited when waves break. When we tried to recreate the wave measured at the Draupner platform by creating ones that travelled in the same direction, they broke about two meters before reaching the scaled height of the wave we wanted.

We then attempted to recreate the wave by making two smaller wave groups that crossed at an angle of 120 degrees. We found that it was possible to recreate the full scaled amplitude of the original Draupner measurement. The height of waves produced under these conditions is not limited by breaking in the same way.

In general, wave breaking occurs when the fluid in the crest of a wave travels faster than the crest of the wave. This causes the fluid to overtake the crest and the wave to break. For non-crossing waves, large horizontal velocities are generated and this can result in plunging wave breaking. When this type of breaking occurs, a jet of water emanates horizontally from the crest of the wave as illustrated by the sequence of images below (top row):
CrossCompSequence.
When waves cross, much of this horizontal motion is cancelled out and this type of plunging wave breaking no longer happens. Instead, wave breaking happens in mainly upward jet-like behavior (see images above (bottom row).
Critically, this type of crossing breaking doesnt seem to limit the height of waves in the same way as plunging breaking, and this allowed us to reproduce the full scaled height of the Draupner wave under crossing conditions.
The nature of waves
Our findings not only shed light on how the famous Draupner wave may have occurred, but also on the nature and significance of wave breaking in crossing sea conditions. This suggests previously unobserved wave breaking patterns, which differs significantly from our current understanding of what happens in the oceans.
In addition to a better understating of potential freak wave formation, the ability to accurately predict the onset of wave breaking is crucial to accounting for its effect on various other phenomena.
Wave breaking is one of the main mechanisms for the dissipation of energy in the oceans, and is crucial to accurate forecasting. The creation of sea spray and entrainment of air (bubbles of air trapped in the wave) by breaking waves affects the mix of the atmosphere and the flux of heat between air and sea, which in turn affects many geophysical processes and their accurate modeling.

To our amusement, the wave we created bore an uncanny resemblance to The Great Wave off Kanagawa often referred to as as Hokusais Wave a woodblock print published in the early 1800s by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.
The print depicts an enormous wave that towers over fishing boats. Although this similarity is completely unintentional, studies suggest that the wave depicted was most likely a freak wave, and that its shape and structure indicate that it may also have occurred under crossing conditions. Therefore, the likeness to our wave may not have been entirely coincidental after all.

Best Life,"In yet another break with tradition, the queen did not present Meghan's father with his own coat of arms as she did with Michael Middleton when Kate married into the royal family. Not exactly a surprise since given Thomas was a no-show at the wedding and embarrassed everyone—especially his daughter—with the paparazzi scandal. (And then there's his questionable friendship with TMZ.) Instead, she opted to present Meghan with her own coat of arms, something Diana, Sophie, Countess of Wessex ( Prince Edward's wife) or Kate didn't get when they married into the family. The crest artfully combines Meghan's California roots and her new status as Prince Harry's wife. A statement from the Palace described the design this way: ""The blue background of the shield represents the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, while the two golden rays across the shield are symbolic of the sunshine of The Duchess's home state. The three quills represent communication and the power of words. Beneath the shield on the grass sits a collection of golden poppies, California's state flower, and wintersweet, which grows at Kensington Palace."" The coat of arms was approved by the queen and Thomas Woodcock, the Garter King of Arms and Senior Herald in England, who is based at the College of Arms in London. Meghan, of course, had input into its design.

RORY SMITH,"He gave up his season ticket a few years ago; coping with the match day crowds at the Hawthorns was too much. But he still goes to the stadium, only now it is when the stands are quiet and the field is empty. Along with Heather, Steve has come every Wednesday for the last six weeks as part of a program, run for five years by West Brom’s foundation, called Albion Memories. Each group consists of a handful of West Brom fans, all of them suffering from some form of dementia, as well as some partners and caregivers. One or two wear West Brom scarves, gently draping them over their chairs, or knitted hats embroidered with the club’s crest. They come to meet and to talk — “to get out of the house,” as Heather put it. But mainly, they come to remember. “We want to energize their memories, to get them talking again,” said Paul Glover, the foundation’s head of disability. The best way to do that, he believes, is through soccer, through West Brom, tapping into the vast reservoir of memories built up through a lifetime of being a fan, its hold so strong that it remains untouched even as dementia starts to take a toll in other ways. “Their memory is often very good, even if they cannot recall what they had for dinner last night,” said Jan Liddell, a senior health care support worker at Edward Street mental health hospital. All of the members of the group are patients at Edward Street; all have expressed an interest in soccer, and all, as part of their treatment, have been offered the chance to join the Albion Memories program. “With memory, there is an element of use it or lose it,” Liddell said. They come here to use it. Photo West Brom holds the sessions in a suite at its stadium, with the belief that even the view of the field where fans used to watch games can serve as a memory aid. “This disease strikes at the heart of identity,” one mental health expert said. “It can lead to a fractured sense of who you are.” Credit José Sarmento Matos for The New York Times The format is simple. The participants sit in a semicircle in a stadium lounge, gazing through a picture window at the field — the view itself is an aide-mémoire, Liddell said — while John Homer, the head of West Brom’s supporters’ club and a walking encyclopedia of the Black Country, as this part of England is known, interviews a player. Some interview subjects are drawn from the current squad, though Glover says the former stars get the best reactions: not just because of West Brom’s current struggles, but because those are the names and the faces that the aging members of the group — Griffiths, now 61, is among the youngest — remember. A few weeks ago, the guests were Graham Lovett and Graham Williams, veterans of the West Brom team that won the 1968 F.A. Cup, and the club’s former striker Micky Fudge. All three, at Homer’s gentle insistence, cycled through their memories of their playing days, telling stories, cracking jokes, amiably mocking one another. When Lovett lost the thread on one anecdote, Williams suggested with a smile that perhaps he should be in the audience, not on the stage. Skillfully, Homer seizes on every little story to spark something in the group. He asks where the players used to drink, and asks those listening if they remember the pub, if they know where it is. He mentions cafes and ice cream parlors, some long since closed, and cars that have not been on the road for decades. At one point, he breaks into an impromptu chorus of “ Wonderful Copenhagen,” from the 1952 musical film “Hans Christian Andersen.” A few of the guests take up the tune. They remember the lyrics perfectly.

JON PARELES,"LUCY ROSE This singer dared to perform quietly at SXSW, radiating solace and benevolence in her gauzy, luminous voice. She’s an English songwriter who gained some American listeners with choruses for the rapper Logic. She sang about regretful leave-takings and the possibilities of tender reunions over undulating piano chords or unobtrusive guitar; there were echoes of Feist and Joni Mitchell, but she had her own melodic grace. BALÚN Latin rock remains wide open to ideas not limited by national origin. Balún, a band from Puerto Rico, sometimes used a reggaeton beat, but it was also ready to layer on deep electronic bass tones, the quick strumming of the small Andean guitar called a charango, pealing rock guitars and ethereal soprano vocals, adding up to songs full of positive aspirations. Photo Tim Darcy of Ought at Barracuda on Thursday. Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times OUGHT The post-punk band Ought, from Montreal, won’t be pinned down from song to song. It can be melodic, singing about something like romance; it can seethe with frustration; it can switch to jagged, stop-start dissonances. And it can find its way toward ranting affirmation: “I’m no longer afraid to die,” it declared in “Beautiful Blue Sky.” Whatever the idiom, it sounds as if the band means it. Photo The Weather Station at St. David’s Historic Sanctuary on Wednesday. Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times THE WEATHER STATION Both serenity and storminess infuse the songs that Tamara Lindeman, from Toronto, writes as the Weather Station. Her band’s folk-rock is steeped in Joni Mitchell and Fairport Convention, weighing the textures of interwoven guitars; her lyrics reveal her interior monologues with a literary, lived-in sense of detail, often pondering the ways a couple’s lives can grow together and apart: “An ambulance passed on the street, and you took my arm reflexively,” she sang in “Thirty.” Photo Dermot Kennedy at Palm Door on Thursday. Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times DERMOT KENNEDY Angels, demons, ghosts, memories and all the dimensions of love haunt the Irish songwriter Dermot Kennedy. He has a grainy, melancholy voice that can crest with a howling rasp; he’s an acknowledged fan of David Gray. Onstage at SXSW, his songs revealed their folky structures, built on guitar or piano. But they also harnessed the dynamics of electronic dance music, with drumbeats sputtering into double time and choruses that exploded into his howl. The valley-and-peak production makes his songs more suitable to current radio, though it may be a Faustian bargain: W ill the tracks sound dated in a few years? Photo Jackie Mendoza at the Sidewinder on Wednesday. Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times JACKIE MENDOZA A member of the band Gingerlys, Jackie Mendoza backed herself for this show with her own laptop tracks. They were dense concoctions that changed radically from song to song, touching down at times in dance beats before drifting into more abstract zones, and then getting reeled back by her straightforward vocal lines, with lyrics in English and Spanish. JADE BIRD Jealousy and separation sparked song after song in a showcase set by Jade Bird; she even had a pre-emptive breakup song: “Knew we had to stop before we started/to torture each other,” she rattled off in “Cathedral.” She’s an English songwriter with a country-rock streak and a furious rasp when she gets riled, which was fairly often in the songs she unveiled: “Baby thanks for leaving me/Happy anniversary,” she snarled.

Des Moines Register Flood waters spill over Four Mile Creek on Sunday, July 1, 2018 after flash flooding Saturday night in Des Moines. (Photo: Brian Powers, Rodney White/The Register) Buy Photo Though emergency officials expected a storm in Des Moines on Saturday, the sheer strength of it took people by surprise, according to a news conference on Sunday. ""It’s hard to predict how that water is going to rise and how quickly it’s going to come,"" said Sgt. Paul Parizek, spokesman for Des Moines police. ""The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise."" For the near future, the heavy rain has ended across central Iowa, according to Kelsey Angle, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines. Between 3 to 8 inches of rain fell rapidly across the Des Moines metro Saturday, contributing to ""catastrophic flooding,"" Angle said. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street recorded the highest crest on record just over 19 feet, Angle said. Take a look from above as water spills over the banks of Walnut Creek in Windsor Heights. Rodney White and Michael Zamora, The Register The Saylorville Lake reservoir is forecast to crest at about 888 feet by next weekend — a depth that is above the lip of the concrete emergency spillway, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday. On Sunday, 20,500 cubic square feet was flowing out. ""We are not anticipating a flood release that is uncontrolled out of Saylorville,"" said Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie. Much of the Des Moines area got 6 to 7 inches of rain in less than three hours Saturday, and the flash flooding resulted in one death, rescues of people stranded in their vehicles, apartment evacuations and a house explosion in Urbandale. At least 100 people have been displaced, according to the American Red Cross. As of 9 a.m. on Sunday, the Saylorville Lake reservoir stands at 878.39 feet, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. It increased over 2 feet in the last 24 hours. Saylorville Lake reached 866.6 feet above sea level Tuesday afternoon, an increase of more than 15 feet in just five days. The top of the dam's spillway is at 884 feet; that figure can be increased to 890 feet with the use of pneumatic crest gates. When in use, the inflatable pneumatic crest gate pushes water back from the lake's spillway dam and allows engineers to keep channeling it through the dam's main gates. This helps control erosion on the spillway. Last Slide Next Slide Saylorville Lake hit a historic high level on July 11, 1993, when it crested at 892 feet above sea level. On June 12, 2008, the lake level rose to 891 feet above sea level. The most heavily damaged areas in the Des Moines area are along Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek in the metro, said A.J. Mumm, Polk County Emergency Management Director. The worst flooding damages are along the Fourmile Creek from East Douglas Avenue all the way to Pleasant Hill, until it meets the Des Moines River. Damage is along Walnut Creek through Urbandale, Clive, Windsor Heights and Des Moines. Walnut Creek flooded at record levels during Saturday's deluge. A little east of Clive, the creek at 63rd Street in Des Moines set a record when it crested at 11:45 p.m. at 19.08 feet. The previous high was 18.7 in 2015. ""We've seen truly historic crests on both of the waterways,"" Mumm said. Fleur Drive in Des Moines appears to be safe as of Sunday morning, but residents in the eastern side of town should use caution near the Fourmile Creek area, where numerous buildings were evacuated Sunday because of record flooding, said Chad Christensen, Des Moines Public Works flood systems engineer. How to deal with a flooded home: The latest forecast from the National Weather Service in Des Moines shows the Raccoon River cresting at 16.5 feet near Fleur Drive — just on the brink of when water comes on to the road. If no additional rain hits the metro, the road will not have to close, Christensen said. Public works is focusing its attention along the Fourmile Creek area, which was hit with 6 to 10 inches of rain along its base, Christensen said. Drivers are advised to stay away. Road damage has been reported along Second Avenue, where water peeled and displaced the asphalt. Birdland Drive and Prospect Road are also closed. The city closed the gate that’s a part of the Birdland levee across from Saylor Road as a precaution. It’s been all-hands-on-deck in the public works department as crews survey and fix damages since 8 p.m. Saturday, Christensen told the Register.

Officials also rescued residents from buildings in Clive, Elkhart, Johnston, Grimes, Pleasant Hill and Urbandale. Des Moines reported two structural collapses. Evacuations occurred at Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park in Pleasant Hill and Parkside East Apartments in Des Moines. Transportation: Multiple roads are closed across the metro. Drivers will also find abandoned and flooded vehicles on roads across the metro Sunday. Some tow companies are reporting a three-day wait to clear all vehicles. The overhead floodgate at 63rd Street and Grand Avenue has been closed. Many Des Moines Area Regional Transportation routes are on temporary detours due to flooding. Routes will return to normal as roads reopen throughout the day. Expect delays and call 283-8100 with questions. Fourmile Creek on Des Moines' east side reached a record breaking 17.47 feet on Sunday morning, July 1, 2018, after heavy rain overnight. Wochit Shelters: Residents impacted by flooding can seek shelter at the Urbandale, West Des Moines, Elkhart and Clive fire departments. Tenants at the Parkside East Apartments at 3560 East Douglas Ave. were evacuated and moved to a neighboring apartment complex. Hospitals/medical care: Residents at the UnityPoint Taylor House Hospice at 3401 E. Douglas Ave. were evacuated due to flooding at Fourmile Creek. Residents who required power for medical devices needed assistance.

Nathaniel Meyersohn,"The consumer products giant and activist investor Nelson Peltz agreed to end what is believed to be the costliest battle for boardroom control in corporate America's history. Although Peltz ultimately lost the vote for the seat in a nailbiter, P&amp;G appointed him to the board starting March 1. Peltz declined to comment for this story, but his investment firm's scathing September report on P&amp;G's struggles offers clues that he could pursue a price-chipping strategy once he's on the inside. In the report, Peltz's Trian Management Group said P&amp;G's ""greatest"" challenge is declining market share. The culprit: P&amp;G products were marked up an average of 50% over the cost to make them, Trian found. Related: Gillette unveils new, cheaper razors to keep Dollar Shave at bay Analysts believe P&amp;G will experiment with reduced prices and introduce cheap new products to win back customers. Raymond James' Joseph Altobello points to Tide Simply, a cheaper version of Tide that rolled out in 2013, as a past example of P&amp;G targeting the lower end. Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj expects P&amp;G to ramp up this strategy to reach cost-conscious shoppers. He believes P&amp;G will try to stop the bleeding by giving customers more free samples with the hope they'll buy full-priced items later on. P&amp;G makes most of the essentials below your sink, in your laundry room and inside your medicine chest -- Tide, Bounty, Charmin, Crest, Gillette, Swiffer, Pampers, Old Spice, Olay and Tampax. ""Laundry, diapers and‎ razors are the categories P&amp;G can't afford to lose share in,"" Dibadj said. P&amp;G already started lowering prices on one of its most important products. During its fight against Peltz, P&amp;G slashed Gillette prices and introduced new disposable razors. P&amp;G had focused most of its attention on more expensive Gillette razors in recent years, allowing cheaper subscription services Dollar Shave Club, Harry's and ShaveLogic to gain a foothold. Gillette's command of the razor market fell by 11 percentage points over the past two years. It now controls around 56% of the market. ""It took its eye off the ball,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. Related: The battle for the future of Tide Despite its ubiquity and $65 billion in sales last year, the 180-year-old P&amp;G has been stuck in a slump. Once one of the most widely held stocks in America, Procter &amp; Gamble ( PG ) shares have flatlined over the past three years even as the Dow has gained nearly 40%. Revenue has fallen in key product areas. Americans have been spending less on household goods over the last few quarters even though consumer confidence is at a 17-year high. Peltz argued he had the track record to help P&amp;G get back on track, having led successful turnarounds at companies such as Heinz, Wendy's, Mondelez and Snapple. Now that Peltz has a seat at the table, expect a flurry of activity in 2018 from this old behemoth.

Jeff Mason,"HAVELOCK/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday promised that North and South Carolina would have strong federal support as they recovered from the devastation of Hurricane Florence, whose floodwaters continue to threaten the region. “We’re going to be there 100 percent,” Trump told officials at a briefing shortly after arriving at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina. “... There will be nothing left undone. You’ll have everything you need.” Trump, who has been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, also thanked first responders for their work since Florence made landfall on Friday and recapped the efforts to get food to residents and restore power. He was accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long, Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott of South Carolina. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina because of Florence, which came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. Although the storm is long gone, river flooding still poses a danger to the area. The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 near the Fort Bragg army base in the southern part of the state, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way.” Florence has killed at least 36 people, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Two of the South Carolina victims were mental health patients who drowned on Tuesday when a van carrying them was swept away by floodwater. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad. Maria also devastated the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, whose 3 million citizens are Americans but do not vote in presidential elections, and left much of the island without power for months. Critics said the Trump administration was slow to recognize the extent of the damage and slow to help. Former basketball star Michael Jordan, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, and the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association, donated $2 million to the Florence recovery effort, the team said.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence drenched North Carolina with more downpours on Sunday, cutting off the coastal city of Wilmington, damaging tens of thousands of homes and threatening worse flooding as rivers fill to the bursting point. The death toll rose to at least 16. Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on parts of North Carolina since Thursday, and continued to produce widespread heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the National Weather Service said. “The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference. Many rivers “are still rising, and are not expected to crest until later today or tomorrow.” Some rivers were not expected to crest until Monday or Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said. South Carolina’s governor issued a similar warning, urging anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate. “Those rivers in North Carolina that have received heavy rainfall are coming our way,” Governor Henry McMaster said during a news conference. “They have not even begun (to crest). But they will. And the question is how high will the water be, and we do not know.” The storm killed at least 10 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator. Officials urged those who had evacuated to stay away. “Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home, but you can’t come yet.” In New Bern, a riverfront city near North Carolina’s coast, the storm tore away porch steps, splintered balconies and sent a yacht plowing into a garage that shattered like kindling. Anne Francis Coronado came back on Sunday to inspect the damage with her husband. “There’s mud all over the floor and the wood floors have buckled,” she said, adding they planned to return to her brother’s house because of the musty smell that pervades their home. “We’ve been through hurricanes here but we’ve never had it come anywhere close to this,” she said. On a flooded road near New Bern, Bryan Moore and his nephew Logan decided to go swimming in the floodwaters after having spent days at home without electricity or running water. “We were stir-crazy from being inside so long,” Moore said. “Feels great. The water’s really cool.... We’re just having a good old time out here, enjoying the weather.” In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 meters) over Highway 17, submerging stop signs in what local people called unprecedented flooding. The sheriff’s department and volunteers, including locals and some who came from Texas, rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets. Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable. The whir of generators could be heard throughout the city, a sound not expected to dim soon as crews work to restore power. More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. Florence set a record in the state for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous record of 24 inches (61 cm) set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather. North Carolina officials warned motorists not to drive on major highways because of hazardous conditions in the southeastern part of the state. The flooding could taint waterways with murky coal ash. But officials said the state’s many lagoons of toxic hog waste had so far withstood the storm. By Sunday afternoon, Florence’s winds had dropped to about 35 miles per hour (55 kph), the National Hurricane Center said, with some weakening forecast over the next 24 hours before intensifying once again as an extratropical low-pressure center.The center of the storm was just west of Raleigh, the state capital, and moving north at 14 mph (22 kph), the hurricane center said. It was expected to accelerate to the north on Sunday night and then turn eastward across southern New England on Tuesday. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region this week, tweeted his condolences.

They have so much old history that they cant even care about all of it. Dave in Dallas The Monastiraki Flea Market is pretty mind blowing, as is the Central Market. Worth taking an hour to stroll through and gape at everything. mumbly Do the Acropolis in the morning. For one, its a big open spot on a hill so on a hot day itll get toasty pretty early and for two, the line starts to get massive after 10am. AntiHeroV Understand that many of the Acropolis structures may be going under repair so youll see scaffolding and workers working to repairs the columns. We really enjoyed visiting Panathenaic Stadium. We even ran up the stairs and ran a lap around the whole track. They have free devices to listen to different points around the stadium. Oscar The Acropolis museum is nice, the National Museum of Archeology is much better. Do not miss the Anthikitera master piece. DaffyDuck Explore the parks beyond the Acropolis. Bonus points for finding Prison of Socrates. lorem ipson I would also add the Kerameikos as a must-see to the serious among us who cant get enough: the site of the citys gateway to Piraeus, along which the Long Walls rose to protect that connection, which Pericles passionately pleaded to expensively build, and conquerers stipulated to be taken down. Here you will find exposed some of the most ancient walls of the city, and its oft rebuilt Gates. The river still flows out here, and just beyond begin the grave monuments of generations of its citizens, and even Spartan warriors. Captbrad6 If you are interested in ancient Greek history and philosophy, Aristotles Lyceum was almost empty when I went. Its a location that likely changed the course of human history and its amazing to see it in person. Its walkable from the Acropolis Museum and included in the ticket package you buy for the Acropolis and Agora for like 30-ish euro. Shape of a Lion Know and Plan Choose the location of the hotel carefully. While the metro is efficient, some places are just not where you would go after sunset (Omonia springs to my mind). Others are great (Plaka) but difficult to get there with your luggage. Or, very central (Kolonaki) but crazy expensive. DaffyDuck I had expected in my head we would be immersed in old-world quaintness. But the reality is that Athens is a massive bustling city that has been growing, ebbing, and evolving for thousands of years. The streets are small and not at all a grid. There are busy people who dont care if you are touring, they want you out of their way. It really all makes sense, but it isnt what I expected and so I quickly had to change my mindset before I could attempt to enjoy it all. IndyGoTell2 You do not flush toilet paper, ever. You put it in a little wastebasket next to the toilet. dergolem ( Its true! Blame the British.) Get Out of Town If youre planning a longer vacation, take a cheap flight out to one of the islands (I recommend Santorini or my favorite, Crete). The islands are a completely different feel from Athens, and flights were faster and cheaper than the (godawful) ferry. AntiHeroV Spend one day at the Acropolis, its totally worth it. Then get the hell out of Athens. Go to Delphi, go to Piraeus, drive around the countryside...just dont stay long in Athens. IceHippo73 The two local road trips are out along the curved seaside highway to breathtaking Sounion, with the stunning temple of Neptune solitary on a high headland, the most seaward point of Attica where under the watchtowers the warships, invaders, and commerce of this empire passed. Get the guidebook at the gateway and deeply enjoy. Find the accompanying city site on the back slope of the hill, with the remains of ship sheds carved into the sheltering back cove for the defending sea patrols that guarded this vital approach. Continue along the shore road, and with your good map, you will find a country road that climbs up into the hills, and after some pleasant miles and vistas, you will find the excavations that were the fabulous silver mines, pits really, that funded the wealth and rise of the Athenian Empire. At the crest of the ridge is a giant hole, surrounded by groves of trees and picnicking Greeks, the greatest and richest of these mines. Other sites and towns are nearby to see.

Ernest Scheyder,"CONWAY, S.C. (Reuters) - Flooding across the Carolinas in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed 36 people, was expected to worsen over the next couple of days, forecasters said. Twenty-one flood gauges showed major or moderate flooding early on Thursday in southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina, where major waterways, well above their flood stages, were forecast to rise through the weekend before they crest, the National Weather Service said. “People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a written statement. “Stay alert, and stay safe.” Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina, and many areas remained cut off by floodwaters and inundated roads. The slow-moving storm, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane, has since been downgraded to a tropical depression and moved into the U.S. northeast. The deaths of at least 36 people have been attributed to the storm, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. The latest victims were two women in South Carolina who drowned on Tuesday when a sheriff’s department van in which they were riding was swept away by flooding. Some 2,600 people had been rescued by boat or helicopter in North Carolina alone since the storm hit land, according to the state Department of Public Safety. About 10,000 remained in shelters and over 160,000 customers were without power across North Carolina, the department said. As floodwaters continue to rise concerns are growing over the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow, creating a risk the standing water will be contaminated with bacteria like salmonella, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region have also released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported. U.S. President Donald Trump warned South Carolina that “water is coming your way” as he toured the area on Wednesday. “Now it looks nice, but it’s really the calm before the storm,” Trump said. Experts have said that climate change has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and touching off catastrophic flooding.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - The port city of Georgetown, South Carolina braced on Wednesday for flooding touched off by Hurricane Florence, as emergency management officials urged residents to evacuate despite forecasts that scaled back the threat of 10-foot high water. Florence, which crashed ashore two weeks ago as a Category 1 hurricane and killed 46 people in three states, has since dissipated, but the storm’s torrential rainfall threatens to swamp the Georgetown as it drains toward the ocean. Forecasts now show floodwaters rising 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) in Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers about 30 miles (50 km) south of Myrtle Beach, considerably lower than initially feared. “We’re encouraging people not to let their guard down though, because just as quickly as forecasts change in our favor, they can change against us,” said Jackie Broach-Akers, a spokeswoman for the Georgetown County Emergency Management Operations Center. Despite bright sun on Wednesday, Broach-Akers said officials were urging 6,000 to 8,000 residents to leave their homes, with rivers expected to crest in Georgetown on Friday morning and remain above flood stage for four or five days. “(The sunshine) makes it harder to believe that something bad is right around the corner,” she said. The North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies said preliminary research suggests that Florence was among the rainiest storms to hit the United States in some 70 years. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the river flooding caused by Florence, which dropped nearly 20 inches (50 cm) of rain in some places in the state, is something his state has not had to cope with before. ‘FULL BATTLE MODE’ “This is unprecedented and we are still in full battle mode,” McMaster said at a press briefing on Wednesday at Emergency Management Division headquarters in Columbia, the state capital. Flooding has already destroyed 46 homes in the state, significantly damaged more than 1,000 and forced 11,000 people to flee their homes, including 3,000 in Georgetown, EMD Director Kim Stenson told reporters. In Conway County, where the Waccamaw was already well above flood stage, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility, said floodwaters stopped rising before inundating a pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic coal ash. “The river’s rise has slowed and we think it’s cresting today,” utility spokeswoman Mollie Gore said from the site, where 115 workers had shored up the dam around the pond. “We still have a foot between the top of the river and the top of the dam.” Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was expected to crest by late Thursday at 21.2 to 26.4. feet in the upriver communities of Conway and Bucksport, the National Weather Service Southeast River Forecast Center in Atlanta said. “This is going to be a very long flooding event,” said John Atwell, a weather service hydrologist. Some 1 to 2 inches of rain moving into the central and western parts of the state in a next day or two will prolong the flooding, said meteorologist Rich Otto of the weather service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “Any additional rainfall is just going to filter into those rivers,” Otto said. Crews worked to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"KINSTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Flooding from rain-swollen rivers was expected to worsen across the Carolinas on Thursday and the next couple of days in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which killed 36 people in three states, forecasters said. Twenty flood gauges showed some level of flooding in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where some major waterways, well above their flood stages, were expected to rise through the weekend before they crest, the National Weather Service said. “People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a written statement. “Stay alert and stay safe.” Touring the area on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned South Carolina that “water is coming your way.” “Now it looks nice but it’s really the calm before the storm,” he said. Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on parts of North Carolina and many areas remained cut off by floodwaters and inundated roads. The slow-moving storm made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. In Lenoir County, North Carolina, where the rising Neuse River has flooded some roads, emergency medical workers have been running a “mobile disaster hospital,” which provides urgent care to residents cut off from the nearest hospital. Tripp Winslow, medical director of North Carolina Emergency Medical Services, helped set up the mobile emergency room during a downpour on Saturday night. They have received 20 to 30 patients a day so far, he said, but expect to be busier as the river crests. “Once we get isolated we expect to see more,” he said. “No pun intended, it’s a fluid situation.” MANY STILL WITHOUT POWER At least 36 deaths have been attributed to the storm, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Some 2,600 people had been rescued by boat or helicopter in North Carolina alone since the storm made landfall, and about 10,000 people remain in shelters, according to state officials. More than 121,000 customers were without power across North Carolina, and more than 2.1 million customers across the southeast United States were affected by the storm, according to utilities. Duke Energy Corp ( DUK.N ) started to return its Brunswick nuclear power plant in North Carolina to service on Thursday. The company shut both reactors at the 1,870-megawatt facility before Florence hit the coast near the plant in Southport, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Wilmington. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. As floodwaters continue to rise, concerns are growing about the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow, creating a risk that standing water will be contaminated, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality.

Amanda Kooser,"Home Alone fans got all sentimental late last year when Google brought in Macaulay Culkin to reprise his role from the 1990 holiday-themed caper comedy Home Alone to promote Google Assistant. But a familiar face was missing. 
A new Google Assistant ad released Friday shows actor Joe Pesci, who played the ill-fated bandit Harry, watching Google's Home Alone Again ad with friends.
In a surprisingly sweet turn, Pesci plays himself and comments on Culkin's ad. It all leads up to a big moment at the end. 
While the ad features a party for the ""big game,"" the ad isn't scheduled to run during the Super Bowl on Sunday, according to a Google spokeswoman. 
Google had the smarts to release the video ahead of the Rams-Patriots NFL championship game this weekend, so it will ride the crest of interest in commercials along with the wave of nostalgia for the hijinks of Home Alone.
The search giant will reportedly run two mystery ads during the game, but the company is keeping details under wraps.","Google slips a new Home Alone-themed ad in among the crowd of Super Bowl commercials, but it won't air during the game.",2019-02-01T19:00:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Joe Pesci gets nostalgic with Google Assistant Home Alone ad - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/joe-pesci-gets-nostalgic-with-google-assistant-home-alone-ad/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/lq-HCscixlpRghXMIEIpIC_VHMA=/724x407/2019/02/01/32ffaecd-b158-4a06-bbc4-c7b34f5368ee/joepescigooglead.jpg,,Cnet.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Violent storms across swathes of the Southeast have caused several deaths and caused major flooding this weekend, with landslides also reported in several areas. Rain in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee reached an astonishing one to one and a half feet, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli.
Per the Associated Press, a tornado in Columbus, Mississippi killed one woman in a house undergoing renovation, while a man in Knox County, Tennessee drowned after his vehicle was submerged in floodwaters. The tornado resulted in 12 other injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening, Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. told the AP. An additional death was reported in Craighead County, Arkansas, after a 76-year-old man and his vehicle was swept away by high water after seemingly driving around barricades, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Destruction in Columbus included damage at First Pentecostal Church that Rev. Steve Blaylock described as a total loss, while sheds and outbuildings in the citys east side were mostly demolished, the AP wrote. Used-car dealer Lee Lawrence said the storm demolished four buildings on his lot and blew out car windows, telling the AP it will be a start-over deal. I cant say it will come back better or stronger, but well come back.
The AP wrote:
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrences lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Some 300 river gauges across the Southeast remained above flood levels on Sunday, according to CNN.
Tennessees Knox County was put under a flash flood warning on Saturday afternoon, CNN reported, with the National Weather Service advising residents that this is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now. Amid the rising floodwaters, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Officials also implemented regional states of emergency in Alabama and Mississippi.
There were additional reports of rockslides wiping out part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, with all lanes covered by rocks, trees, and dirt. Construction engineer Ted Adams of the North Carolina Department of Transportations District 14 told the Citizen Times it was a small slide with rocks falling from a pretty high elevation, and when they were hitting the road, they were bouncing into the eastbound lanes. The road may be closed for up to a week, the paper wrote.
Mudslides in Chattanooga also wiped out a Subway retail location on Saturday morning. Per the Times Free Press, owner Owen Megahee closed the location on Friday after observing an adjacent hill seemed about to collapse.
If they had it open, and employees and customers had been in there, wed be talking about something much more serious, fire department spokesman Bruce Garner told the paper. People could have been hurt or killed for sure.
Nearby, the Dunlap Fire Department posted a video of rising floodwaters spilling well over the boundaries of a waterway on Saturday.
The city of Nashville broke a rainfall record, with its February the wettest in over a century, CNN reported. In Lynchburg, between Nashville and Chattanooga, the grounds of the Jack Daniels distillery were flooded, though employee Henry Feldhaus IV told CNN that all employees and stores of whiskey were safe.
While the storms are largely over, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said that many of the floods will not crest until later in the week as rains continue to drain into waterways. According to the AP, tens of thousands of Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia remained without electricity as of Sunday afternoon.

Amanda Kooser,"This illustration shows what Caihong juji might have looked like. Velizar Simeonovski, The Field Museum, for UT Austin Jackson School of Geosciences Forget scaly T. rex. Feathered dinosaurs are all the rage, and now we're meeting the flamboyant rock star of the feathery dino world. Caihong juji is Mandarin for ""rainbow with the big crest."" It's an apt description of a newly discovered small dinosaur that lived in China 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period. An international team of researchers from Shenyang Normal University in China and the University of Texas at Austin studied the dino fossil, which was discovered by a Chinese farmer in 2014. ""The preservation of this dinosaur is incredible, we were really excited when we realized the level of detail we were able to see on the feathers,"" Chad Eliason, one of the study's authors who is now a researcher at The Field Museum in Chicago, said in a statement. Caihong juji's skull shape resembles that of a velociraptor. Dongyu Hu, et al. The researchers determined the dinosaur's colorful characteristics by inspecting imprints left by melanosomes, which The Field Museum describes as the ""part of cells that contain pigments."" The melanosomes resemble those found in rainbow hummingbird feathers today. Caihong juji was about the size of a chicken, and scientists believe its neck feathers were not only colorful but also likely iridescent, which would have made it quite the looker. As with some modern-day birds, the flashy appearance may have helped with attracting mates. ""It has a rather velociraptor-looking low and long skull with this fully feathered, shaggy kind of plumage and a big fan tail. It is really cool … or maybe creepy looking depending on your perspective,"" Julia Clarke, a University of Texas professor, paleontologist and one of the study's authors, said in a statement. Dongyu Hu, a professor in the College of Paleontology at the Shenyang Normal University, led the study.

Rhett Jones,"Last year, people went nuts trying to find Nintendos NES and SNES Classic consoles, but it looks like the games those nostalgia-machines offered will soon be available right on your Switch. Data miners claim to have discovered a list of 22 SNES titles and possibly two mystery emulators in the code for Nintendo Switch Online.
The launch of the Switchs online service has been met with overwhelming disappointment. Even though Nintendos subscription service is relatively inexpensive at just $20 per year, the Switch isnt really filled with that many online multiplayer games and players are experiencing performance issues with blockbuster titles like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The bonus offering of old school NES games hasnt been enough to make people feel like theyre getting enough. That could change soon. 
Over the weekend, data miner and modding enthusiast KapuccinoHeck tweeted that they were recently perusing the online services code and discovered a list of 22 SNES games. KapuccinoHeck also tweeted the actual file for anyone interested. Other users confirmed the presence of the list and pointed out that the games include descriptions in English and Japanese, further fueling speculation that they could arrive imminently. Heres the full list of titles:
Super Mario Kart
Super Soccer
Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past
Demons Crest
Yoshis Island
Stunt Race FX
Kirbys Dream Course
Popn Twinbee
Star Fox
Contra 3
Kirby Super Star
Super Ghouls n Ghosts
Kirbys Dream Land 3
Super Metroid
Super Mario World
Pilotwings
F-ZERO
Star Fox 2 (lol)
Super Punch-Out!!
The Legend of the Mystical Ninja
Super Mario All-Stars
Breath of Fire 2
The list of games is very close to what was included on the SNES Classic, which retails for $79.99. But what may be even more exciting is that Twitter user OatmealDome jumped in to do a little more scraping and claimed they found four emulator types, however its unclear what two of them do. The code names for the emulators are:
Kachikachi (NES Classic)
Canoe (SNES Classic)
Hiyoko (???)
Count (???)
Could we be getting N64 or GameBoy emulators? Maybe. One person pointed out that the Count category of emulators could just be a string intended to keep track of the number of emulators present and its possible only one additional emulator exists.
Nintendo did not immediately respond to Gizmodos request for confirmation, but the data miners have a good track record of making discoveries. KapuccinoHeck figured out how to hack the online NES library the day after it was released. OatmealDome helped out with that one and regularly makes discoveries in the code for Splatoon 2.
Yes, Nintendo tends to be overly stingy with its older games but its not unreasonable to think there could an incoming flood of titles as the company tries to appease disgruntled users and subscription services become more important to tech giants. And competition for game subscription and streaming dollars is getting more fierce. Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, Electronic Arts, Google, Nvidia, and Verizon are all reportedly working on some type of gaming service. Just last week, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told Nikkei that in the long-term Nintendos focus as a business could shift away from home consoles. Thinking outside of the box is key to Nintendos future.

Augusta Pownall,"A trademark application made earlier this month has given a clue to name and crest of David Beckham's new Miami football team, and the year they aim to start playing. An application was submitted for a round pink and black badge by MIPH, a company that has registered several names for a Miami football club, on 10 August. The badge features two back-to-back cranes – a bird native to Miami – on a central crest, with their legs entwined to form an M. The colour scheme fits with the pastel art-deco palette found on many Miami buildings. At the base of the badge are the Roman numerals MMXX, meaning 2020, which would suggest that the team plans to be playing in two years time. Club could be called Internacional Club de Fútbol Miami The badge also hints that the team will likely be called Internacional Club de Fútbol Miami, which could be shortened to Inter Miami. On 29 January 2018, the Miami Beckham United Group was awarded the twenty-fifth franchise in Major League Soccer, an American men's professional soccer league sanctioned by US Soccer. The league currently comprises 23 teams, including LA Galaxy, where Beckham played between 2007 and 2012. The logo was trademarked by MIPH, the same Delaware-based company that earlier this year trademarked a series of potential names for the club, including Miami Freedom, which is now considered to be the proposed name for the club's new ground. Residents to vote on location of club The latest plan is for a 28,000-seat stadium on the former site of Melreese Country Club next to Miami International Airport. The proposals include a 23 hectare park, a hotel, shopping precinct and public football grounds. Residents will vote in November to decide whether to authorise the city to negotiate an agreement to develop the park. Miami hasn't had a soccer team in the league since Miami Fusion ceased playing in 2001. Beckham's team will be the first to be based in the city itself, as Miami Fusion played in Fort Lauderdale, 30 miles to the north of the city. The rebrand of football badges has often been controversial, from the update of Leeds United's badge being dropped, to comparisons of the Premier League's rebrand for the 2016/2017 season to the logo for the UK Independence Party.

Tom Ravenscroft,"Leeds United Football Club has abandoned its new crest, which was revealed last week, after more than 77,000 people signed a petition calling for the club to rethink the design. The controversial redesigned crest features a torso with a fist placed against the heart – depicting a gesture known as the ""Leeds salute"" that is widely associated with the club. Despite consulting over 10,000 people, the first change to the club's badge since 1999 received an overwhelming negative response. This lead to to the club appearing to rethink the new design, the day after it was unveiled. Now Leeds United has abandoned the design and is calling on fans to submit creative designs for a new crest. Leeds United faced a fan backlash after unveiling a redesigned crest last week ""We would like to thank our loyal fan base for the overwhelming engagement on the future of the club crest,"" a statement on the club website said. ""We have seen a great number of designs and ideas, and to ensure every fan can have their say, we are calling on supporters to share your inspiration for the new crest."" Following consultation, fans will be able to vote on a shortlist of designs, with the new crest set to be unveiled by the end of February 2018. ""Using your ideas as inspiration, a small shortlist of refined designs will be chosen by fan panels and then go to a democratic vote amongst all our season ticket holders and members on Wednesday 21st February, with our new crest announced by the end of the month,"" said the club. However, in a move that may anger designers, these designs would then become the property of Leeds United according to the statement. ""Supporters understand that by submitting creative, this [any submissions] will become the intellectual property of Leeds United,"" it reads. This will be the 11th time that Leeds United has changed its crest in the 99-year history of the club. Other football clubs that have recently redesigned their crests include Italian team Juventus, which unveiled a minimal crest that became the subject of widespread criticism.","Leeds United Football Club has abandoned its new crest, which was revealed last week, after more than 77,000 people signed a petition calling for the club to rethink the design.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / The view of Baxter Street as seen from N. Alvarado Street, in Los Angeles. reader comments 18 It’s a common story : small towns and residents living on once-quiet streets are sometimes annoyed by the influx of traffic that Waze, traffic wayfinding apps, and ride-hailing services have wrought. But residents along Baxter Street in Los Angeles’ Echo Park neighborhood— reportedly one of the steepest streets in America (comprising two major hills)—are now banding together to try to change local traffic patterns. Neighbors have contacted city officials and Waze’s parent company, Google, to try to mitigate the problem. They believe that a lot of drivers are using Baxter as a way to avoid Glendale Boulevard, a nearby thoroughfare. According to a Wednesday report in the Los Angeles Times, locals say that they’ve noticed an uptick in serious accidents. “The car came through our garden, went through two fences, and ended up backwards hanging over our driveway,” resident Jason Luther told the paper. “Rain is a huge problem,” another resident, Robbie Adams, said. “People start skidding and spinning. We had our garden wall knocked down twice, and my wife’s car got hit in our own driveway. I’ve seen five or six cars smash into other cars, and it’s getting worse.” The street, which dates back to 1872, has a 32-percent grade—more than double what current city law allows for today. In 2003, the Times described the street this way: “Unsuspecting motorists gasp when they reach the crest and discover the roadway in front of them has dropped out of sight and there is nothing but empty space in front of their car’s hood.” A decade later, Los Angeles magazine noted : Baxter later became a proving ground for automobiles, as manufacturers staged elaborate stunts to demonstrate their vehicles’ power. In one such event in 1916, a four-wheel-drive truck loaded with 4,300 pounds of baled hay groaned its way up the grade, pausing twice for newspaper cameras. Nearly 100 years later, Baxter Street continues to bewilder uncertain drivers and confound elongated vehicles. Adams also told the Times that the neighbors had sent a letter to Waze, suggesting that the street be removed entirely. “They said they couldn’t do that because it involves changing the algorithm of the app in a weird way,” he said. Google did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment.","“I’ve seen five or six cars smash into other cars, and it’s getting worse.”",2018-04-05T21:35:41Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Waze’s crazy routing over a 32% grade road is driving residents nuts,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/waze-blamed-for-rise-in-accidents-along-one-of-steepest-streets-in-us/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/baxter-760x380.jpeg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jenna McKnight,"American studio Michael Maltzan Architecture has completed a bright white residential complex in the Los Angeles area, which contains over 60 studio apartments and various support services for its formerly homeless tenants. Crest Apartments was built on a slender, rectangular parcel in Van Nuys – a suburban district northwest of Downtown LA. Totalling 45,000 square feet (4,180 square metres), the complex serves as permanent supportive housing for those who formerly had no home. The project was backed by Skid Row Housing Trust – a local developer and property manager that provides housing for people suffering from homelessness, extreme poverty, illness, disabilities and addiction. This is the fourth residential project that LA-based Michael Maltzan Architecture has designed for the organisation. The five-storey Crest building appears to rise high above its low-scale neighbours. Rather than a simple block, the design team conceived an assemblage of rectilinear volumes that vary in height as they march across the elongated site. The complex has an ""arching form"", with portions of the building lifted up and supported by pilotis. ""The low points of the building touch down at both the front and back of the site, creating a physical relationship to the smaller-scale single-family residences to the south, and the commercial facades to the north,"" said Michael Maltzan Architecturein a project description. Facades are sheathed in white stucco and punctuated with square windows. Splashes of colour were incorporated throughout the complex, from bright green columns to lemon-hued walls. Within the building, one finds ""inviting, light-filled spaces"" designed to help engender a sense of community. Related story Brooks + Scarpa completes The Six housing for LA's homeless and disabled veterans The ground level contains a series of communal areas and support services. A lobby is located in the front of the building, where glazed walls engage the streetscape and create a welcoming atmosphere. Behind the lobby, the team placed an array of amenity spaces, such as a lounge, a laundry room and a community kitchen. Support services for tenants, including four counselling offices, are situated in the rear of the ground level. The upper four storeys of the building contain a total of 64 studio apartments, 23 of which are set aside for homeless military veterans. Open-air corridors bring in daylight and enable cross-ventilation, while also offering views of the city. Rooms feature white walls, grey flooring and contemporary decor. The site's landscaping is meant to play a central role in the overall design. Given the region's limited rainfall, the team selected native plants that can tolerate drought. Tufts of grass encircle the building, and also pass underneath it. ""The ground-level landscape runs across the site, spreading beyond its boundaries, creating a unified field beneath the residential floors which hover above,"" the studio said. The team got creative when it came to addressing strict parking and fire-lane requirements. Rather than covering a large swath of the property with concrete or asphalt, they installed pervious pavers, which permit grasses to sprout and enable rainwater to penetrate the earth. The west side of the complex provides enough room for emergency vehicles, while also serving as green space for residents. ""By integrating landscape materials, such as permeable pavers that can withstand various loads, the demarcation between hardscape, softscape and functional requirements are blurred to create an interchangeable ground surface,"" the studio said. The greenery helped the project earn LEED for Homes Platinum certification from the US Green Building Council. Other sustainable design elements include a rainwater collection system and rooftop solar panels. According to the architecture firm, the building's energy performance exceeds the state mandate by 23 per cent. The total project cost was $23.6 million (£17.7 million), with $14.2 million (£10.7 million) spent on construction. With over 134,000 homeless residents, California has the largest homeless population of any state in the US, according to the US Interagency Council on Homelessness.

Aylin Woodward,"In parts of California wine country, 8 feet of floodwaters have inundated homes and vineyards over the last 24 hours. 
 While the towns of Sonoma County are no strangers to flooding, record-breaking torrential rainfall this week caused the Russian River and its tributaries to inundate the area with the worst floods since 1995. 
 ""A slow-moving storm is moving into the West Coast from the Pacific, which has been the cause of very heavy rainfall that has occurred over northern and central California,"" Accuweather meteorologist Frank Strait reported. 
 Parts of Sonoma County received more than 20 inches of rain, and the National Weather Service reported that Santa Rosa broke the 100-year rainfall record by more than 3 inches with a whopping 5.66 inches in 24 hours. 
 The rainfall caused the Russian River to crest to more than 45 feet — 14 feet over the flood mark — on Wednesday evening, causing further damage to local homes and businesses. 
 Hundreds of roads across the county shut down, and the rains also caused numerous mudslides in the area. 
 Guerneville and Monte Rio, two towns about 80 miles northwest of Sacramento, were disconnected from surrounding areas by up to 8 feet of water. Local sheriff departments declared Guerneville ""an island"" and warned that it was accessible only by boat. 
 Flood warnings are in effect through Thursday afternoon, but the National Weather Service expects waters to recede throughout the day. More rain is expected later this week, though. 
 Here's what the Sonoma County flooding looks like on the ground.","On Wednesday night, California's Russian River — which winds its way through Napa Valley — rose to its highest point in 25 years.

Text description provided by the architects. Major Addition and Remodel to 1949 International Style Home. Original structure was built in 1949 and was the first home/building constructed in the Malibu Knolls region of Malibu. The house sits atop a bluff with views of the Malibu Pier, Surf Rider Beach, Malibu Lagoon to the south and the Santa Monica Mountains to the north.

It was important to the owners to maintain the lines of the original house, while also increasing the square footage and taking full advantage of the landscape and panoramic ocean and mountain views. 
Plan
Sketch
From the onset, the project needed to be classified as a remodel as we didnt want to lose the old growth trees that had grown around the original structure. (They would have to be removed if the project was deemed new construction) To that end, over 50% of the original exterior walls were required to remain and were incorporated into the current design. The new addition was built around the original structure. Many of the original exterior walls became interior walls and portions of the original slab/ foundation remained mostly intact. 984 sf was added to the original 3,141 sf structure. The final project is a 4,125 sf

Harry Hill,"This post is part ofHard Refresh, a soothing weekly column where we try to cleanse your brain of whatever terrible thing you just witnessed on Twitter.
If Hermione Granger had had YouTube access at Hogwarts, she'd definitely watch wax seal videos. 
Even with the advent of the World Wide Web, it's still nice to communicate with people the old-fashioned way sometimes. Sure, tapping a text takes just seconds, but writing a letter on paper is a chance to flex our creative muscles and put some real meaning into the message. 
With all the chaos of the modern world, it may be nice to take a step back in time and revisit the art of the wax seal. And just like everything else that exists, YouTube has a designated corner for it. 
SEE ALSO: You could win a $1.7 million mansion by writing a standout letter
A brief history on wax seals should come in handy while watching these videos. Though letter writing has been around since there were people to write them, wax seals only became popular in the middle ages. They were used as an authenticator for important documents before they became widely used to actually seal letters from prying eyes, according to the brand Kings Wax. 
Since the stamps can be personalized to include initials or a crest, there is a very official and personal air about the whole process. Mostly, though, it's just nice to watch slow hands going through the steps of actually making a seal. 
First, the wax is chosen, whether it be from a bead, stick, or glue gun. If multiple colors are used, they sometimes they're arrange them in a certain way to achieve a specific look. From there, the wax is heated over a flame in a spoon or directly on the stick. Once it's hot enough, the most satisfying part of the process happens: the wax is poured. 
It doesn't take much to make a standard seal, but  the size of stamps varies. After about 10-15 seconds, the stamp is pressed into the hot wax for another 10 seconds and voila! A wax seal is born. 
If you're just looking to relax and watch someone do something creative by candlelight, these videos are perfect for you. Just be cautious, you may find yourself writing a postcard to a long lost friend and using an old Crayon (melted in a spoon) to jazz it up. 
The most famous seals might be those seen in Harry Potter, dropping from the claws of an owl into Harry's hands. Here is 11 minutes of pure Hogwarts-inspired wax sealing for your viewing pleasure:
While sealing a letter with wax requires dexterity and practice, folding letters may also requires some expertise. Now, it's not necessary to fold your letters like they're going to be delivered in lamplight by a courier, but it will add to the mise-en-scène of it all. 
Sometimes, wax seals are just a chance to make colorful things in a simple and soothing way. 
So take a step back, and remember a time when correspondence required more than a finger on glass and a digital litter of eggplant-shaped hieroglyphics.","This post is part of Hard Refresh, a soothing weekly column where we try to cleanse your brain of whatever terrible thing you just witnessed on Twitter.

Augusta Pownall,"Brand consultancy Summa has subtly re-designed FC Barcelona's badge, and created a new personalised typeface and visual system for the football club. The design team has removed the letters FCB from the badge and reduced the number of vertical blue and maroon stripes in the lower half of the crest from seven to five to make the colours stand out. The football has been made bigger, and centralised to reflect the team's style of ball-centred play, which sees them making many quick, short passes. The black outline around the crest remains, however, all internal black lines have been removed to achieve ""a more homogeneous, harmonious and brighter crest design"", according to a statement on Barcelona football club's website. The red and white cross of Sant Jordi, or Saint George, the patron saint of the area, and the red and yellow stripes of the Senyera that together make up the flag of Barcelona remain at the top of the crest. The re-design forms part of the club's strategy to better position the brand internationally while ""staying faithful to the historical elements of the crest"". In particular it is hoped that the updated design will ensure that the crest can be accurately reproduced across all media, including digital and social media. ""Since the design was last updated in 2002, the context, society and technology have changed enormously, and the symbols identified with the club need to evolve too,"" reads the statement. ""The new design now has greater reproduction capacity, especially in the increasingly more important world of digital media,"" it continued. The new typeface is based on elements of the crest, and the visual system that will be applied across the club echoes its colour and patterns. The branding has been approved by the club's board of directors, but it will need to be submitted for approval by the club's membership at a delegate assembly on 20 October 2018. Once passed, the new design will be rolled out across shirts, merchandise and in the media for the 2019-20 football season. It will be the 11th time that the crest has been re-designed since the club's inception in 1899. In recent year's several football clubs have been criticised for controversial rebrands, with Leeds United being forced to scrap its redesigned crest, and Juventus' being mocked for its minimal redesign.","Brand consultancy Summa has subtly re-designed FC Barcelona's badge, and created a new personalised typeface and visual system for the football club.

Associated Press,"(KANSAS CITY, Mo.) — More towns are evacuating as the flooded Missouri River seeps over and through busted levees.
The National Weather Service says the river is expected to crest Friday at levels just short of those reached during historic 1993 flooding in Atchison, Kansas, and St. Joseph, Missouri.
About 1,200 residents of the Kansas town of Elwood were urged to leave, and the governor eased restrictions on large vehicles carrying relief supplies. Across the river, parts of an industrial area in St. Joseph were inundated with water.
But no major flooding is forecast downstream in Kansas City.
The Missouri River swelled following heavy rains and snowmelt this month. The flooding had been blamed for three deaths, damaged thousands of homes in Nebraska,Iowa and Missouri, and taken a heavy toll on agriculture.

Gunseli Yalcinkaya,"With football club Leeds United facing backlash from fans over its redesigned crest, here's a look at some of the sport's most controversial rebrands – from the minimal redesign of Juventus' logo to Red Bull's creation of RB Leipzig. Leeds United Leeds United Football Club was forced to reconsider its new crest after complaints from fans led to more than 77,000 people signing a petition urging the club not to use it. The proposed logo featured a torso with a fist placed against the heart, depicting a gesture known as the ""Leeds salute"" that is widely associated with the club. With the logo receiving a huge amount of criticism – despite the club claiming it had undergone a rigorous design process that lasted six months – the crest was dropped and a hunt for a new design launched. Juventus Turin-based football club Juventus swapped its bold logo of a charging bull and a crown to a far more minimal design, featuring two J-shaped stripes that hang beneath the team name. Fans were quick to mock the crest on social media, with some calling it too corporate and anonymous. Others compared it the JD Sports logo or the shape of former player Alessandro Del Piero's facial hair. Aston Villa Birmingham-based football club Aston Villa was initially reportedly to have spent £2 million on its 2016 redesign, which appeared to simply remove the word ""prepared"" from the previous design. Although the club later confirmed the project cost less than £80,000, the new logo was met with criticism from fans who believed it was a waste of money, especially as the club was bottom of the UK's Premier League at the time. SSV Markranstädt/RB Leipzig In 2009, SSV Markranstädt's license was purchased by energy drink maker Red Bull, with the team rebranded as RB Leipzig. The football team became the fourth in the company's sports advertising portfolio with the crest altered to reflect the new name and ownership. However, all original crests proposed were rejected by the Saxony Football Association (SFV) as they were considered copies of the corporate logo of Red Bull, leading to the team playing without a crest for its first season. A redesigned crest was used for the next couple of seasons, but this logo was rejected by the German Football League (DFL) during the license procedure for the 2014-15 season, leading to the current crest being introduced. Everton The English football club's 2013 redesign prompted over 23,000 supporters to sign an online petition calling for the new badge to be scrapped, calling it ""amateurish"" and ""embarrassing"". Designed by the club's in-house graphics team, it depicts the Everton landmark St Rupert's Tower, as well as the club's name and the year of its formation. Responding to fan reactions, the club dropped the crest the following season. The Premier League This controversial redesign wasn't just for one team, it was for the entire Premier League. For the 2016/17 season, the UK league unveiled a new logo and visual identity by creative agency DesignStudio. Featuring a purple lion's head and the league's name spelt in a bespoke typeface, the new design was met with polarising opinions – with some comparing the logo to Disney's The Lion King. In October 2017, the UK Independence Party replaced its yellow, pound-sign logo with a purple lion's head, drawing similarities between that and the football league.","With football club Leeds United facing backlash from fans over its redesigned crest, here's a look at some of the sport's most controversial rebrands – from the minimal redesign of Juventus' logo to Red Bull's creation of RB Leipzig.

Rosalind Adams,"Hayden Vice was walking down the hallway of the psychiatric hospital when a mental health technician instructed him to go take a shower. Pausing on his crutches, the 15-year-old patient replied that a nurse had told him not to get the cast on his lower leg wet. But the worker, Isaac Doughty, told Vice again that he was going to take a shower. “No, the hell I’m not — I’m going to do what the nurse told me to,” he recalled responding. Surveillance video shows what happens next: Doughty walks toward him waving his right index finger in the air, then brings both of his hands down on Vice’s neck. The crutches fall at Vice’s side as Doughty spins him around against the wall and then pushes him down to the floor. Briefly, Vice lifts himself onto his hands and knees, but Doughty grabs him around the middle and, with the help of another worker, hauls Vice into a nearby room — and out of the camera’s view. For a few moments the hallway is still, strewn with loose papers, scattered chairs, and Vice’s crutches. Then Vice stumbles out again. His face is now bloody, and his white shirt is soiled with large crimson drops. Bending over to retrieve his crutches from the floor, he tries to strike Doughty with them. But Doughty, bigger and quicker, shoves him and pulls him back into the room, once again out of the camera’s sight. Minutes later, the hallway swells with patients, but Vice does not emerge for about 30 minutes. Off camera, Vice said, the tech smashed his head into the dresser and then picked up his right foot, the one that was in a cast, and slammed it down to the ground. “I’m surprised it didn’t paralyze my leg, the way that he was slamming it,” Vice said. Contesting Vice’s account of what happened in the room, Doughty, who reviewed the footage at BuzzFeed News’ request, repeated several times, “I didn’t do anything wrong.” The facility where the April 2015 incident took place — Hill Crest Behavioral Health, in Birmingham, Alabama — is owned by America’s largest psychiatric hospital chain, Universal Health Services. UHS, whose revenues last year from its behavioral health facilities alone exceeded $8 billion, owns more than 200 for-profit psychiatric facilities that served 455,000 patients. About a third of its revenues come from taxpayer dollars. But the company, which has been the subject of an ongoing, two-year BuzzFeed News investigation, is under increasing scrutiny by state and federal agencies for a litany of allegations: holding patients until their insurance runs out, regardless of actual medical need; inadequate staffing and training that endangers both employees and patients; and physical abuse of patients. Following BuzzFeed News ’ stories, Oklahoma stopped sending kids in the state’s custody to a UHS facility and terminated its Medicaid contract. Top senators have also called for scrutiny of the company. Now, a deep examination of UHS’s Hill Crest facility — based on internal surveillance videos; interviews with nearly 50 former patients, family members, and current and former employees; and a review of hundreds of pages of legal and medical documents — shows that a culture of violence flourished there. Videos show patients — including foster children — being tackled, dragged, and choked by staff members. Employees sometimes hauled patients into bedrooms where, beyond the view of surveillance cameras, they doled out their most vicious beatings, patients and staff members said. Interviews and documents show that the hospital’s management did little to halt the abuses. “They don’t treat those kids right. They treat them like they’re animals in a zoo,” said a former nurse. “I wouldn’t send my dog there.” In a written statement, the facility said that the videos show “isolated incidents” that are “not indicative of the quality of care provided at Hill Crest.” “We regret and are disappointed in the instances of inappropriate conduct by our employees, which was inconsistent with the facility’s policies and their training,” it continued. UHS declined to make any comments of its own. Hill Crest, a 219-bed facility that has several state contracts to care for Alabama’s foster kids, touts superior patient care and rigorous staff training. But interviews with current and former workers, as well as patients, reveal that training is so cursory and staffing levels are so low as to be dangerous. Not all employees said they witnessed abuse, and many said they did the best they could, even spending their own money on snacks for patients when the hospital was in short supply. But other employees resorted to using chokeholds or twisting the arms and legs of patients to control them. And those who were caught on camera hurting patients — such as Doughty — continued to work there with little discipline. In addition, the facility was run down; the County Health Department found roaches and dead rodents rotting in traps in the facility’s kitchen. Hill Crest has gotten high marks from Alabama’s Department of Mental Health and Department of Human Resources, the two state agencies that oversee the facility, and has been accredited by The Joint Commission, a national non-profit. But a BuzzFeed News investigation reveals that Hill Crest withheld crucial information from government regulators, falsified patient records, defrauded insurers, and lied to the families of its young charges. More than a half dozen employees say that hospital administrators helped floor workers cheat on exams that state contracts require them to pass. Several families of patients who incurred injuries said hospital officials lied about what actually happened. Five employees said they were told to to backdate or falsify patient charts, including those for patients not in their care — a seeming violation of fraud statutes. And despite state and federal rules about how hospitals report serious injuries, Hill Crest filed no documents regarding an adult patient who died the day after being restrained by staff members. The most shocking of these incidents — in which children, some so vulnerable that the state has placed them in the care of a special institution, are physically abused by the very people who are supposed to be caring for them — are captured on closed-circuit video. After obtaining these videos, BuzzFeed News used interviews and documents to confirm the events they capture. We shared them with the families in question, as well as with UHS. Portions of the videos are presented here as BuzzFeed News received them, though some of the individuals’ faces have been obscured. Hill Crest told BuzzFeed News that its investigation “relies upon a limited number of isolated, cherry-picked, non-representative, and in some cases wholly inaccurate accounts.” The hospital’s “goal is to help and heal those who come to us at their most vulnerable times in their lives,” and if patients said they were mistreated, administrators would conduct a thorough review. But Hill Crest's statement added, “it is important to note that many patient allegations are ultimately revealed to be unsubstantiated, inaccurate or incomplete.” The experiences of former residents and employees, however, tell the story of a very different hospital. They suggest that Hill Crest often did not help its young patients, among the most powerless people in the state. Some patients and families say the violence and mistreatment they received there ruined their lives and have haunted them ever since. ""I didn't want to live no more"" A few hours after the altercation with Doughty, Vice was sent to the emergency room for stitches above his eye. Hill Crest didn’t notify his mother, Trecia Gilmore, until the next day, she said, when they told her that her son had fallen in the hallway. She didn’t buy it. By that time, Vice had been at the facility about nine months. She had seen bruises on her son before, she said. So that afternoon, after she picked up her other kids from school, she made the 90-mile drive to Hill Crest. She arrived in the early evening, in time for visiting hours. “Now, Hayden had a pretty nasty fall, but it looks worse than it is,” she recalled a manager telling her as she waited to see her son. “Hayden’s just being overdramatic.” She also recalled being told that the facility’s security cameras weren’t working that day. She started getting nervous. When her son finally came down from the unit, she immediately spotted the fresh bruises on his arms and throat, and the row of half a dozen stitches above his left eye. “My heart dropped, and my eyes filled up and I started crying,” Gilmore told BuzzFeed News. She demanded to see Burney Johnson, the clinical director, but recalled being told that he wouldn’t speak to her. “I'll tell you what, get his shit together because we're leaving,” Gilmore said. Staff protested, but the hospital released Vice that night. Stephanie Jenks, who had until recently been Vice’s therapist at Hill Crest, said it wasn’t the first time that staff members assaulted him. On another occasion, a few months prior, she had found him “all scuffed up and red-faced and scratched and bleeding,” she recalled. “His neck had finger marks around it,” she added. “He was crying and shaking.” Hill Crest records show that Vice had a “history of violent, destructive threats,” as well as “severe and dangerous agitation.” But along with several other nurses and employees, Jenks said staff members “would just antagonize. They would just push these kids’ buttons.” They did it to Vice “so they could restrain him or put him on restriction or take something away from him,” she said. “It was just abuse.” Vice said he felt constantly under attack at Hill Crest. “I kinda felt like they didn’t care or anything,” he said. “It just made me feel like I didn’t want to live no more.” The day after Vice was released, Gilmore took him to a medical hospital, where a doctor diagnosed him with a contusion, records show. Photos she took two days after the incident show brown and purple bruises on his bicep, his knees, and his elbows, and long red scratches covering his chest and neck. Hill Crest’s employee handbook says physical or verbal abuse toward a patient can be punished with corrective action or immediate termination. “Of course I got talked to about the incident,” Doughty said. “That’s protocol.” Hill Crest said Doughty “received mandatory retraining” and the incident was reported to applicable state and regulatory agencies. Doughty said he continued working part-time at the hospital until just a few months ago. He said he quit only because he is currently in school, and his schedule got in the way. He is studying to become a psychiatric nurse. “My experience with Hill Crest,” Doughty said, is “the patients have been treated fairly. I’ve never seen a patient treated badly.” Jenks, Vice’s former therapist, no longer works at Hill Crest. She said she left the hospital after that incident, which Hill Crest acknowledges, because of how badly Vice was abused and how eager everyone was to say it was his fault. “I was not going to go along with the lies,” she said. “Not about this — not about abuse.” “They picked me up like some sort of animal” UHS has operated Hill Crest since 2010, but the hospital has a much longer history, having opened nearly a century ago as a 25-bed sanitarium in the mansion of a former Birmingham sheriff. Today, it has expanded to more than 200 beds across nine programs that serve both adults and adolescents. As of September 2017, Hill Crest’s one- and two-year contracts with the state’s Department of Human Resources, or DHR, to house foster kids in its adolescent units and group homes are worth more than $20 million in state and federal funds. One of these contracts is to place foster children in the unit called RISE, which is located in one of the boxy, stand-alone trailers off the main hospital and is focused on treating adolescent girls with behavioral problems. “We had children that we could not place,” said a former nurse at the facility. “There was nowhere else for them to go.” Previous BuzzFeed News investigations have revealed how UHS pushed its executives to increase profit margins by boosting admissions while cutting staff. At Hill Crest, state contracts helped keep the adolescent units full: For the last few years more than 200 foster kids a year have been placed there. Adryana Metcalf ended up in Hill Crest at 16. When she was 5, her father left a belt mark on her face because she hadn’t sat still in church, law enforcement records show, and the state took Metcalf from her parents. Her mother regained custody for a time, but Metcalf went back into state care as a teenager, getting shuffled among facilities around the state, several in the last year alone. She spent about a year on the RISE unit, she recalled. Many of the patients at RISE come from tough circumstances; some are violent. Among Hill Crest staff, it’s known as the place where no one wants to work. In contrast to nurses and doctors, mental health technician at Hill Crest are only required to have a high school diploma, though experience working in a residential treatment center is preferred, according to a job description. Yet these floor workers spend the most time with the patients, doing everything from taking them on outings to intervening during fights and checking on them while they sleep. Despite receiving millions of dollars of public funds to house those patients, the hospital gave these employees minimal training, staff members repeatedly said. These workers are supposed to receive four to five days of classroom training on topics such as writing progress notes and making patient rounds, according to the facility’s contracts with the state. The hospital is also supposed to train its employees in how to physically restrain patients who are at risk of harming themselves or others. Such restraints are highly regulated by state and federal rules because of the “high-risk nature” and “potential for harm” according to Alabama’s administrative code. But employees said that training segments were rushed through or not completed at all. Several employees described watching a video or reviewing a workbook about how to place a patient in a restraint, but said their questions were dismissed by instructors, and the trainees did not have a good grasp of the techniques when they started working on the floor. “It’s so fast you don’t remember or really know what to do,” said a current worker at the facility, who added that he was nervous when he started working with patients. At the end of the training week, Hill Crest contracts say, new hires must score at least 90% on a test or receive additional training. But more than half a dozen employees who started at Hill Crest in different years and worked in a range of departments said that a supervisor read out the answers to them, ensuring everyone got the highest mark. Hill Crest did not respond directly to allegations of cheating, but said, “If the Trainer notices that the employee does not fully understand why the answer is not correct, he intervenes to add clarity prior to the test being retaken.” The facility added that it provides ongoing training and mentorship for new hires who may not yet feel comfortable performing physical holds. One former RISE employee who said he didn’t learn much about physical restraints in the training was Tommy Horton, a heavyset man with close-cropped hair. Working on the floor, he said, he saw some of his colleagues put kids in chokeholds or twist their arms and legs. Staff did it “because they could,” he said. Last July, Metcalf was arguing with staff members in the common area because she wanted to sit closer to the television, rather than in her assigned seat, she said. Frustrated, she walked away and took a seat in the corner. Several staffers crowded around her and told her to go to her room. What happened next, captured on video, violates federal and state rules on how to physically handle patients. All at once, Horton and two other men reach for Metcalf’s arms and begin pulling her away from where she’s sitting. As they tug on her wrists, Metcalf scrunches up her knees to stop herself from sliding across the floor and lies down on her back, shielding her face with her arms. For a moment, she tries to wriggle away, but almost immediately Horton and the other two large men overpower her, flipping her over so she is facedown. With her legs flailing, Horton leans the side of his body on her neck and head. Restraints in which a patient is pressed facedown against the floor are considered especially dangerous because of the risk of suffocation. While Metcalf is pinned facedown, the video shows, a nurse gives her a shot. Horton and another worker then lift Metcalf up by her arms. As they take her to her room, her legs drag behind her until a third man pushes her ankles together and folds her legs at the knee. Together they haul her off. “They picked me up like some sort of animal,” said Metcalf. After Metcalf was carried into her room, “it got even worse,” she told BuzzFeed News. “When we’re in the room, there’s no cameras and they can do whatever they want.” The techs leaned her over so that her abdomen pushed into the edge of the wooden bed frame, she said. “They were forcing my head into the bed so that I couldn’t breathe. That’s what they do.” Horton said that he hadn’t meant to drag Metcalf and he told the other employee to stop when he realized what was happening. This is when the third employee grabbed her legs. While reviewing the tape, he said that Metcalf was kicking, which is why they held her down before taking her to her room. Staff members, he said, wanted Metcalf to go to her room because another girl wanted to fight her. The 15-minute surveillance video does not show Metcalf interacting with any other patients. Horton said he recalled Metcalf was crying but was not in the room with her for long and did not see her pushed into the bed. Speaking generally, however, he said some staff members did hurt patients when they were escorted to their rooms. “When they get off camera, they beat people,” Horton said, referring to the other mental health workers. “It happened on all the units.” Hill Crest strongly denied any such pattern, stating that “no inspection or citation has ever alleged or revealed any evidence that improper restraints are conducted in patient rooms away from cameras.” Hill Crest said that the employees involved in the incident were assigned to mandatory retraining and that DHR investigated the incident and found that no abuse had occurred. Horton characterized that retraining as “no big deal.” He said it lasted about 30 minutes, after which he was asked to sign some papers stating that he knew how to do a proper restraint, he recalled. Later he was fired for what he said were unrelated reasons. Metcalf’s mother, Heather Todd, said she first heard about the incident at Hill Crest from her daughter shortly after it happened. “I got mad as hell, and I called up there and cussed everyone out,” she said. The hospital denied the incident had happened, Todd said. Her daughter was probably exaggerating, Todd remembered being told. A third parent, Meghan Parsons, said she was on the phone with her son Jordan while he was at Hill Crest earlier this year. As they were talking, she heard a man, who Jordan said was a staff member, tell her son, “Give me the phone now before I beat the fuck out of you,” followed by muffled sounds of him shouting. The line went dead. Immediately she called back, but her concerns were dismissed. She spent the night in agony, she said, wondering if her son was OK. Jordan told BuzzFeed News that on his side of the call, a tech pressed his face into the glass wall of the nurse’s station, punched him in his gut, and then restrained him. After that, he was given a sedative shot and taken back to his room. “At first they were telling me, ‘Jordan has a tendency to overexaggerate things,’” Parsons said. But she knew what she had heard. “I’m not crazy. Jordan ain’t crazy. I was on the phone with him — I heard my child physically attacked.” When a reporter showed Adryana Metcalf’s mother the surveillance video of her daughter being dragged and then carried facedown by three large men, the woman’s breath drew in sharply. “Oh my god,” she repeated in a low voice. After a pause, her voice grew louder and more insistent. “They told me, 'Oh no, it didn’t happen the way she said it did.' And that’s exactly what she said happened! She said, ‘Mama, they dragged me across the room. They sat on me.’” She couldn’t remove her daughter from the hospital because she didn’t have custody at the time of the incident. It was the same for Parsons, who heard her son being attacked. They both said they felt helpless. Hill Crest called the account of what Parsons heard during her phone call with her son “inaccurate, misleading and incomplete” but said the hospital could not provide specifics because it did not have a signed consent form to speak about his care. It added that the facility makes “good faith efforts” to communicate with parents, including “proactively updating parents” about “events affecting their child’s care.” Parsons, who has since regained custody of her son, recalled that day: “It’s just the worst feeling in the world, watching your kid in pain like that.” She now owes nearly $1500 in child support to the state for the time her son was in its custody. Todd, who is still fighting the state to regain custody of Metcalf, her oldest child, couldn’t help but wonder aloud after watching the video: “What good have y’all done having my daughter in all of these places?” Referring to Hill Crest and the state agency that placed her daughter there, she said, “All they did was fuck her life up.” When Nick Lafogg, 20, first came to Hill Crest after a stint in a juvenile detention center in 2014, everything seemed great. He could wear his own clothes, he said, and the food was pretty good. Lafogg recalled how Johnson, the clinical director, had told him things would be fun at Hill Crest, and they’d try to place him in a foster home within a few months. “After a week or so you start seeing the bad side,” said Lafogg. “You start to see staff being abusive.” Kids in state custody, as Lafogg was, may get sent to Hill Crest if they have a history of behavior issues. Some have been in juvenile detention. Others were victims of trauma and abuse. “They could not find me a foster placement that would take me because of what was on my juvenile record at the time, and they had to put me there,” he said. But some employees responded to the kids with more violence, said both staff and patients. Staff members “just see these kids as badass kids who don’t have home training and need things beat into them,” said one former Hill Crest employee. “I've seen them throw them on the bed and bend their leg up like over their head. I've seen them twist the foot sideways until they get the answer that they want.” Several employees pointed out that their young patients tended to have troubled histories. “We were working with kids off the street, kids who were in gangs, kids who have been abused since day one,” said Alison Bigham, a therapist who said Hill Crest gave quality care. “You can get in some violent situations with our kids because they’re very violent.” Other staff members said these were kids who had “nothing to lose,” who were “manipulative,” or who threatened staff — or actually hurt them, a point that some former patients confirmed. But young patients, who spent months or sometimes years at the facility, described Hill Crest as a place they were trying to survive. Some spoke about staff members they liked, often someone who had listened to their problems and made their time at the facility better. “I tried to pick out the staff who were trustworthy,” said Jessica Williams, 20, who came to Hill Crest after a foster family she had lived with for a couple of months decided to give her up. “They didn’t want me there, so they took me to Hill Crest. I was really depressed.” She said she learned to watch how the staff members interacted, avoiding the ones who fought with other employees or who “told lies on kids.” Many of the other patients interviewed and nearly a half dozen workers agreed that some employees picked on patients, looking for ways to provoke them in order to dole out punishments. Some of those sources said staff members also drugged patients to make them easier to manage — a violation of state rules — or resorted to violence. Staff treats patients “like members of an opposing football team,” said Jordan Parsons, Meghan’s son, who was released in July. “If you don’t act right, you get restrained. Basically that means they’re going to come in your room and get the crap beat out of you.” Fighting also broke out often among patients. When a code purple was called, alerting all available staff to an out-of-control patient, staff members sometimes escalated the conflict. “They would choke you, put you in a chokehold, they would sit on you,” said Jessica Evans, 19, who left Hill Crest earlier this year. “It happened a bunch of times.” She recalled seeing an employee break the arm of a resident during a restraint, an incident echoed in state reports. “There were some staff who thought they could do whatever,” she said. Hill Crest said “it does not condone nor tolerate utilization of chokeholds or intentional twisting of patients’ arms or legs during physical restraint episodes” and that its policies are consistent with applicable regulations. Sometimes these restraints — either a physical hold or a shot of sedatives — happened with little provocation, according to interviews. “There are kids that said one wrong thing and got kneed in the stomach,” Lafogg recalled. Other times, workers deliberately antagonized the residents, patients and some staff members said. “They would call us stupid, they would call us lame, they would call us all kinds of stuff,” said Parsons. Staff members saw it too. If patients “came in from school in a bad mood,” nurses “would pull up a shot and give it to them,” said one nurse who recently worked at the facility for a year. “The techs would come in: ‘So-and-so is getting me on my nerves watching TV and won’t quit talking; come over here and give her a PRN’” — a shot that could contain a sedative such as Ativan or an antipsychotic like Haldol. The nurse said she would decline these requests since under Alabama regulations, so-called chemical restraints are to be used only as a last resort — and never as a tool of punishment or as a substitute for treatment. The shots had powerful effects. Often they’d make kids go to sleep for the rest of the day. For Parsons, they were torture. “My tongue would get really, really thick,” he said. “Every time I tried to move my mouth there will be 13 or 14 seconds where I’m struggling to swallow so I can speak.” Drinking water helped, but sometimes the sensation would last for an entire day. He estimated he got as many as five or six shots a week. Hill Crest said it “wholeheartedly rejects any allegations that it inappropriately administers medicines for any non-clinically justified purpose and it has never received a citation alleging or revealing such conduct.” Because of the powerful shots and the daily medications, some patients said they missed days of school. Parsons said he was sedated so often that after he was released from Hill Crest, he had to attend summer school to make up for the education he had missed. When residents did make it to class, they attended Higdon Hill School, which consists of a few classrooms in the basement of Hill Crest’s main building. Alabama’s Department of Education paid more than a million dollars to the hospital over the last two years to provide specialty education for children in its care, according to figures provided by the department. But several former patients said the school did not provide any real education at all. “There were books but they were rarely opened,” said Lafogg. “It really wasn’t class — it was more like crossword puzzles and coloring sheets.” Hill Crest said Higdon Hill adheres ""to stringent curriculum requirements."" Both Lafogg and Williams, like others interviewed, tried to run away. Lafogg said he tried to bust through the window of his room to get out. (It didn’t work.) Williams said she managed to escape with a piece of glass tucked in her bra to defend herself. After a few hours, the cops picked her up and took her back to Hill Crest. The hospital told BuzzFeed News it was not required to report the incident because she was brought back to the facility before midnight, but they voluntarily notified her case worker. Parsons said he just tried to get through his time there without getting too depressed. But after a few months, he said, all he could think was that being at Hill Crest “has eradicated every ounce of happiness that I’ve ever had.” “An expectation to doctor the charts” Many current and former employees interviewed said they didn’t see incidents of outright abuse of patients by staff. But most said the demands of their job made it impossible to properly supervise patients or offer proper care. Several former nurses described overseeing as many as 30 — and in one case, 70 — patients at a time on their own, sometimes spread across multiple units. And since several of the adolescent units are located in stand-alone trailers out of the main building, for some this meant running back and forth between different buildings to make sure medicines were administered properly. “All you were doing is passing medication as fast as you could open it and then running to another unit and doing the same thing,” said one former longtime nurse. Ultimately, several nurses say, staff levels were not high enough to keep either patients or employees safe. “I was scared every weekend that something would happen to one of my patients,” said another nurse. Hill Crest did not answer specific questions about nurse-to-patient ratios, but said “Staffing is maintained at appropriate levels consistent with state and federal rules governing the levels of care at Hill Crest.” In addition, facilities were dirty and crumbling. In August 2015, county health department inspectors found roaches and gnats as well as dead rodents in traps. The following March, federal inspectors listed nearly two dozen items in the adult units that needed repair, including a hole in the wall, rotting wood in the windowsills, graffiti, and rust. They also cited the hospital for storing expired medication and not labeling some medications properly. Hill Crest said that any facility maintenance issues were “standard-level” and were promptly addressed. It also added that it has contracted weekly pest control services. Several staff members said they had stayed at Hill Crest for years because of kids at the hospital who needed help, even digging into their own pockets to provide appropriate supplies when the hospital came up short. A floor worker said she bought underwear for an adolescent girl who didn’t have any that fit her properly. Multiple nurses said they bought snacks because there often wasn’t a lot to hand out between meals. “The poor children would be hungry on the weekends,” said a former longtime nurse of the facility, who started bringing in boxes of apples. “I would tell them it’s bedtime, and they were crying and saying they’re hungry.” Hill Crest denies any shortage of supplies or food. Without proper supervision, patients also had greater opportunity to hurt themselves. In another 15-minute surveillance video, an adolescent walks into a small common area room alone. He throws a hoodie over the surveillance camera, but it slips off. As he takes a seat under the camera, his left wrist is still visible, and he begins to make stabbing motions at his arm and then his left leg. Blood spurts onto the floor and one of the chairs. After several minutes, a group of staff members come in, stop him, and begin cleaning up the cut",,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 on his arm and leg. For much of the video, which also shows a view of the hallway outside of the room, no staff members are visible anywhere. Hill Crest said that patient rounds were properly conducted. State agencies that oversee Hill Crest rate the hospital highly. Alabama’s Department of Mental Health, which licenses the main hospital, awarded Hill Crest a score of 100% across six of seven areas in its most recent site survey in May 2017. Among the areas where Hill Crest was awarded a perfect score was for the use of restraints and seclusion on its children's and adolescent units. And the Department of Human Resources, the state agency that licenses Hill Crest’s two group homes and oversees the state’s foster care system, found no major deficiencies in a recent site visit in May 2017. The Joint Commission, a national nonprofit that accredits hospitals, named Hill Crest as a top performer until 2014, the last year that designation was in use. But those outside assessments may not reflect the true conditions at Hill Crest. When the “Joint Commission came in, they’d pile the people in there and put so many people on the schedule to make it look like there was tons of staff,0, “but as soon as Joint Commission had come and gone it’d go back to the usual staffing.” A spokeswoman for the Joint Commission declined to comment about Hill Crest. The Department of Mental Health directed BuzzFeed News back to its most recent site survey of the facility. The Department of Human Resources told BuzzFeed News it could not comment on specific patients or complaints of abuse. Meanwhile state rules require Hill Crest to file a report any time a child in state custody is injured in the hospital’s care. Through a public records request, BuzzFeed News obtained the nearly 100 incident reports Hill Crest submitted to Alabama’s Department of Human Resources between 2014 and 2016. Only two of the reports suggested that employees had been responsible for any patient injury. A former therapist at the facility said that in order to protect the hospital, incident reports didn’t always include the full story of what happened. A former nurse also told BuzzFeed News that when an employee was injured by patients on her unit, she was asked to omit details and make it sound as if the unit were fully staffed. “I think there was an expectation to doctor the charts,” said Layne Williams, a former nurse who worked at Hill Crest for more than a decade and was sometimes assigned to shifts in the medical records department of the hospital to fill in charts that were incomplete. The nurse told BuzzFeed News she wouldn’t jeopardize her license by falsifying the records and only filled in what she knew to be true about a patient’s treatment. Three other former staff members said supervisors instructed them to fill in charts for patients they had no knowledge of or could no longer recall. This could mean falsifying or backdating anything from the quick check-ins that floor workers are supposed to perform on patients every 15 minutes to official medical charts. Submitting false claims to federal payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, violates fraud statutes. Hill Crest said it “strictly prohibits any employee from falsifying medical records.” It added that “it is the responsibility of each employee to use their professional judgment in ensuring their documentation is accurate and reflects the services they provided to the best of their knowledge.” UHS, which owns Hill Crest, describes itself as a management company with facilities that operate independently. But the company hires and oversees those facilities’ managers, controls budgets, and reaps profit margins as high as 28% last year from the hospitals. Its own corporate compliance policies state that it has the “ responsibility and authority ” to conduct any internal investigations into possible violations of state or federal laws, and it directs facilities to retain surveillance footage of any incident in which a patient is injured. It was still dark when Terry Young set out to make the 500-mile drive from his home in Jacksonville, Florida, to see his brother, who had recently been admitted to Hill Crest. Around 10 a.m., when he was just outside of Birmingham, a doctor called to tell Young his brother was dead. Arriving at the medical hospital where his brother had been transferred, Young saw “black eyes and bruises on his body,” he recalled. “That’s not normal” was all he could think, he said, and he immediately requested an autopsy. Ed Young, Terry’s brother, had arrived at Hill Crest less than a day earlier — May 7, 2015 — after a referral from Birmingham VA Medical Center to regulate his medications. Years before, he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but was stable as long as he was taking his medication. Young still lived on his own in Birmingham and had recently put a down payment on a new Buick, said his brother, whose family is now suing Hill Crest for medical negligence, assault and battery. Hospital records say that after Young was admitted, he became aggressive. “Patient continues to be loud, disruptive, attempting to kick staff,” said a nurse’s progress note written around 2 a.m. When Young refused to get up from his chair, staff escorted him to his room, where a nurse gave him a shot to calm his agitation. Young only slept a couple of hours that night. Just after 7 in the morning, a nurse’s note said he was “loud, disruptive, combative, aggressive and non-compliant” and had been placed in a physical restraint for at least 20 minutes. As he was held down, Young was given another shot and then transferred to the psychiatric intensive care unit. Just before noon, he was given an ice pack for “eye swelling possibly from earlier altercation with staff.” At 12:30, a worker wrote in Young’s chart that he was lying in bed quietly. An hour later, Young walked out of his room and sat on the table in the day room, while holding a plastic bottle in his hand, according to a note written by a mental health worker. When staff members came toward him, he became loud and started to curse, and then went into his room, the note said. Another note said the patient was “attempting to stab a mental health tech with a crushed plastic bottle.” A police report on the incident said that Young had fashioned “a weapon out of a water bottle and was acting strangely.” Surveillance video obtained by BuzzFeed News shows that Young was sitting on the table in the common area, then hurried into his room as two workers approached him. But in the video he is not holding any plastic bottle; his hands are empty. The two workers then follow Young into the room and are alone with him for about 20 minutes, except for two occasions in which a nurse enters. While Young was in his room, a nurse administered a third shot — 5 milligrams of Haldol, an antipsychotic medication; 100 milligrams of Thorazine, another antipsychotic; and 50 milligrams of Benadryl, records show. Within minutes Young became unresponsive and was lying on his side on the floor near his bed. The nurses called a code blue, ran to get a defibrillator, and started chest compressions. Responders from the Birmingham Fire Department arrived quickly, wheeling Young out on a stretcher to take him to the emergency room. A nurse there told Terry Young that his brother looked so bad that medical staff had called the police. Horton, the worker who had dragged Metcalf to her room, said the techs who went to Young’s room later bragged about “taking time beating” him. Following a few high-profile restraint deaths of patients in the late 1990s, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, now requires psychiatric hospitals to report any death that occurs within 24 hours of a patient’s physical or chemical restraint. These reports may trigger a federal survey to determine if there were any violations in standards of care or restraint and seclusion regulations. But federal surveyors never came to investigate Young’s death. They didn’t know about it. BuzzFeed News reviewed all reports of restraint-related deaths submitted by Alabama hospitals to CMS in 2015, the year Young died. There isn’t one about this incident. The federal agency confirmed the hospital did not report the death and that there was no investigation into the incident in 2015. The autopsy for Young showed that he had a black eye and contusions to the right side and the front of his head. It concluded that he likely died of hypertensive heart disease. The medical examiner classified the death as natural. Dr. Elizabeth Laposata of Brown University, an expert in restraint deaths who served as chief medical examiner of Rhode Island, reviewed Young’s records at the request of BuzzFeed News. She concluded that there was a glaring dearth of information. Laposata said a bad heart and manic behavior certainly are risk factors for cardiac arrest. But Hill Crest records give no details about how Young was physically restrained, nor do they include statements from staff about what happened in the minutes leading to his loss of consciousness. Laposata said the doses of drugs that Young was given were not inherently alarming, but that without those details, a standard part of a proper death investigation, it’s impossible to know what other factors could have contributed to Young’s death. Hill Crest referred questions about the incident to Martha Thompson, a lawyer representing the hospital in the lawsuit, who told BuzzFeed News that “Hill Crest denies the allegations in the Complaint, specifically the allegations of physical abuse or that Mr. Young’s death was caused by any actions at Hill Crest.” Cathryn Conn, the hospital's human resources director at the time of Young’s death, defended the care at Hill Crest and said that all incidents were investigated appropriately. She could not recall whether there was any investigation of this particular incident. “Just because he died in our hospital doesn’t mean that we did something wrong,” she said. On a blazing hot morning this past September, Hayden Vice — his leg no longer in a cast — appeared at the county courthouse dressed in orange sweats with “Property of Lamar County” across the chest. His wrists were in handcuffs and shackled to a chain at his waist. Now 17 years old, his dark hair had a shock of bleached blonde that tapered down to a V near the nape of his neck. His mother sat up straighter when she heard her son’s name called, and craned her neck from the back of the courtroom to get a look at him. On the inside of her forearm was a tattoo that read “I can’t unlove you.” Vice had spent the last few weeks in jail after he lost his temper and destroyed a television set. His mother said she pressed charges to keep him out of trouble. She worried he might get too out of control and hurt himself or someone else. Gilmore said Hill Crest left her son much worse off than when he was admitted. After she pulled him out of the facility, she said she got a call from Johnson, its clinical director. “I told him straight blunt how it was: They ruined his life,” Gilmore said. “The people he was supposed to trust to protect him and take care of him are the ones that hurt him.” Still, there are moments when Vice appears to be just like any other teen, goofing around and figuring out what he likes to do. When the judge informed him he could be released, he smiled broadly, shimmying his shoulders, drawing a few laughs from the people in the court’s pews. A few hours later, at the trailer near Tuscaloosa where he was living with his mother, he fiddled with the wiring of the stereo in his room, and said he was thinking about going to trade school for electrical work. But Vice, too, said his time at Hill Crest left him scarred. “It just made me want to fight all the time,” he said. “I felt like a dude on meth thinking people were trying to get after them.” He still can’t see very well out of his left eye, the one that was red from broken blood vessels after the rough encounter with Doughty, he said. “I haven’t even told my mom that.” As the sun began to fall on his first day of freedom, his mother smoked a Marlboro Black near the screen door. “Tell them the names they used to call you, Hayden,” she said. Vice leaned his head on her shoulder and took a drag of her cigarette. “I don’t like thinking about it,"” he said. “It brings up too many bad memories.” ● Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

ABC News,"The Latest on severe weather in the Midwest and other parts of the U.S. (all times local): 6:45 a.m. Sandbags are holding back floodwaters in parts of Michigan as a storm sweeps across the Midwest and Great Plans, bringing heavy rains, snow and ice.

The National Weather Service also issued flood warnings for parts of Missouri and Texas. In southwestern Michigan, sandbags were filled to protect homes and businesses in the village of Mattawan as the Mattawan Creek rose above its banks. In Indiana, homes and streets were flooded in the South Bend area, and forecasters predicted the St. Joseph River wouldn't crest until Thursday. Winter weather advisories are in effect for an area stretching from southwestern Illinois to Texas. ——— 12:35 a.m. Several states could see severe flooding and other weather-related problems amid a storm system that has brought rain, ice and snow to the Midwest and Great Plains. Melting snow and heavy rain prompted the National Weather Service to issue flood warnings for parts of northern Illinois and flood watches for central Illinois. The fear of a rising Illinois River forced the evacuation late Tuesday of the LaSalle County Nursing Home in Ottawa. Parts of Michigan's Lower Peninsula are seeing flooding and road closures.

Reuters,"(Reuters) ― The U.S. Southern Plains and Midwest braced for more flooding on Thursday as snow-melting temperatures and heavy rains swelled waterways after claiming the lives of at least two people, including a child, and forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Flood advisories were in effect until at least Sunday for low-lying parts of eastern Texas northeast across the region into southern Ohio and in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, the National Weather Service said. The flooding forced hundreds of people to place sandbags around their property and flee their homes in small communities like Niles, Indiana and Marseilles, Illinois that sit on rivers, already beyond their flood stages, that were not expected to crest for days. “We just got to wait for it to go down,” Terry Teeter said to WOOD-TV after installing pumps around his house in Mattawan, Michigan. “It’s going to be a couple of days like this.” A one-year-old girl died when she wandered into standing water in a backyard in Central Michigan and a 52-year-old woman was found dead in her car that was submerged in a ditch in Illinois, local media reported. Rising waters also forced some 19 people to evacuate their homes in Elkhart, Indiana, a community about 110 miles (175 km) southeast of Chicago, the local newspaper reported. “This city has not seen flooding like this in the last 45 years,” Elkhart Mayor Tim Neese said during a news conference, the Elkhart Truth reported. More rain was expected to fall on Thursday in the Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas where as much as 8 inches (20 cm) fell on Tuesday and Wednesday, closing roadways and schools. “We are still expecting heavy rain and flash flooding at least through the end of the week,” the National Weather Service said in a Tweet regarding the region.

Andrew Martonik,"One less caveat to deal with on Google's carrier. Project Fi has always been a great solution for those who use less than about 4GB of data per month, but now Google's giving the nod to people who want more. A new feature called ""Bill Protection"" effectively gives Project Fi users an unlimited data option, taking on the big carrier competition that has swung back to heavily promoting unlimited data plans. So here's how it works. From the start, everything is the same as it always has been. You pay $10 per month for each gigabyte of data you use, and any data you don't use you aren't charged for. But with Bill Protection, once you hit 6GB of data, or $80 for the month ($20 ""Fi Basics"" + $60 of data), your bill is capped — but you continue to get data service, just like a flat-rate unlimited plan from other carriers. Really, it's the best of both worlds. In months when you use less than 6GB of data, you only pay for the data you used. If you have a heavy month of usage and you crest over 6GB, it's all included and billed as a flat $80. Not only does that $80 figure line up nicely with the competition, but it also is effectively much lower since most unlimited plan users don't actually use over 6GB of data per month every single month. The only catch, as is always the case with ""unlimited"" plans, is that Project Fi does start to throttle speeds once you've hit 15GB of data usage for the month. At that point, your speeds drop to 256kbps. Somewhat counteracting that is the ability to switch back to full speed if you want to start paying again, at the usual rate of $10 per gigabyte. Other carriers start to throttle in the 15-25GB range (save for T-Mobile, which is even higher), and often don't offer any sort of full-speed buyout option, so it seems like a fine compromise to me. That 15GB of data usage on Fi used to cost you $170 for the month, too — and now it's just $80.","One less caveat to deal with on Google's carrier.

We Are The Mighty,"When looking at Iran's 65th Airborne Special Force Brigade, you might notice a few striking similarities — the yellow enlisted chevrons seem a lot like the the yellow chevrons on old Army greens, for example. Before the Iranian Revolution, their unit insignia looked a lot like the De Oppresso Liber crest that signifies the United States Army Special Forces. The distinctive green beret worn by the Iranians may not be the same shade of green worn by today's US Army Special Forces, but Iranian special operators wear green for a reason — they were trained by Americans. In the 1960s, the United States sent four operational detachments of Army Special Forces operators to Iran to train the Shah's Imperial military forces. The Mobile Training Teams spent two years as Military Assistance Advisory Group Iran. Before they could even get to Iran, the soldiers had to pass the Special Forces Officer course at Fort Bragg, then learn Farsi at the Monterey, Calif. Defense Language Institute. Only then would they be shipped to Iran to train Iranian Special Forces. It's been a long time since the 65th was a part of the Imperial Iranian Special Forces. Now called 65th NOHED Brigade (which is just a Farsi acronym for ""airborne special forces""), the unit's mission is very similar to the ones the US Special Forces trained them for in the 1960s. They perform hostage rescue, psychological operations, irregular warfare, and train for counter-terrorism missions both in and outside of the Islamic Republic. Inside the Iranian military, the unit is known as the "" powerful ghosts."" The nickname stems from a mission given to the 65th in the mid-1990s. They were tasked to take buildings around Tehran from the regular military - and were able to do it in under two hours. Since their initial standup with US Special Forces, Iran's 65th Airborne Special Force Brigade survived the 1979 Iranian Revolution, then they survived the brutal Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and now advise the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as they fight for the Iran-dominated Assad regime in Syria against a fractured rebellion. The legacy of the harsh but thorough training with American Green Berets continues in Iran. The current training includes endurance and survival in desert, jungle, and mountain warfare, among other schools, like parachute and freefall training, just like their erstwhile American allies taught so long ago.","Morteza Nikoubazl/Reuters The distinctive green beret worn by Iranian special forces looks strikingly similar to the ones used by US Special forces.

Mark Frauenfelder,"I watched the election results on TV last night with my family. As it became clear that the Democrats were going to win the House, some of the talking heads said the results of the evening overall did not indicate a ""blue wave."" I disagree. Despite Russian meddling, voter intimidation, voter suppression, and gerrymandering, the Democrats managed to overcome these obstacles and win. It's not surprising that Democrats didn't win the Senate. That system is rigged to favor conservative states with tiny populations. Why should Wyoming (pop. 573,720) get the same number of senators as California (39 million)? That's how we end up with the kind of minority rule situation we find ourselves in now. Look at this graphic from Huffington Post that someone screenshotted last night: Voters placed 36 million votes to win 41 Democratic senators, and only 29 million votes to win 51 Republican senators. It's a form of cheating that's been legalized. The good news is that in the House, 313 districts moved to the left, and only a few dozen moved to the right.

Rachel Premack,"A semi-truck normally just takes 10 weeks to produce. 
 But now, companies are waiting seven to eight months for their new truck, said Michael DiCecco, who is executive managing director of Huntington Bank's asset finance sector. 
 ""It's a pretty hefty backlog,"" DiCecco told Business Insider. 
 The last year has been anything but normal for the freight truck industry, leading to that long wait time. 
 A safety law cut truck driver capacity, forcing retail behemoths like Walmart to advertise for new truck drivers on television and overhaul their training process. Spot rates to move goods regularly broke records in 2018. And, as a result, consumer products ranging from the price for Amazon Prime to Hasbro toys to Tyson Foods meat crept up to make up for the skyrocketing cost of freight.

 Now, the freight market is slowing down, trucking analysts told Business Insider. Steve Tam, vice president of ACT Research, said order numbers for December were ""indicative of a normal or average market."" 
 ""Freight is still growing at this point,"" Tam told Business Insider. ""It's just that it's growing at a slower pace."" 
 While orders have slowed considerably from the three-digit year-over-year growth rates of 2018, the backlog of orders is still filling up. That wait time was around six months in August. Then it expanded to a surprising nine months in Q3 2018. Now, as companies have caught up to orders, it's back to around seven to eight months. 
Read more: New truck orders plunged by 43% in December, but trucking insiders remain strangely cheery
 In total, Tam said there's a backlog of around 300,000 trucks right now. Usually, it's around 80,000 to 100,000 units. 
 What that means for retailers, manufacturers, and others is that, even though orders have slowed, the production side still needs time to catch up to the craziness of 2018.","As the trucking industry comes down from one of the biggest boom years ever, there's still a massive backlog of semi-truck orders.

James Rogers,"The fossilized remains of a tiny duck-sized dinosaur with rainbow feathers have been discovered. Dubbed Caihong juji, which is Mandarin for ‘rainbow with a big crest,’ the dinosaur discovery was revealed in a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. The dino, which had a bony crest on its head, likely sported iridescent feathers on its head, wings and tail, according to paleontologists. The bright feathers were probably similar to a modern hummingbird’s feathers. EXPERTS MAKE INCREDIBLE TURKEY-SIZED DINOSAUR DISCOVERY “When you look at the fossil record, you normally only see hard parts like bone, but every once in a while, soft parts like feathers are preserved, and you get a glimpse into the past,” explained Chad Eliason, a postdoctoral researcher at The Field Museum and one of the study’s authors, in a statement. “The preservation of this dinosaur is incredible, we were really excited when we realized the level of detail we were able to see on the feathers.” An illustration of a reconstruction of the iridescent dinosaur which had rainbow feathers, named Caihong juji, unearthed in China, is shown in this October 31, 2016 photo released on Jan. 15, 2018. (Illustration by Velizar Simeonovski, The Field Museum/Handout via REUTERS) The specimen was found by a local farmer Qinglong County, Hebei Province, China and acquired by the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning in February, 2014. Eliason, who began work on the project as a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, explained that experts analyzed Caihong’s melanosomes, the parts of cells that contain pigment. “To find the color of Caihong ’s feathers, we compared its melanosomes with a growing database of thousands of measurements of melanosomes found in modern birds,” he said. DINO DESTRUCTION: VANDALS WRECK DINOSAUR FOOTPRINT Color is not only dictated by pigment, but by the structure of the melanosomes that contain the pigment. “Hummingbirds have bright, iridescent feathers, but if you took a hummingbird feather and smashed it into tiny pieces, you’d only see black dust. The pigment in the feathers is black, but the shapes of the melanosomes that produce that pigment are what make the colors in hummingbird feathers that we see,” said Eliason. The dinosaur is the earliest-known animal with asymmetrical feathers – a feature that modern birds use for steering in flight. Caihong, however, couldn’t fly – its feathers were probably used to attract mates and keep warm. Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Science, who co-authored the study, notes that, unlike modern birds, who have asymmetrical feathers on their wingtips, Caihong’s asymmetrical feathers were on its tail. “The tail feathers are asymmetrical but wing feathers not, a bizarre feature previously unknown among dinosaurs including birds,” he said, in a statement. “This suggests that controlling [flight] might have been first evolved with tail feathers during some kind of aerial locomotion.” DUCK-DINOSAUR HYBRID BAFFLES SCIENTISTS WITH MIXED-UP BODY The bony crest on Caihong’s head is also noteworthy when combined with its feathered features. “This combination of traits is rather unusual,” said study co-author Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin, in the statement. “It has a velociraptor-type skull on the body of this very avian, fully feathered, fluffy kind of form.” The international team that worked on the Caihong project was led by Dongyu Hu, a professor in the College of Paleontology at the Shenyang Normal University in China. Caihong is not the only dinosaur making headlines. In a separate announcement, paleontologists recently revealed the discovery of a new turkey-sized dino species in southeastern Australia.

Matt Novak,"Unilever, one of the largest consumer goods companies in the world, is threatening to pull advertising from Google, YouTube, and Facebook if the tech giants don’t rid their platforms of extremism, hate speech, and fake news. Unilever is particularly disturbed by its ads showing up in videos that sexualize and exploit children. Unilever owns everything from food brands like Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Hellman’s, Bertolli, and Lipton to personal hygiene brands like Dove, Vaseline, Axe, and St. Ives. And the company’s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, is expected to formally threaten to pull its advertising later today at the Interactive Advertising Bureau conference in Palm Desert, California, near Joshua Tree National Park. “Unilever will not invest in platforms or environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society, and promote anger or hate,” Weed is expected to say, according to a copy of his speech that was released to news outlets like The Guardian and Wall Street Journal. Whether the company actually does pull any ads remains to be seen., but threats from Unilever won’t be taken lightly. The company is the world’s second largest advertiser, right behind Proctor &amp; Gamble, the company that makes the other half of virtually everything Americans consume—with its brands like Crest, Herbal Essences, Dawn, Charmin, and Mr. Clean, just to name a few. Unilever spent $9 billion globally on advertising last year. And with more of those dollars moving to the digital space, Big Tech depends on those billions if it wants to keep growing. “As one of the largest advertisers in the world, we cannot have an environment where our consumers don’t trust what they see online,” Weed is expected to say. “And we cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain—one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers—which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.” A swamp? Where have we heard that kind of language before ? Digital platforms like YouTube, owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, have come under increased pressure during the past year to police content considered extremist or inappropriate for minors. Most recently, YouTube star Logan Paul has been disciplined over a video where he livestreamed the corpse of someone who had died by suicide in Japan. Paul took a short hiatus, before returning to taser a dead rat and perform mock CPR on a live fish. YouTube temporarily suspended ads on Paul’s channel as punishment. But it’s not just Logan Paul who’s causing headaches for these platforms. Advertisers are increasingly concerned about being associated with internet mediums that thrive on trickery. In some cases, kids are being tricked into watching disturbing, surrealist videos that are marketed as child-friendly. And in other cases, platforms like Google and Facebook are key drivers in spreading fake news. YouTube has tried to address its political problems by posting a notice to American users when they’re watching state-sponsored “propaganda” like the Kremlin-funded RT. But so far it hasn’t instituted similar warnings for propaganda outlets like Alex Jones’ Infowars and the White House’s favorite cheerleaders, Fox News, which spread dangerous conspiracy theories and racist hate. Just take a look at this awkwardly racist transition from Jesse Waters back in August of 2017 : Facebook has also had its share of problems involving financial scams, especially when it comes to get-rich-quick schemes like cryptocurrencies. To say nothing of the fake news (both foreign and home-grown) that has been rampant on Facebook during the Trump era. As the Wall Street Journal notes, Procter &amp; Gamble made a threat similar to Unilever’s last year, though change has come rather slowly when it comes to policing extremist content. At the time P&amp;G seemed most concerned that its ads were showing up on propaganda videos for ISIS. Long story short? The internet’s largest platforms are a mess and a company like Unilever might finally force companies like Google and Facebook to get their act together. The downside? It might not be such a great idea to have the makers of Dove deciding what adults can and cannot consume online. Logan Paul is bad, but I don’t know that Hellman’s Mayonnaise Hour should be the only alternative.

,"At a Glance Residents within a quarter mile of the Llano River in the city of Llano were urged to evacuate. Water rescues were reported Tuesday morning in Segovia, Texas. A bridge has collapsed after heavy rain in parts of south-central Texas triggered major flooding along several rivers and creeks, where evacuations and water rescues are underway. A section of the FM 2900 bridge collapsed in Kingsland on Tuesday morning, sending chunks of the bridge down the Llano River, according to a tweet. Residents within a quarter mile of the river in the city of Llano were urged to evacuate on Tuesday, according to a Civil Emergency Message. Authorities in Marble Falls told residents in several neighborhoods along the river to evacuate. The city is also asking residents to limit activities including laundry, washing dishes, using the toilet and taking showers because flooding was putting the city's wastewater plant under stress. The river rose to its second highest crest on record Tuesday morning in the city about 75 miles northwest of Austin and home to more than 3,000. According to the National Weather Service, many homes from Castell to below Llano are typically damaged by floodwaters when the river rises to that level. As much as 10 inches of rain had fallen in western Llano County in the 30 hours ending Tuesday morning, weather.com meteorologist Chris Dolce says. Farther west, water rescues were reported Tuesday morning in Segovia, prompting a flash flood emergency to be issued. The emergency will expire at 11 a.m. CDT. Eight rescues because of high water were completed in Gillespie County on Monday night, John Culpepper of the county's Office of Emergency Management told KXAN. The Lower Colorado River Authority announced Tuesday that it was closing several lakes to the public, including Travis, Marble Falls, LBJ, Inks and Buchanan. Water from the Johnson Fork Creek was flowing over Interstate 10 in Kimble County on Tuesday morning, according to the NWS.","The Weather Channel Texas Flooding Triggers Bridge Collapse; Evacuations, Water Rescues Underway The Weather Channel A bridge has collapsed after heavy rain in parts of south-central Texas triggered major flooding along several rivers and creeks, where evacua…",2018-10-16T14:44:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Texas Flooding Triggers Bridge Collapse; Evacuations, Water Rescues Underway - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-16-texas-flooding-evacuations,https://s.w-x.co/floodingkingsland_0.jpg,,Weather.com,crest,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Source data a, At the tissue level, clonality within the mandible during distraction (middle) is observed to occur in a highly linear and directional manner in parallel to the vector of distraction. By contrast, clonality observed in fracture (top) and distraction plus FAKi (bottom) was highly mesenchymal with less apparent organization in its morphology, indicating a nondirectional clonal proliferation. b, The cellular level: the developmental origin of the NCC-derived SSCs of the mandible (top), and the postnatal SSCs of the mandible (bottom) that are present in our experiments. During distraction the d - SSC (shown in pink) demonstrates plasticity and takes on an NCC- derived signature, whereas the f - SSC (purple) retains its postnatal SSC characteristics with no NCC signature. In the absence of FAK signalling, the d - SSC FAKi (green) reverts functionally and epigenomically to the fracture state without emergence of the NCC signature. NCC Prog indicates the premigratory (e8.5) NCC progenitor population; NCC Md indicates the postmigratory (e10.5) NCC population arriving within the mandible. c, At the chromatin level, distraction induces a gain in accessibility at promoters (P) of FAK-responsive NCC craniofacial genes through the activation of their enhancers (E), with a parallel gain in accessibility of retroviral elements near NCC-specific craniofacial enhancers. Thus mechanotransduction during mandible distraction unlocks FAK-responsive craniofacial enhancers, potentially through retrotransposons, enacting a developmental NCC program in d-SSCs similar to that of the e10.5 NCC Md population ( b ). This does not occur under fracture conditions (top) or during distraction plus FAKi (bottom). These differential epigenomic responses correlate with the degree of clonality and patterning seen in Rainbow mice ( a ) that occurs in response to distraction. Circled P represents phosphorylation.","Reversion of adult skeletal stem cells to a developmental state underlies the growth of new bone during jaw regeneration, in a process that relies on mechanotransduction via the focal adhesion kinase protein.",2018-10-24T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",Mechanoresponsive stem cells acquire neural crest fate in jaw regeneration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0650-9?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0650-9/MediaObjects/41586_2018_650_Fig1_HTML.png,,Nature.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Rivers and waterways, swollen after Florence’s historic deluge, rose dangerously across the Carolinas on Tuesday, closing roads, inundating communities, hindering rescue and repair efforts and preventing evacuees from returning home. Though slow-moving Florence has moved into the U.S. northeast, allowing glimpses of sunlight in the waterlogged state, at least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days, the state said. “One thing we know is that sunshine doesn’t necessarily mean safety,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a late-afternoon press conference and warned the 15,000 residents living in shelters against returning home too soon. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Florence, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane before it was downgraded, has already killed at least 33 people, including 26 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned some 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The White House said President Donald Trump would visit North Carolina on Wednesday. He was criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000. ‘DRIVING NOT ADVISED’ In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. “I haven’t been home since it started. I can’t get home either,” Chafin said. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised.” The Cape Fear River was also expected to keep rising in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has hampered efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow residents to homes. Florence dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” Cooper said. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, appeared with Cooper and said his agency would help restore power and open roads. “I think the next 48 hours are going to be incredibly critical,” he said. THOUSANDS OF RESCUES In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. More than 324,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina estimated on Tuesday 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 hogs died in the storm, exceeding the number killed in the state’s last major hurricane two years ago. Property damage from the storm is expected to range from $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence moved across western North Carolina early on Monday and continued to dump rain that has nowhere to go except to swell rivers, flood highways and homes, and threaten more lives as it heads towards Virginia and New England. For the water-logged Carolinas, “the worst is yet to come” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain, so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately,” he said. “Those rivers are going to start to crest later today and Tuesday and maybe longer.” Flash floods, landslide warnings and “prolonged significant river flooding” throughout the region will continue for the next few days, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by high flood waters early on Monday, tens of thousands of homes were damaged and at least 17 deaths were reported in North and South Carolina. Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, is expected to decline in force again on Monday before re-intensifying on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It has dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on North Carolina since Thursday and continued to produce heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the NWS said. An additional 2 to 5 inches of rain is expected with isolated areas of 8 inches possible through Tuesday in the Carolinas and Virginia. “The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference. More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said. Many rescues took place on swift boats in Wilmington, a coastal city of about 117,000 people on a peninsula between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews negotiated downed trees and power lines to reach stranded residents, Mayor Bill Saffo told WHQR radio. “There are no roads... that are leading into Wilmington that are passable because of the flooding that is taking place now inland,” Saffo said. Officials urged people who had been evacuated to stay away. “Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home, but you can’t come yet.” UNPRECEDENTED FLOODING In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 meters) over Highway 17 in what local people called unprecedented flooding. The sheriff’s department and volunteers rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets. Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable. More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. Florence set a state record for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous high of 24 inches (61 cm) from Hurricane Floyd which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather. The storm killed at least 11 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator. South Carolina’s governor urged anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate. “Those rivers in North Carolina that have received heavy rainfall are coming our way,” Governor Henry McMaster told a news conference. “They have not even begun (to crest). But they will. And the question is how high will the water be, and we do not know.” By 5 a.m. on Monday, Florence’s winds had dropped to about 30 miles per hour (45 kph), the NWS said, with weakening forecast over the next 24 hours before intensifying again as an extratropical low-pressure center.The center of the storm was about 125 miles (200 km) west southwest of Roanoke, Virginia and moving northeast at 13 mph (20 kph), the weather service said.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Large parts of Nebraska and the U.S. Central Plains were underwater on Saturday after a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm triggered historic flooding along the Missouri and Platte rivers, causing two deaths, tearing apart homes and swallowing roadways. 
The National Weather Service predicted dangerous flooding would continue through the weekend in Nebraska and in south and west central Iowa, particularly along the Missouri River. 
“We’re still in a very widely dispersed and intense flooding situation in the eastern third of Nebraska,” said Mike Wight, a spokesman for the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a phone interview. 
Nebraska has had two flood-related fatalities this week, Wight said. One person died at home after failing to evacuate, although the exact cause of death was unclear, authorities said, and the other was swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
The Missouri River was still rising on Saturday evening, local TV station KMTV reported, with a record crest of more than 47 feet expected early on Tuesday in Brownville, Nebraska, about 70 miles south of Omaha in the eastern corner of the state. 
“We’re looking at 4, 5, 6, 7 feet above the highest it’s ever been,” Wight said. 
The flooding came in the wake of what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm blew from the western Rockies to the Central Plains last week. 
The rising water has reduced stores and homes to rubble and ripped off a long chunk of a highway bridge, according to photos posted on Twitter by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Ranchers posted images on social media of their cattle being dug out of snowdrifts or stranded in fields. 
The flooding has all but blocked access to some small communities along the river, where potable drinking water has become scarce as the flood has contaminated wells, Wight said. 
Ricketts visited several flooded communities on Saturday and wrote on Twitter that he witnessed “unbelievable devastation.” 
“The whole state is pulling together as we respond to and recover from the ongoing #NebraskaFlood! #NebraskaStrong,” the governor tweeted.

By 6:15 the fire had reached 50 acres and I was already packing bags and calling my husband who is on business in Boston. By 6:30 I knew for sure we had to get out of there. I told our two nannies to wake up immediately and get their bags packed as well as the kids bags packed. I told them to pack as if we would never see this house again.” — Gwen Gottlieb “After dinner in Westlake, we were driving home down the grade and saw the red glow of the fires. It was awful and we just prayed for all in its path. Thirty minutes later we arrived in Ventura and the streetlights flickered. Then the entire city went dark. At that point we figured it was from the fires and headed inside. Not 20 minutes later I looked out my bedroom window and saw the red glow extremely close. I told my daughters we need to start gathering items as it must be spreading. Within minutes I saw the fire crest our hill and it was panic.

Jason G. Goldman,"One of the most impressive scenes in the world of birds is a peacock displaying its impressive, iridescent feathers, technically known as its train. While the female peahen looks on, the peacock spreads his train out and ruffles it back and forth as the sun highlights the red, blue, and green within the feathers. 
[Train rattling sound]
But these iconic trains are only half of the story of how the boys impress the ladies. Both male and female peafowl sport crests on their heads, small feathers that stick straight up, like a mohawk. 
""The crest feathers that actually give the peacocks' their Latin name, they're called Pavo cristatus, the crested pheasant. And so I was intrigued by the fact that people didn't really know what the function of these crests were.""
Haverford College physicist Suzanne Kane.
A biologist might see those feathers and assume they are visual signals, but as a physicist, Kane had a different idea.
""We were curious in my laboratory about whether the preferred vibrational properties of the crest feathers might, by any chance, agree with the preferred vibrational properties of this train-rattling display that the males do.
So the Kane and her colleagues exposed crest feathers from preserved, dead peafowls to simulated displays of male and female social behaviors, like wing-shaking and train-rattling. 
""And so we were just gobsmacked to find out that they did agree."" 
What all that means is that the peafowls' head crests are specifically tuned to the vibrations produced by the train-rattling of its own species. The crests thus act like a sort of special antenna meant to pick up a single kind of sound. The findings are in the journal PLOS ONE. [Suzanne Amador Kane et al. Biomechanics of the peafowl's crest reveals frequencies tuned to social displays]
The researchers also point out that there are at least 35 other types of birds, distributed across ten taxonomic orders, that have both head crests and displays with a vibration component. 
""A lot of those tactile aspects of displays are really not even very well described.""
University of British Colombia zoologist Roz Dakin, who worked with Kane on this study.
""There are species that dance and vibrate on perches, and the female's sharing the same perch as the male, and feeling what's going on through parts of her body like her feet. There are species where birds rub feathers on each other… What we're suggesting here is that a sensory function of feathers in social displays may be more widespread than we appreciate right now.""
Seems that the females really do feel something about a particular peacock.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"KINSTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Residents in Georgetown County, South Carolina, where five rivers flow into the ocean, will prepare on Friday for a deluge of water in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people. Lying on Atlantic Ocean between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, the county of about 60,000 people is one of several areas across the Carolinas waiting anxiously for rivers to crest, a week after Florence dumped some three feet of rain in the region. Flooding could begin early next week, officials said during a community meeting on Thursday. The city of Georgetown on Friday will hand out 15,000 sandbags as the county develops plans to evacuate residents. “Please heed the warnings,” Sheriff Lane Cribb said. “Protecting lives and property will be our goal... You better pray. I think we all need to pray that it don’t happen.” More than three dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding. Some rivers had still not crested by Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Thirty-one deaths have been attributed to the storm in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Some 4,700 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. About 10,000 remain in shelters. The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina, remained cut off by floodwaters on Thursday. More than 200 roads across the state were closed or blocked as residents. Over 60,000 customers were without power in North Carolina early on Friday, according to Poweroutage.us. As floodwaters continue to rise, concerns are growing about the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, creating a risk that standing water will be contaminated, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

PARUL SEHGAL,"The play follows three brothers, played by Josh Charles, Armie Hammer and Paul Schneider. Their mother, now dead, was determined that her sons grow up without a sense of entitlement. She even retrofitted a game of Monopoly to give them an idea of the advantages they were born into. She called it “Privilege,” and it featured rules like losing money for being white when you passed Go. Of all her sons, Matt (played by Schneider), the oldest and brightest, took her message most to heart. He was his family’s golden boy, who went to Harvard but has chosen to return home to care for his elderly father (Payne) and take a menial job at a community organization. At dinner, Matt suddenly bursts into tears, which sends his father and brothers into a panic. For all their liberal pieties, we see the full measure of the confusion and disgust with which they view his decisions. Matt is accused of martyring himself to minorities. “All our lives, guys like us have been told to get out of the way so that ‘other’ people can have a chance. Matt’s actually doing what they want!” his brother Jake, a banker, says. “You’re making yourself invisible the way you think we’re supposed to!” Matt stays mostly silent as his family’s arguments crest and crash around him. He responds later, in slightly Bartleby fashion, that he is just trying to find a way “to be useful.” “Straight White Men” looks like an Arthur Miller play and acts a bit like an Arthur Miller play, with its conflict between fathers and sons, between desire and obligation, between self and community. But it withholds some of the key satisfactions for which we go to Miller (or much of theater): motive, psychology, resolution. The play is, in fact, so open, so hospitable to interpretations, that every cast and crew member I talked to described a jarringly different production. For Kate Bornstein, the play drives home how all identities are becoming more capacious and can be transgressed: “We’re talking about people who genuinely question their own privilege and do something about it,” she said. “There are heterosexual white males who are fabulous — we’ve got four of them in the play. I wouldn’t call them straight white men.” For Armie Hammer, “this is an inflammatory play. You’re going to have straight white men who go see this and have to be confronted with the reality of their existence.” Paul Schneider had yet another take: “Regardless of race, gender or sexuality, for me all stories boil down to what our parents did or didn’t do to us.” “Straight White Men” was staged in 2014 at the Public Theater to warm reviews — Charles Isherwood, writing in The Times, called it “mournful and inquisitive.” But Lee worries about its reception today. The play lands in a season when President Trump’s travel ban has just been upheld, immigrant families are being torn apart at the border, reproductive rights are under attack and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people are being energetically rolled back. The most salient fact about identity politics these days seems less that some straight white men feel diminished by its existence than that the identity politics of some straight white men threaten the existence of so many others. Lee told me she believes that her very decision to write about the plight of middle-aged, upper-middle-class, straight white men — to “center their experiences,” she said — might be enough to trigger a backlash. Schneider called her one night, wanting to discuss his character, and mentioned that one of his friends, a person of color, had read the play and said it was potentially dangerous. She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations, which it clearly already has. But she won’t deny that it feels particularly risky to stage it now, when “there is something dangerous about not just clearly demarcating the lines of combat, taking a side and fighting on that side.” The art that seems to speak most to the mood of the moment has that flavor — of getting in formation, of fighting the power. Take the movie “Sorry to Bother You,” by Boots Riley, the Oakland-based rapper and activist, a science-fiction workplace comedy that’s also a love letter to labor organizing. Or “Nanette,” a new Netflix standup special by Hannah Gadsby, a rousing commentary on the #MeToo movement and the price of silence exacted on women and minorities. “The story is as you have told it — power belongs to you,” Gadsby says, addressing straight white men. Lee allies herself with these conversations (and Riley is a hero of hers), but she stands slightly apart, asking unpopular questions, like what would really change if power were to simply switch hands. “I don’t hope for a future in which our existing structures stay the same, but I am the one on top,” she wrote in a Facebook post about the slogan “The Future Is Female.”",The first female Asian-American playwright on Broadway takes aim at identity and watches the audience squirm.,2018-07-18T09:00:08Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Feature: Young Jean Lee’s Unsafe Spaces,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/magazine/young-jean-lees-unsafe-spaces.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/22/magazine/22mag-lee-image1/22mag-lee-image1-facebookJumbo.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jennifer Ouellette,"Enlarge / Gently swirling a glass of wine creates a single, smooth crest, mixing in oxygen to enhance the flavor. reader comments 0 Wine aficionados are known for gently swirling their wine in the glass before tasting, and it isn't as pretentious as it seems. (Well, maybe a little.) They claim the rotation mixes in oxygen and enhances the flavor. Physics backs them up, specifically a mini-subfield dubbed ""oenodynamics."" The swirling action—technically called ""orbital shaking""—creates a rotating gravity wave in the direction of the swirling force being applied, churning up the liquid in the process. It's often said that science begins with someone noting an unusual effect and thinking, ""Huh... that's funny""—and then investigating to find out more. Such was the case for a coterie of wine-swirling physicists. Several years ago, Martino Reclari, then a graduate student at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, was out to dinner with colleagues when the conversation turned to the different kinds of wave dynamics they could produce by swirling their wine glasses: one big smooth wave, a series of smaller ripples, or a splash, for instance. Not content to leave it at the dinner table, they performed a series of experiments in the ensuing weeks by filling small cylinders of varying sizes with different volumes of a modest merlot. They used gyrating machines commonly found in chemistry labs to swirl the wine in the cylinders, duly noting how various factors affected the behavior of the wine. They identified three factors at work: the ratio of the level of wine in the glass to the glass's diameter; the ratio of the glass's diameter to the width of the circular shaking; and the ratio of the primary forces acting on the wine: one pushing the liquid to the outside, the other forcing the liquid back down. So by tweaking how much wine you pour in a glass and whether you swirl it in wide or tight circles, you can create different kinds of wave dynamics in the glass (detailed in the video below). That work became Reclari's PhD thesis. It's not limited to analyzing your glass of wine, either. The formula he and his colleagues devised works for any fluid container size, most notably the bioreactors used to mix large batches of nutrients when cultivating cells in the lab. A recent paper by a team of Parisian scientists extended the analysis to beer, with surprising results. Unlike wine, beer has a head of foam, and while you might expect that foam to move in the same direction as the swirling motion, the opposite is true. It rotates in the opposite direction. The same thing happens with cappuccino foam, tea scum, and a powder floating on the surface, like cinnamon, under the right circumstances. The original 2011 paper on the physics of wine swirling inspired a limerick contest (physicists love a good limerick almost as much as they love a good wine) in the Annals of Improbable Research, which holds the Ig Nobel Prizes every year. Here is our favorite entry: They use several metrics to show The circular motion and flow Of wine as it swirls, As it whirls and it twirls, Although why, I am too drunk to know.

CBS News,"LOS ANGELES -- The devastating blaze that broke out in the densely-populated Sepulveda Pass area last week was caused by a cooking fire, authorities announced Tuesday. The Los Angeles Fire Department stated that arson investigators determined the Skirball Fire -- which broke out in the early-morning hours of Dec. 6 -- was caused by a cooking fire at an encampment in a brush area near the Sepulveda Pass and the 405 Freeway. CBS Los Angeles reports that when firefighters arrived on scene that morning, no one was found in the area, LAFD reports. No arrests have been made. It was unclear if the blaze was considered intentional in nature. LAFD cites the National Park Service as saying that approximately 90 percent of wildfires nationwide are human-caused. The 422-acre Skirball Fire broke out at 4:50 a.m. Dec. 6 on the east side of the 405 Freeway near Mulholland Drive. It destroyed six homes and damaged 12 others, and at one time prompted the evacuation of about 700 homes and an apartment building. It also shut down the 405 Freeway for several hours. One firefighter suffered neck burns and was treated at a hospital, authorities said. Another firefighter suffered minor injuries. As of Tuesday, the fire was 85 percent contained, CBS Los Angeles reports. About 70 firefighters were still working to fully extinguish the blaze. All mandatory evacuation orders were lifted Sunday afternoon for all areas affected by the Skirball Fire. All road closures were also lifted, with no restrictions in place. At its height, evacuation orders covered a 3.2-square-mile area bounded by Mulholland Drive to the north, Sunset Boulevard to the south, the San Diego Freeway to the west and Roscomare Road on the east. The exception to the evacuation order was the Bel-Air Crest housing development, which was not threatened, according to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. The Getty Center and the nearby Skirball Center, both on the west side of the freeway, reopened Friday, when classes at UCLA, Cal State Northridge, Los Angeles Valley College and Santa Monica College resumed. All Los Angeles Unified School District schools in the San Fernando Valley and some on the west side of Los Angeles -- a total of 265 district schools and charter schools -- were closed Thursday and Friday. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District closed all of its schools Wednesday and Thursday. The fire burned in the same general area as the devastating Bel-Air Fire of 1961. That blaze destroyed about 500 homes and led to various policy changes, including a prohibition on wood-shingle roofs and the strict requirement to clear brush around properties.","CBS News Illegal cooking fire caused devastating Skirball Fire in Southern Calif., officials say CBS News LOS ANGELES -- The devastating blaze that broke out in the densely-populated Sepulveda Pass area last week was caused by a cooking fire, authorities anno…",2017-12-12T21:40:00Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}","Illegal cooking fire caused devastating Skirball Fire in Southern Calif., officials say - CBS News",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/skirball-fire-cause-illegal-cooking-fire-los-angeles-fire-department/,https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/12/66404cce-d2d9-4a90-a75a-7303855574b3/thumbnail/1200x630/e5542b1b6a542a8a0f2e3fb57d503ca4/gettyimages-887097084.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stef Schrader,"Colin’s Crest is one of the most delightful parts of Rally Sweden. Every year, the organizers have a mini competition on the Vargåsen stage as to who jumps the farthest over one particular crazy fast jump. Hyundai driver Thierry Neuville didn’t win the Colin’s Crest Award, but his jump was insane for other reasons. Neuville’s aim was a bit off over Colin’s Crest this year, sending him perilously close to the big snow berm on the side of the stage road. The passenger side of his car dipped down mid-jump and I think my butt cheeks involuntarily tightened into a full-on pucker just watching this, and I wasn’t in the car. Neuville kept his foot in it, though, and didn’t just save the car from rolling over on landing—he went on to win Rally Sweden. This year’s Colin’s Crest winner was Citroën driver Mads Østberg with a legitimately insane 42-meter jump—enough to give him a second Colin’s Crest win in a row. As you can tell by the supercut of jumps above, Neuville wasn’t the only driver whose aim was a little off, although his landing was definitely the worst. The all-time Colin’s Crest record, however, wasn’t set by one of the main World Rally Championship cars but Eyvind Brynildsen’s Ford Fiesta R5 running in the feeder WRC2 series. Brynildsen’s record-breaking 45-meter jump in 2016 was enough to shame Elon Musk’s puny space-car for needing rocket asssitance to break into orbit. Here’s some more Rally Sweden footage from this year, just because we can’t get enough sweet jumps and drifts.","Colin’s Crest is one of the most delightful parts of Rally Sweden.

Tom Breihan,"We’re a mere couple of weeks away from the release of the new Mountain Goats album In League With Dragons. Bandleader John Darnielle has said that he hopes the album, a sort of concept LP about a small town ruled by a wizard, will kick off a whole new genre called “dragon noir.” We’ve already heard a couple of songs from the album, “Younger” and “Cadaver Sniffing Dog.” And now he’s shared another new one called “Sicilian Crest,” and he’s also shared a whole lot of things about the writing and recording of “Sicilian Crest.”
Last year, Darnielle and Night Vale host Joseph Fink teamed up for I Only Listen The The Mountain Goats, a podcast wherein Darnielle and Fink discuss Darnielle’s work, with a whole lot of digression built into the thing. For the podcast’s first season, they went over every song from All Hail West Texas, the Mountain Goats’ classic 2002 album. (This also led to a tribute compilation.) And they recently launched the second season, which gets deep into the creation of In League With Dragons. Today, there’s a new episode, which traces every stage of “Sicilian Crest,” right from when Darnielle first wrote it and recorded a demo with his young son helping out.
Musically, “Sicilian Crest,” the last song on the album, is grand and lush, built from a florid piano and from a whole lot of tense, explosive Jon Wurster drum work. By the time the song really gets going, we also get triumphant early-’90s adult contemporary synths and big, near-orchestral surges of sound. The lyrics play out as some kind of absurd, overblown prophecy: “Drench a kitchen rag in the heretic’s blood / Wash the windows and prepare for the flood.” Check it out below.
On the song, Darnielle says:
“Sicilian Crest,” lyrically, is more reminiscent of early Mountain Goats than anything since a couple of the songs on Heretic Pride — but began life as an in comprehensible title in a notebook, has its genesis in playing around at the piano with my son while a Moridira Hurricane and a Fender Twin on standby stood close at hand, and ended up being a cryptically political dance number with shades of New Order or the Alarm. My bandmates are going to kill me for referencing The Alarm in this announcement, and one of them will kill me twice if I don’t mention that the Alarm’s drummer’s name was “Twist.” So, should the worst come to pass, please enjoy my funeral, and in the meantime please enjoy this episode of I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats.

Driver Barrett Riley, of Fort Lauderdale, and front seat passenger Edgar Monserratt Martinez, of Aventura, were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, said Detective Tracy Figone. Backseat passenger Alexander Berry, of Fort Lauderdale, was ejected from the car on impact and was taken to Broward Health Medical Center. His condition was not known. Police said the gray 2014 Tesla Motors Model S may have been speeding southbound in the 1300 block of Seabreeze Boulevard when it drove off the roadway and struck a concrete wall about 6:46 p.m. Tuesday. Riley and Martinez were trapped inside the burning wreckage, said Battalion Chief Greg May, of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue. Some witnesses said they tried to rescue the victims but the flames were too intense. Neighborhood resident Wendy Mascolo told WFOR-Ch. 4 that she heard the violent crash when it happened and ran to help. “These parents, they got the worst call of their lives and their lives are never going to be the same,” she said. Pine Crest students and staff were in shock and devastated, said president Dr. Dana Markham. “Our school’s crisis team immediately came together last night,” she said, Wednesday morning. “We have more than a dozen counselors here to support students as well as faculty.” Tesla has been under scrutiny before over several instances of vehicles catching fire.

The new Crest Apartments for the Skid Row Housing Trust transformed an existing open site in suburban Los Angeles into a 64-apartment complex for formerly homeless veterans. Located on a busy thoroughfare near two freeways, the project introduces a new density in the neighborhood with easy connections to public transportation and area resources. The client’s permanent supportive housing model includes individual efficiency apartments with on-site social services and community spaces. These combined programs effectively support the highly vulnerable residents in an effort to reduce chronic homelessness. © Iwan Baan Second Floor Plan © Iwan Baan The building’s arching form stretches the length of the site, creating a sheltered courtyard with tiered terraces above that include open-air outdoor corridors and an expansive ground level landscape zone. The low points of the mass touch down at both the front and back of the site, ensuring a strong volumetric relationship to the smaller scale single-family residences behind the property and the larger commercial facades running along the boulevard. Inviting and light-filled spaces throughout the building form a network of healthy community connections that support residents within the building and build social connections to the city beyond. The lobby and reception area is positioned in the front to welcome in both residents and visitors alike. Additional shared spaces and community resources on the ground level include the residents’ lounge, community kitchen, laundry room, conference room, social service offices, health clinic, and an outdoor community garden. Individual studio apartments on the four upper residential floors that hover over the ground plane incorporate natural light, cross ventilation, and views to both the circulation corridors and the city. © Iwan Baan The architectural and landscape design forms a symbiotic relationship that enables the efficient use of natural materials. Strict code and program requirements prompted the design team to think of the ground plane as a flexible zone that can accommodate required parking and fire lanes while also providing informal open spaces for residents. By integrating landscape materials such as permeable pavers that can withstand various loads, the demarcation between hardscape, softscape, and functional requirements are blurred to create an interchangeable ground surface. The pervious surface enables rainwater filtration into two bioswales below the parking area. Drought resistant trees and plantings will be used extensively. © Iwan Baan The project was certified LEED for Homes Platinum by the U.S. Green Building Council. Windows in each unit provide ample natural light and air. Units are equipped with Energy Star-rated refrigerators and range hoods, bio-based marmoleum composition floors, high efficiency bathroom fixtures, and tile made from recycled content.

Starting today on Madewell’s website, some Nordstrom stores, and Nordstrom.com, Madewell will offer T-shirts, sweatshirts, and jackets. The men’s collection will also focus heavily on denim–something Madewell is known for–and will feature 21 different styles in three fits. The price point will be similar to the women’s line, with T-shirts starting at $39.50 and jeans starting at $115. The entire line is inspired from Madewell’s roots company–founded in 1937–that made workwear for men. [Photo: courtesy of Madewell] In 2004, J.Crew’s former CEO, Mickey Drexler, purchased the then-defunct Madewell brand, transforming it into a casual womenswear brand. It has thrived over the last couple of years, even as J.Crew sales spiraled downwards. Last year, Drexler left, along with longtime creative director Jenna Lyons. Last July, Jim Brett–who previously served as CEO of home brand West Elm–was appointed as J.Crew’s CEO. He’s led a couple of big initiatives at J.Crew, including making products available on Amazon. Selling menswear at Madewell is another big change. And it’s unclear whether men will be eager to buy from a brand that has so far been associated with women. To launch this new collection, Madewell will hold a pop-up at Crest Hardware in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, from Friday, September 14, to Sunday, September 16.

M., Harland, R., Rape, M.","Structured Abstract Abstract Aberrant complex formation by recurrent interaction modules, such as BTB domains, leucine zippers, or coiled coils, can disrupt signal transduction, yet whether cells detect and eliminate complexes of irregular composition is unknown. By searching for regulators of the BTB family, we discovered a quality control pathway that ensures functional dimerization [dimerization quality control (DQC)]. Key to this network is the E3 ligase SCF FBXL17, which selectively binds and ubiquitylates BTB dimers of aberrant composition to trigger their clearance by proteasomal degradation. Underscoring the physiological importance of DQC, SCF FBXL17 is required for the differentiation, function, and survival of neural crest and neuronal cells. We conclude that metazoan organisms actively monitor BTB dimerization, and we predict that distinct E3 ligases similarly control complex formation by other recurrent domains.","Many metazoan proteins form oligomers, which is often mediated by modular domains such as BTB domains.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Michael Biesecker), Michael Biesecker","Duke Energy said Saturday night that heavy rains from Florence caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said about 2,000 cubic yards of ash were displaced at the L. V. Sutton Power Station outside Wilmington and that contaminated runoff likely flowed into the plant's cooling pond. The company has not yet determined whether the weir that drains the lake was open or if contamination may have flowed into the Cape Fear River. That's roughly enough ash to fill 180 dump trucks. Florence slammed into the North Carolina coast as a large hurricane Friday, dumping nearly three feet of rain and swelling the region's rivers. The resulting flooding forced swift-water rescues and left several people dead. Sheehan said the company had reported the incident to state and federal regulators ""out of an abundance of caution."" The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and the company has been excavating millions of tons of ash from old waste pits and removing it to safer lined landfills constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Duke has been under intense scrutiny for the handling of its coal ash since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles of the Dan River in gray sludge. In a subsequent settlement with federal regulators, Duke agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from coal-ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. The company is in the process of closing all of its coal ash dumps by 2029. In this June 23, 2014 file photo, the dried-up bed of an inactive coal ash pond is seen at Duke Energy's Sutton plant in Wilmington, North Carolina. Mike Spencer/The Star-News via AP Spokeswoman Megan S. Thorpe at the state's Department of Environmental Quality said state regulators will conduct a thorough inspection of the site as soon as safely possible. ""DEQ has been closely monitoring all coal ash impoundments that could be vulnerable in this record breaking rain event,"" Thorpe said. She added that the department, after assessing the damage, will ""hold the utility accountable for implementing the solution that ensures the protection of public health and the environment."" There are at least two other coal-fired Duke plants in North Carolina that are likely to affected by the storm. The H.F. Lee Power Station near Goldsboro has three inactive ash basins that flooded during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, exposing a small amount of coal ash that may have flowed into the nearby Neuse River. The old waste pits are capped with soil and vegetation intended to help prevent erosion of the toxic ash beneath. The Neuse is expected to crest at more than nine feet above flood stage Monday and Sheehan said the company expects the same ash basins are likely to be inundated again. At the W. H. Weatherspoon Power Station near Lumberton, Sheehan said it had already rained more than 30 inches by Saturday evening, causing a nearby swamp to overflow into the plants cooling pond. The Lumber River is expected to crest at more than 11 feet above flood stage Sunday, which would put the floodwaters near the top of the earthen dike containing the plant's coal ash dump. Environmentalists have been warning for decades that Duke's coal ash ponds were vulnerable to severe storms and pose a threat to drinking water supplies and public safety. ""Unfortunately, Duke Energy has spent years lobbying and litigating and still has not removed the coal ash from its dangerous riverfront pits in the coastal area, some of which are in the floodplain,"" said Frank Holleman, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center who has battled the company in court. He added: ""When a hurricane like Florence hits, we have to hope and pray that our communities do not suffer the consequences of years of irresponsible coal ash practices by the coal ash utilities.""","Matt Born/The Star-News via AP Duke Energy said Florence's heavy rains caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast.

Issie Lapowsky,"A wave of antitrust interest is washing over Europe and much of the United States, and Spotify is riding its crest.
The Swedish audio-streaming giant lodged a complaint against Apple with the European Commission on Wednesday, accusing the company of abusing its position as owner of the App Store to stifle competition. Specifically, Spotify says that by charging a 30 percent tax on in-app purchases, Apple forces app developers to make an impossible choice: Either pass those costs on to consumers, or refuse to pay the commission and face a litany of technical hurdles imposed by Apple. Spotify, which competes directly with Apple Music, argues that this constitutes an unfair advantage for Apple.
""Let me be clear that this is not a Spotify-versus-Apple issue,"" Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek wrote in a blog post. ""We want the same fair rules for companies young and old, large and small. It is about supporting and nurturing the healthy ecosystem that made our two companies successful in the first place.""
The Commission has received a complaint by Spotify, which we are assessing under our standard procedures, a spokesperson for the Commission said. Apple did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.
Determining what a healthy ecosystem should look like, particularly for the tech industry, has been a popular topic for debate lately. In the US, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is taking on the issue as part of her run for President. In a much-discussed policy proposal released last week, Warren said she wants to prohibit tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon from being participants on the platforms they own. Her plan, which was applauded by anti-monopoly groups like Open Markets Institute, would prevent Amazon, for instance, from selling Amazon-branded products on its own marketplace, and would require Google's ad exchange and Google Search to be split apart. Over the weekend, at South by Southwest, Warren explained that such a plan would also mean breaking up Apple and the App Store. ""Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They dont get to do both at the same time,"" she said.
That suggestion elicited swift criticism, including from Stratechery's Ben Thompson. ""Is Senator Warren seriously proposing that smartphone be sold with no apps at all? Was Apple breaking the law when they shipped the first iPhone with only first-party apps?"" Thompson wrote. ""At what point did delivering an acceptable consumer experience out-of-the-box cross the line into abusing a dominant position? This argument may make sense in theory but it makes zero sense in reality.""
Spotify's complaint takes a different approach. Rather than arguing that Apple shouldn't own the App Store, Ek is seeking changes to Apple's conduct on the App Store. Right now, he says, apps like Spotify that don't pay a 30 percent commission to use Apple's in-app payment system are penalized in certain ways. They're prohibited, for instance, from emailing their own users directly or enabling them to upgrade to premium services inside the app. Ek isn't suggesting anything as radical as Apple giving up the App Store entirely. Instead, he's asking that all apps have control over which payment systems they use and have the ability to communicate with their users directly. He also asks for all apps to comply with the same rulesincluding Apple Music.
Ek's brand of antitrust argument may be more appealing to US regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice who are wary of overly disruptive action, says Martin Gaynor, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and former director of the FTC's Bureau of Economics. ""There's a set of very, very strong policy recommendations Sen. Warren has put out. Many of them, particularly breakups, I would describe as last resorts,"" Gaynor says. ""Never use a sledgehammer when a pocket knife will do.""
Ek also points out specific ways that Apple's behavior could result in increased prices for consumers. If Spotify were to pay Apple's commission, he says, it ""would force us to artificially inflate the price of our Premium membership well above the price of Apple Music."" That's important because antitrust law in the United States places a major emphasis on how competition affects consumer pricing. Tech trade groups have used this consumer welfare standard to criticize Warren's proposal.
""Breaking up large Internet companies just because they are large wont help consumers,"" Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said in a statement last week. ""It will hurt them by reducing convenience, reducing quality of service and innovation, and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services.""
Apple has faced antitrust enforcement action in the past over its impact on market costs. In 2012, the Department of Justice accused Apple of conspiring with publishers to raise the prices on their e-books and withhold books from Amazon's Kindle platform, which had imposed a $9.99 flat rate on e-books. Apple fought the charges, but ended up paying $450 million in fines after losing in the Supreme Court.
Ek argues that Apple is, once again, using its market position to drive up costs by effectively requiring app developers to push Apple's fees on to consumers. And by preventing Spotify from communicating directly with users, Ek says, Apple is blocking his company from broadcasting discounts. Ek isn't the only one making this argument. Last fall, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case called Apple v. Pepper, in which plaintiffs are seeking antitrust damages from Apple for what they say are unfair app prices caused by Apple's policies.
That Spotify would bring this complaint to the European Commission makes sense, and not just because Spotify is based in Europe. Antitrust regulators there, led by Margrethe Vestager, have been far more aggressive in cracking down on anticompetitive practices in recent years. In 2017, Vestager's office slapped Google with a $2.7 billion fine after finding that the search platform unfairly directed consumers to its own shopping platform over the competition.
And yet, not even Vestager has thrown her support behind Warren's plan to unilaterally break these companies up. To break up a company, to break up private property would be very far reaching and you would need to have a very strong case that it would produce better results for consumers in the marketplace than what you could do with more mainstream tools, Vestager said at South by Southwest last weekend.
Despite the comparatively light-touch approach Spotify is suggestingand the growing conversation in the United States about antitrust actionGaynor cautions that there's no guarantee Spotify would prevail if it were to bring such a complaint in the US. ""Antitrust laws are about harm to competition, not competitors,"" he says. ""If Spotify is disadvantaged, but theres vigorous competition and consumers are benefiting, then they have no standing.""

Kyle Hyatt,"It's a new day at Cadillac, and unfortunately, that means the sun is setting on two of our favorite domestic performance models: the ATS-V and the CTS-V. In an email to Roadshow, Cadillac confirmed that it plans to cease production of both vehicles by Spring, 2019. However, that doesn't mean the end of the V performance line as a whole -- not by a long shot. ""Starting in 2019, Cadillac will broaden the V-Series sub-brand and add high-performance variants across its portfolio -- all with enhanced propulsion systems, chassis and brake systems,"" said a brand representative in an email to Roadshow. ""This includes the new hand-built Blackwing V8 for the CT6-V that develops an estimated 550 horsepower and a class-leading 627 pound-feet of torque. With the ATS-V and CTS-V sunsetting and the arrival of the CT6-V this spring, V-Series is embarking on its next chapter, where we begin to broaden the V lineup."" The CT6 V-Sport and its hot new bespoke Blackwing V8 were a huge hit at the New York Auto Show. Antuan Goodwin/Roadshow It turns out that when Cadillac debuted its CT6 V-Sport at the New York Auto Show in March, people really liked it. They especially seemed to like the 4.2-liter turbocharged Blackwing V8 engine that powers it, so the folks behind Cadillac have opted to give their full-size luxury sedan the full-fat V treatment with even more performance goodies. ""Beginning with the debut of the CTS-V Sedan in 2004, the V-Series sub-brand sparked new life into Cadillac,"" said Mark Reuss, executive vice president and president of GM Global Automotive Group and Cadillac, in an official statement. ""As a result of the overwhelming response the CT6 V-Sport received when revealed in early 2018, we've decided to formally make it a V-Series, signaling the expansion of V-Series."" Historically, Cadillac's V models have not represented a significant portion of sales for the brand, but their performance cred has provided something of a halo for the long-struggling marque. While not yet a ""name brand"" performance division like its rivals at BMW's M program or Mercedes-Benz AMG, Cadillac's V-Series has indeed burnished the image of General Motors' luxury brand. Despite the impending demise of the ATS-V and CTS-V, it sounds like the V-Series will remain an important cornerstone of the Wreath and Crest brand's revival efforts.","The CT6-V will be the first model in a new, expanded series of V-Series performance Cadillacs.",2018-09-20T00:53:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}","Cadillac says goodbye to CTS-V, ATS-V, will expand V line - Roadshow",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/cadillac-ct6-v-series-new-models-performance/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/I7JjM2jqpecR-D7R22OrTDUGVbY=/2018/03/21/af0f3daf-56c3-47b2-be15-9f0e19bbf228/cad-ogi-1.jpg,,Cnet.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters ""Lower the music, guys, one second."" Guillermo del Toro was mid-acceptance speech at Sunday night's Golden Globes when the orchestra began playing him off. ""It's taken 25 years [to win this award],"" The Shape Of Water director laughed. ""Give me a minute. Give me a minute!"" Not only did his demand prompt cheers from the audience - but it was also effective, as the orchestra did in fact back off and allow him to finish. Del Toro went on to complete his speech, later praised for its poignancy, in which he stressed that making movies had ""saved his life"" on three separate occasions. ""I understand that there's a show to run and I understand that they needed to get going,"" the director tells BBC News. ""But there is also the need [for the winner] to acknowledge a few people that were integral to the process of the movie, and to finish your thought."" Image copyright Sophie Giraud Image caption Del Toro directed The Shape Of Water - which stars Octavia Spencer and Sally Hawkins Del Toro, who has also been nominated for best director at next month's Baftas, adds that the walk from the table to the stage can be overwhelming, and therefore require some extra time to gather your thoughts. ""When you reach that stage, you want a moment to recompose yourself and say what you think, so you know, I felt I needed just a few more seconds,"" he says. Did anyone from the Globes tell him off for going over his allotted time? ""No no, the beautiful thing in the Globes is not that I asked for more time and the orchestra to be quiet, but that they gave it to me. ""That's the remarkable thing. It was very generous and very moving."" But del Toro's acceptance speech wasn't the only thing that caught viewers' attention during the presentation of best director. While introducing the category, actress Natalie Portman said: ""And here are the all-male nominees."" The camera panned to del Toro as she said it, but, he explains now, he hadn't initially heard what she said. ""From where we were sitting, sometimes what is said on the stage in the microphone is very hard to hear,"" he says. ""It's one thing on TV, and one thing around [the auditorium]. I heard the category, and I was reacting to that, and it was only a few beats later that you heard what she said. ""So all the reactions in the room were delayed by a couple of beats. On camera they happen faster because the microphones were much clearer to the TV than in the room."" Twitter erupted with praise for Portman's efforts to draw attention to the gender imbalance in film directing. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Del Toro says directors such as Patty Jenkins and Greta Gerwig should be recognised And del Toro says he ""absolutely"" agrees more women behind the camera should be recognised at awards ceremonies. ""Particularly in this year, with the movies that Greta Gerwig [director of Lady Bird] or Patty Jenkins [Wonder Woman] have made, it's very important I think to recognise it. ""There is a reason to do it, there is material to do it. The important thing is to recognise this season there are films that are very worthy, made by very good female storytellers."" Del Toro is riding on the crest of a wave at the moment. Shortly after the Globes ceremony, he heard The Shape Of Water had also picked up the most nominations (12) at this year's Bafta film awards. ""It felt fantastic... you feel elated to be in the conversation,"" he says of the Bafta recognition. Image copyright Fox Searchlight Pictures Image caption The Shape Of Water has been nominated for 12 awards at this year's Baftas ""After 25 years, you know it doesn't happen every time, so you learn to be grateful and humble, but also encouraged, and I think the Baftas have a stature and have a way to reach an audience and lift a movie above the end-of-year din or the beginning of awards season. ""That is significant for a film-maker, this [awards] season is about reaching the Olympics, and being in the Olympics is very good, you feel each round is important, not about you, but about the movie reaching an audience and being rewarded for taking a risk or being bold or inventive and unique."" The Shape Of Water stars British actress Sally Hawkins as a janitor who forms a relationship with an amphibious creature being held in captivity. During his Globes speech, del Toro credited the film, along with two of his others - 2006's Pan's Labyrinth and 2001's Devil's Backbone - with ""saving his life"". ""This movie's ultimately a biography, and out of this really dark turmoil, you find a little bit of light. And that has happened to be several times in 25 years of storytelling,"" he tells the BBC. ""It happened certainly on The Devil's Backbone. I was at the end of my rope after having done only two movies, one of them - Mimic - was with Miramax Dimension, that was such a bad experience, such a harrowing experience, and then there was the kidnapping of my father shortly thereafter. After that, Devil's Backbone picked me up and healed me. ""And in a different set of circumstances, that happened with Pan's Labyrinth. These movies come out of that very dark night of the soul.""

Adam Bankhurst,"Super Mario World, A Link to the Past, and more! 
By Adam BankhurstAn alleged data mine has potentially revealed a list of Super Nintendo games that may be headed to Nintendo Switch Online.
Via Polygon,KapuccinoHeck has discovered a list of SNES games in some code in ""NES Online's strings"" and it reveals many titles that may be arriving on the Nintendo Switch at some point in the future.
The list of games is as follows;
Super Mario Kart
Super Soccer
The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past
Demon's Crest
Yoshi's Island
Stunt Race FX
Kirby's Dream Course
Pop'n Twinbee
Star Fox
Contra 3
Kirby Super Star
Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts
Kirby's Dream Land 3
Super Metroid
Super Mario World
Pilotwings
F-Zero
Star Fox 2
Super Punch-Out!!
The Legend of the Mystical Ninja
Super Mario All-Stars
Breath of Fire 2
Many of these games appeared on the SNES Classic, but titles such as Pilotwings and Demon's Crest would be new additions, potentially indicating that this wouldn't necessarily just be a SNES Classic bundle.
While Nintendo has never explicitly said that SNES games would be joining Nintendo Switch Online as NES titles have, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime did say he envisions ""the Virtual Console successor"" to be Nintendo Switch online.
NES Online currently has 29 titles, with Zelda II: The Adventures of Link and Blaster Master joining the library this week Adding SNES to the mix would be a great addition to those subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online.
While we wait to hear more about SNES titles being added to Nintendo Switch Online, be sure to check out our list of Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.
IGN has reached out to Nintendo and will update this story should they respond.

UnderConsideration,"Noted Jan. 25, 2018 by Armin About (Est. 1919) “ Leeds United Football Club is a professional association football club in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The club was formed in 1919 following the disbanding of Leeds City F.C. by the Football League and took over their Elland Road stadium. They play in the Championship, the second tier of the English football league system.” ( Wikipedia ) Design by N/A Related links Leeds United press release Leeds United microsite for new crest Leeds United press release on ""crest consultation"" after bad response to new crest Relevant quote The new crest depicts the ‘Leeds Salute’, which over the decades has been an expression of the passion that connects Leeds United’s fans and players on and off the pitch and all over the world. It is used extensively, and notably on match days when with right hand on heart fans sing the Club’s famous song ‘Marching on Together’. Leeds United owes everything to the supporters who have stood by the club through thick and thin. We are delighted and proud to reveal a new crest that reflects the passion and loyalty that runs deep through the Club, and celebrates the fans at the heart of our identity. Images (opinion after) Logo evolution. Can we revive those mid-1970s logos, please? Logo. Video introduction. Opinion When it comes to European soccer redesigns the first disclaimer I like to state is that I am not a fan of either soccer and much less of any particular team so my opinion is completely detached from the change and on a scale from 0 to batshit-crazy I have no passion for what the old logo meant or the storied past of the team. So, the old logo was absolutely terrible, with an unreadable, wedding-invitation-esque “LUFC” — which if it were introduced today, I bet you many of those fans would say it’s “girlie” and demand it be taken away — a ridiculously small flower-ball thing and a ghastly shield shape and set of stripes. I’m sure everything in there has meaning to many but, as a logo/crest, it was bad. The new logo is more American-ized and like something you would see in the MLS, which may be part of what makes fans upset. Obviously, the elephant in the room is the illustration of the player doing the “Leeds Salute”. It’s not a bad idea and the execution is almost there but it’s a really, really hard gesture to capture properly in static form. Without knowing about the Leeds Salute previously I instantly knew what the figure was doing but I was confused by how many fingers there are and what’s a shadow and what isn’t. Overall, though, as a mark that signifies a team through a gesture fans know, it’s relatively good. The typography isn’t great but it’s a major improvement over that “LUFC” frilliness. Not that any of this matters because the team might change the logo after this week’s brutally negative reception from the fans — including the obligatory, indignation-fueled change.org petition — with the team issuing an official press release saying they will need to rethink things, which is, bollocks. They should stick with what they presented and let fans deal with the change because in a month’s time they’ll have forgotten about the old logo and the new logo and will have moved on to the next thing that upsets them.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","People waited in long lines for ice, gas and other supplies after their electricity was knocked out by tropical storm Florence. The city of Wilmington, North Carolina, was essentially cut off from the world. USA TODAY People look on at trees pushed up against a railroad trestle crossing the Cape Fear river as it crests from the rains caused by Hurricane Florence as it passed through the area on Sept.18, 2018 in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The area was inundated with rain that caused concern for large scale flooding in the North Carolina and South Carolina area. (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images) Prosperous, vibrant Wilmington was opening three sites for food and water distribution Tuesday as officials in the North Carolina city struggled to feed a population cut off by the historic floods of once-mighty Hurricane Florence. The Cape Fear River, normally a tourist attraction and economic boon, has brought the city of 120,000 to its knees. Residents who didn't flee before Florence hit last week are now reliant on essentials rolling in on high-water trucks and helicopters. The river, expected to crest in Wilmington on Tuesday, set a record Monday when it reached 22.54 feet in the town of Burgaw, 25 miles to the north. ""The river will continue to rise in the coming days,"" the National Weather Service said. ""Stay safe, river flooding is still a major concern!"" The storm has been blamed for at least 32 deaths since it rolled up on the coast of North Carolina last week. More than 300,000 utility customers across the state remained without power Tuesday. More: Wilmington cut off as flooding overwhelms North Carolina; 32 dead More: Flooding from Florence to swamp Carolinas for days – or even weeks Last Slide Next Slide More than a dozen North Carolina rivers are expected to crest in major flood stage this week. Some areas saw up to 36 inches of rain. Wilmington's total was about two feet. The combination of high winds and surge from the initial impact of the storm, plus the rain, has paralyzed the city. Most homes and businesses have no power, and most traffic lights aren't working. The city welcomed 20 high-water trucks from Fort Bragg, packed with enough food and water for 60,000 people for four days. But access to the city remained limited. Stores and gas stations are running out of essentials. Desperate for gas to run a generator at home, Nick Monroe waited in a half-mile-long line at a local station that ran out. His power went off Thursday before Florence hit the coast, but he couldn’t recall exactly when. “It’s all kind of a blur,” Monroe said. Flash flooding was a concern across much of the Carolinas and parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and into southern New England. In South Carolina, Gov.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","Is it the stock photo industry?
Grab your tinfoil hat and walk with me down sparkle way. In the Dec. 21New York Times,Caity Weaver has a rollicking dispatch from the Glitterex glitter factory, which reveals the true nature of glitteraluminum metalized polyethylene terephthalatebefore hinting at a greater mystery: a top-secret industrial glitter use that accounts for most of the companys sales.
The following exchange ensues when Weaver asks Glitterex manager Lauren Dyer why she cant disclose this enigmatic buyer:
Dyer: Because they dont want anyone to know that its glitter. 
 Weaver: If I looked at it, I wouldnt know it was glitter? 
 Dyer: No, not really. 
 Weaver: Would I be able to see the glitter? 
 Dyer: Oh, youd be able to see something. But its yeah, I cant.
On Twitter, Weaver followed up: Please ask the smartest person in your family what the glitter industrys biggest market is, and reveal their answers here.
I went one further: I asked Joe Colleran at Meadowbrook Inventions, the worlds leading glitter manufacturer. Its nothing so interesting, he says. Small manufacturers protect client information to protect business. Its really that simple.
Clearly, it was time to do some digging. But it wasnt really the perfect time, since its Christmas week, and everyone in America is on vacation. To make matters worse, the investigation requires a level of confidence in chemical and physical sciences to which I stopped aspiring in high school. The colleagues who would be able to answer my questions? Theyre on vacation too.
And so I present to you a half-baked Friday afternoon inquiry: seven potential industrial uses of glitter where the clients might not want you to know they were working with a glitter company.
Fighter jets. Most military aircraft are equipped with tubes of chaff, millions of tiny aluminum- or zinc-coated fibers, to boggle radar-guided missiles and tracking systems. Did someone say aluminum-coated fibers? According to an October Pentagon report, theres only one remaining supplier of chaff to the Department of Defense: Esterline Defense Technologies, which manufactures the stuff in North Carolina under the subsidiary Armtec. Unfortunately for us, Armtec says its chaff is made of metalized glass fibers. (An Esterline representative had not responded to Slate as of press time.)
Spacecraft. The gold and silver sheets you often see on NASA equipment protect spacecraft from the temperature extremes of outer space. They are aluminized polyimidesclose cousins of the sheets that are chopped up for party decorations and makeup. If, say, a satellite-launching startup were looking for a Mylar substitute in small quantities without paying for the DuPont brand name or buying at the markups of the military-industrial complex, could it just turn to any old glitter factory? Maybe! Is it still glitter if it hasnt been chopped up into a million pieces? Maybe not! (The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service couldnt be reached for comment; its closed because of the government shutdown.)
Rocket fuel. Everyone knows NASAs Space Launch System uses aluminum powder (along with ammonium perchlorate) as solid rocket fuel. What this article presupposes is: Maybe they use glitter instead.
Sand. The world is running out of sand, in case you needed one more thing to worry about, so the construction industry is increasingly turning to manufactured sand (very fine crushed rock) as a component of concrete. Could the sand industry be spiking M-sand with glitter in search of the natural sparkle of Key Weststyle quartz sand for cosmetic uses like concrete floors, walls, or countertops? Maybe, but the vast majority of concrete never has to meet any aesthetic standard at all.
Fishing bait. Glitter is certainly a component in many plastic fishing lures, but its not a secret, and Im not sure why it would be.
Toothpaste. Earlier in the decade, online reviewers attested that Crest-brand 3D White Vivid toothpaste contained small plastic particles that were getting logged in brushers teeth and gums. In 2014, Procter &amp; Gamble, which owns Crest, wrote to Snopes that the company (and its peers) were using limited amounts of small colored polyethylene specs in some toothpastesessentially microbeads, which were then common in soap and body wash, to give color. The ingredient was safe, P&amp;G insisted, and to the extent it made people like brushing their teeth, it led to healthier dental outcomes. Arguing that consumer preferences had changed (there was also a federal law passed in 2015 against microbeads), Crest eliminated microbeads from North American toothpaste by 2016. Could glitter be providing some of that missing sparkle in toothpaste and other microbead-less cosmetics? (Procter &amp; Gamble PR did not respond to a request for comment by press time.)
Money.Sure, why not? Glitter in money. To make it hard to counterfeit and give it a cool look.
Or, of course, we could take Meadowbrook Joe at his word and assume that the answer is the least-interesting one possible, like the shiny paint on a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of beer. A July Research and Markets industry report notes that the largest end-uses for metalized films include food packaging, decoration, and cosmetics.

UnderConsideration,"Established in 2016, FC Cincinnati began play in the United Soccer League (USL) where they finished the 2018 season as the team with the most wins (but lost in the second round of the playoffs) and set the record for biggest average attendance ever for a USL team during that season. This past May, the team was awarded an expansion slot in the MLS and will begin play in 2019 and move into a fancy new stadium. Yesterday, FC Cincinnati introduced its new crest, designed by the local office of Interbrand. Symbolism abounds in the new crest, meant to celebrate the city’s German heritage in a modern way. The lion’s crown pays homage to the “Queen City,” while the seven points of its mane are a nod to the seven hills of Cincinnati. The three-feathered wing represents the club’s three-year journey to MLS and, perhaps most noticeably, its tail takes a “c” shape. Logo explanation. Logo. The old logo had a semi-decent good idea of turning a crown into an abstract ball but the proportions of the crown in relation to the shield were off the mark, leading to a huge ball/crown. But more terrible, were the proportions of everything else, with a huge “FC”, small “Cincinnati”, and tiny lion that, at that size, looked like it was holding up a toothpick. Part of the problem with anything Cincinnati related is that it’s a super long word and not easy to work with but the new logo does a fantastic job in not just making it fit but making it prominent without sacrificing proportions anywhere else. The city name, set at a vertiginous angle, fits beautifully in the crest shape, which breaks away from the typical shield shape by adopting the contour of a single panel of a soccer ball. It’s kind of amazing no team has (notably) done this before. The city name cuts the crest cleverly to fit a new lion in the lower portion and “FC” in the top portion. The “FC” element is probably the only minor complaint I would have about the crest in that it sits somewhat awkwardly in that space. The lion, if you can get past the dozen or so hidden rationalizations in it*, is mostly a great drawing — the wing looks like it was designed by someone else — that works great in that orange shape. In general, the new crest is great. It has a kind of vintage Italian car racing aesthetic with a modern twist that is quite appealing. * It’s lovely that they were able to build all those little details in the main and wing but the explanation graphic starts to border on looking like a parody. The club’s new secondary mark is the stylized FCC from the full wordmark, while stand-alone tertiary elements will eventually include the full lion from the crest, the lion’s head and mane, and the crown. Those elements will be introduced more prominently in future years as the brand gains traction in the marketplace. Secondary marks. The secondary marks are fine but not as exciting as the crest. The “C”s having such a pronounced angled feature makes them stand out in a weird way. Perhaps the crossbar of the “A” could have been angled too. The crown works well on its own on top of the “C” and I do like how the bottom of the “F” is a continuation of the “C” to its right. Merch promo images. Scarves. Merch looks great. Given the strong fan base the team already has and renewed excitement of it joining the MLS, this is going to sell like crazy. New logo introduction video. It’s… detailed. Overall, this is another excellent logo in the MLS — along with Austin FC and Club Internacional de Fútbol Miami — that is able to bridge the notion of traditional football crests with contemporary elements and is turning the MLS into the best-designed professional sports league. Thanks to Big C for the tip.","“Yasss Queen… City” Established in 2016, FC Cincinnati began play in the United Soccer League (USL) where they finished the 2018 season as the team with the most wins (but lost in the second round of the playoffs) and set the record for biggest average attend…",2018-11-13T10:45:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Underconsideration.com'}",Reviewed: New Crest for FC Cincinnati by Interbrand,https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_crest_for_fc_cincinnati_by_interbrand.php,https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/fc_cincinnati_logo_before_after.png,,Underconsideration.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Erin Brodwin,"Could 23andMe-branded drugs one day grace the shelves of your medicine cabinet? 
 Anne Wojcicki, the cofounder and CEO of the Silicon Valley genetic testing startup, said it would be a ""source of pride"" if that happened. Her comments came during a panel at a health and tech conference organized by the Wall Street Journal. 
 23andMe has been working on creating its own drugs for everything from skin conditions to cancer and heart disease since 2015, when it hired former Genentech executive Richard Scheller to head up the program. 
 Wojcicki said she was ""hopeful"" for the day when there could be drugs branded with the 23andMe label. 
 Today, the company has 13 compounds in early stages of research, she said, and two of them are in a later phase of testing in animals. A team of at least 10 scientists is currently focused on studying those compounds, according to 23andMe's website. 
 23andMe also sells anonymized genetic data to drug companies for their own research initiatives. Last summer, for example, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline acquired a $300 million stake in 23andMe and struck a drug-development deal with the company. The startup also has partnerships with at least four other drug companies: Pfizer, Biogen, Genentech, and Alnylam. It's also working with P&amp;G Beauty, the company behind products like Crest toothpaste and Ivory soap.

 Traditionally, the process of creating new therapeutics can be long and costly. Some 86% of all drug candidates never make it into approved drugs, according to one recent analysis published in the journal Biostatistics. 
 But in contrast to most drug development work, which relies heavily on animal models and animal DNA, 23andMe's efforts begin with human data. The startup already has data from roughly 14 million customers. 
 Wojcicki said that by starting with a data from people instead of animals, it's possible that 23andMe could have a higher chance of success at creating drugs that work.","Silicon Valley genetic testing startup 23andMe is making progress in its efforts to develop new drugs for everything from skin conditions to cancer and heart disease, the CEO said at an event last week.

Sophia Mitrokostas,"Ivy Ford of Hazel Crest, Illinois, said she was horrified when she discovered that the luggage she had checked on a Spirit Airlines flight to O'Hare International Airport had arrived at baggage claim completely destroyed. According to an ABC 7 I-Team report, Ford did not immediately recognize the luggage as her own when it passed her on the baggage carousel. Closer inspection, however, revealed her bag and its contents had been shredded, melted, and stuffed into a black trash bag. ""I was more upset that nobody told me that you would allow me to get off the plane and discover it, versus coming to me and informing me as soon as we got off the plane,"" Ford told ABC7. After filing a claim with the airline, Ford reported that Spirit asked for receipts for items in her luggage valued at over $50. She explained that she did not have receipts for all her belongings, which she said spurred a month of emails and calls with the airline regarding the receipt policy. ABC7 revealed that Ford was eventually given a $400 reimbursement check, which was about $80 less than she requested. Spirit also gave her a $50 travel voucher. When Ford contacted the media about her experience, the airline granted her another $50 travel voucher and added $80 to her claim settlement. Ford also said that the airline refused to cover the loss of her Versace perfume and that she was forced to choose a replacement suitcase from a Spirit Airlines catalog rather than receiving cash reimbursement for her shredded luggage. In the carrier's contract of carriage, Spirit Airlines notes that it will not reimburse customers for damaged or missing perfumes, cameras, computers, money, jewelry, medicine, cosmetics, watches, or phones. ""I wasn't satisfied and to be honest with you, driving home from the airport I felt like somebody dropped the ball that works for Spirit. Somebody didn't do their job, mishandled some luggage, and no one's taking responsibility for it,"" Ford said. When asked about the incident, Spirit Airlines told INSIDER: ""We greatly apologize for the damage to our Guest's luggage and personal items. At Spirit Airlines we take pride in our luggage handling, but in the rare event of damage or loss, we have a process of itemizing all belongings and their value. Keeping in mind every incident is different, we have worked directly with our Guest and fulfilled her request for reimbursement."" The airline did not tell ABC7 nor INSIDER how the luggage was damaged.

JONATHAN MARTIN,"If Mr. Lamb, a Marine veteran and a former federal prosecutor, defeats State Representative Rick Saccone, a Republican, in a district that the president carried by 20 points, the alarm bells will be audible across the country. The Democrats will have shown that they can breach the Republican hold on the blue-collar white voters who helped deliver Mr. Trump the presidency. “If the Democrats were to prevail in western Pennsylvania, that would be quite an earthquake, let’s face it,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican who represents a district in the eastern part of the state. “If a strong pro-Trump district like this goes the other way, it would send a bad signal around the country in districts far more competitive than this one.” What is so remarkable about the Republican intervention is the ephemeral impact of its outcome. The lawmaker who held the seat — a married man and an opponent of abortion — fled Congress after his mistress let it be known that he had pressed her to have an abortion. Since then, the State Supreme Court has redrawn Pennsylvania’s congressional lines, and Mr. Lamb will live in another district come November. Win or lose, he will probably be running against another Republican lawmaker in a more Democrat-friendly district slightly to the north. Yet Republican officials, who believe that Mr. Saccone is a pedestrian candidate, say they could not simply abandon such a red-tinted region, especially with the White House unveiling tariffs aimed at bolstering the steel industry and eager to keep its grip on the crucial industrial Midwest this year and in 2020. Now, with Mr. Lamb gaining ground, they are doing everything they can to push Mr. Saccone over the finish line, including a bit of political gamesmanship. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading House Republican “super PAC,” is sending mail to Democratic households depicting Mr. Lamb firing an assault rifle and noting that he supports gun rights — part of an attempt to dilute his support among more liberal voters. Photo Conor Lamb, left center, the Democratic candidate for the March 13 special election, campaigning with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Collier, Pa., on Tuesday. Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press The group has also put together a deceptive digital ad made to look like a cable television news report that portrays Mr. Lamb as reaching a “boiling point” with the labor unions, a pillar of his support. “Democrat abandons PA Unions,” the ad says, noting that he opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. While Mr. Lamb does oppose such an increase, he enjoys overwhelming support from unions. In an interview, Mr. Lamb said that he was running in part because he was “upset we weren’t competing everywhere,” and he argued that his success, in the wake of the West Virginia teachers’ strike, could help reinvigorate the beleaguered union movement. “It could send a message that we have rebuilt and reconnected our link with organized labor,” he said. “They’re at the top of our agenda.” This appeal, along with Mr. Lamb’s unapologetic opposition to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, has offered other Rust Belt Democrats something of a model for how to run in the Trump era. ""Your Lives"" Video by Conor Lamb If that gives Ms. Pelosi, who is eyeing a return to the speakership, pause, it troubles Mr. Trump and his allies even more as they aim to hold together their 2016 coalition. The president will have visited the district twice by Tuesday, and other administration officials have come for their own events. Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, noted that Mr. Lamb is “running like a Republican,” pointing out not just his opposition to gun control but also his support for the president’s tariffs. But Ms. McDaniel said that the overarching reason the party and the White House are competing so aggressively is they know Democrats are energized and history suggests they could make big gains this fall. “Every seat is going to count when you have a 24-seat majority,” she said. The R.N.C., which in the past rarely got involved in House races, has spent more than $900,000 here. It is this worry about just how high the Democratic wave could crest in November and the momentum they could pick up here that has prompted so much spending by Republicans. While Mr. Lamb had raised nearly $4 million as of Feb. 21, much of it online from out-of-state progressives eager to win anywhere they can, Mr. Saccone’s campaign has been largely underwritten by outside groups. While Republican-aligned groups spent $9.7 million as of late February, Democratic groups had put in only $849,000. Photo If Mr. Lamb defeats Mr. Saccone, Republicans say it would be “a bad signal.” Credit Antonella Crescimbeni/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, via Associated Press The House Republican super PAC has not only unleashed a barrage of commercials and mailers, but it has also funded canvassers, a small group of whom were making their way through a middle-class subdivision just west of Pittsburgh the morning after Mr. Biden was in town. Armed with an app that displayed the precise voting history and partisan tendencies of each household, the door-knockers found few residents at home for a piece of literature that deemed Mr. Lamb a “Rubber Stamp for Nancy Pelosi,” as well as a throwback “Stop Hillary” warning. But those Republicans who did come to the door were receptive to Mr. Saccone and aware of the election. “We’re voting for Rick,” Derek Soose interjected before a canvasser could complete his sentence. Back in Washington, it is not difficult to find Republicans frustrated by all the money being dumped in a soon-to-be-redrawn district. Some party strategists complain that the spending will seem misguided come October should Republican lawmakers find themselves in unexpectedly difficult elections and require money that may not be available. Notably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the most influential Republican-aligned groups, decided to stay out of the district after meeting with Mr. Saccone. “We made a strategic decision to take a pass and focus on selling tax reform and linking it to pro-growth candidates that can win,” said Scott Reed, the chamber’s top strategist. But former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who once ran the House campaign arm, said Mr. Lamb may prove more vulnerable should he win on Tuesday, because he would have a voting record for conservatives to use against him in the fall. In any event, Mr. Davis bluntly suggested that there was a bigger reason Republicans were so desperate to prevent disaster in Pennsylvania: They must spend money to keep raising money. “A lot of transactional money in Washington will start moving when they see results,” Mr. Davis said, referring to the lobbyists whose contribution decisions are guided in part by which party they believe will wield power next year. “Like in the stock market, you want to stay on winning side.” Democrats agree that the results will resound beyond this corner of Pennsylvania. Reminded that Mr. Lamb was competing in an ancestral coal and steel district, the sort of place that has been firmly in the grip of Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden grinned and shot back: “Tell you what, it ain’t going to be anymore.” Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington.

UnderConsideration,"Established in 1899, FC Barcelona is one of the most well known and successful football teams in the world with far too many titles and accomplishments to list in one paragraph. The Catalan team has attracted some of the best players in the world over the decades, including Johan Cruyff, Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi, among many others. Last week, the club introduced a revised crest and new identity designed by Spanish firm Summa. FC Barcelona has updated its crest to suit modern times. Since its last update in 2001, the context, society and technology have changed enormously, and so must the Club’s identifying features. This evolution is faithful to the historic elements in the crest and also makes it easier to reproduce, especially in the increasingly important digital media. Its features include greater balance and power in the blue and maroon colours, a more prominent football, as the iconic representation of the Barça style of play, simpler, more homogenised shapes and colours and the elimination of the FCB acronym, not explanatory and in disuse. Summa provided text Your browser does not support the video tag. Logo evolution. The main features of the new crest are greater balance and power in the blue and maroon colours, greater presence of the ball, an iconic element that represents the Barça style of play, and simplicity and homogenisation of the shapes and colours. A more harmonious crest that still maintains its shape and essence. Crest updates. Logo. It goes without saying that the very best decision was to not mess with the crest in any significant way. I’m all for changing crests to modern logos — à la Juventus — but I think a team like FC Barcelona will simply never be able to change. Over the years, the team hasn’t been too shy about making updates, so this new update isn’t as controversial or unexpected. All the changes are an improvement, making the logo simpler, easier to read, and more efficient to reproduce. Getting rid of all the thin black strokes on the inside alone should be a national celebration. The color combo is still a little whack, lacking some contrast but not much you can do there. The one thing that does bother me is that the top two quadrants, the sides that touch the crest do not follow the curves of the crest, especially the white/red cross that I think could have easily hugged the curve. Nonetheless, it’s an update that should incite little ire from fans and, in this realm, that’s the biggest win possible. I’m not super excited about the new wordmark (or font in general) but it’s not bad by any means. It just feels at odds with the crest. As a result of this process and the new strategy, we have opted for two official brand expressions: FC Barcelona for everything relating to the institution and football, and Barça, a very popular expression which had not previously been given official status. The second name now identifies everything related to all other sports and the knowledge, social change and entertainment areas. Areas that speak for themselves, because Barça is more than a club. Your browser does not support the video tag. Your browser does not support the video tag. Sub-brands. The sub-brand system is pretty straightforward and it may seem “bland” but when you look at the logo-itis they had before, where everything had its own different logo, it’s a most welcome approach. To broaden the communicative register of the brand, we have designed a visual system inspired by its values and attributes, giving the club a distinctive, flexible voice, capable of adapting to the different contexts and audiences with which it interacts. A system of colours, stripes and textures that can be adapted to the Club’s different areas and fields of activity. And its own exclusive FC Barcelona typeface, based on the traits of the crest and the personality of the brand, which is versatile and capable of evolving. Your browser does not support the video tag. Custom font. The custom type family has some interesting qualities — the way any angled strokes (like the “A” or “R”) are squared off or the curve of the “A” — but maybe it has one too many of them. The little slabs on the “C” and “S”, for example, or the angles on the top bars of the “T” and “E”. Pick one or two distinguishing characteristics and stick with those. Patterns. Patterns with photos. Business cards. Letterhead. The patterns are sort of okay. The idea of making one from the crest is good but the color combination of red and blue is taxing on the eyes and when paired with type as in the business cards, it borders on looking more cheap than elegant. Feels like there is some room for improvement on the institutional materials. Kit. Flag. The system will probably be less seen by the everyday fan and, in the end, it comes down to the crest and its value for fans. This is an evolution that will look great on merchandise and all communications for another 10 - 15 years until the next evolution… or until someone is crazy enough to completely change it.","“Barça gets Versed in Digital Reproduction” Established in 1899, FC Barcelona is one of the most well known and successful football teams in the world with far too many titles and accomplishments to list in one paragraph.

Tim Cook says he doesn’t worry about short-term stock price moves, but investors certainly do. Citigroup today released a report that expects AAPL to crest the $200 mark in 2019. Apple’s stock performance in the last 30 days lags behind the S&amp;P, although it’s still up almost 10% this year. The whole tech sector has taken a hit recently, with some accentuated fears that the China/US tariff war will impact Apple’s hardware prices. Nevertheless, the Citigroup analyst shakes off current pessimism. They reference Apple’s continued Services expansion as a source of ongoing growth, and note that Apple’s holiday lineup of iPhones appears strong. While iPhone X demand expectations have been tempered, we believe 2H18 lineup could spur demand given the differentiation in the higher end OLED models versus the LCD models and consumers becoming accustomed to paying a premium price for smartphones which are essential to daily life. We are not expecting a Super Cycle but we do believe sustainable single-digit unit growth of iPhone is achievable. Apple has made it a business goal to double services revenue between 2016 and 2020, and it is well on track. Apple Music subscribers continue to rise, Apple is investing into TV original content that will result in some kind of new subscription service, and the company is planning a premium magazine and news subscription offering for next year as well. On top of all this, Apple continues to rake in billions from App Store commissions. The Citi report estimates the number of Apple users with active paid subscriptions is nearing 270 million. The analysts point to Apple’s upcoming 2018 iPhone to deliver sustainable single-digit growth, noting that customers appear receptive to paying premium prices for smartphones, which bodes well for Apple’s iPhone X and iPhone X Plus. We have already seen some supply chain murmurings that indicate the X Plus will be popular (likely priced around $1000). Citi also points to India for further iPhone sales growth over the coming years. For people keeping score on the imaginary milestones chart, Apple stock’s last high was $194.20. The stock price has to cross the ~$204 level for Apple to become the first public company with a trillion-dollar market cap.

Kyle Orland,"This cat's reaction of a real SNES mimics our reaction to the existence of SNES game references in the Switch's NES emulation files.
5 with 5 posters participating
Dataminers have discovered references to numerous Super NES games in the files for the Switch's ""Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online"" subscription emulation service, suggesting that the company could be planning to expand the system's emulated offerings in the future.
Switch hacker KapuccinoHeckwho has previously shared mods and hidden data for Splatoon 2 and other Switch gamesused Twitter to link to the text of a file full of internal string variables purportedly stored in the NES Online's file system. Fellow modder OatmealDome confirmed that file's authenticity via Twitter. Though Ars has not been able to independently verify the file's existence in the Switch's NES Online app, the information comes from hackers who have provided reliable datamining information from Switch games in the past.
In addition to information about the current NES Online software selection, the shared file also includes references to the following Super NES games, many of which include extensive descriptions of those games in Japanese and/or English:
Breath of Fire 2
Contra III: The Alien Wars
Demon's Crest
F-Zero
Kirby's Dream Course
Kirby's Dream Land 3
Kirby Super Star
Legend of the Mystical Ninja
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
Pilotwings
Pop'n Twinbee
Star Fox
Star Fox 2
Stunt Race FX
Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts
Super Mario All-Stars
Super Mario Kart
Super Mario World
Super Metroid
Super Punch-Out!!
Super Soccer
Yoshi's Island
A full 13 of the games listed in the file are also included in the Super NES Classic Edition, including the exclusive Star Fox 2. But the NES Online file includes many games that are not available on Nintendo's previous plug-and-play device (and vice versa), suggesting this is not just a data artifact copied and pasted from a previous emulation project.In addition, OatmealDome says on Twitter that the miners found an enumerated variable in the NES Online files listing ""four emulator types""two for the NES and SNES Classic and two others named ""Hiyoko"" and ""Count."" While the ""Count"" type may simply be a counter variable, the ""Hiyoko"" type suggests yet another Nintendo system may be planned for Switch emulation at some point.
The inclusion of this hidden Super NES metadata doesn't necessarily mean those games will be emulated on the Switch any time soon, if ever. But this isn't the first hint Nintendo is interested in getting emulated Super NES games running on the Switch. In fact, the company promised Super NES games would be part of the Switch's emulated offerings when it first announced the Switch's online service two years ago. In June of 2017, though, the company said that Super NES games merely ""continue to be under consideration"" for the service.
In a similar data-mining discovery last month, hackers found Sony's PlayStation Classic contained references to dozens of games that may have been tested during the device's development. If one more example pops up, we'll be willing to officially call ""emulator developers leaving interesting breadcrumbs in their files"" as an emerging trend.",NES Online files include references to dozens of 16-bit classics.,2019-01-14T16:02:19Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Datamining suggests emulated Super NES games could be coming to Switch,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/datamining-suggests-emulated-super-nes-games-could-be-coming-to-switch/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/cat-snes-flickr.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aria Bendix,"A winding road on Tejon Ranch, outside of LA County. David McNew/AP Los Angeles is dealing with ever-increasing traffic, congestion, and housing prices. In spite of that, a new planned suburban oasis outside the sprawling city is attracting controversy. After decades of opposition from environmental groups, the county is revisiting a plan to transform Tejon Ranch, the largest contiguous expanse of privately owned land in the state, into a mixed-used development featuring a business park and more than 19,000 residential units. At 270,000 acres, the entire property is eight times the size of San Francisco. But the county will only have 12,000 acres to work with, following a deal it struck with an environmental coalition a decade ago. Under the agreement, the project's developer, Tejon Ranch Co., is required to conserve 90% of privately owned wilderness. Some of that land (62,000 acres) will be divvied up between a state park, space for local habitat tours, and the Pacific Crest Trail, among other things. At the time of the agreement, Bill Corcoran — now a regional campaign director at the Sierra Club — described the deal as ""the ecological equivalent of the Louisiana Purchase."" Even with organizations like the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Endangered Habitats League on board, the plan continues to garner scrutiny among environmentalists. On the one hand, they argue that new construction could destroy hundreds of native plant species and thousands of acres of habitat. On the other, they fear that a suburban community would encourage the use of cars, further driving up pollution levels and greenhouse gas emissions. Their concerns are shared by many urbanists, who see suburban development as a way to avoid much-needed solutions to issues like gentrification, housing affordability, and zoning restrictions. But proponents of the development, known as Tejon Centennial, argue that it provides a new set of options for buyers in LA County. The development includes plenty of open space, in addition to 10 million square feet of commercial property. The development will also feature a school, sheriff's and fire stations, public parks, and its own waste-management system. Developers are planning to provide transit options, like buses or shared-ride services, for people commuting into the city. The end-goal is to create a self-sufficient community that maintains its urban access. The project is being heralded by developers as a solution to LA's affordable housing shortage — a claim that doesn't quite hold up. Though Tejon Ranch has committed to making 10% of its units affordable, the LA Times reports that a single-family unit at Tejon Centennial costs anywhere from $425,000 to $550,000. This is only slightly lower than the median home price in LA County, and a far cry from being considered ""affordable"" for low-income families. A 2015 report from the California Association of Realtors found that a family earning $54,510 in LA County could afford no more than $275,530 for a home. To truly address its housing crisis, LA County will need to build nearly 570,000 units for low-income families — around 300 times what Tejon Ranch has set aside.","Los Angeles County is revisiting a plan to turn one of its few remaining expanses of undeveloped land into a 12,000-acre, mixed-use community.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) Water appears to have receded in some areas of the Carolinas, but more flooding from Hurricane Florence could arrive through the weekend, officials say. More than a dozen rivers in North and South Carolina already have overflowed their banks and the water -- particularly the Waccamaw River, which spans both states -- is expected to swell putting additional residents in harm's way. Officers were going door-to-door along the river in Brunswick County, North Carolina encouraging residents to evacuate. President Donald Trump met with first responders in Conway, South Carolina on Wednesday and warned them of the danger of rising rivers. ""It's going to get rough for South Carolina,"" he told them. ""You're going to have a rebuilding process, and we are behind you from day one,"" Trump said, calling this the ""calm before the storm, because you're going to have a lot of water."" Conway's city spokesman Taylor Newell said water could be ""4 feet higher"" there than when Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016. In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents to ""stay alert"" as water rises. ""People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,"" Cooper said. Bodies of women trapped in flooded police van recovered There are still unanswered questions surrounding the deaths of two mental health patients who drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van swept away by rising floodwater in South Carolina. The victims, whose bodies were recovered by divers on Wednesday, were identified as Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, the Horry County Sheriff's Office said. The women were being transported by sheriff's deputies from a hospital in Loris and from the Waccamaw Center for Mental Health in Conway to McLeod Health Darlington, CNN affiliate WPDE reported. The two deputies escaped the vehicle but were unable to open the doors to get the women out, authorities said. They have been placed on administrative leave, the sheriff's office said. ""We are sorry,"" Horry County Sheriff Phillip Thompson told reporters Wednesday. ""We take a lot of pride in what we do. We work hard to protect and to serve our citizens. We are just very sorry that this event has taken place."" The investigation has been handed over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the sheriff's office has launched an internal investigation, officials said. The women are among at least 36 people who have died because of the storm. Thousands remain in shelters More than 8,100 people are taking refuge at dozens of shelters across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to the Red Cross. Of those, approximately 7,800 are in shelters in North Carolina. Some residents are waiting until the floodwater recedes from their homes. Others can't get to their neighborhoods because the extensive road closures or simply because they don't have a ride home. And some who went home have returned after finding out they don't have power, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. Roads have been so impassable in Kinston, North Carolina, the National Guard has used helicopters to distribute water. In Conway, South Carolina some residents were heading home Wednesday but only to collect their belongings and evacuate again after officials say more flooding could be on the way. ""We are cautioning everyone not to be overconfident,"" City Administrator Adam Emrick said. ""The water is going to come back up. We are worried about Friday."" Chris Ross has been staying at a shelter since he fled his Fayetteville home about a week ago when the National Guard pulled people out of his neighborhood. ""People can only take so much,"" Ross told WRAL. ""It's wearing on a lot of people here, trying to keep their sanity together."" Even after farmers moved thousands of animals to higher ground ahead of the storm, many have suffered losses. North Carolina farms lost an estimated 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 pigs, the state Department of Agriculture &amp; Consumer Services said. Allison Cavenaugh and her husband, who own a home and a poultry farm with 80,000 chickens in Wallace, North Carolina, returned home for the first time this week on a boat just to find out that their chickens have drowned. ""It's all gone,"" Cavenaugh told WRAL. North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler, who conducted an aerial survey of damage on Tuesday, said the flooding has affected the top six agricultural counties in the state. ""This was an unprecedented storm with flooding expected to exceed that from any other storms in recent memory,"" Troxler said in a statement. ""The footprint of flooding from this storm covers much of the same area hit by flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which only worsens the burden on these farmers."" In South Carolina, farmers face damage to cotton, peanut and hemp crops, the state said. CNN's Jay Croft, Steve Almasy, Amanda Watts, Andrea Diaz and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Water appears to have receded in some areas of the Carolinas, but more flooding from Hurricane Florence could arrive through the weekend, officials say.",2018-09-20T10:32:45Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",The Carolinas brace for even more flooding,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/florence-aftermath-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919164431-little-pee-dee-river-south-carolina-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,crest,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Johanna D. Wilson,"Johanna D. Wilson is a freelance journalist and Montessori teaching assistant in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) I remember Hurricane Hugo. Back then, in September 1989, I was one of many Howard University students sending canned goods, water and other supplies to people affected by the Category 4 hurricane that crashed into South Carolina and immediately caused chaos. Huge power outages swept the state. My family was living in a small community called Boyer, in the middle of the state, and went without electricity for nine days. On the Grand Strand, which includes Pawleys Island and Myrtle Beach, homes snapped like pretzels. Majestic trees were strewn like toothpicks by Hugo's 140-mph sustained winds (with gusts of more than 160 mph). According to the National Hurricane Center, at least 50 people lost their lives as a direct result of the storm. Forecasters agreed Hurricane Florence had the potential of being a bigger wolf than Hugo. Sheep had to be on guard. That's why I made a special plea to my shepherd. Enter the anointed oil. It was what I held in my hand as I stood alone at the door of my Myrtle Beach condo. A preacher had given it to me 10 years before during a revival meeting. When I heard about Florence's fury, I asked Jesus to protect my life, my family, my friends, my foes and our homes. I anointed my condo with the oil. Then, after I prayed and packed, I got into my 2006 Honda Accord V6 and put some distance between Florence and myself. I was going to be with my mama and other loved ones more than 100 miles away. Florence, may find me, I thought, but she won't see me in Myrtle Beach. Hurricanes wear you out. Folks who have endured them know this. They inconvenience all of us. They make plenty of us frantic. They make us spend money we need for other things. They make enough of us angry. The molasses-moving Florence was no different. ""I think it sucks,'' said John Smeyda, my Myrtle Beach neighbor, when we spoke on the phone Friday. He decided to stay behind. He is a 57-year-old retired electrician with a Marine haircut and a voice that booms. For him, Florence was a headache he wanted to go away as soon as possible. On Friday, the storm still hadn't showed up. It had been raining for hours. Gusty winds were getting more rambunctious. Florence was weakening, slowing down. She danced her way out of a Category 4 rating and eventually diminished in strength, becoming a tropical depression. Yet her wickedness can't be denied. More than 30 people have died in North and South Carolina and Virginia. The flooding caused by the storm's torrential rains may bring even more devastation. My classmate, Jacqueline Gilmore Jackson, 49, resides in Wilmington, North Carolina. She and her 20-year-old son, Devin, are OK. Their home didn't sustain any critical damage. She lost some shingles. Part of her fence came down, but there is no water accumulation on her property at all. A mere 30 minutes away, others weren't as fortunate. She said cars are floating down streets. Homes are almost hidden by floodwaters. Her city is basically cut off, for now, from the outside world. Gilmore Jackson said the major highways leading into Wilmington are closed because of the flooding. Roads have washed out. Bridges have given out. ""Nobody can help us right now,"" she told me Monday when I called to check on her. ""We have to help ourselves. Of course, God is helping us all."" I am thankful to hear this. I know firsthand how dangerous and unpredictable unrepentant weather can be. During my career at The Myrtle Beach Sun News, where I was a journalist for nearly 20 years, I met notable members of Florence's family. Fran was wicked. Back in October 1996, I watched as a 48-year-old farmer mourned corn bent by wind, as if in prayer, after Fran destroyed about $100,000 of his crop. Floyd demolished a 65-year-old family home. Its 86-year-old widowed matriarch cried over the sanctuary where she birthed seven of her eight children. That was in 1999. I cried with her. Storms are also a part of my family history. Mama told me about my great granddaddy, Herbert Gilmore, when I was a little girl. He was a successful farmer until a storm destroyed all the labor completed by his talented, leathered, ebony hands. The pernicious storm, its name unknown to us, tumbled his Holly Hill, South Carolina, home and killed all of his livestock in 1929. The storm's subsequent flood defeated an otherwise strong man, who suffered a heart attack and died. As I write this, news outlets are reporting that hundreds of thousands of people are without power in the Carolinas. People and animals are still in need of rescuing. The death toll may grow. Flooding is expected to continue in the Carolinas as rivers rise and are yet to crest. Folks in Conway, only 14 miles from me, are maneuvering amid floodwaters from the Waccamaw River. I faced no such terror on Monday. While driving back home, the sun pushed aside gray clouds as it warmed my face. Merely shallow waters, not deep waters, covered parts of US 17 in Pawleys Island as I got closer to Myrtle Beach. When I got out of my car, I climbed 32 steps and found my home intact. I looked around from my balcony and saw my community was basically unscathed. I am thankful because my prayer was answered. Still, I can't be blasé about storms of any kind. Wisdom demands that of me. This year's hurricane season doesn't end until November 30. More watery wolves may be on the way. That's why I am so glad I am rooted in faith. It's where I place my trust whenever a storm is raging. And lately, that's been often.",South Carolina journalist and educator Johanna Wilson recounts evacuating to escape Hurricane Florence and outlines how her faith sustained her when she returned to find her home unscathed and listened to friends who weren't so lucky.,2018-09-18T19:05:30Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Coming home after Florence, this is what I found",https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/opinions/south-carolina-hurricane-florence-spared-myrtle-beach-johanna-wilson/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918140159-second-avenue-pier-florence-0914-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","Dean Bixler used to go golfing near the top of Brickhouse Gully, a neglected drainage canal, at a course called Pine Crest. It was near his house in west Houston, and not a bad place to play until it closed down a couple of years back. In the months after Hurricane Harvey, savoring his $30,000 floodproofing investment, including metal doors with gaskets that had kept water out of his house, Bixler heard from a neighbor that the golf course was being developed. The neighbor was concerned that the new subdivision would replace low-lying grass with roofs and roads and that the runoff would flood their neighborhood in a heavy rain. In Brooklyn or Boston, residents worry new neighbors will take their sunlight or their parking spaces. In Houston, the concern is new neighbors will bring flooding. Bixler downloaded Federal Emergency Management Agency maps and found something strange. For the past decade, the entire course had sat in the 100-year flood plain—land, usually near bodies of water, that has been assessed as having a 1 percent chance of flooding every year. What that official designation means is both practical risk to the homeowner and, for anyone with a Federal Housing Administration mortgage, a potentially onerous requirement to buy flood insurance. In most places in the U.S., a flood plain encompasses beach houses and ribbons of properties along fast-rising rivers. In Houston, the 100-year clings to the bayous, gullies, and ditches that give the city its natural character and duck beneath the roads and lurk behind houses. On a map, the flood plain is to the bayous as foliage is to a branching tree. The maps Bixler pulled indicated that, according to government-approved estimates, Pine Crest golf course could be expected to sit beneath 2 feet of water during what would be called a 100-year storm. In a city locked in a mortal battle with water, that was no small thing: That much water spread across the course (at least briefly detained, in water-management lingo) would mean that much less water flowing immediately downstream in a big storm. The water from the course would flow into Brickhouse Gully, which would in turn rush east to empty into a bigger channel, the White Oak Bayou, along which more than 8,000 houses were flooded during Harvey. But then Bixler saw the FEMA map had been revised once already, with a further revision conditionally approved—essentially showing that as long as the owner, a developer in Houston, dug a channel where the golf course’s water hazards lined up, the whole property could gradually emerge from the FEMA danger zone. The 100-year flood plain the course sat upon would, as far as the official map went, disappear. Now the revisions made sense. The new owner, an Arizona homebuilder called Meritage Homes, could terraform the flood plain into 100 acres of dry land ready for 900 houses selling for about $400,000 a piece. Approximate revenue: $360 million. Homebuyers with FHA mortgages wouldn’t be required to buy flood insurance or grapple with the fears that come with living on a flood plain every time the sky darkened. The new houses, perched on fill more than 2 feet above the safer 500-year flood mark, were expected to stay dry in a major storm. But if the water that had once sat on the golf course went downstream, where would it end up? Houston is as flat as a tile, and about as resistant to water. It rains a lot (more than it used to), and it rains hard (harder than before). Water ripples across the fields of concrete and tends to flow right over the raw earth, too, a clay mix called “black gumbo.” Despite the best efforts of civil engineers, the natural streambeds that carry water from the county line to Galveston Bay aren’t much bigger than they were in 1950, when this was a city of 600,000. It’s grown fourfold since then. If the water that had once sat on the golf course went downstream, where would it end up? Unprecedented storms have brought three straight years of biblical floods, culminating in Harvey, which inundated 154,170 homes in Harris County—the Delaware-sized area that contains the city of Houston and another Houston’s worth of people outside it. Nearly half of those houses were in neither the 100-year nor the 500-year FEMA flood plain. Why did they flood? In part because Harvey was a leviathan of a storm swollen by a carbon-thick atmosphere, a once-in-10,000-years rainfall event. The weight of the water flexed the earth’s crust and temporarily sank the city a half-inch. And the homes flooded in part because Houston, like other cities, has reshaped its natural flood plains with concrete. Human construction now decides where the floods go. Bixler is tanned and stocky, with close-cropped, thinning hair and a goatee. He used to work as a seismic engineer in oil and gas, and he brought a sheaf of printed maps and charts to a strip-mall Starbucks to demonstrate what he perceived as the dirty tricks that had been used to extract the course from the 100-year flood plain. “It’s very clever engineering,” he told me. In his white pickup, classic rock radio on the dial, we cruised the roads around Pine Crest. It is hard to imagine a flood on a sunny day, but Bixler did his best to assist. Near the top of Brickhouse Gully, as we looked down on a still pool teeming with turtles, he smoked a cigarette and reflected on his struggle to bring the development to a halt. “To be quite honest, I wish my neighbor had never shown me this. I’ve lost faith in the city,” he said. “It makes me ill that the people supposed to be protecting us, Harris County Flood Control, is helping these guys.” In November of last year, shortly after Bixler dug up the flood maps, Meritage sought city approval for a special tax district to develop Pine Crest. Two months after Harvey, the prospect of a flood-prone 18-hole golf course on the upper watershed being paved into a thousand driveways was treated as a scandal. The editorial board of the Houston Chronicle wrote, “Our city can no longer tolerate a civic philosophy that insists on construction at any cost. We can no longer allow developers to treat our city as their playground for profit. … A natural sponge for floodwater would be transformed into a concrete pipeline that drains right into Buffalo Bayou.” And it was all happening along Brickhouse Gully, where, to avert future flood damage, the city had bought out 30 homes before Harvey and wanted to buy 15 more. Now, just uphill, it was enabling the construction of 900 more. The outcry managed to postpone the vote, but little more—in April, the city gave the same proposal a unanimous go-ahead. Not everyone thought this was the best use of one of the largest remaining single infill parcels in the city. “If the Flood Control District had been able to purchase that land, I’d be designing and planning to construct a large detention basin in that area,” said Matt Zeve, the director of operations for the Harris County Flood Control District. By August, Pine Crest was well on its way to becoming Spring Brook Village, a project that embodies the challenges that Houston faces as it confronts an existential question: Did the city build its way into cataclysm? On Aug. 25—the one-year anniversary of Harvey’s landfall—an astounding 85 percent of Harris County voters approved a $2.5 billion bond issue to fight flooding. It’s the largest bond issue in the history of Texas’ largest county and, everyone agrees, long-awaited recognition of the dangers that Houston faces. The support is a testament to how deep an impression the storm has left; it will quadruple the Flood Control District’s annual budget. On a recent night, a friend took me to a party in west Houston where an older couple was celebrating the move back into their house, nearly a year after Buffalo Bayou came in through their back door. It was a hot, still night, but you couldn’t hear the stream through the woods, let alone see it—or, for that matter, imagine this group of older Houstonians in polo shirts launching kayaks out their garage doors, through brown water rushing in rapids over submerged pickup trucks. Melissa Ramirez tells Edward Ramirez the status of their flooded home on Sept. 1, 2017, after she returned to it by canoe for the first time since Harvey floodwaters arrived in Houston. Among the Harvey survivors I met were Patti and R.J. Simon; last August was the fifth time their ranch house on Brays Bayou had flooded. They waded to a neighbor’s elevated home. Then they finally moved. At 75, Patti told me she was done with the routine that had accompanied the years in their house since Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Done putting the couch up on the kitchen counter each time they saw a bad forecast—and too old for it besides. So they left the neighborhood they’d known for decades, where Patti could walk to her job teaching French at the high school, and friends from church could come by and help move the boxes in and out every time the water came in the door. They lost the door frame where they measured the kids. This wasn’t their children’s main concern. “They would have committed us to asylum had we stayed,” she said. Harvey was their third flood in three years. The Simons aren’t alone: Homes that once flooded rarely, if ever, are suddenly flooding more. The flood plains are on the march, creeping inland from surging bayous. All three of the conduits below Pine Crest—Brickhouse to White Oak to Buffalo, a double-play combination that drains this stretch of northwest Houston—are among the 12 fastest-rising urban waterways in the state of Texas. Since records began more than 50 years ago, Buffalo Bayou’s peak flows are up 250 percent. Brickhouse Gully’s peak is up nearly 400 percent. And White Oak Bayou, over a slightly longer time frame, is up nearly 600 percent. That doesn’t include Harvey, said watershed scientist and consultant Matthew Berg, who published the data. “Pretty much all the time, development is a piece of it,” he asserted. “It’s just a question of how much.” Two in three Houstonians believe lax regulations have made the city’s flooding problems worse. Dean Bixler is one of them. The house where he and his wife live was built in 1960. It has now flooded three times, all in the past decade. What changed? He pointed to a giant, raised shopping center up the hill. It’s hard to prove these things, but Bixler felt it was obvious: The project had displaced scores of acre-feet (an acre-foot is an acre of water, 1 foot deep), some of which had wound up in his living room. Three times in 10 years. He lost two cars, and, like many people in Houston, he has learned to park up the block, on higher ground. (A joke I heard, which might not be a joke, was that the highest points in Houston are the soaring ramps of highway interchanges.) Bixler saw in the Pine Crest development a supercharged version of his domestic battle. It wasn’t even in his watershed. But with 900 homes on a little more than 100 acres, Pine Crest was to be among the largest infill projects in the city of Houston, an irresistible morsel for builders and a red flag for wary residents. A Meritage executive said last spring to the Houston Business Journal, “What we saw was the biggest opportunity available in the city in terms of one tract of land.” Members of Residents Against Flooding, including Bixler, allege that the map revisions distort how and where the water flows. The revisions were prepared by local hydrological engineers working for the site’s previous owners, MetroNational, and certified by the Harris County Flood Control District on behalf of FEMA. The 2007 map shows the golf course could be under roughly 200 acre-feet of water during a 100-year storm; as the developers carve a channel through the property, removing the banks from the 100-year flood plain, some of that water appears to go missing. The course has been closed for only a couple of years, but in the tropical climate it has rapidly reverted to nature, with black-eyed Susans and dense scrub filling the fairways between stands of pine. It won’t be wild for long. At the low end is the wide grass halfpipe that will one day funnel runoff from 900 driveways into Brickhouse Gully, part of what Meritage says will be a state-of-the-art drainage-and-detention system that will actually improve conditions downstream relative to the old golf course. On sunny days, it will double as a lovely water feature along which residents can walk their dogs and ride bicycles. To pay for it and other improvements, Meritage got the city to approve a “special utility district,” a geographic tax assessment that will allow a $280 million infrastructure bond issue to be paid off through buyers’ future property tax bills. (It’s a way to pass costs onto buyers.) At the high end, the trees have been felled, and grassless fill rises from the street to escape the 500-year flood mark. Two-story homes, modest and with little flair, are open for tours. The Harris County Flood Control District, for its part, has looked into all of this at the behest of Residents Against Flooding and stands by its certification of the work by the developers’ engineers. According to Todd Ward, a risk specialist and hydrologist at the Flood Control District, the revisions are just more accurate than the maps from 2007. (After complaints, the agency did its own analysis to verify this.) “When you look at it in more detail, you find there’s a lot more high ground than you might think. The actual volume stored on the site is quite a bit less than [what the 2007 map implies].” The new channel would be deep enough to bring the adjoining land safely out of the 100-year flood plain. The agency also promises that the Meritage development plan will have “no adverse impact” on water levels downstream, meaning that any flooding should be the same or less than if the development weren’t there. “There’s no question that the amount of impervious surface … has impacted the amount of runoff and flooding.” — Shannon Van Zandt In normal times, the complaints of neighborhood cranks might not be worth much against the word of the county’s hydrological authorities. But confidence in local water guardians is not high. Thousands of plaintiffs whose houses flooded during Harvey have filed suit against the Army Corps of Engineers, which runs the city’s two giant dams, for flooding their homes without warning by releasing water from the reservoirs as they neared capacity. Meanwhile, the Harris County Flood Control District insists that the past three decades of new development have not caused more flooding—a view that is not widely shared. “People have always said the guy upstream of me is making me flood,” Zeve, of the Flood Control District, told me. “That has been a common theme throughout Houston history and always will be. No one is going to deny that development increases the volume of water, but detention regulates the peak flow.” Not just in theory: Zeve said the agency’s watchful eye has successfully mitigated the effects of new development since the early 1990s. To prove it, the agency has commissioned a peer-reviewed investigation of its own detention requirements (otherwise, he notes with some self-awareness, no one would believe them), and preliminary results suggest their requirements are effective. The city’s recurring flood issues, he argued, can be attributed to huge storms hitting a city largely built before anyone knew what a flood plain was. Several experts I spoke to found that suggestion—that new development was not having an effect on flooding—ridiculous. As Houston has sprawled westward over the Katy Prairie, 75 percent of its flood-absorbent grasslands have been paved over, turning natural detention basins into roads and houses. In Brays Bayou, on the south side of the city, Rice environmental engineering professor Philip Bedient has found that rainfall is up 26 percent over the past 40 years—but runoff is up 204 percent. From 1996 to 2011, impervious surface in Harris County increased by a quarter, and from 1992 to 2010, the area lost almost a third of its wetlands—nearly 16,000 acres. It’s a correlation that’s been noted again and again. “There’s no question that the amount of impervious surface and the destruction of natural ecosystem surfaces has impacted the amount of runoff and flooding that we have seen,” said Shannon Van Zandt, the head of the landscape architecture and urban planning department at Texas A&amp;M. “There’s no question about that. I don’t think it’s plausible to suggest that the detention is taking care of the issue.” Critics say the system is built to approve more housing, not deliver objective science. Engineers who sign off on developments, assuring the public they will not contribute to flooding, bid for work from developers, who hire engineers who can make things pencil out. Those houses inside the dam basins whose owners are suing the Army Corps? Certification work for some of those projects was done by an engineering firm run by Houston’s current flood czar, Steve Costello. His firm was so deep in the trade that, when later elected councilman, he had to recuse himself “from more than 60 matters involving his firm, including city flood-control contracts and reviews of municipal utility district deals spread across the region,” according to an investigation in the Houston Chronicle. Jim Blackburn, an environmental lawyer and professor in the Rice Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, thinks the county must find a way to end this cozy relationship between engineers and their dual masters, developers and (according to state licensing) the public. One step would be to prohibit the types of flood plain map revisions that the developers had undertaken at Pine Crest. And then some. “As far as I’m concerned, Pine Crest proves the larger point, that we don’t have proper respect for the flood plain. We’re going to have to turn land over to water. Water will demand space in this city whether we like it or not.” Judge Ed Emmett, the chief executive of Harris County and most powerful politician in the region, agrees: “We’re not going to build our way out of this problem.” The saga over the development of Pine Crest is a Houston city issue, Emmett emphasized, but he said candidly: “It has been a mess.” In the year since Harvey, the Republican has emerged as a born-again advocate for better flood control. He said Harris County has the strictest building codes and flood plain regulations in the country. It was his decision to schedule the bond issue for the one-year anniversary of Harvey. “When was the last time you saw 85 percent for anything?” he asked the crowd at a supporters’ gathering Saturday night. He’s criticized the way development was conducted for decades (some of it on his watch). Though a champion of the Grand Parkway, the outermost western beltway under construction, Emmett talked conservation at a forum in February: “We need to completely protect the Katy Prairie,” he said of the great plain in western Harris County. “Just set it aside and not touch it.” There are signs of awakening in the city, too. First Harris County, and then Houston, mandated that all structures in the 500-year flood plain must be built 2 feet above the base flood elevation. The “zero net fill” rule forces all 500-year flood plain builders to dig an equivalent hole for every hill they construct. That’s among the strictest city building codes in the nation, in a place so famous for freewheeling construction that the British architecture critic Reyner Banham compared it to “a real-life Monopoly game.” It’s a recognition that, on this coastal plain, deep into the Anthropocene era, the FEMA maps no longer accurately describe what happens on the ground. (When FEMA updates its maps, the city will revisit those elevation rules.) During Harvey, Houston buildings in the 500-year flood plain were damaged at a slightly higher rate than those in the 100-year flood plain. Now the city has essentially quashed the distinction. “Of all the flood disasters I’ve lived through, this one seems to be creating more change than in the past,” said Sam Brody, a planner who served on the National Academy of Sciences committee on urban flooding in the United States. Two feet at the 500-year level was not even on the table last year. “I was saying 2 feet freeboard at the 100-year level a year ago and people were saying, ‘You crazy academic, that’s never going to happen.’ ” The homebuilders got their concessions, though. Rather than force builders to elevate structures above the flood line on stilts, the city permitted slab foundations on raised, compacted soil so long as the builder could demonstrate water flows didn’t change. This is a good thing, argues Marvin Odum, the former president of Shell Oil who was appointed Houston’s chief recovery officer after Harvey. “You basically have free rein as long as you don’t alter how water moves off of that property,” he said. A home is surrounded by floodwater after Harvey’s torrential rains pounded southeast Texas in late August 2017. That’s how Meritage is doing it: houses on mounds, not stilts. While Meritage says all that fill is coming from digging out the property, it’s not obligated to do so under pre-Harvey 500-year requirements. Before the developer received its April go-ahead to create its utility district, the company did extensive outreach with the city council and residents downstream, according to Robert Moore, a vice president of land development at Meritage. “They should feel assured,” he said, “because it’s been checked, double-checked, triple-checked to make sure we aren’t going to have a negative impact on them at all.” Meritage says—and the Flood Control District agrees—that with the carved-out channel and associated ponds, the development will hold more water upstream than the golf course did. The company also suggested that the drainage work it had done before Harvey might have alleviated flooding on Brickhouse Gully, where 2,300 homes were inundated last August. On approving the utility district, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner cited the Meritage project as proof that the city’s new code would not scare off the homebuilders who have made the Bayou City a uniquely affordable American metropolis. The downstream residents are victims. They’re also part of the problem. The chief risk facing Houston and Harris County is not the vulnerability of new developments, which do tend to be built higher, better, and upstream, but that of the older houses downstream, many built low to the ground and served by undersize storm drains. It may not be the case that your new neighbor upstream is making you flood. But the standards could be higher. Activists say the choice between an abandoned, flood-prone golf course and a subdivision of 900 homes was a false one. Susan Chadwick, the executive director of Save Buffalo Bayou, a group that opposes development in and around the river, argued in June that the city should have used eminent domain on the course to create a detention pond that would relieve Brickhouse Gully. The engineers at the Flood Control District don’t disagree it would have been a good place for a pool. As we sat in his office going over flood plains, Todd Ward conceded it was a bit of a missed opportunity. We found the course on an enormous satellite map of Houston on the wall. In a giant city, it’s a small square. But there aren’t many undeveloped parcels of that size left. Some of the just-approved $2.5 billion bond will go toward buying out existing repeat-flooding homes downstream of the newly elevated houses at Spring Brook Village. The bond calls for $35 million of channel improvements to Brickhouse Gully to reduce the risk to 1,300 homes. No matter how much care is put into terraforming, the development will dump more water into the flooded channels than it would had it become a giant detention pond instead. “You can literally measure this thing in gallons going into someone’s living room,” said Albert Pope, a professor of architecture at Rice. “There’s a way to get to fewer gallons.” Pope is one of a growing number of architects, planners, and engineers who argue for an anti-flooding plan that looks not just at what will be built (building codes, detention requirements) but also at what has been built. Those downstream residents are victims. They’re also part of the problem. He is working on a blueprint for a phased retreat of the 100,000 Houston structures that lie within the city’s 100-year flood plain. The bond was a good sign. But he added, “We are close to the end of engineering fixes.” To John Jacob, a wetland scientist and director of the Texas Coastal Watershed Program, Houston’s long-term strategy must simply be to evacuate the 100-year flood plain. It’s the equivalent of demolishing a midsize American city. “It would be traumatic. It’s not something that should be taken quickly. But it ought to be a goal.” He believes that the city’s bayous, if restored to their full storm-surge size and shorn of encroaching roads and houses, have the capacity to handle another Harvey. That land could be appropriated as a series of linear green spaces akin to D.C.’s Rock Creek Park, with trails, fields, gardens, and paths. It’s an enhanced version of the city’s Bayou Greenways 2020 project, a $220 million investment to assemble a 150-mile network of hiking and biking trails. Houston is not a walkable city, but on the trail that winds along White Oak Bayou, cyclists and joggers share space in the sunken green bend of the floodway. Egrets alight by the water. It’s a glimpse of a Houston where the bayou is something to be loved, not feared.","The story of a map, a bayou, and hundreds of millions of dollars in development.",2018-08-30T17:03:55Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",And the Waters Will Prevail,https://slate.com/business/2018/08/houston-one-year-after-hurricane-harvey-is-at-a-crossroads.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/373c69d6-d8f6-43ba-8abb-da3aa81ffddb.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=2760x1840&offset=342x0,,Slate.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Paul P. Murphy, CNN","(CNN) Authorities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, are urging thousands of people to evacuate ahead of historic flooding in an area where multiple swollen rivers converge. The county escaped the brunt of Hurricane Florence's wind, but it sits at the mouths of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers. Parts of Georgetown County will see at least 10 feet of flooding, forecasters say. Key words: at least. The flooding is expected to begin Tuesday and will last through the weekend. ""The Pee Dee River is the big elephant in the room,"" Georgetown County Administrator Sal Hemingway said in a press conference Thursday. The Great Pee Dee and the larger Waccamaw River have already swollen to record levels upstream -- as demonstrated by the flooding 40 miles north in and around Conway, where the Waccamaw is still rising -- and that water is now traveling downstream at historic levels. There is no benchmark for comparison, not even the destruction wrought by Hurricane Matthew last year, Hemingway said. Making matters worse is the potential for tides to exacerbate floodwater levels. Normally, from low tide to high tide, Georgetown sees about a 3-foot difference in the water level where the Great Pee Dee River meets Winyah Bay. Monday night's full moon means high tides will be even higher. If the rivers hit peak crest during a high tide, flooding will spread even farther into the city. How the city is preparing The rainfall that Florence dumped on North Carolina has been crawling downriver for more than two weeks. It's now set to inundate the homes and businesses belonging to Georgetown County's more than 61,000 people -- almost 8,000 of whom are being urged to evacuate. A significant portion of the city is expected to be underwater. Critical infrastructure is already being prepared and hardened. Along Highway 17, which connects Georgetown to the nearby South Carolina coast and its beaches, flood barriers are being erected. Officials worry that the flooding could wash away the portion of the highway that links the bridges spanning the Great Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers. As a precaution, the South Carolina National Guard is building a floating ribbon bridge, capable of carrying heavy equipment, across the Waccamaw River. All 19 Georgetown County schools were closed Monday until further notice. Several are ""at risk for substantial flooding damage,"" county officials say. Two of them, Georgetown High School and Waccamaw Middle School, have opened as pet-friendly shelters. The Georgetown County Water and Sewer District is also scrambling to prepare. The Waccamaw River, which supplies drinking water for the county, will soon contain dangerous pollutants from the floodwater. Ray Gagnon, executive director of the water district, told reporters that the district is working to protect all of its facilities in the ""inundation zone,"" and preparing other sources of water -- including aquifers, recovery wells, groundwater wells and the county's interconnect with the nearby Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority. Sandbags are also being distributed -- up to 10 per household -- but the county warned on its Facebook page, ""Keep in mind that sandbags will not seal out water."" Thomas Cafe sits on Front Street, the main drag in Georgetown. It looks almost exactly like did it did when it opened in 1929. The menu and the booths are original, as is most of the decor -- even the refrigerator. In its 89-year history, it has never flooded before. Matthew's floodwater reached only to its back door. ""We're expected to get water in this time,"" said Olivia Goins, who has waited tables there for five years. On Tuesday, the cafe won't be serving its famous $10.95 shrimp and grits. It will close for one of the few times in its history so employees can remove the fridges and freezers ahead of the flood. Like many residents and business owners in the city, they're trying to prepare in any way they can, but in the end, there's not much they can do. ""Water is water,"" Goins said bluntly. There's nothing anyone can really do; the floodwater is coming and, by all forecasts, will be catastrophic. Goins and the city of Georgetown are stuck playing the waiting game.

Subscribe » Steve Vicario married young, bought a house young and had to work three jobs just to keep the bills paid. But despite the pressure, he had ambition. “I told my wife, ‘One day we’re gonna have our own shore house,’” he says. “ ‘We’re gonna have the things we want.’ ” She believed him “one hundred percent,” he says. “She knew the type of person I am. I don’t believe in failure. For me it was just a matter of grinding and grinding, and at some point something will click.” Related: Why You Can Never Give Up Hope The Jersey shore held a special significance for Vicario. His parents used to take him and his three brothers there for vacations, renting or staying with relatives. Eventually his father’s South Philly auto body shop got successful enough that he was able to buy a shore house of their own in the town of Wildwood Crest. Vicario and his brothers spent all their summers down there. “There was always football on the beach, intense Wiffle ball games and tons of arguments over Monopoly,” he says. “But it brought us closer together.” After he graduated college in 1994, Vicario took on a series of jobs, working in food service sales and, in 2004, launching his own hardscaping business in Jersey. Then in 2008 he and his brother Fred bought a Hand &amp; Stone franchise -- a massage and facial spa. It flourished. Soon the two became regional developers for Central and South Jersey, and then Orange County, Calif., opening three dozen locations. His parents’ shore house was still in the family, but with four brothers and their families, it was getting cramped. Still, Vicario didn’t quite feel secure enough to make the leap to a place of his own. That changed when Hand &amp; Stone’s corporate owner sold the company. The timing felt right to exit, so he and his brother sold their regions back to the franchise. By then they had acquired Cherry Blow Dry Bar -- a blowout salon franchise currently approaching two dozen locations. Related: 7 Ways Focused Hard Work Crushes Self-Limiting Beliefs With that, Vicario finally felt secure enough to start looking for a shore house. He found a vacant lot just a block from his parents’ place, looking out over a lake with stunning sunsets and served as general contractor himself, overseeing the construction of the house. His vision was simple: “There are windows everywhere, so when you wake up, you know you’re at the shore,” he says. Image Credit: Steve Vicario The house opened its doors last summer.

Conner Dial,"When the DTC oral care brand Quip launched online in 2014, it was entering a playing field dominated by mainstream, legacy heavyweights. These oral hygiene brandsfrom Crest to Colgateare often the subsidiaries of major CPG corporations, meaning they have the resources, appeal and mass recognition needed to gain a spot on countless retail aisles and household bathrooms.
But Quips mission goes far beyond these baseline oral care retailers, encompassing not just the initial electric toothbrush purchase, but offering a subscription package that includes oral education, brush refills and more. Its this complete lifestyle positioning that has allowed Quip to sell more than one million toothbrushes and hold on to one million subscribers as of January 2019.
Now, the company is collaborating with Target to showcase its products with an in-store presence. PSFK spoke to Simon Enever, CEO of Quip, about the brands tactics for moving into an offline space and how its driving customers to visit the brands predominantly online ecosystem for post-purchase support.
PSFK: Could you describe your approach to selling in Target stores?
Simon Enever: Our mission at Quip is to make good oral health more simple, enjoyable and accessible for everyone. Launching with a direct-to-consumer approach was a critical way to help tell our story, educate people on what really impacts their oral health and change attitudes towards the routine as a whole.
Accessibility is core to our mission. We wanted to ensure we were offering our affordable oral care products in places that are as simple and convenient as possible. With our launch into Target, we were able to help offer affordable oral care solutions to the millions of people who use their weekly or monthly shopping trip to refresh their oral care products, rather than buy them online.
In retail, the jump between manual brush prices (up to around $5) and electric (often starting at $50) is even more apparent than online. We’re able to offer shoppers who visit Target a more affordable way to get the assistance of an electric brush to help improve their oral health, especially considering that around 80% are unlikely to have ever upgraded to an electric brush before, often due to their price and the experience of using one. By doing so, we’re taking huge strides towards our mission of making great oral health more accessible to more people.
Whats your approach to the subscription element when youre selling in stores?
One factor that contributes to poor oral health habits is traditional retail purchasing. With in-store purchases, people are left entirely to their own accord to use the brush the correct amount and in the right way after purchase. They have no contact with a dental professional or the brand of the brush itself, and they are left to themselves to develop the proper oral care habits (which most fail to stick to).
Our mission is to help them develop these habits for life through a subscription that guides, supports and automates the key aspects of their oral care routine that matter most for their health. One key habit, that around 75% of people dont stick to, is changing the brush head or toothbrush every three months when it becomes unhygienic and unable to clean properly. Our subscription service automates this process and nearly everyone who purchases Quip online signs up for this to help break those bad habits.
To replicate this habit change in physical retail, we only offer starter sets in store. Guests who purchase starter sets are pointed online through a unique code to sign up for a subscription refill plan (or buy a brush head without one) to help change the habits of buying a brush in a store and never changing the brush head. Instead, their brush head refills are auto shipped and refreshed every three months, just as they would if they purchased online. We also deliver optional anti-cavity toothpaste, and important oral health tips to our customers, including the proper techniques for brushingand this helps improve their oral health overall as well.
Whats the difference between online and in-store consumers? Do you find that online shoppers have more purchase intention than offline?
We have only been available in Target for four months, so its a little early to say too much about the differences in consumers shopping behaviors between online and off.
You can imagine that someone buying online is typically seeking out an electric toothbrush or Quip in particular so they are landing on our website with a lot of intent. This is different from discovering our products while browsing for other non-related products in retail, which is a new behavior we have been excited to further understand, explore and see the impact of.
What are the challenges of entering brick and mortar?
One of the biggest challenges for us was operational: dealing with bulk purchases of our product and setting up an entirely new supply and logistics chain to fulfill those orders, with a very different flow from that of our ecommerce business.
Another challenge was the need to create an entirely new packaging design to deal with the different needs of on-shelf packaging compared to that of ecommerce. Selling online allows a retailer the freedom and space to tell their brand story, from that first ad through the landing page, checkout experience and post-purchase emails. In store, this experience is entirely different, where the only space you have to tell your story is the display, if there is one, and primarily the packaging.
Our in-house design team invested heavily into creating a package that relied on a unique three-dimensional design, not gimmicky graphics, to stand out on the shelf and worked to make sure the graphic design helped tell our story, and put Quips best foot forward in a way that wasnt necessary for our ecommerce packaging.
How do you stand out from the competition, competing with larger CPG products?
In retail, one way Quip is differentiated is through the price point itself. A $25 starting price point means we can offer an accessible and effective option. It also comes down to the design of our packaging, display and product. Our packaging, as mentioned, is a unique and eye-catching shape yet more simplistic in graphical design, making it stand out without using distracting or misleading marketing tactics.

Samantha Nelson,"At the end of season 1 of Netflix’s Marvel series Iron Fist, Rand Enterprises partner Joy Meachum (Jessica Stroup) and master martial artist Davos (Sacha Dhawan) sit down to talk about the superhero Iron Fist, aka their mutual acquaintance Danny Rand. Danny (played by Finn Jones) views both characters as his siblings. Joy is the childhood friend from New York who he desperately wanted to reconnect with when he returned home after spending a decade training in the mythical city of K’un-Lun. Davos is the surrogate brother who gave him his fondest memories during his otherwise harrowing time being forged into a fighting machine by abusive monks. Despite those deep connections, Danny has left both characters bereft. He’s partially responsible for the death of Joy’s father and the destruction of the city he and Davos swore to protect. While they have little else in common, Davos and Joy foreshadow the central conflict of the second season by coming together to discuss the fact that their lives would be a lot better without Danny in them. Raven Metzner, who took over as showrunner following Iron Fist ’s widely panned season 1, seems to be on their side. The first six episodes of season 2 aim to turn the series around by stripping Danny of his resources and emphasizing the show’s supporting cast. Iron Fist is still a mess of comic book and kung fu clichés, but the later episodes of the second season show its potential to actually tell a good story. After the events of the one-shot miniseries The Defenders — a crossover event between Iron Fist and Netflix’s other Marvel Cinematic Universe series Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and Luke Cage — Danny has pledged to defend New York in Daredevil’s absence. He’s mostly focused on Chinatown, where master martial artist and former member of the Hand Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) has turned her dojo into a cozy apartment for her and Danny. The Hand’s destruction in The Defenders has left a power vacuum in the neighborhood, and other crime syndicates are violently trying to fill it. Watching Danny play the great white hope negotiating with Asian crime bosses is painful both because it reinforces his white savior role and because of Danny’s general childish incompetence. Colleen’s efforts to turn her mentorship skills from recruiting for the Hand to rehabilitating a group of young gang members lacks the racial problems of the Danny plot, but it feels like a side story from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which parodies the Hand through the evil ninja of the Foot. It’s admittedly pretty entertaining to watch teens fighting with bike chains, but it’s hard to take Colleen’s chats about getting their lives on track too seriously. The struggle to bring peace between warring criminal organizations worked better in Luke Cage season 2, when the groups had powerful charismatic leaders, and they weren’t just being used as excuses for fights involving knives and hatchets. Fortunately for the series’s momentum, that plot quickly takes a back seat to a much bigger threat in the form of Davos and Joy punishing Danny by stripping him of his Iron Fist power through a mystic ritual. Danny remains fairly oblivious to their scheming until it’s too late, leading to a hilariously awkward scene where he invites them over for a housewarming dinner party. (Since Danny would likely know that Davos’ moral code involves not drinking alcohol or eating meat, isn’t he the real villain here since he’s serving Davos spaghetti with meatballs and red wine?) That aside, the dinner is part of a sitcom-style plot to get Joy and her brother Ward (Tom Pelphrey) to reconcile after he spent years keeping Joy from knowing their father was actually alive. By trying to be everyone’s friend, Danny reinforces why so many of the show’s characters and viewers hate him. He desperately wants to be loved, but his efforts to help other people are often poorly thought-out and prone to backfiring. Photo by Linda Kallerus / Netflix Joy’s face-heel turn is marked by a ridiculous change in wardrobe. She started out wearing conservative and often colorful business attire, but now, she’s vamping it up in black dresses and furs. She was an inconsistent character in season 1, with regularly shifting motivations and loyalties that seemed to be more a result of poorly planned writing than personal capriciousness. That hasn’t changed in season 2; she plays a distant second fiddle to Davos. He’s filled with barely contained rage which he periodically releases in angry diatribes about the decadence of New York and in highly kinetic fight scenes where he shows the results of his extreme devotion to training. The worst of his venom is reserved for Danny, who he believes abandoned his responsibilities to K’un-Lun to return to a life of privilege in America. Davos believes he deserves the power more than Danny, and in many ways, he does. Both characters have decided that the destruction of K’un-Lun and the Hand means that the Iron Fist should now be used to fight evil in the world, but they fundamentally disagree on how that should be done. Davos and Joy’s plot against Danny involves hiring Mary Walker (Alice Eve), who spends the season’s first few episodes mostly demonstrating the ability to be off-putting like she displayed in the Black Mirror episode “ Nosedive.” Like Typhoid Mary, the comics character she’s based on, Walker is a hyper-competent mercenary with dissociative identity disorder. That plot would work a lot better if Jessica Jones season 2 didn’t also center on a character with dissociative episodes. Like the similarities between the criminal plots of Iron Fist and Luke Cage, this issue likely is due to the basic tropes of the source material. But it’s an unfortunate coincidence, given that the shows are going to attract the same audience, and Iron Fist seems derivative by coming later. Photo by Linda Kallerus / Netflix Further well-tread ground in season 2 includes Danny’s struggles with frustration about how little impact he seems to make, mirroring the issues Luke Cage dealt with in his second season. Like the second seasons of Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, Iron Fist ’s latest chapter focuses heavily on family conflict. Joy’s brother and former business partner Ward has joined Narcotics Anonymous and feels like he needs Joy’s forgiveness to move forward, but she just wants to start over. Colleen has lost her surrogate family in the Hand, but finding a box with her family crest on it leads her to hope she might be able to locate her mother. Flashbacks in K’un-Lun show how Davos and Danny grew up as brothers, but they also reveal that Davos had an extremely fraught relationship with his mother, who viewed him as a failure for letting Danny claim the power of the Iron Fist. These plots vary in the quality of execution. Davos’ shows what forged him into such a dangerous villain, while Colleen’s shows Metzner’s struggle to figure out what to do with the character, beyond labeling her as “Danny’s girlfriend.” But regardless of quality, they feel very familiar. Besides borrowing themes, Iron Fist season 2 also brings in Luke Cage character Misty Knight (Simone Missick), who further solidifies the anti-Danny Rand sentiment by showing up to yell at him for ruining a police bust that was in the works and landing an undercover agent in the hospital. She and Colleen had great chemistry in their barroom brawl in Luke Cage season 2, and that continues through to Iron Fist, whether they’re talking about Colleen’s new role in the world or teaming up to kick yakuza ass. Misty’s no-nonsense, take-charge attitude is a refreshing change from previous perpetual guest star Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), who has traditionally just provided medical help and moral support for superheroes in need of both. Misty brings energy to every scene she’s in with her mix of wry humor and bravado. After having to kill his dad twice in season 1, Ward has somewhat lost his role as the voice of reason, and Misty takes up the job of pointing out how ridiculous Iron Fist ’s plot is. Ward could use more to do in season 2, but it’s a small price to pay for the elimination of the convoluted boardroom drama that made up the worst parts of season 1. The CW’s Arrow and various versions of Batman have handled the billionaire-vigilante-businessman trope better than Iron Fist, so season 2 abandons that thread to bring Danny down to the same street-level fighting of the rest of the Netflix MCU shows. After giving up his stake in Rand Enterprises, Danny is making a simple living working for a moving company. There’s lingering conflict between Ward and Joy, who’s trying to set up her own business, but that’s largely fodder for more scenes without Danny. The Defenders minimized Danny’s impact by treating him more like a MacGuffin than a character and by openly letting his fellow heroes laugh at his ridiculous, out-of-place posturing. Iron Fist season 2 similarly finds ways to have events orbit Danny without actually revolving around him. Photo by Linda Kallerus / Netflix Iron Fist remains the weakest of the Netflix MCU portfolio, but its creators are trying to improve a bad situation by acknowledging their season 1 problems and modeling their story after better shows to the degree they can without entirely losing their much-maligned title character. Burdened by an unlikeable protagonist and problematic concept, the show may never be able to achieve greatness. Luke Cage and Daredevil both have neighborhoods they’ve sworn to protect, while Jessica Jones has a career as a private investigator. By comparison, Danny abandoned his duty, then managed to somehow make it irrelevant. Now, the character and show lack a clear direction. Having Danny sub in for Daredevil gives him some purpose, but that will end when Daredevil ’s third season airs in October. After that, it will be up to Iron Fist ’s creators to find their title character a new way to be a hero worth watching.","Netflix’s most derided Marvel Cinematic Universe show Iron Fist, a clumsily written series about a white superhero who becomes the embodiment of Eastern martial arts, is back for season 2.

Do you love, uh, celebrating fans????? Before you ask, no, that’s not in fact a Nazi salute—it’s a traditional club salute. As LeedsLive says, “The salute involves a repeated thump to the chest, traditionally with the left fist, while chanting ‘Leeds, Leeds, Leeds’.” Fans and players used to avoid using their right hands so as to distance themselves from the far right. However, even hardcore fans aren’t down with the logo, which offends even on aesthetic grounds, as it might as well be some randomly generated club crest from Pro Evolution Soccer. Fans seem to be quite protective of their dear old salute, and they are none too pleased with it being splashed all over the team’s branding for marketing purposes. Not exactly a wonderful use of “6 months of research” and the opinions of “10,000 people.” Leeds’ managing director acknowledged the fuckup, and the club will reopen the consultation process.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Deeper flooding loomed in the hours and days ahead from rivers in the Carolinas swollen by Tropical Depression Florence, which has killed 23 people, even if rain-weary residents got a brief glimpse of sunshine on Monday. The slow-moving storm, a hurricane when it hit the North Carolina coast, has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday, displacing thousands. The flooding could persist for several weeks in some areas. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by flood waters from the Cape Fear River on Monday. Further inland, the same river, running through Fayetteville, a city of 200,000, was expected to reach major flood levels later on Monday, and would not crest until Tuesday. Florence was headed through Virginia and toward New England and flash flood watches extended from Maryland through New York and southern New England. In the Carolinas, the National Weather Service continued to warn people the floods were worsening. “The worst is yet to come,” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, an NWS meteorologist. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately.” Major rivers are expected to remain flooded for the next two to three weeks, said Steve Goldstein, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration liaison to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The death toll from Florence, which came ashore in North Carolina on Friday, rose to 23 on Monday. The dead included a 1-year-old boy who was swept away from his mother as they tried to escape their car amid floodwaters. The woman had driven around barricades to get on a closed road, the sheriff’s office in Union County, near North Carolina’s border with South Carolina, said on Facebook. North Carolina officials reported 1,200 road closures, including a stretch of Interstate 95, a major transportation artery running the length of the U.S. East Coast. About 509,000 homes and businesses were without electricity on Monday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states. POWER OUTAGES, BLOCKED ROADS The sun appeared in some areas for the first time in days, allowing some people who had been forced to leave their homes to return home to assess damage. Eric Tryggeseth, 59, found his home in Leland, North Carolina, without power and with a tree lying in his front yard. He had been evacuated a day before by troops in a truck. “The floodwaters were rising so I figured I better get out of there,” he said. “I can’t thank the first responders enough.” There were currently 2,000 federal workers working on storm response, supporting state efforts, said Tom Fargione, FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer, during a press conference. Sean Adams, 29, a contractor from Leland, said his home suffered only minor damage but he had no idea when power might be restored. With so many roads in and out of the region flooded, he could not access supplies to help start rebuilding. “We really can’t get much done right now. It’s getting frustrating,” he said. The storm killed 17 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of people in the Georgetown, South Carolina, area were urged to evacuate their homes on Tuesday as rainwater unleashed by Hurricane Florence surged down rivers, threatening to submerge some neighborhoods under 10 feet of water. Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers, was largely spared the initial fury of Florence, which came ashore on Sept. 14 as a Category 1 hurricane, killing 46 people in three states. But the port city of more than 9,000 stands in the path of what the National Weather Service has said could be significant flooding as water dumped by the storm system drains to the ocean. “We are urging people to take this event seriously. We expect the flooding to be worse than Hurricane Matthew a couple years ago,” said Randy Akers, deputy public information officer for Georgetown County. “We always urge people to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” Akers said between 6,000 and 8,000 people have been exhorted to leave, but it was not clear how many had done so as of Tuesday evening. He said the county lacked authority to mandate evacuations. “We do have some concerns that people are not taking this event as seriously as they should,” he said. Parts of Georgetown could be submerged in up to 10 feet (3 meters) of water in the coming days as the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers overrun their banks, the National Weather Service said, adding that the deluge threatened to cut off highways and isolate communities. COAL ASH POND COULD FLOOD In neighboring Conway County, the Waccamaw, which was already well above flood stage on Tuesday, could inundate a coal ash pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic ash, according to Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility. Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was forecast to crest on Thursday at 22 feet in Conway and at 21.2 feet in Georgetown, a representative with the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said. The potential flood zone encompasses roughly 3,500 homes in Georgetown, 37 miles (60 km) south of Myrtle Beach, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island where as many as 8,000 people live, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers said. Authorities warned residents in harm’s way with recorded telephone messages and home visits. The county opened two emergency shelters on Monday, and hotels in nearby Myrtle Beach were offering discounts to evacuees. Public schools were closed until further notice. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Monday that seven rivers in the southeast part of the state were at major flood stages and three others at moderate flood stages.Meanwhile a new storm was brewing in the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Florence dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on Wilmington, North Carolina, alone. Insured losses from Hurricane Florence will range from $2.8 billion to $5 billion, according to RMS, a risk modeling and analytics firm.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Emergency management officials in Georgetown, South Carolina, were optimistic on Thursday that their port community would see less flooding than previously expected in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Florence, which crashed ashore two weeks ago as a Category 1 hurricane and killed 46 people in three states, has since dissipated, but the storm’s torrential rainfall threatens to swamp Georgetown as it drains toward the ocean. Forecasts now show floodwaters rising two to four feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) in Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers about 30 miles (50 km) south of Myrtle Beach, considerably lower than initially feared. “While we’re optimistic that things are looking better to some degree... there will be increased levels of water in some areas,” Georgetown County Administrator Sel Hemingway said on Wednesday. “The awareness level needs to be elevated.” Officials were still urging 6,000 to 8,000 residents to leave their homes, with rivers expected to crest in Georgetown on Friday and remain above flood stage for four or five days. The North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies said preliminary research suggests that Florence was among the rainiest storms in the United States in some 70 years. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the river flooding caused by Florence, which dropped nearly 20 inches (50 cm) of rain in some places in the state, is something his state has not had to cope with before. ‘FULL BATTLE MODE’ “This is unprecedented and we are still in full battle mode,” McMaster said at a press briefing on Wednesday at Emergency Management Division headquarters in Columbia, the state capital. Flooding has destroyed 46 homes in the state, significantly damaged more than 1,000 and forced 11,000 people to flee their homes, including 3,000 in Georgetown, EMD Director Kim Stenson said Wednesday. In Conway County, where the Waccamaw was already well above flood stage, Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility, said floodwaters stopped rising before inundating a pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic coal ash. “The river’s rise has slowed and we think it’s cresting today,” utility spokeswoman Mollie Gore said from the site, where 115 workers had shored up the dam around the pond. “We still have a foot between the top of the river and the top of the dam.” Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. Some one to two inches of rain moving into the central and western parts of the state in a next day or two will prolong the flooding, said meteorologist Rich Otto of the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Crews worked to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river.

Alan Taylor,"At least three people are confirmed to have lost their lives so far amid record-setting floods affecting parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and other nearby states. Thousands of people have been asked to evacuate, and many have been away from their homes for days in hard-hit Nebraska, following last week’s “bomb cyclone” weather system that dropped huge amounts of precipitation—adding to existing troubles from heavy snow melt and ice-choked rivers. Dams and levees were overwhelmed, roads have been washed away, and some neighborhoods, farms, and military bases now sit in water up to 8 feet deep. As some of the rivers in eastern Nebraska are beginning to recede and others are expected to crest within 24 hours, worries are growing for areas downstream, along the Mississippi River Valley.","Snowmelt and last week’s “bomb cyclone” have overwhelmed rivers in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and neighboring states, causing widespread flooding that has broken dozens of records, and cost at least three lives.",2019-03-18T16:49:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Historic Flooding Across the Midwest,https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2019/03/midwest-flood-photos/585169/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/03/midwest-flooding/f01_AP19076776858624-1/facebook.jpg?1552924307,,Theatlantic.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrew Martonik,"The Pixel 3 doesn't have many show-stopping issues. But its 2915mAh battery is a clear weak point among competitive phones that crest 3500mAh nowadays. Sure it has smaller overall dimensions so it just doesn't have the room for more battery, but nonetheless battery life is shorter than the competition and is one of the trade-offs you have for getting such a nicely compact phone. That means less wiggle room in your daily routine, which could lead to a low battery earlier in the day than you'd like. But there are a few tweaks you can make to improve battery life on your Google Pixel 3 and make the most of its limited capacity. Check your battery usage details The best way to start fixing battery problems is to know where the battery is going. This really lands in the ""knowledge is power"" section: the best way to start diagnosing battery life problems is to see where your battery is going. In Settings, Battery you can tap the top-right menu button to check Battery usage to get some insight into what's draining your phone. It's best to do this near the end of the day to get a good feel for overall battery usage — and the insight is helpful. Tap the menu button again to show the full device usage, including screen time. If you haven't used an app much but it's using double-digit percentage of your battery in a day, you should consider checking in on that app to see if everything is working properly. You'll also see if there are odd outliers like ""Android OS,"" which could indicate a system-level problem that's hung up or gotten stuck syncing and needs to be fixed with a setting change or just a reboot. Turn off Ambient display In the Display settings you'll find an option to turn off Ambient display — this is the feature that keeps your time and notifications lit up even when the screen is ""off."" It looks great and is super useful to get information at a glance, but keeping the display active uses battery throughout the entire day, even when you're not looking at the phone. Turning off Ambient display doesn't make the phone totally useless without pressing the power button, though — there's a nice middle ground. You can let the phone turn on Ambient display when you lift your phone or a notification comes in, which is a nice compromise, and you can make your display turn on with a double tap of the screen. Reduce display sleep time If you set down your phone without turning off the screen, you should reduce the timeout. As we've established, the less time your phone's screen is on the less it's draining your battery. If you're the kind of person that finishes using their phone and sets it down on the table without turning off the screen manually, you'll want to reduce the display sleep time. In Settings then Display, you'll see the option for Sleep — tap it and choose something lower than where you have it now. 15 seconds may feel a bit restrictive if you like to read longer bits of content without scrolling, but 30 seconds is a nice middle ground. Those seconds add up to minutes throughout the day, and can save precious battery power. Turn on Adaptive Battery This feature lets the system limit infrequently used apps from waking up and draining your battery, which is really helpful. It's pretty conservative about this in order to not cause you any problems with not receiving notifications, but really helps reduce battery usage by apps you installed and forgot about or just don't use all that often. You can find the Adaptive Battery setting in Settings, Display and then Adaptive Battery. Switch to a static wallpaper The glory of a living wallpaper wears off quickly — switch it up with a static one refreshed daily. Google loves to show off the Pixel 3's display with beautiful ""Living Universe"" wallpapers. These are stunning visual experiences that look static at a glance, but are actually subtly moving throughout the day. They're beautiful to look at, and present you something slightly fresh to look at every time you unlock your phone, but they drain your battery in the process. They don't use a ton of battery, but they use far more than a static image. To eke out every last bit of your battery, you want to switch to a still image instead. A nice compromise for those who want something fresh on their phone on a regular basis is to switch to a ""daily"" wallpaper through the wallpaper settings. You can select a category and get a new curated image displayed on your phone each day — keeping things fresh, but without constantly moving within the day. Use Battery Saver If you're been using your phone hard and know you won't find a charger anytime soon, flip on Battery Saver. Your phone will still work normally when it comes to most notifications and app use, but it restricts performance and background data access for apps so that nothing can drain your phone unless you're actively using it. It's not something you'll use every day, but it's a life saver when your phone's draining fast. It isn't something you'll want to use all the time, but if the alternative is having a dead phone... you'll prefer to use it under these restrictions. You can go into Settings then Battery to make it turn on automatically at a specific battery percentage (15% is a good mark), and you can add a quick setting toggle in your notification shade to turn it on and off manually as you see fit. Make the most of your charging time We'll all have to charge our phones at some point. And if you're in need of a midday top-up, you want that charging time to be as meaningful as possible, which means picking the right charger for the job, not just any old plug you have laying around. You have to charge at some point; might as well make it as fast as possible. The charger that comes in the box is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) charger that will supply 18W of power to the Pixel 3, and charge it up incredibly quickly. The great thing about USB-C PD is that it's an open standard, and there are hundreds of chargers out there to choose from. Find yourself a well-rated USB-C PD charger that's rated for at least 15W, and your Pixel 3 will be happy to charge up in a surprisingly fast amount of time. There are good wall chargers, portable batteries and car chargers that all support USB-C PD. If you want to charge up wirelessly, the fastest way to do so is to use a Google-approved ""Made for Google"" charger. Right now that means the Google Pixel Stand... and few others. Unless it's the Pixel Stand or specifically a ""Made for Google"" charger, it won't wirelessly charge the Pixel 3 at its full 10W, and that means you'll be stuck on the much slower 5W standard.",Get the most out of that little battery. The Pixel 3 doesn't have many show-stopping issues. But its 2915mAh battery is a clear weak point among competitive phones that crest 3500mAh nowadays. Sure it has smaller overall dimensions so it just doesn't have the…,2018-11-08T12:00:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Androidcentral.com'}",Google Pixel 3: How to make the most of your limited battery,https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-google-pixel-3-battery-life,https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/10/google-pixel-stand-both-sizes.jpg?itok=qcHOwuFa,,Androidcentral.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Melanie Rieders,"Name: Mecca Williams and Ashley Isokpehi Location: Bed-Stuy Brooklyn, New York Size: 950 square feet Years lived in: 2 years, renting Longtime friends Mecca and Ashley planned on living together well before Ashley moved to New York. After a long and tedious search, they found a perfect sun-filled spot in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The two creatives worked hard to develop an aesthetic that blends their tastes. The style destination they arrived at is a soothing, plant-filled space that draws inspiration from Nigeria and Jamaica. The apartment's Instagram handle, It's Apt 4, showcases their apartment living and various events they host. Their best advice? ""...go with a piece or something that is the current you, something of your past (to keep you grounded), and something of the future you for progression."" Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Matisse meets Malcolm X meets Malick Sidibe meets Frida Kahlo Inspiration: Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life Favorite Element: Plants, Sunlight, and Vibes, they're in unison! Each of the plants in our house have specific names. We named each of them after influential black women that inspire us greatly! That with the warm vibe and sunlight creates the most peaceful combination. Biggest Challenge: We are both super creatives, and mesh very well in that, but I think the biggest and most exciting challenge is bringing our space and ideas together cohesively. We disagree a lot, but in the end we come together and choose the best pieces and things that work for our place equally. What Friends Say: ""It feels like home!"" Biggest Embarrassment: For Mecca's birthday, we threw a BBQ on our roof and our neighbor called the fire department because she ""feared we would burn down the brownstones on the block."" The firemen extended a ladder from the street to the roof of our brownstone and stormed through the building to find nothing. It was a laughable mess; they walked away with a few hot dogs and burgers though, and we partied on! Gotta love Brooklyn! Proudest DIY: Our Kinfolk-inspired painting in our living room. We saw this beautifully painted canvas in the Kinfolk Living storybook, immediately bought it and used it as the main inspiration for the art piece in our living room. We sourced the color, carried the large canvas through the city to Bedstuy. Ashley then painted it, ensuring it had depth and texture and voila! Biggest Indulgence: Our marble coffee table from Crate &amp; Barrel. We searched high and low for the right affordable marble table, but just couldn't find what we were looking for. One day I saw this coffee table on Crate &amp; Barrel, and just needed it! Needless to say, one month later that marble coffee table made its home in our abode. Thanks for the friends who helped us carry and assembly it! Best Advice: Go with your instincts; they are your very essence! Home decor is super spiritual, and is supposed to inspire you daily. So when shopping/curating your space go with something that is the current you, something of your past (to keep you grounded), and something of the future you for progression.

Special Correspondent,"The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has opened shutters (30 cm) of the Moozhiyar dam, Pampa dam and the Kakki-Anathode twin reservoirs of the Sabarigiri hydro-electric project in the Moozhiyar forests on Friday afternoon following a forecast of heavy rain till Sunday. The decision was taken at a meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority chaired by District Collector P.B. Noohu on Thursday evening. The Disaster Management Authority had also declared Orange alert in Pathanamthitta district. No need for panic The news on the opening of shutters left the residents of Ranni, Kozhencherry, Adoor, Mallappally and Thiruvalla taluks, already affected by the recent floods, panicky. Media offices were flooded with distress calls from different parts of the district, asking whether those residing along the river banks should be shifted. Mr. Noohu said there was no need for panic as the dam shutters had been opened as a precautionary measure in the event of a very heavy rainfall as in mid-August. Presently, there was no need of panic and the administration had been fully geared up to meet any exigency, he said. KSEB executive engineer Ganesan K. told The Hindu that water level in all the three reservoirs had been below the crest-level, and hence there was no need to panic. Though the shutters were kept open, water would flow out only once it crossed the crest level. Mr. Ganesan said the storage position in Kakki and Pampa dams was 77.32% and 53.79% respectively of their full reservoir capacity. The water level in the Pampa dam was 6.5 metres below the crest level and that of the Kakki-Anathode twin reservoir was 40 cm below the crest level, he said. Moderate rainfall Mr. Ganesan said the rainfall was moderate in the catchment areas of the Sabarigiri reservoirs. Catchment areas of Kakki had received 18 mm rainfall on Thursday while that of Pampa was 17 mm. Mr. Ganesan said the release of water from the Kakki-Anathode, Pampa and Moozhiyar dams would be 150, 100, and 50 cumecs respectively.","Water in Moozhiyar, Pampa and Kakki-Anathode reservoirs below crest-level",2018-10-05T18:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Sabarigiri shutters opened,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarigiri-shutters-opened/article25138328.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steven John,"Why you'll love it: If you'd prefer to avoid artificial ingredients in your whitening toothpaste, then Dental Expert Active Whitening Charcoal Toothpaste is an excellent choice. 
 Granted, using a black toothpaste in hopes of achieving a white smile might seem counterintuitive. For many people, using black toothpaste will seem downright odd no matter what the goals. But rest assured that not only will a good activated charcoal toothpaste not leave black residue on your teeth, but will, in fact, leave your smile cleaner and more pearly white than it was before. The Dental Expert Active Whitening Charcoal Toothpaste is the best one you can buy. 
 The toothpaste doesn't have sulfates, fluoride, synthetic colors, or artificial flavors. It uses a mixture of natural ingredients that includes charcoal powder derived from sustainable bamboo. Charcoal can help break up and lift stains, fight off bacteria that cause bad breath and gum ailments, and help create a gentle abrasion that removes plaque built up on your teeth. 
 Now, in all candor, many dentists and oral health experts feel that for the best cleaning and whitening, your toothpaste needs to feature fluoride and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Products that have those ingredients will probably whiten faster and more effectively. But if you prefer to live a life using all-natural ingredients, then Dental Expert Active Whitening Charcoal Toothpaste is a safe and relatively effective choice for enjoying a cleaner, whiter smile. 
 Even with more than 3,000 review posted on Amazon, Dental Expert Active Whitening Charcoal Toothpaste enjoys a solid 4.3-star average rating. A buyer named Maryanna loved its ""surprisingly great taste"" while another reviewer named Lynne said she could ""definitely see a difference"" after using the toothpaste for a while. 
 In a comprehensive product roundup from Dental Dorks, the writer said he loved its ability to ""destroy bad breath"" by helping fight off bacteria. 
Pros: All-natural formula, effectively fights bad breath, breaks up plaque 
Cons: Not as effective as traditional options, may cause gum sensitivity","Insider Picks writes about products and services to help you navigate when shopping online.

Lucy Thorpe,"Tommy Jeans continues to bring the heat this fall with a capsule collection of stylishly casual pieces paying tribute to Tommys historic Crest emblem. The Crest collection hits shelves on Thursday, November 15, and to celebrate, German retailer Kickz will be throwing a launch event that day at its Berlin store on Torstrasse. The free event will showcase Tommy Jeans’ new capsule in full and give attendees the chance to purchase garments on the day it drops. DJ-cum-activist-cum-model DJ Wana Limar aka Wanye West will be behind the decks, drinks will flow, and a host of influential faces from Berlin’s fashion scene will no doubt stop by to peruse the new collection. Originally released in 1985, Tommy Hilfigers Crest, which depicts a lion with a sword encircled by laurels, is one of the American labels most recognizable emblems after the iconic red-white-navy flag. Over the years it has adorned both Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans garments and has been subject to reworks, most recently by Kith for their collaborative drop earlier this year. Selected as the main source of inspiration for this capsule, the iconic insignia anchors the capsule in the brands past, while modern cuts and silhouettes ensure its firm footing in the present. The collection highlight’s included a navy and green plaid Harrington jacket, a denim trucker, as well as crest-heavy hoodies featuring the golden emblem center front, on the sleeves and back. All of these garments and more will be on display and available to cop at the Kickz event. The launch event will take place on November 15 at Kickz’s Berlin Store ( Torstrasse, 86 ) from 7-9 p.m. Any readers in Berlin are invited to swing by for an evening of fashion and choons.","Tommy Jeans continues to bring the heat this fall with a capsule collection of stylishly casual pieces paying tribute to Tommy’s historic Crest emblem.

The slur, which has been denounced by FIFA and CONCACAF when used elsewhere, was chanted by the fan section in the Banc of California Stadium's 3252 area when the Sounders' goalkeeper took a free kick. LAFC owner Tom Penn and 3252 Independent Supporters Union Josef Zacher issued a joint statement that said any fans identified as participating in the offensive chant would be removed from the stadium and have their season membership revoked. ""The offensive goal-kick chant is wrong and not what we are about,"" the statement read. Jim Buzinski, co-founder of the LGBT athletic magazine Outsports, called it blatant homophobia.

""This is a bad look for LAFC, which plays in a city where LGBT people are part of the social fabric and fan base,"" Buzinski wrote Tuesday. ""Unless fans are tossed from games for chanting the slur, it will continue. It appears to be a badge of pride for some fans, who seem to be proud of themselves for some reason and fall back on 'culture' as a defense....This nonsense has got to stop.""

ABC News,"Sandbags were holding back floodwaters in parts of Michigan as a storm system moved across several Midwest and Great Plains states on Wednesday, bringing heavy rain, snow and ice to the region. The weather has already been blamed for hundreds of car crashes and several fatalities, including the deaths of four people in a crash along a slippery interstate in Nebraska. Melting snow and heavy rain prompted the National Weather Service to issue flood warnings for parts of northern Illinois and northern Indiana, as well as southern Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Flood warnings also were issued for parts of Missouri and Texas. Flooded streets in Michigan stranded motorists and a school bus in Flint, while residents in Mattawan, in the southwestern part of the state, used sandbags to protect homes and businesses as the Mattawan Creek rose above its banks. ""We just got to wait for it to go down,"" Mattawan resident Terry Teeter, who installed pumps to keep water away from his house, told WOOD-TV. ""It's going to be a couple of days like this."" In Illinois, the fear of rising water along the Illinois River forced the evacuation late Tuesday of the LaSalle County Nursing Home in Ottawa. In Indiana, homes and streets were flooded in the South Bend area, and forecasters predicted the local St. Joseph River wouldn't crest until Thursday. Flood watches were issued for several states, while winter weather advisories were in effect Wednesday for an area stretching from southwestern Illinois to Texas, including parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansasm The weather stretched as far south as Arkansas, where strong winds toppled power lines and damaged some buildings late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Two days of rain in southern Wisconsin swelled waterways, prompting road closures. Police and firefighters rescued people from vehicles stranded in high water Tuesday at two sites in Janesville. In western Michigan, officials said a washout from heavy rains may have caused two engines from a freight train to derail near Grand Rapids. No injuries were reported. A 52-year-old woman from Bourbonnais, Illinois, was found dead Tuesday in a submerged car in Peotone, south of Chicago. The woman apparently lost control of her car on southbound Illinois Route 45 and ended up in a rain-filed ditch, Peotone Fire Protection District Deputy Chief Bruce Boyle said. In eastern Nebraska, speed and slippery pavement caused a crash between a pickup truck and a semitrailer Tuesday that killed four people on Interstate 80, police said. The three men and one woman killed were from Colorado, authorities said. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a 38-year-old woman died and two other people were injured in a collision on an icy highway late Monday. In Minnesota, state police said winter weather contributed to 400 crashes and 250 spinouts, including two fatal accidents. The storm system stretched to Texas, where weather service officials said three tornadoes hit. One struck early Tuesday in a rural area near Joshua, destroying at least two mobile homes and severely damaging several others. A mother and her disabled daughter were injured when one twister demolished their mobile home.","ABC News States face flooding, other problems in Midwest amid storms ABC News A mobile home is seen destroyed after a tornado struck an area outside Joshua, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Fort Worth, Texas, Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018.

Travis Fedschun,"At least three people are dead as a storm system roars eastward across the central U.S., spawning possible tornadoes and flooding and leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin said late Saturday two people died in the western part of state due to ""severe weather events"" as the storm that also included strong winds, hail and heavy rain slammed the region. ""Please take weather watches/warnings seriously, and stay safe,"" Bevin said on Twitter. In rural, south central Kentucky, 79-year-old Dallas Jane Combs died after a suspected tornado hit her Adairville home Saturday evening, Logan County Sheriff's Department told television station WKRN. Sheriff officials said Combs was inside the home when it collapsed on her. Combs was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities say Combs' husband was outside the house when the unconfirmed tornado hit and he sustained minor injuries. In northeast Arkansas, an 83-year-old man was killed after high winds toppled a trailer home. Clay County Sheriff Terry Miller said in a Facebook post that Albert Foster died Saturday night after the home was blown into a pond in Knobel. Storm-related damage also was reported in Middle Tennessee, where FOX17 in Nashville reported extensive damage to homes and vehicles. FOX17 said at least a dozen homes were damaged in one Montgomery County subdivision. FOX NEWS WEATHER CENTER The storms were caused by a system associated with a cold front moving east, which caused flood watches and warnings to be issued across multiple states as of Sunday morning while a wind advisory remained in effect for nearly all of Lower Michigan. Heavy rain also spread into the Northeast, which caused greater flooding fears. Pennsylvania Avenue at the Potter Park Zoo entrance is still closed due to flooding, Saturday, Feb. 24, 2018 in Lansing, Mich. (Robert Killips /Lansing State Journal via AP) ""It's right along that line we've seen the most rain activity here throughout the weekend,"" Fox News Meteorologist Adam Klotz said Sunday on "" FOX &amp; friends Weekend."" Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens signed an executive order earlier Saturday declaring a state of emergency ahead of the anticipated storms and flooding in parts of southern Missouri. The order activates the resources of the Missouri National Guard and ensures state resources are available in the event of weather damage. A levee breach along the Kankakee River in northwestern Indiana had local officials urging about 30 homeowners to evacuate. A view from the Central Bridge shows the flooding from the Ohio River Saturday, Feb. 24, 2018 in Cincinnati. (Liz Dufour/The Cincinnati Enquirer via AP) The Ohio River is expected to reach 60.6 feet in Cincinnati by Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. The expected river crest would easily make it the worst flooding Greater Cincinnati has seen since March 5, 1997, when the river hit 64.7 feet, FOX19 reported.

"USA TODAY, Courtney Campbell, USA TODAY","The 20 most popular things our readers bought on Amazon in July (Photo: Instant Pot / Intex) — Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY’s newsroom and any business incentives. Happy August! At the beginning of each month, we like to look back at all the products our readers have purchased during the previous month. It’s always fun to see what was the most popular, and because of Amazon Prime Day in mid July, our readers bought an exceptionally wide array of items last month. Some of the best cooking and tech products were at their lowest prices during this crazy sale, so it’s no surprise they made the list, but others were just great deals on fun items. Even though Prime Day has come and gone, these are still great products to invest in and some of them are still at a pretty good price. So whether you want to invest in that cult-favorite kitchen gadget ( cough Instant Pot cough ) or just want an inexpensive, wacky product, here are the 20 most popular things our readers bought on Amazon in July. 1. The cult favorite Instant Pot Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1 Pressure Cooker (Photo: Instant Pot) The Instant Pot was at an all-time low price on Prime Day and it sold out twice, so we’re not shocked that it's at the top of our list. It probably won’t be back to a sale price under $60 anytime soon, but it still might be worth the buy if you want an easy way to cook more at home. We love this product because it has all the functions of a pressure cooker, slow cooker, and rice cooker, so you can do all your cooking in one place—and fast. Get the Instant Pot DUO 6 Qt 7-in-1 for $99.95 2. A streaming stick for binge-watching Amazon Fire TV Stick (Photo: Amazon) With a great deal on the Amazon Fire TV Stick on Prime Day, our readers went nuts. It may not be our top pick for streaming devices, but it’s on the lower-end cost-wise and has a button for Alexa built in to the remote, which we think is pretty neat. Get the Amazon Fire TV Stick for $39.99 3. An inexpensive wireless charging pad RAVPower Wireless Charging Pad (Photo: RAVPower) We had an exclusive discount code that made this inexpensive wireless charging pad even cheaper on Prime Day. The code no longer works, but at only $10, this simple charger is still a great bargain for your office, kitchen, living room, and bedroom. Get the RAVPower Qi Wireless Charging Pad for $9.99 4. A DNA testing kit to find your health and heritage 23andMe DNA Testing Kit (Photo: 23andMe) DNA testing kits are cool and all, but they’re even better when they’re on sale. People love this one from 23andMe because it not only shows you your heritage, but it also gives you information on how your DNA affects your health. The kit is no longer at its lowest price, but it’s still selling for less than its original market price. Get the 23andMe DNA Test Health + Ancestry for $138.99 5. Unlimited music to jam out to Amazon Music Unlimited (Photo: Amazon) Amazon ran an insane Prime Day deal where you could get 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $0.99.

Get Amazon Music Unlimited for $9.99/month ($7.99/month for Prime members) 6. An electric toothbrush your dentist is proud of Our readers liked the white color, but this guy loves brushing with his black toothbrush. (Photo: Philips) We call this electric toothbrush from Philips the BMW of toothbrushes—it’s that good. It was at an insanely low price on Prime Day, but unfortunately it’s pretty pricey again (hence the nickname). If you are willing to invest the money, this is a great choice for those us who want to improve our dental health. Get the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for $162.30 7. One of our favorite car chargers Maxboost Car Charger (Photo: Maxboost) I think car chargers are essential for road trips, and our readers agree. After we tested a number of leading car chargers this one from Maxboost was our runner-up because it charged smartphones the fastest. It was on sale for just under $8 for a while this month, but at $10, you might as well still get it. Get the Maxboost Car Charger for $8.38 8. The best affordable meat thermometer Habor Meat Thermometer (Photo: Habor) It’s still the season of grilling, and if you don’t want to cut into an undercooked or overcooked slice of meat, you’re going to want a meat thermometer. The Habor Instant Read Meat Thermometer is our favorite affordable meat thermometer because it was just as accurate as some of the more expensive models. Although it's not on sale right now, at less than $10, we think it's still worth the buy. Get the Habor Instant Read Meat Thermometer for $9.49 9. Strips for whiter teeth Crest 3D Whitestrips (Photo: Crest) White Strips aren’t usually a must-buy for most shoppers, but when they’re on sale the prospect of a brighter smile is hard to resist—and that’s exactly what our readers thought during Prime Day. This pack from Crest claims to whiten your teeth after 20 days and may even remove or reduce yellow stains on your teeth. Get the Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips for $43.99 10. A mini Amazon smart speaker Echo Dot (Photo: Amazon) The Echo Dot is one of my favorite Echo devices. It’s tiny and the cheapest, which makes it perfect for a small apartment.

The best multicooker we’ve ever tested Crock-Pot Express Crock Multi-Cooker (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) Instant Pot may be a household name, but after testing electric multi-cookers, we found that this one from Crock-Pot actually bested it. Bonus: It’s $30 cheaper than the Instant Pot. Get the Crock-Pot Express Crock Multi-Cooker for $69 12. An Echo that’s perfect in the kitchen Amazon Echo Show (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) The Echo Show was at its lowest price ever during Prime Day.

A straw that will filter your water LifeStraw (Photo: LifeStraw) This was one of the more unique items on our list this month. The LifeStraw was $5 off on Prime Day and people were pretty interested in it.

Get the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter for $14.99 14. Our favorite electric toothbrush Oral-B Pro 3000 Electric Toothbrush (Photo: Oral-B) We were so excited when our favorite electric toothbrush was on sale.

Plus, it's also much more affordable than the Philips BMW. Get the Oral-B Pro 3000 Electric Toothbrush for $76.99 15. An indoor security camera for when you’re away Amazon Cloud Cam (Photo: Amazon) Indoor security cameras are great for when you want to keep an eye on things while you're on vacation or to see if the cat’s okay while you’re at work. The Amazon Cloud Cam isn’t our favorite indoor security camera, but it's still totally fine, and plenty of people bought it when it was on sale on Prime Day. Get the Amazon Cloud Cam Security Camera for $119.99 16. An air purifier so you can finally breathe hOmeLabs Air Purifier (Photo: hOmeLabs) We’ve haven’t tested the hOmeLabs Air Purifier, but our readers went for it when it was on sale on Prime Day.

A faster streaming device Amazon Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD (Photo: Amazon) Another Amazon streaming device was on sale during Prime Day: The Fire TV.

Get the Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD for $69.99 19. The best affordable hair dryer Revlon Hair Dryer (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) The Revlon 1875W Infrared Hair Dryer is the best affordable hair dryer we’ve ever tested because it works just as well as more expensive models at a fraction of the price. When it’s on sale, our readers tend to go crazy for it, but even at its full price, we think it’s still a great value for a solid hair dryer. Get the Revlon 1875W Infrared Hair Dryer for $16.69 20. A fun floatie for the pool Intex Unicorn Inflatable Ride-On Pool Float (Photo: Intex) There were a bunch of fun pool floats on sale during Prime Day, but people liked this unicorn one the best.

Amy Held,"Aerial views of flooding and submerged homes in Lumberton, N.C., on Thursday. Carol Guzy for NPR Florence may have concluded its crawl over the Carolinas, but officials are warning residents not to let the fairer weather deceive them. For days, the storm dumped relentless rain — in some places around three feet — and as all that water continues to make its way downstream, rivers keep on rising. The storm's death toll ticked up to 41 people on Thursday; 31 people in North Carolina alone, which entered its 13th day under a state of emergency. Lt. General Jeffrey Buchanan surveys flooding and damage from Hurricane Florence from a helicopter ride from Raleigh to Wilmington, N.C., on Wednesday. Buchanan also assisted in Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Carol Guzy for NPR The state's Department of Public Safety said four more deaths were reported in Duplin County, without providing further details, reports The Associated Press. ""Major flooding is still occurring across many of our rivers,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a Thursday news conference. Even as he underscored the ongoing danger, he highlighted the tireless efforts of first responders. ""More than 4,700 people have been saved, twice as many as in Matthew."" U.S. Army servicemen and women distribute water bottles and supplies. Carol Guzy for NPR The National Weather Service reported flooding at 30 river gauges on Thursday, 12 of them major, mainly in North Carolina, but also in South Carolina and Virginia. Rivers at some sites are not forecast to crest for days, including near Conway, S.C., where President Trump visited Wednesday. ""Over the next couple of days it's going to get rough in South Carolina,"" Trump told a crowd gathered at the Horry County Emergency Operations Center. Trump called Florence ""one of the most powerful and devastating storms ever to hit our country."" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster agrees. ""The rainfall and flooding in North Carolina is sending unheard of amounts of water into South Carolina along the Lynches, Great Pee Dee, Little Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers,"" McMaster wrote Thursday. ""The damage in the northeastern part of our state will be catastrophic, surpassing anything recorded in modern history."" Aerial views of damage from Hurricane Florence in North Carolina. Carol Guzy for NPR Residents of Georgetown County, S.C., have been told to have go-kits at the ready in case of evacuation. ""The difficulty lies in determining the volume of waters that will flow down to Georgetown,"" County Administrator Saul Hemingway tells ABC News. ""Due to the fact that a lot of these rainfall levels were higher than historic levels, it made it harder to predict because you didn't have a benchmark to weigh that against."" Officials are maintaining their plea for motorists to avoid areas still experiencing flooding. Even on seemingly safe roadways, vehicles can quickly be overcome. On Tuesday a sheriff's van in Horry County, S.C., was swept away, killing two of its passengers on their way to receive mental health treatment. Most of the storm deaths have occurred in vehicles, reports the AP. Around 750 roads remained closed across North Carolina Thursday, down from around 2,200, according to the state's Department of Transportation. About 750 roads remain closed (down from 2,200), including sections of I-40 &amp; I-95. US 258 in Kinston was closed Thurs due to flooding. Drivers should plan for US 70 to be closed as the Neuse continues to rise. US 421 at the New Hanover Co line is now closed. #FlorenceNC pic.twitter.com/e1oGxoH968 — NCDOT (@NCDOT) September 20, 2018 ""There are many roads where water levels will continue to rise making the roads impassable during the next 72 hours or more depending on when the local rivers crest,"" NCDOT said, adding that travel was not recommended in several counties, including Cumberland, Duplin and Harnett. Views of power workers in North Carolina. Carol Guzy for NPR Duke Energy, the area's biggest utility, reported tens of thousands of customers in North and South Carolina were still without power Thursday. Duke also raised an emergency alert Thursday after floodwaters from the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, N.C., spilled over a dike, threatening a retired coal-fired plant now used as a generating station run with natural gas, reports the AP. Over the weekend, Duke also said that flooding had resulted in toxic coal ash spill. On Wednesday, 7,800 residents remained in shelters across North Carolina. So far 16 tornadoes associated with #Florence have been confirmed. Storm surveys are continuing and it is likely that additional tornadoes will be confirmed during the next several days. pic.twitter.com/7JI6XrRThN — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 20, 2018 Chef Jose Andres, who helped feed Puerto Ricans devastated by Hurricane Maria, has been in North Carolina for days with his nonprofit World Central Kitchen. They have been serving up 20,000 meals a day to feed first responders as well as storm evacuees. As if the flooding were not enough, officials confirmed Thursday that Florence had spawned more than a dozen tornadoes, with more expected in the coming days. And in yet another miserable twist of nature: floating balls of fire ants have emerged, like the ones that plagued Harvey survivors in the Houston area. ""The fire ants are doing their thing where they float and if you get close to them they will swim to you,"" Conway resident Debbie Long told South Carolina Public Radio. ""I've already been bitten."" But even as some residents remain in the grip of an ongoing disaster, officials are also eyeing the road to recovery. Aerial views of damage from Hurricane Florence in North Carolina. Carol Guzy for NPR Floodwaters have receded in some areas, allowing residents to return home to assess the damage. In an appeal for federal disaster recovery funds, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina announced Thursday that the state's financial losses from the storm are estimated to top $1.2 billion. McMaster is asking for funding for half of the state's 46 counties. The preliminary breakdown includes losses and federal recovery fund estimates of $125 million for the state's agriculture industry and $165 million for the National Flood Insurance Program. Also Thursday, FEMA said it will speed up the process for storm victims to receive advanced payments on their flood insurance claims. Policyholders can get up to $5,000 without an adjuster visit or providing additional documentation to their insurer, FEMA said. But if a policyholder provides photo or video evidence of damage and receipts of out-of-pocket expenses related to flood loss, up to $20,000 in advanced payments will be available. NPR's Ruben Kimmelman contributed to this report.","The additional deaths were reported in North Carolina.

CH Editors,"Toronto-based Pansy Ass Ceramics is a CH favorite for their humor, playfulness and quality creations. The company—made up of Kris Aaron and Andrew Walker—explores gay male identify and culture via ceramics that are oftentimes subversive, and always eye-catching. From plates to planters, vases and objets, their creations pay homage to everything from anal beads to desserts. For this year's CH Omakase, Pansy Ass created several vessels—each one as delightful as the last, and all entirely functional. The Juicy Fruit Planter, made in an edition of 100, was especially made for Omakase with a G-rated vibe. The strawberry-shaped planter was delivered complete with an air plant in the USA, and a synthetic version for international clients. Made in an edition of 14, the black and white Marbled Cock Planter is as blunt as its name. Handmade in Toronto, this vessel is also crafted to display an air plant (or similar) and should be hung with a nail at 45º for maximum support. Two very lucky Omakase clients were gifted entirely one-of-a-kind pieces by Pansy Ass—and both are comical, and R-rated. A mischievous take on the fruit bowl, the Dick and Banana Bowl appears to be held up by phalluses and phallus-shaped fruits. The bowl itself is gold-rimmed and functional, but is a work of art in itself. Making the subversive punny, Pansy Ass made another unique piece for another Omakase client. The 22K Gold Succulent Cockatoo planter is a take on the Cock Planter, but with a delightfully cheerful-looking cockatoo atop it. The beautifully made creature features gold talons and crest, making it an extra regal bird. CH Omakase is a collection of never seen before, pre-release and collaboratively designed gifts delivered in time for a holiday surprise. You can see our collection from this past season here.

Kirk Hamilton,"Look, starships are cool and everything. They’re great! They can fly, they have lasers, and they usually look nice. But if you’re playing No Man’s Sky, I have some advice for you: Don’t neglect your buggy. In No Man’s Sky, you can craft a buggy station (aka “Roamer Platform”) at any point with some metal plating, some ion batteries, and some paraffinium. It is very easy to just never do this, opting instead to either fly everywhere in your ship or gallivant around using the tried-and-true melee+jetpack super jump. Those are both perfectly useful and enjoyable ways of getting around, but you know what’s also fun? The buggy. Once you’ve got a buggy, you can move much more quickly across the surface of a planet. Got a nearby spot you want to explore? Did one of your base employees give you a quest that requires reaching a faraway place on the same planet? Instead of hopping in your starship, consider staying on land, instead. While the starship is the easiest and fastest way to make a quick hop around on your planet, I’ve found that using the starship to get everyone eventually gets kind of monotonous. I spend most of my time in the air, zooming toward a waypoint. I land, run into the building, do my thing, and take off. It gives the game a disjointed quality compared to when I stay on land. Furthermore, the buggy is just fun to drive. It controls like a Halo warthog by default, with acceleration tied to the left stick and steering to the right. That took some getting used to, but once I did, I was zooming along and having a fine old time, sort of like I was driving a really big RC car. The buggy can blast through most trees and rocks, which is a little silly but also satisfying. It can fire powerful projectiles at attacking enemies. And it can jump, which means that with a little practice, you can use every hill-crest or crater-lip as a launching point for stunt jumps. Ramping this little guy has yet to get old, and I don’t even have the boosters yet. More than all that, though, I appreciate how using the buggy forces me to slow down. No Man’s Sky has a lot of grind, and the faster and more efficiently I play, the more I remove the lower-key traversal and sightseeing that usually balances out all the material accumulation and ferrite dust mining. When I play in a maximally optimized way, it can quickly begin to feel like the game is all grind, which is pleasing in a certain sense but leaves behind a lot of No Man’s Sky ’s odd beauty and calming vibe in the process. So, this is my advice for you: In these hectic, busy times, you may feel the need to get everywhere as fast as you can. But the next time No Man’s Sky gives you somewhere to be, don’t fly. Drive.","Look, starships are cool and everything. They’re great! They can fly, they have lasers, and they usually look nice. But if you’re playing No Man’s Sky, I have some advice for you: Don’t neglect your buggy.

ABC News,"At least a dozen tornadoes touched down across the south-central U.S. over the weekend as a foot of rain was dumped on the region in the past week. That downpour has led to massive flooding from Louisiana to Michigan. The Ohio River may crest near Louisville today, as parts of Arkansas and Indiana are bracing for major flood damage. More severe storms are expected from Texas to Alabama on Tuesday. More rainfall and flooding is in store for much of the south-central U.S. Another storm is expected to develop on Wednesday and bring more severe weather to parts of Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi. The system may miss hard-hit Kentucky. Slow-moving storms will dump more rain all the way to Georgia, potentially aggravating already-swollen rivers throughout the region. This same storm system could keep moving east and create havoc later in the week for the Northeast. By late Thursday, another strong coastal storm may be forming in the Northeast. By late Thursday or early Friday, a coastal storm may develop in the Northeast, bringing with it snow, gusty winds, heavy rain and coastal flooding. Winter storm warnings are in effect for the Cascades, Sierra Nevadas, Northern Rockies and Southern California Mountains. More snow is expected in the major western mountain ranges this week including the Cascades and Sierra Nevadas, which may see 10-20 inches of fresh powder through Wednesday. Snow is expected through Tuesday night in much of the Pacific Northwest. Los Angeles and San Diego are expected to get heavy rain tonight, perhaps up to half an inch.

Ryan Gilliam,"If you played D estiny, you may be familiar with Xur, the weekly exotic item merchant. In Destiny 2, he’s back, and he can now appear all over the map. This week, he’s in the Tower, and there’s a helpful icon on the planet map to show you where he is. You can find Xur just north of the Hang a r, standing on some steps behind the Dead Orbit vendor. Bungie/Activision Xur’s inventory this week consists of the following: Suros Regime, Exotic auto rifle: 29 legendary shards Gemini Jester, Hunter: 23 legendary shards Crest of Alpha Lupi, Titan: 23 legendary shards Claws of Ahamkara, Warlock: 23 legendary shards Fated Engram: 97 legendary shards Three of Coins: 31 legendary shards Five of Swords: free Each of the items comes at a maximum power level of 345 — a base power of 340, plus a Legendary (purple) mod that raises the value by five. This scales to your character’s power level, so make sure you’re buying Xur exotics on your highest-level character. S uros Regime Suros Regime is a fan favorite Destiny auto rifle that returned to Destiny 2 in the Warmind expansion. Its first exotic perk is Suros Legacy, which causes the bottom half of each magazine to deal bonus damage and have a chance to return player health on kills. The second exotic perk is actually a choice between Spinning Up and Dual Speed Receiver. Spinning Up causes the firing speed of Suros Regime to rise the longer you hold the trigger. Dual Speed Receiver causes Suros Regime to deal more damage when aiming down sights but fire much slower. Suros Regime allows changing play style on the fly, depending on the type of enemy you’re dealing with. There’s a reason so many players loved this gun in Destiny. On top of some great perks, it feels genuinely great to fire at enemies. This is a must-have gun for all players. G emini Jester Gemini Jester is one of the new exotics added in Curse of Osiris. Its main exotic perk is Misdirection. If you dodge when near an enemy, you’ll disorient them, removing their radar if they’re a human player. This is a decent PvP exotic if you’re sick of running the classics. Just beware that you need to be close to be effective. C rest of Alpha Lupi The Crest of Alpha Lupi is an awesome Titan chest piece. Its exotic perk, Survival Well, causes supers to generate more orbs of light. Barricade will start health regeneration for nearby allies when deployed, too. This is great for some PvE content and extremely powerful in competitive PvP. Don’t miss this chest piece. C laws of Ahamkara The Claws of Ahamkara are new Warlock gauntlets added in Destiny 2 ’s Warmind expansion. Their exotic perk, The Whispers, grants any Warlock that wears these gloves an extra melee charge. Warlocks have some pretty powerful melee abilities, so these are great gloves if you love getting up close with your enemies. F ated Engram The Fated Engram is new as of Destiny 2 ’s mid-December 2017 update. Buying one may be expensive, but it guarantees you an exotic that you don’t have. If you find yourself drowning in legendary shards and missing a few key exotics, this is a pretty great way to spend your shards. You can only get one per account, once a week. T hree of Coins This old farming buff has returned from the Destiny graveyard to help you farm exotics. Also new as of Dec. 12, Three of Coins is a four-hour buff that increases the odds of exotic engrams dropping in the wild. Bungie clarified their effectiveness, and they don’t seem particularly worth the steep legendary shard cost at the moment. Five of Swords Xur is now selling an upgrade for your Nightfall challenge card. It allows you to increase your score multiplayer on the Prestige Nightfall, allowing you to get more points each time you run it.",Head to the Tower for some exotics,2018-05-18T17:33:21Z,"{'id': 'polygon', 'name': 'Polygon'}","Destiny 2 Xur location and items, May 18-21",https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2018/5/18/17369152/xur-location-items-may-18-21,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBLL-5itZUSZVwU_dfN80WEZSVY=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9253051/Xur_Destiny_2_.jpg,polygon,Polygon,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"info@hypebeast.com (HYPEBEAST), HYPEBEAST","Nike and UNDEFEATED recently received an onslaught of backslash for their collaborative “The Fives” collection logo, which bore striking similarities to the U.S. Naval Academy’s crest design. On Thursday, the USNA announced that it was sending a cease and desist to Nike and UNDEFEATED for trademark infringement. “The similarities of the Nike/UNDEFEATED logo released this week and the USNA Crest are undeniable and we believe their logo is clearly an infringement under trademark law,” the Navy wrote on Twitter.

Stef Schrader,"Just look at this incredible almost-jump. This UTV rider definitely had a landing, but I’m not sure it’s the landing he wanted. Clearly, this UTV rider wanted to hop over the crest of this steep hill, but didn’t quite make it. What’s surprising is that he landed four wheels down after failing to jump over the crest, treating it more like a giant quarter pipe for boarding than a big hill to jump. That landing was nailed! Yet he didn’t crash there. He waited until he was all the way to the bottom of the hill to roll over. I guess that had to happen eventually after somehow not crashing up top. Oops.

Matt Given,"If you love lists, December is a fun month to browse the internet. These lists usually take one of two forms: You're looking back on the previous year or eyeing the horizon for the year to come. Some of the lists in the rearview mirror are autopsies. Here's what went wrong or the biggest flame outs. The lists for the coming year are different. For most of us, the future holds nothing but hope. Next year will be our best year. Here's my list of the first six books you should read in 2018. I've read them all. You may have read a few, too--that's why I have a backup plan for each book. 1. Extreme Ownership--How US Navy SEALS Lead and Win By Jocko Willink and Leif Babin This book, written by two retired Navy SEALS, distills leadership and performance lessons learned in the SEAL Teams and tested on the gnarliest battlefields of Iraq. Written in a no-nonsense tone, Willink and Babin are careful to relate these harrowing SEAL experiences to real-world applications. If you're an entrepreneur, or just a human, the lessons on owning every part of your sphere are enough to pick this one up. And to all young leaders, remember this phrase, ""There are no bad teams, only bad leaders."" Face it, we could all use a little Navy SEAL in our 2018. If you've already read that, read this: The Way of the Warrior Kid : From Wimpy to Warrior the Navy SEAL Way By Jocko Willink This is the kid's version of Extreme Ownership. But don't let that fool you! It's a great read that's chock-full with lessons for individuals, leaders and parents. 2. The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge Into Action By Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton Don't let the academia resumes fool you. These two Stanford professors deliver both ideas and systems to break down performance barriers in individuals and companies. The book can be dense, but it's a worthy read to help you focus on getting the right things done in 2018. Have you been to or held a useless meeting lately? Pay very close attention to the chapter titled ""When Talk Substitutes for Action"". If you've already read that, read this: Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap, and Others Don't By Jim Collins Collins' soaring, well researched classic is a must read. Maybe a must re-read. 3. The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses By Eric Ries This is another must-read, especially if you're in startup mode. Ries' personal stories of failure leading to success are worth the price tag. There might not be a better product innovation framework than his Minimum Viable Product for us to learn. If you've already read that, read this: Rework By Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson Like The Lean Startup, this book was written by real operators. Fried and Hansson bring to light their stories from the trenches as the founders of 37 Signals in an easy-to-digest style. If you've been curious or confused on how or when to hire as a startup, be sure to read chapter nine, ""Hire when it hurts."" 4. Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail By Cheryl Strayed This one's a curveball. Strayed's memoir delivers a real perspective check as she weaves gut-wrenching stories from her youth with a tale of re-birth on her month's long, mostly solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. Some of her quips are quotable, bulletin board-worthy nuggets of inspiration. Many entrepreneurs reach points on the journey where the challenges seem too much to overcome. Walk this path with Strayed and you'll know what the human spirit is capable of. Read the book prior to checking out the movie. If you've already read that, read this: Touching the Void: The True Story of One Man's Miraculous Survival By Joe Simpson Just read this story. After you've finished, try and convince yourself that your challenges are tough. 5. Customer Success: How Innovative Companies Are Reducing Churn and Growing Recurring Revenue By Nick Mehta, Dan Steinman, Lincoln Murphy Even if you're not in a recurring-revenue business, the stories and approach to clients presented in this effort are worth exploring, distilling, and adopting. The core principle is this: Play a part in the success of your customers and they will be fans. That idea alone is worth the read. If you've already read that, read this: From Impossible to Inevitable: How Hyper-Growth Companies Create Predictable Revenue By Aaron Ross and Jason Lemkin Chapter after chapter, this business building blueprint delivers real systems and approaches for business builders to follow. 6. About Face: The Odyssey of an American Warrior By Colonel David Hackworth and Julie Sherman Simply one of the best, if not the best, books on leadership of all time. It's almost 900 pages, but you'll want more. I read this almost 15 years ago, and re-read it each year to remind myself: Despite all of the new ideas on business building and leadership, some principles never change. During his 25 year military career, Colonel Hackworth earned 111 medals. You can learn a lot from him.

Special Correspondent,"The crest gates of the Kabini reservoir in Mysuru district, which were opened late on Thursday, saw a surge in the outflow since the early hours of Friday. This is the first time in the recent years that the water level in the reservoir is hovering at 2,280 feet as early as second week of June. In north Karnataka too, with copious rain, for the first time in the recent years, the Tungabhadra reservoir at Hosapete has been getting good inflow, which is rare for June. This has raised the hopes of farmers in the Tungabhadra Command Area of early release of water for cultivation. At the Kabini reservoir, the outflow, which was at the rate of around 16,200 cusecs at 6 a.m. on Friday, was stepped up to around 36,000 cusecs by 10 a.m., thanks to increase in the volume of water flowing into the reservoir in view of copious rain in the catchment area of the river along the upstream. Though the authorities decided to regulate the outflow to match the inflow, which began to slightly recede around 12 noon, the 6 p.m. reading indicated that the rate of inflow was steady at around 35,000 cusecs. Assistant Executive Engineer of the reservoir Puttasheshagiri said the outflow would be regulated to match the rate of inflow so as to balance the reservoir level. It is likely that the outflow would be reduced by Saturday morning, depending on the inflow. The full reservoir level of the Kabini reservoir, located at Beechanahall in H.D. Kote taluk of Mysuru district, is 2,284 feet and the water level was hovering at around 2,280 feet on Friday. “This is as good as full because the water is never impounded so as to reach the FRL, especially when there is a possibility of rain,” he said. On Friday, the inflow into the Tungabhadra reservoir was at around 48,410 cusecs, taking the reservoir level to 1,592.57 feet as against the FRL of 1,633 feet. Presently the storage in the reservoir has gone up to 11.906 tmcft. Last year, on the same day (June 15), the reservoir level was at 1,568.85 feet, holding around 0.930 tmcft water, while the inflow was at 320 cusecs.",Outflow from the Kabini dam stepped up a day after crest gates were opened,2018-06-15T19:45:55Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}","Surge in inflow into Kabini, Tungabhadra reservoirs",http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/surge-in-inflow-into-kabini-tungabhadra-reservoirs/article24176466.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/h6146e/article24176472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGKABINI,the-hindu,The Hindu,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was beautiful – as beautiful as the clothespin, as inevitable as the wine bottle, as dignified and reassuring as the fire hydrant. A tranquil cylinder of delightfully resonant metal, it could be opened in an instant, requiring only the application of a handy gadget freely dispensed by every grocer. Who can forget the small, symmetrical thrill of those two triangular punctures, the dainty pfff, the little crest of suds that foamed eagerly in the exultation of release? Now we are given, instead, a top beetling with an ugly, shmoo-shaped tab, which, after fiercely resisting the tugging, bleeding fingers of the thirsty man, threatens his lips with a dangerous and hideous hole. However, we have discovered a way to thwart Progress, usually so unthwartable. Turn the beer can upside down and open the bottom. The bottom is still the way the top used to be.

Caroline Praderio,"People who use certain types of dental floss may be exposing themselves to a toxic chemical, according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of Exposure Science &amp; Environmental Epidemiology. 
 The study, led by the Silent Spring Institute and the Public Health Institute in Berkeley, California, tested the blood of 178 women to look for evidence of PFAS, a broad class of man-made chemicals used in industry and in consumer products like waterproof clothing and non-stick cookware. 
 Because they're used so widely used — and because most of them don't break down — PFAS are found in the blood of people across the world, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some scientific studies have linked exposure to these chemicals with health problems. 
 A few years after collecting the blood samples, the researchers then asked the women in the study how often they engaged in behaviors that may relate to PFAS exposure, including using non-stick cookware, eating certain packaged foods, buying stain-resistant carpets or furniture, and flossing with Oral-B Glide. 
Read more: Dangerous 'forever chemicals' have been found in US drinking water at alarmingly high rates — here's what to know about PFAS
 In the paper, the authors wrote that certain flosses including Oral-B Glide ""have been reported to be manufactured from PTFE,"" though INSIDER was not immediately able to verify the source of such reports. PTFE is a chemical that may be manufactured using PFAS, according to Katie Boronow, study author and senior staff scientist at the Silent Spring Insitute. 
 (In an email to INSIDER, a spokesperson for Procter &amp; Gamble said the company can ""confirm that none of the substances in the report are used in our dental floss."") 
 ""PFAS are used in a wide variety of products,"" Boronow told INSIDER. ""And aside from women who are exposed in their workplace or have contaminated drinking water, we don't really know what the most important sources of exposure are. This study was an effort to uncover and untangle some of these everyday sources of exposure."" 
 The authors found that having stain-resistant carpet or furniture and living in a city with a PFAS-contaminated water supply were associated with higher levels of some PFAS chemicals in the body. They also found that using Oral-B Glide floss was linked with higher levels of one PFAS called perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) in the body, compared to not using the floss. 
 The study tested different floss brands for a ""marker"" of PFAS chemicals 
The researchers tested several different brand of floss.

In the second part of the study, the researchers tested 18 floss products for the presence of fluorine, which Boronow said is a ""marker"" for PFAS chemicals. Some of these products were branded as Oral-B Glide while others had package labels that said ""compare to Oral-B Glide,"" according to the study. 
 In total, six products tested positive for fluorine. They were: CVS Health EaseBetween SuperSlip Dental Floss Waxed, Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Mint and Glide Pro-Health Original, Crest Glide Deep Clean Cool Mint Floss, Safeway Signature Care Mint Waxed Comfort Floss, and Colgate Total Dental Floss Mint. 
 Safeway and Colgate did not immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment. 
 In a statement to INSIDER, CVS Pharmacy said ""the CVS brand product that was part of the study was actually discontinued last year and is no longer available in our stores. The product undergoes rigorous safety and quality assurance testing annually and we stand by the safety of our products."" 
 Procter &amp; Gamble, maker of Crest and Oral-B floss, said in a statement to INSIDER that ""the safety of the people who use our products is our top priority. Our dental floss undergoes thorough safety testing and we stand behind the safety of all our products."" 
 In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Rita Loch-Caruso, a University of Michigan professor of environmental health who wasn't involved in the study, noted that dental products like floss may contain added fluoride, which also contains fluorine. 
 ""It would have been nice to see them discuss whether fluoride could have been contributing to the fluorine measurements on the floss,"" she told BuzzFeed News. (Boronow told BuzzFeed News that none of the products in the study were advertised as containing fluoride.) 
 There are other possible sources of PFAS 
Some drinking water may be contaminated with PFAS.

""This study interviewed people about their self-reported use of a wide array of consumer products and foods, it was not focused on dental floss alone,"" the Procter &amp; Gamble spokesperson added in an email to INSIDER. ""Additionally, in the supplemental table, the dental floss data alone showed no correlation to these substances. It was only when trying to combine consumer products that they saw any correlations at all."" 
 In response, Boronow said that, in the final paper, the authors used a statistical model that ""looked at the effect of floss taking into account the other behaviors that the women reported doing as well."" 
 The researchers also wrote this is the ""first evidence"" that using PTFE-based dental floss may contribute to higher PFAS levels in the body, and added that more studies are needed to verify their findings. 
 Harvard University environmental health professor Philippe Grandjean, who was not involved with the study, told BuzzFeed News that the study participants may also have been exposed to PFAS chemicals from other sources that weren't included in the research. 
 A handful of US communities have water sources that are contaminated with dangerously high levels of PFAS, for example, and people may also be exposed if they accidentally swallow contaminated dirt or dust or eat seafood caught in contaminated water. The chemicals can also show up cosmetics, firefighting foams, and some food packaging, like pizza boxes and microwave popcorn bags. 
 Boronow acknowledged this. 
 ""Certainly our study only looked at a subset of all possible sources [of PFAS exposure],"" she told INSIDER. 
 Concern over PFAS exposure stems from the fact that the chemicals can accumulate and stay in the body for long periods of time, and because buildup of PFAS in the human body has been linked to different health conditions, including low birth rates, high cholesterol, liver damage, chronic kidney disease, asthma, and colon ulcers. 
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) think PFAS may be cancer-causing, too, because higher-than-average exposures to the chemicals have been linked to higher rates of testicular and kidney cancers, Business Insider reported last year. But that link hasn't been demonstrated for sure.

Addressing presspersons after chairing the first meeting of the ICC at the office of Krishna Bhagya Jal Nigam Ltd. on Tuesday, Mr. Patil said the committee had unanimously decided to start releasing water into the canals from Tuesday. He also said this year, they were deviating from the annual practice of releasing water after July 24. “With Almatti dam receiving a large quantum of water every day, the committee has decided to release water into the canals for irrigation purposes,” Mr. Patil said. Farmers have been demanding that the government release water into the canals as their crops are withering away owing to deficient rainfall. Mr. Patil said water would be released first into canals for a few days, and later a call would be taken on limiting the days. He said that while it was a routine to release water after every 12 days, they were contemplating releasing water after every seven days into the canals, based on the availability of water in the reservoir. The Minister said 95,000 cusecs of water was being discharged through 18 of the 26 crest gates of the reservoir. Along with this, power production has also started. About the damage to canals, which is causing huge loss of water, the Minister said he has brought the matter to the notice of Water Resources Minister D.K. Shivakumar in order to get the canals repaired. To a question, he made it cle ar that all precautions would be taken to ensure Vijayapura city does not face any drinking water problem. “We will not make the mistake committed in the past when excess water was released from the dam for irrigation purposes, causing acute drinking water problem subsequently,” he said.","‘Water being discharged at the rate of 95,000 cusecs through 18 crest gates’",2018-07-18T02:50:34Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Irrigation panel nod for releasing water from Almatti into canals,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/irrigation-panel-nod-for-releasing-water-from-almatti-into-canals/article24448764.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pk7gaw/article24448763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGVIJAYAPURAALMATTI,the-hindu,The Hindu,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avi Creditor,"Nashville SC already had an MLS start date, a temporary stadium, plans for a permanent stadium and a pair of executives and player signings in place. Now it has the logo to go along with it all.
The 2020 MLS expansion team unveiled its branding on Wednesday, revealing a rather simple, eight-sided, gold crest that features navy blue musical waves forming the shape of an ""N"" above the words ""Nashville SC."" With Nashville being Music City, the nod certainly fits the city's brand.
The crest ultimately wasn't that much of a surprise, as it had been accidentally leaked by apparel supplier Lids a week earlier and teased quite revealingly by the club in the days leading up to the official unveiling.
Nashville SC club is slated to begin play in MLS next year, with the Tennessee Titans' Nissan Stadium serving as its home while the more permanent soccer-specific stadium at the Fairgrounds site it secured is built. The new stadium is expected to be ready in time for the 2021 campaign.
The club, run by CEO Ian Ayre and general manager Mike Jacobs, has two players on the books for its inaugural MLS season, with forwards Daniel Rios and Cameron Lancaster signed to MLS deals. They'll play for the club's USL Championship franchise this year.
Nashville will join the league along with Inter Miami CF next season, with Austin FC joining in 2021. Another to-be-named franchise is also due to be unveiled by MLS, which has stated that it will explore growing beyond 28 teams in the future.",Nashville SC reveals its look ahead of its entry into MLS.,2019-02-20T23:33:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Si.com'}","MLS Expansion Team Nashville SC Unveils Logo, Crest, Branding",https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/02/20/nashville-sc-logo-crest-colors-mls-expansion,https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2019/02/20/nashville-sc-logo.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85,,Si.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Matthew Dessem, Matthew Dessem","We’ve all gone on online shopping sprees that we regretted the next morning, but only members of the media have the privilege of reclassifying them as “investigative journalism.” That’s just what Jimmy Kimmel did on Wednesday night, walking the audience through the contents of a giant box of overpriced garbage he purchased from TrumpStore.com, “the official retail website of The Trump Organization.” Did you know there was an entire website where you could buy Trump Organization-themed stuff? If you’re, just, like, a fan of the Trump Organization and want other people to know that fact about you? Kimmel was ostensibly investigating where the Trump Organization has its retail products made—if you guessed “not in the United States, despite a certain president’s big talk,” you win a shitty plastic coin bank—but his big box of stuff has all the hallmarks of a late-night mistake, and his account of the purchase doesn’t exactly sound like Woodward &amp; Bernstein: Even though my wife was yelling at me the whole time I was on the site, like, “Don’t order anything from that!” I ordered a bunch of stuff from it. Kimmel’s wife, Molly McNearey, is one of Jimmy Kimmel Live! ’s head writers, so it’s possible this was a work conversation, but a quick look at TrumpStore.com makes a late-night shopping spree seem more likely. The Trump Organization has created a delightful website, like old-timey-snake-oil–salesman delightful, exactly the kind of internet rabbit hole that leads to buyer’s remorse the next day. It’s aimed at people with more money than taste—but not quite enough more money to know they’re overpaying for things that are actively distasteful. Given that the website’s non-Jimmy-Kimmel clientele put Donald Trump in office, the schadenfreude from imagining them getting cheated in an ill-advised attempt to buy class on a budget is one of the few pleasures remaining. TrumpStore.com’s pitch shows a level of contempt for the intelligence of its customers that would be appalling if its customers weren’t people who voluntarily decided to shop at TrumpStore.com, which they are. It’s a rich tapestry. But how much money did Kimmel have to funnel to the Trump Organization to fund his reporting? To find out, we identified each item in Kimmel’s big box, found it on the TrumpStore.com website, and paired it with the single most unconvincing, soul-deadening sentence from the marketing copy for that item. (Except for the “Classic Natural Trump Mug,” where three sentences tied for first place.) Here’s the complete rundown: 1 Poly Waffle Cap, Frost White/Black: $32.00 (Made in China) Contrast stitching lends a contemporary look to our Ahead brand poly waffle cap while the Trump Crest logo, coupled with the subtle waffle pattern, adds to the sophisticated appeal. 1 “ Classic Natural Trump Mug,” $15.00 (Made in Thailand) Subtle elegance is the perfect way to describe our Trump classic natural colored mug. The gold Trump name adorns the side hinting that you enjoy the finer things in life. This beautiful ceramic is sure to maintain its elegance for years to come. 1 “ Trump Golf Solitaire Driver Headcover,” $40.00 (Made in China, Decorated in the U.S.A.) Our expertly crafted driver headcovers are a luxury you cannot deny yourself … nor will you want to. 1 “ Signature Small Duffle Bag,” $100.00 (Made in China) Versatility and convenience are what our small duffle is all about. 1 “ Signature Shoe Bag,” $50.00 (Made in China) A zippered side pocket adds to its functionality while the Trump crest gives it a stylish flair. 1 “ Lattice Embossed Blanket ” in Taupe Velvet, Twin size $50.00 (Made in China) You’ll fall in love with our luxurious velvet blanket featuring a lattice embossed pattern. 1 “ Quilted Toddler Bib ” in Soft White, $25.00 (Made in Peru) Toddlers can often make messes and that’s where our toddler bibs come in handy. 1 “ Trump Golf Collector Medallion,” $15.00 (Made in China) This is a special collector’s item you won’t want to pass up. 1 “ Gold Bar Coin Bank,” FREE WITH PURCHASE! (Made in ????) Our Trump coin bank is modeled after a real gold bullion and is not only a collector’s item, but will store your spare change perfect for a rainy day. 1 “ Pet Bandana ” in Fuschia, $8.00 (Made in ????) Man’s best friend will look his best while sporting one of our Trump pet bandanas. That’s a grand total of $220 worth of Trump Organization merchandise, none of which was made entirely in the United States, some of which may have violated import laws, and every bit of which is so cruddy you’d be disappointed to get it for free at a trade show. This is the retail experience Trump Organization fans deserve, and it’s reassuring to know someone is providing it to them. It’s just a shame these particular fools can’t be parted from their money without it benefiting the Trump family.","We’ve all gone on online shopping sprees that we regretted the next morning, but only members of the media have the privilege of reclassifying them as “investigative journalism.” That’s just what Jimmy Kimmel did on Wednesday night, walking the audience throu…",2018-03-15T06:24:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Jimmy Kimmel Bought a Bunch of Garbage From TrumpStore.com So You Never Have To,https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/jimmy-kimmel-bought-a-bunch-of-garbage-from-trumpstore-com-so-you-never-have-to.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/1f7ddf69-c6de-42bf-97d2-79dc63411ace.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,crest,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gina Martinez,"A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas. The Cape Fear River in Fayetteville was at 60.1 feet and still rising as of noon Tuesday. It’s projected to crest at 61.6 feet, which is far from the 1945 record of 68.9 feet, but higher than the 58.9 feet it reached after Hurricane Matthew, according to the National Weather Service. The Cape Fear River expected to spread to a width of up to 2 miles, with several thousand homes and business threatened. As the city of Fayetteville begins to flood, up to 150 homes will be threatened, according to the National Weather Service. The flood waters aren’t expected to recede to normal levels until late Friday – one week after the hurricane made landfall. The Cape Fear River is just one of several major rivers that are spilling over their banks after Hurricane Florence brought massive storm surge and record rainfall to North and South Carolina. More than 25 inches of rain fell on inland parts of North and South Carolina – deluging streams and rivers with vast amounts of water. Lumber River in Lumberton is also at a Major Flood Stage with 21.9 feet of water, breaking the previous record of 21.8 feet, the National Weather Service said. The floodwaters are inching closer to the local Pepsi plant and dozens of homes will be isolated and inundated. Several roads will be closed near the river. Flooding is expected to continue there for the next few days. As of Tuesday, the death toll from Florence was at 32 and rising, with 24 of those deaths taking place in North Carolina, according to the Associated Press. The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical depression, but warned that catastrophic flash fooding, river flooding and landslides are still expected in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. On Sunday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned residents at a press conference to steer clear of flooded areas in the upcoming days. “Never drive through flooded roads. Just a few inches of water can wash your car away,” Cooper said. Last week Mike Doll, Senior Meteorologist at Accuweather, warned that residents near the Cape Fear River and other low-lying areas next to streams, creeks and rivers, should prepare for river flooding. “Once the last drops of rain [have] occurred doesn’t mean problems are over,” he said. “People that live in flood-prone areas near creeks and rivers need to be prepared. Even after the rain has ended, residents should still pay attention.”",A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas.

Michael Biesecker / AP,"Duke Energy said Friday that a dam containing a large lake at Wilmington power plant has been breached by floodwaters from Florence, and it’s possible coal ash from an adjacent dump is flowing into the Cape Fear River. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said Friday that floodwaters continue to overtop an earthen dike at the north side of Sutton Lake, a 1,100-acre (445-hectare) reservoir at the L.V. Sutton Power Station. That water has caused several breaches in the dam on the south end of the lake, which is flowing back into the river. The company said that because of the high water levels in the river from the hurricane, they do not expect water levels to be affected by the breaches in the dam. Sheehan said floodwaters also had overtopped a steel retaining wall containing one of three large coal ash dumps lining the lakeshore. Sheehan described the incident as a “developing situation” and said the company can’t rule out that ash might be escaping and flowing into the river. Gray material that the company characterized as lightweight coal combustion byproducts could be seen Friday floating on the top of the lake. The ash left over when coal is burned to generate electricity coal ash contains an array of components, including mercury, lead, arsenic and other toxic heavy metals. The inundated basin contains at the plant 400,000 cubic yards of ash. The current incident is separate from the rupture at a nearby coal ash landfill reported at the site last weekend, spilling enough material to fill 180 dump trucks. The site received more than 30 inches (75 centimeters) of rain from former Hurricane Florence, with the Cape Fear River expected to crest Saturday. Duke’s ash waste management has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants.

elskes,"Berlin-based M-Appeal has closed a flurry of deals across its slate, including Ash Mayfair’s “The Third Wife” and Michal Aviad’s “Working Woman” which were launched at Toronto. 
“The Third Wife” (pictured) sold to Potential Films for Autralia/New Zealand, and Crest International Inc. for Japan. Potential Films is planning a theatrical release next summer, while Crest Internatonal plans a roll out next fall. 
The movie, which had its world premiere in Toronto’s Discovery section, is set in 19th century rural Vietnam, and follows 14-year-old May who becomes the third wife of wealthy landowner Hung. May soon learns that she can only gain status by asserting herself as a woman who can give birth to a male child. 
M-Appeal previously sold “The Third Wife” to North America, the U.K., Ireland, Taiwan, Singapore, Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong and Spain. 
“I was truly impressed by the beauty of the picture, by its authenticity and, above all, the drama of women,” saidEmiko Watanabe, managing director of Crest International Inc. 
“While the circumstances of women in 19th century Vietnam are quite sad, at the same time those women are so enchanting. I think that the theme is of relevance even for the present time as women are still struggling to achieve their own dignity,” Watanabe pointed out.
“Working Woman,” meanwhile, sold to Potential Films for Australia/New Zealand, and RTV Slovenija/Igor Palcic for Slovenia. Potential Films is planning a release in the summer; RTV Slovenija/Igor Palcic are planning a broadcast premiere in September 2019. Following its world premiere in Toronto’s Contemporary World Cinema section, “Working Woman” sold to North America, France, Benelux and Poland.
“Working Woman” centers on a mother of three who is being sexually harassed by her boss at work and is forced to cope with it as her husband struggles to keep his new restaurant afloat. 
Another highlight on M-Appeal’s slate, Albertina Carri’s “The Daughters of Fire,” sold to Gitano Films, a branch of Centro Arte Alameda, for distribution in Chile; and Vitrine Filmes for Brazil. 
“The Daughters of Fire” had its world premiere at San Sebastian and previously sold to Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia. The film revolves around three women who embark on a life-changing polyamorous journey.
“(‘The Daughters of Fire’) is a daring and beautiful film by award-winning director Albertina Carri. Distributing this work of feminist pornography is urgent and essential,” said Silvia Cruz, managing director at Vitrine Filmes. 
Rosen Fort, managing director at Gitano Films, said the film was “intense, poetic, pornographic and a militant work.”
M-Appeal also sold Fanny Metelius’s critically acclaimed debut “The Heart” to Indeed Film for distribution in Germany, Austria and Switerland. The movie world premiered at Rotterdam and established Metelius, who is already a rising Swedish actress as a promising filmmaker. Metelius stars in the coming-of-age film which chronicles the rise and fall of a love relationship. 
M-Appeal has added two titles to its slate: Filipe Matzembacher and Marcio Reolon’s Brazilian drama film “Hard Paint” which has already sold to Mexico (Machete) and Spain (Damita Joe); and Guto Parente’s Brazilian horror film “The Cannibal Club,” which has sold to South Korea (Cinema Newone), HBO Europe, Germany, Austria, Japan, North America, Scandinavia, U.K. Ireland and Australia. 
“Hard Paint” world premiered in Berlin’s Panorama section and won the Teddy Award.

The proposed design, which is 'subject to member approval', is to the untrained eye largely the same as the current incarnation. However, look carefully and you may notice the removal of the letters 'FCB' while the number of blaugrana stripes has been reduced from seven to five. A statement on Barça's official website reads: ""FC Barcelona is changing its crest in order to adapt to modern times. Since the design was last updated in 2002, the context, society and technology have changed enormously, and the symbols identified with the club need to evolve too."" The statement also promises to stay ""faithful to the historical elements of the crest"", while citing the new design's ""greater reproduction capacity...in the increasingly more important world of digital media."" The new crest has been approved by the club board, but will be submitted for the approval of club members on October 20. Barring rejection, the new badge will be seen on club wear and products for the 2019/20 season.

Mark Frauenfelder,"I haven't read newspaper comics in years, and I was surprised that Nancy is still around. Yesterday's strip was about computational propaganda. I like the image of Sluggo as a bot and would like it in a T-shirt. The 123 comments on this particular strip are lively. Here are a couple of examples: I don’t see this as being anything close to what Bushmiller – or Gilchrist – would have written, or anything close to funny. I think the new artist/writer is terrible at both. And Nancy and Sluggo continue to have the yellowish green skin that makes them appear to have a severe case of jaundice. The syndicate made a bad choice for the new artist/writer and will have to rectify that soon or this comic strip will go down the tubes. -- Oldiesfan @Oldiesfan: Read the “Nancy Classics” archives and do some intensive Google/Google Image searches for some of the old Bushmiller strips; then make your decision. I remember the Bushmiller era very well and even have some of his “Nancy” comic strips in the digest book form that was available back in the 1960’s and 1970’s (I think from Fawcett-Crest or Dell or one of those outfits), much like the “Peanuts” strips were. I can attest by comparison that today’s strip jives pretty well with what Bushmiller often did, with the employment of visual gags like the one in the last panel. Quite often Nancy would get into a disagreement or fight with Sluggo and imagine him in some unflattering form or other as a consequence. It’s entirely possible that Olivia may have taken a few premises from some old strips and put her spin on them (even if just to throw some of us old-timers a bone), in addition to inventing new gags of her own. -- Kaiserfrazer67 The next afternoon the phone rang. “Hello?” came the unmistakable voice. “This is Jerry Lewis and I would be honored to write a foreword for your book.” Only hours before; with zero expectations, we had dropped our (then-slender) draft into a Fed-Ex envelope with a brief query.

Staff Reporter,"After eight crest gates of Srisailam reservoir were lifted on Saturday morning, water level in Nagarjunasagar is gradually reaching the 590-ft indicator. At 3 p.m. on Monday, after a brief lull in rain, water level touched 545 ft. - a rise of 12 ft in about 40 hours. The inflows were recorded at 2,08,328 cusecs, filling a capacity of 198 tmc., as against its full capacity of 312 tmc. Meanwhile, to maximise the benefit to farmers in the ayacut, Nalgonda MP and Rythu Samanvaya Samithi chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy said water will be released through the left bank starting -- August 22. ‘On and off’ method would be followed to ensure judicious use of water, Mr. Reddy told farmers here, addressing an awareness session on water release for the ongoing season. Water will be released in phases – the first release for 20 days and the subsequent ones separated by one week each, would be a better idea, Mr. Reddy said Requesting farmers not to waste the resource, he said that tanks in the low-level AMRP canal area would also be filled. District Collector Gaurav Uppal, Rajya Sabha MP B. Lingaiah Yadav and Miryalaguda MLA N.

Gael Cooper,"Ah, Costco. Need a $9,000, seven-person hot tub ? They've got it. How about a 38-ounce jar of cashews for $43 ? Got that too. Five tubes of Crest toothpaste for $16 ? Cat litter in a 42-pound box for $26 ? A $4,800 outdoor kitchen ? Check, check, check. But forget the bulk shopping, forget the industrial-size pickle jars. Costco's real draw comes after a customer checks out, when the siren call of the Costco food court (that's what the company calls it, but it's really just a snack bar) beckons. One combo meal in particular stands out: The combination of a jumbo hot dog and 20-ounce fountain drink for just $1.50. You can't even get a greeting card for that, and in some places, you can't even get a bottle of water. According to a Costco spokesperson, that $1.50 price has stayed the same since 1985, when the deal moved into the stores after beginning as a hot-dog cart in front of the San Diego location. Yep, 1985, the year of ""Back to the Future,"" ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,"" and New Coke. And the deal is even better now, because both the soda and hot dog used to be smaller. More than 84 million combos were sold in 2017. And best of all: The company says it has no plans to change the price. Fellow retailers, take note: Costco discovered not just a great deal that customers value but also an experience they love. The food court holds a special place in Costco customers' hearts. Shoppers who were quoted in the Costco Connection magazine recalled surprise parties, budget dates, and meeting new friends there, all while dining on the bargain eats. And there's no question that the cheap but filling combo, with its can't-top-this price emblazoned in huge print atop the sales counter, works as an incentive to shoppers. For a warehouse store that requires customers to pay an annual fee, it's a memorable way to give shoppers positive memories when it comes time to renew that membership. The checkout lines may be long, the aisles sometimes tightly packed, but there's a generous and tasty meal beckoning from just beyond the registers. And once you're served, there's plenty of time to sit down with family and friends and, uh, ketchup.","Costco customers may join up for the industrial-size packs of beef jerky and batteries, but we relish the chance to be frank about why they stay.",2018-04-11T18:08:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Costco's Most Genius Product?

Meredith Cash,"Every year, more than 80,000 athletes vie for approcimately 2,500 spots at the IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua Kona, Hawaii. Known as the ""world's most difficult one-day sporting event,"" participants swim 2.4 miles, bike 112-miles, and run a marathon — or 26.22 miles — in that order with no breaks. Completing the race is an impressive feat in and of itself. But completing the race with stage IV lung cancer? Astounding. Isabella de la Houssaye — a 54-year-old Lawrenceville, New Jersey, native — crossed the finish line ahead of 147 other athletes at the IRONMAN World Championship October 13, just nine months after receiving her initial cancer diagnosis. ""At that point, it was stage IV lung cancer,"" she told PEOPLE. ""I had a good size tumor, 7 centimeters, in my lungs. My entire sacrum was cancer. I had six tumors in my brain, I had them in my sternum, I had them in my pelvis. It was a huge wake-up call."" de la Houssaye began treatment in February and reached a point where she could not walk. She slowly built up the strength to walk using canes. Soon enough, she was walking without any aid, and shortly after that was running up to 26 miles each day. ""Every day I got stronger and stronger,"" she said. ""It continues to amaze me how the body responds to the load you put on it."" de la Houssaye comes from a family of remarkable achievers. Her eldest son, Cason Crane, became the first openly gay mountaineer to scale the Seven Summits at 21 years old. At 19 years old, another of her sons, Oliver, became the youngest person to row across the Atlantic Ocean alone. During their gap years before college, daughter Bella hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and son David biked the length of Africa. All four children completed these feats to raise money for charity. de la Houssaye hoped that she would be able to wait for her youngest son to turn 18 so the whole family could compete at the IRONMAN World Championship together, but fate had other ideas. As the race approached, de la Houssaye got nervous about disappointing those supporting her. She wasn't sure she'd be able to finish but promised, ""I'm going to give it everything I have. That's the only thing I can do."" Despite a fall midway through the event, she managed to do both. de la Houssaye finished the race in 14:56:56 and came in 65th place in her age group. And though her cancer still qualifies as stage IV, she has made a lot of progress in her treatment as well. ""Part of what I'm hearing from my doctors is that because I came in so strong and healthy, and that I continued to be, it helped my treatment,"" she said. ""Much like running, I know that if I put one foot in front of the other I'll keep going, and that's the same with my treatment.""","Known as the "" world’s most difficult one-day sporting event,"" the IRONMAN World Championship involves a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bicycle ride, and a marathon run, in that order, with no breaks.

Kenya Foy,"(Image credit: Warner Bros) Looking for some wizard-related wonderfulness? If there was any justifiable reason to withdraw a handful of Galleons and spend it without hesitation, it's the chance to spend a few nights in this Harry Potter rental. Potterheads are probably already packing their robes and inviting their closest muggle pals to BYOB (Bring Your Own Butterbeer) and join them at what sounds like the most enchanting rental ever. Based on the description of Edinburgh, Scotland's Canongate luxury apartment, we totally get it (and please consider this as our official RSVP). The Potter-themed pad was created by Yue Gao, a Harry Potter fan whose design skills and imagination produced several standout features that perfectly pay homage to Rowling's wizard world. For instance, each door in the apartment bears the colors of a particular Hogwarts house as well as its corresponding crest. A blink-and-you'll-miss-it style entry door takes its design cues from the brick wall-turned portal that leads to Platform 9 ¾. The master bedroom is modeled after a Gryffindor dormitory, complete with a four-poster bed and floating candles. There's also a smaller bedroom that resembles a carriage on the Hogwarts Express, which is probably the next best thing to taking a trip on the magical train IRL (which should totally be on your travel bucket list, btw). Trinkets and furniture once owned by Rowling are scattered throughout the house, including a mirror framed by the famous scribe's old hand railings as well as an antique desk. In case that's not incentive enough to book the apartment ASAP, guests also have access to a full kitchen, WiFi, video games and digital TVs. The magical abode is available for rent year round for $206 a night. h/t Teen Vogue","Looking for some wizard-related wonderfulness?

Colin Dwyer,"As many as 145 pilot whales lie beached Sunday at Mason Bay, on Stewart Island, New Zealand. A hiker discovered the mass stranding on Saturday. New Zealand Department of Conservation via AP Over the weekend a hiker was tramping across Stewart Island, a remote locale in New Zealand's far southern regions, when the crest of a hill brought an unsettling vista into view: scores of dead pilot whales washed ashore on the beach. As many as 145 of the marine mammals which, contrary to their name, are technically classified as dolphins were found stranded Saturday along Mason Bay, two pods strewn across the sands just over a mile apart. New Zealand's Department of Conservation, which was notified Saturday night, said half of them had already died by the time they were discovered. The rest were in such a dire condition, and so difficult for experts to reach on short notice, that the department decided even the survivors needed to be euthanized. ""Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low. The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales' deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise,"" the department's operations manager on the island, Ren Leppens, said in a statement released Monday. ""However,"" he added, ""it's always a heart-breaking decision to make."" The sheer number of pilot whales made for a startling sight on an island of just 378 people. In video footage shot from an aircraft, the dead rest motionless in thick clusters, many half-buried in sand by the movements of the tide. Alarming as this incident may be, such strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand. The Department of Conservation reported at least four other incidents across the country last weekend alone, none of which appear to be related. Officials have not yet given up hope on one of those incidents, a stranding on Sunday that left 10 pygmy killer whales washed ashore near New Zealand's northernmost tip. Two of them have died, but authorities have called on volunteers to help them save the rest by re-floating them out to sea Tuesday. Across a period of several days last year, more than 650 pilot whales beached themselves on a thin strip of land projecting off New Zealand's South Island. Those strandings some of the country's largest ever on record reached a bittersweet ending, with roughly a third of the whales escaping to safety with the aid of volunteers. It remains unclear why, exactly, such mass strandings occur. ""Factors can include sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather,"" the New Zealand Department of Conservation explained. ""More than one factor may contribute to a stranding.""","A hiker found the mass stranding Saturday.

Rebecca Hersher,"A satellite image from Wednesday morning shows a powerful storm system heading east across the U.S. The storm is expected to bring high winds, snow and rain to much of the central U.S. in the coming days.
GOES-East/NOAA
When a storm gets very intense very quickly, it gets a very special, very scary name: bomb cyclone.
And just such a storm has arrived in the central U.S.
The powerful system is already bringing high winds, rain and snow to an enormous chunk of the country, including the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region. The National Weather Service has issued high wind and winter storm advisories for an area ranging from Colorado and New Mexico over to Nebraska and parts of Texas, and up to South Dakota.
""This will be one of the strongest wind events in years for West Texas and Southeast New Mexico,"" warned the National Weather Service office in Midland, Texas, with gusts up to 75 miles per hour on Wednesday.
Winds that powerful can make it impossible to drive safely, especially in tall vehicles such as trucks.
The storm could also cause flooding, as rain falls on accumulated snow and rivers clogged with ice begin to rise. Unlike wind, flood risk can last days or even weeks as rivers crest.
On Wednesday morning, some roads were already flooded in the northeastern part of Nebraska, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning, saying more rain is expected later in the day.
In the Denver area, blowing snow could cause dangerous blizzard conditions. On Twitter, the weather service warned residents to ""cancel any travel plans Wednesday afternoon and evening."" Colorado Public Radio reports that the storm could be the most intense storm ever recorded in the area, with the barometric pressure dropping a walloping 23 millibars in just one day.
Barometric pressure is the pressure of the air in the atmosphere, and it changes when the weather changes. A drop in the barometric pressure generally accompanies ""bad weather"": wind, thunder, snow and rain.
When the barometric pressure drops a lot over a short period of time, the bad weather is especially severe. As NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee reported during one of last year's bomb cyclones, this can happen when masses of cold and warm air collide:
""That's where the word 'bomb' comes in, says Jeff Weber, a climatologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 'We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone.' The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic midlatitude cyclone.""
A bomb cyclone on the East Coast around this time last year killed multiple people, shut down train and plane service and knocked out power to about 2 million people.
Scientists are still studying how bomb cyclones in recent years are, or aren't, affected by the larger trend of global climate change. The increasingly wide undulations of the jet stream the wind highway that blows from west to east around the Northern Hemisphere has allowed for more extreme temperature fluctuations in the continental U.S. And sea surface temperatures, which have been steadily rising, also affect the intensity of storms.
But, says climate scientist Jonathan Martin of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ""There isn't a direct link between the slowly changing climate and this event."" 
Although this storm is ""rather unusually intense,"" he notes, ""these things come around every few years.""","The storm is bringing high winds, snow, rain and dangerous road conditions. Meteorologists and local officials are warning people across the West and Midwest to cancel travel plans.",2019-03-13T16:28:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",A 'Bomb Cyclone' Is Thwacking The Central U.S.,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/702946797/a-bomb-cyclone-is-thwacking-the-central-u-s,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/13/20190721332_goes16-abi-conus-geocolor-1250x750_wide-303e63d7e0bb4920aefc4c5c0c6d443b4648eadb.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,crest,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
