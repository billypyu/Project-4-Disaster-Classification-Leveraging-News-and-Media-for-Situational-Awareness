Michael Hardy,"After years of playing with fire, Kevin Cooley finally got burned. Inspired by the smoke signals used at the Vatican to signal the election of a new pope, the multimedia artist began setting controlled fires in and around his studio and photographing their multicolored plumes of smoke. In a way, it was the logical next step for an artist whose previous projects have examined earth, water, and wind, the other three classical elements.
But in 2017, Cooleys personal and professional lives unexpectedly intersected when the La Tuna fire nearly destroyed his Los Angeles home, which sits on a two-acre lot in the Tujunga neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley, between the Verdugo and San Gabriel Mountains. The fire broke out on September 1, and quickly began racing through the hills of the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank.
Cooley happened to be helping his son assemble an emergency preparedness kit for a school assignment when he first noticed smoke rising from behind a nearby hill. ""It was hard to tell how far away it was, because there was just this giant smoke column,"" he recalls. He and his family had just moved into the house after a six-month renovation; now they had to pack their most valuable belongings in a car in case they needed to evacuate. (At the top of Cooley's list: hard drives containing his digital photographs, and some old negatives.)
The night passed uneventfully, Cooley and his wife sleeping in shifts, but in the morning the fire crested a nearby hill, with only an empty expanse of dry chaparral between it and them. After helping his family evacuate, Cooley returned with his camera to document the possible immolation of his home. ""The only way I could process the fire was to photograph it,"" he says. ""I took a lot of the photographs from my driveway, essentially.""
The hard work of local firefighters saved the house, and Cooley continued photographing the aftermath of the fire, which eventually consumed over 7,000 acres, becoming one of the largest in Los Angeles history. Over the following weeks, Cooley was amazed to see the charred landscape showing early signs of recovery. ""The chaparral ecosystem only regenerates through fire,"" he says. ""It was amazing how fast it came back.""
After the close call with destruction, Cooley briefly considered leaving LA. ""But where do you go that's safe from natural disasters?"" he says. ""New York has flooding from hurricanes, the Midwest has tornadoes, anywhere in California has earthquakes. I really don't know where safe is."" Besides, he points out, unloading his house might prove a challenge for the immediate future.
""There's a charred landscape right behind methat's not exactly a great selling point.""

Devin Coldewey,"Boeing has reportedly been struck in a major way by Wannacry, the ransomware that spread like wildfire last year. The Seattle Times obtained a memo from Mike VanderWel, of the company’s commercial airliner division, describing the malware as “metastasizing rapidly.” Wannacry, you may remember, spread using a Windows exploit leaked from NSA files, demanded a modest sum in bitcoin to decrypt the victim’s files, and was stopped in dramatic fashion by a single person. Investigators confidently but, as with most attacks like this, circumstantially attributed the attacks to North Korea. VanderWel’s memo says that the infection appears to have started in North Charleston, and for all we know is still spreading: “I just heard 777 (automated spar assembly tools) may have gone down,” he writes, and “airplane software,” whatever that term really means inside a company that makes airplanes, could be next. Although the attacks may have originated in North Korea and Boeing is of course a major defense contractor, it would be premature to connect those dots at this moment. Wannacry was far from a targeted strike; it was “indiscriminately reckless,” as one U.S. official rather redundantly put it, spreading geometrically and affecting soft targets like hospitals as well as individuals. Wannacry’s initial flare-up may have been tamped down with the “kill switch” and subsequent patches addressing the exploit, but clearly it was not eliminated altogether — though this may very well be a mutation or modified version of the original software. This story is developing. We’ve contacted Boeing for more information and have been told to expect it momentarily, so check back soon.","Boeing has reportedly been struck in a major way by Wannacry, the ransomware that spread like wildfire last year.

Sarah Scoles,"I first heard about Colorado’s Spring Fire on July 1, when I was driving back from a camping trip. My mom texted me from her home in Florida: “How close are these fires?” I pulled over to a rest stop, called up the federal disaster website Inciweb, and sent her back a screenshot of the wildfire’s perimeter. It seemed far away from my house on the Huerfano County line, like it would have to cross impossible acres to even come close. “Looks like we’re good,” I wrote back. The Spring Fire is the third largest in the state’s history. By the time I learned about it, the fire had already burned through more than 40,000 acres. A plume of smoke unfurled into a constantly replenished mushroom cloud. It was 0 percent “contained,” meaning that no human-made or natural barrier was stopping the fire’s edge from expanding. Costilla and Huerfano counties had evacuated around 2,000 households by July 2. The fire had, by then, grown to more than 56,000 acres, just 5 percent contained. I arrived at my cabin on the 3rd, hose in hand, knowing I couldn’t really help the house but not knowing what else to do. The Spring Fire had bloomed to nearly 80,000 acres. The Department of Transportation closed the highway right at the turnoff to my place. Big-bellied planes full of retardant crossed the sky overhead, their flight path traversing part of the bullishly-named Wet Valley. That night, the sunset, reflecting off the smoke particles, was spectacular. The mountains all looked like they were on fire—even the ones that weren’t. Forty miles south, from their base in the Huerfano county seat of Walsenburg, a group called Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team had taken charge of taming and containing the northern section of the blaze; another team, Rocky Mountain Area Incident Management Team Black, was assigned to deal with the southern portion. To direct the emergency response personnel—nearly 1,800 people worked the fire at its peak—the group needed a lot of data, a tightly wound plan, and a weirdly Office Space organizational structure. Fire behavior analyst Shelly Crook, Blue Team, is key to that endeavor. She’s in charge of figuring out what the northern portion of the fire is doing and what it will do. Every morning during the Spring Fire, she has woken up in the bed she keeps in the back of her car. By 5 am, she shows up at the ad hoc incident command post—at John Mall High School—to see if an infrared plane went out overnight. “I take stock of that data, and see where the fire moved from the previous perimeter, to see how much it has grown,” she says. This is Crook’s fourth fire this year, and when we spoke, it was her 60th day in the field (she is “retired”). “When a fire starts, you kind of drop everything,” she says. And so did the other Western-based members of her team, who converged quickly on the Spring Fire after the call went out from the Geographic Area Coordination Center, which helps mobilize emergency resources. At their temporary command post in Walsenburg, they have all the divisions a business might, including finance types, HR reps, and PortaPotty procurers. Every day, a planning team writes out a 30-page packet of information about everything a firefighter might need, from which frequencies to use for communications to what the weather will be like. For that latter part, there’s a dedicated meteorologist. He sits next to Crook as part of a unit that prints more than 150 maps every day—county roads and structures, topography from the US Geological Survey, GPS locations from the ground. After Crook checks on the infrared flight, she gets information from her officemate about the relative humidity recovery—she’s hoping that it increased significantly overnight. “If it’s good, the fire is not going to be active as early,” she says. They dig into data from weather stations—permanent ones and seven RAWS, remote automated weather systems, specially installed at critical Spring Fire locations—informing a forecast Crook will present during morning meetings. That’s just the beginning of Crook’s day, which she dedicates to predicting—as best she can—the north fire’s next moves. That kind of information eventually makes its way to the community—via in-person meetings and daily one-sheets. The public document released on the Fourth of July waffled in its optimism. “Overnight, calmer winds and lighter fuels slowed fire growth along the south and east flanks of the North Spring Fire,” it said. “Fire activity increased along the northwest flank near Sheep Mountain as it moved into dry, mixed timber.” By the afternoon, data from an infrared flight revealed the fire’s total extent to be 95,739 acres. The preevacuation zone, shown on a Google map, now stretched to two miles from my house. To the south, the view from the porch had morphed into a wall of smoke. I did the things on a preevacuation checklist, just in case: take down curtains, close and unlock windows, turn off the gas, turn on the lights, bring everything in off the porch. I used the hose to fill buckets with water and place them around the house. I didn’t need to (pre-pre-evacuation is just non-evacuation), but my nerves had history: When I was 12, a Florida wildfire destroyed 30 structures in my rural area, and my family didn’t get out in time: On our path down the highway, the road was blocked by fire, and we spent hours in a landfill entryway, surrounded by flames. There are concrete steps individual citizens can take to become more firewise in general: get the gunk out of gutters, clear defensible no-brush space around your house, keep wood piles and propane a few dozen feet away, screen all openings so embers don’t sneak in. But sometimes, despite best efforts, Mother Nature wields an upper hand. By this point in the fire, on the Fourth, more than 100 homes had been lost. At six p.m., I tuned in to the community briefing, streamed via Facebook Live from the small town of La Veta. “Happy Fourth of July, everybody,” said David Detray, fire chief of the La Veta area. “I want to give you this picture of your La Veta Fire Protection District personnel.” On the screen behind him, eight firefighters, two holding American flags and one holding a giant teddy bear, stood in a V, seemingly paused in a march through an otherwise empty street. This picture was from the main street in Cuchara, an 8,500-foot-high village that had been evacuated. Citizens couldn’t hold their annual Independence Day parade, which they’ve done for some 50 years. So the firefighters took a moment to stage a miniature, kind of morbid one for them. “These are your people,” Detray said. In the Blue Team’s update, operations section chief Chris Zoller noted where the fire had been “pushing,” expanding its edge by 6,000 to 7,000 acres. He moved on to an area, full of trees, where the fire would soon hit a road and move into a region called “Paradise Acres.” “This is going to be our trouble area for the next 24 hours,” he says. After presenting her initial forecast at Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team morning meetings, Crook goes right back into prediction mode. She feeds information into models that forecast the fire’s behavior, part of the Wildland Fire Decision Support System —a powerful tool that gobbles up data from multiple sources to support wildfire strategy-making. Some of the information it sucks in comes from a federal program called Landfire, which can help firefighters tell what is growing on the affected ground, how it burns, and how topography flows beneath it. Although the support system itself is much newer, these federal prediction models have been in development for around 30 years. “They’ve morphed and become more robust,” says Crook. Crook has two favorites: the three-day perimeter projection, and the fire spread probability prediction. “It tells me over the course of the next seven to 14 days what is the probability of the fire impacting any point on the landscape,” she says. But simulations can only simulate. So in the afternoon, Crook heads out with the firefighters and comes back with ground truth. She can feed specific information back into the models—essentially calibrating them to the North Spring Fire. Still, it’s not a perfect system. “There’s a bit of a mystery on every fire,” she says. There’s also a bit of logistical challenge: Not just where to put the PortaPotties but also how to get the humans and heavy equipment you need. When the Spring Fire started and Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team showed up on the scene, the fire was already moving fast. They needed to act. But the rest of the state also seemed to be on fire. “It took like four days before I was able to get the resources to even come close to what we needed to help start suppressing the fire,” says Jay Esperance, the Blue Team’s incident commander. But that, he says, is life. “There’s only so many firefighters and equipment, and we were the new show in town.” Once the heavy machinery did arrive, it was substantial: At one point, there were 17 bulldozers to clear out lines of land to contain the blaze; two “masticators” to chew up brush and other small-diameter stuff; and skidders to move logs. In addition to ground-bound resources, the Spring Fire fighters also took to the sky. They used planes and helicopters, although Zoller calls them “fixed-wing” and “rotor-wing” aircraft. The planes that combated this blaze—stashed in fire-prone regions across the country during the volatile season—included single-engine flyers and VLATs : Very Large Air Tankers. Both carried fire retardant that spilled from their bellies like paintball powder. The helicopters took care of the H 2 O. “Water is for the immediate need to cool things down,” says Zoller. Retardant, meanwhile, slows the fire down. Above the winged craft flies an “eye in the sky”: an in-the-air air-traffic controller. “He directs all the traffic, and keeps the rotor-wing out of the way of the fixed-wing,” says Zoller. Because the last thing anyone needs during a wildfire is a plane crash. At a July 11 evacuee meeting in Fort Garland, which once hosted a functional military fort, a southern-section public information officer took the stage. “We’re going to start off with some good news,” she said. The entire fire was 83 percent contained, and the southern perimeter was entirely under control. Team Black was going home. Crook’s Blue Team took over the whole operation, which, two days later, was 91 percent contained. The northern edge of the fire stayed far enough from my house that I never had to evacuate, and the Blue Team soon packed up, leaving operations to local teams on July 16. On their way out of town, they decontaminated their equipment, to avoid transporting invasive species, “weed-washing” the outside with high-pressure hoses and burning the insides of tanks with 140-degree water. The path to recovery will be long and hard, like the roads that climb up through the high mountain passes here. According to the Denver Post, the area has brought in the disaster cleanup nonprofit Team Rubicon to help, and a group called the Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster will assist, too. More than 225 structures were destroyed, according to a July 18 report from the National Interagency Coordination Center. What was forest is charred trunks, scorched earth. And no matter how much data anyone or any satellites take, it’s impossible to predict exactly what will happen next for the communities. But if one of Crook’s models could provide imperfect post-fire forecasts, it would probably say that life will slowly grow back toward normal.

THOMAS FULLER,"Why do the researcher says we’ve never seen this before in California? Mark A. Finney, an expert in fire behavior for the U.S. Forest Service and an author of the study, says California forests are much more vulnerable now because, paradoxically, they have been better protected. In their natural state, forests were regularly thinned by fire but the billions of dollars that the state spends aggressively fighting wildfires and restrictions on logging have allowed forests to accumulate an overload of vegetation. “We had forests that were very resilient to weather variations and insect disturbances in the past — maintained by frequent fire on the order of every year, or every few years at the most,” Mr. Finney said. By putting out fires, “we’ve changed completely the fire component of these ecosystems,” he said. How might the dead-tree forests affect California? One of the most striking concerns is the damage the fires might do to watersheds. Intense, hot-burning fires could disrupt forests’ ability to channel water into the Sierra reservoirs that provide cities like San Francisco with drinking water. That’s a scenario that could nudge the state into rethinking its forest management.

"Erin Biba on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When fire scientist Albert Simeoni wants to study wildfires, he cant exactly run into the nearest blaze with sensors and data collection tools. Its simply too dangerous and these conflagrations, though theyre becoming more frequent and intense with climate change, arent predictable enough to research in the controlled manner that science demands.
But he and his fellow fire protection engineers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute have designed a solution: a wind tunnel where they can burn all sorts of materials under different conditions to see how they respond. Its helping them develop new ways to manage forests and design fire-resilient communitiesalthough in the current federal funding environment, actually implementing this critical research is proving to be an uphill battle.
Its very difficult to study a fire while its happening, Simeoni told Earther in his pronounced French accent. Unpredictable weather patterns, uncertainty regarding how different layers of vegetation burn, topography, local residents and nearby buildings are all elements that change the fire. Not to mention the importance of everyone, researchers included, staying out of the way of firefighters trying to save lives.
Field research does happenfor instance, when Simeoni became a fire chief at his volunteer fire department in France, hed sometimes put sensors on his firefightersbut for the most part, the best way to study wildfire is in what Simeoni calls sealed experiments. That means prescribed burns and lab studies, the latter of which allow very specific variables, like wind or vegetation type, to be studied in isolation. 
We dont have any pathways to deliver the results of our research because theres no funding. Its a dire picture at the moment.
Simeoni has been studying fires at WPI for a year and a half, and he built the wind tunnel last year. Essentially a large glass box, the bottom of the tunnel is removable so it can be operated in the lab with materials the team brings inmostly, vegetation from the Worcester areaor taken out to the field and placed over vegetation.
Right now, the researchers are using the wind tunnel for two basic but essential studies. First, in conjunction with the University of Notre Dame, theyre burning dowels made from different types of coated, lightweight wood often found in hardware stores to watch how the flames spread between fuels. While burning these dowels, theyre also looking at how the wind moves and changes the way the fire spreads.
Simeonis hope is that the results of this research will help communities become more fire-proof. The recent destruction of Paradise, California by the Camp Fire underscores just how high the stakes are.
For most places I firmly believe its a design problem, Simeoni said. We see a domino effect in these communities. You ignite the first row of houses and then you lose the whole community. He believes there may be better ways to engineertowns so that if a row of houses does catch on fire, it doesnt spread and take out the entire neighborhood.
The second set of tests hes performing in the wind tunnel are on vegetation. Specifically, how do different types of plants affect wind patterns? While normal wind tunnels are designed to produce smooth wind patterns, this tunnel can mimic gusts and turbulent conditions. For these tests, the bottom of the tunnel can be removed and the entire rig can be brought out to the field to burn real vegetation.
Simeoni explained that the goal is to separate variables and add them back one by one once weve captured the physics of each piece.
The challenge with all of this, Simeoni said, is that even though they are learning a lot about wildfire and how it works, there is currently no systemized, government-funded pipeline for relaying the information theyve gathered to the public. 
Right now, fire researchers are relying on one-on-one individual relationships with fire managershis team is assisting the New Jersey Fire Service with prescribed burns in the Pine Barrensto try and get their findings put into practice. But on a broader scale, We dont have any pathways to deliver the results of our research because theres no funding, Simeoni said. Its a dire picture at the moment.
Simeoni noted one federal government program, the Joint Fire Science Program, thats dedicated to delivering research for implementation. But its lost significant funding over the years. In 2012 the program was funded at $13 million. It was originally slated to be abolished in proposed versions of the 2019 budget by the Trump Administration, but some funding was restored. The Office of Wildland Fire, which coordinates budget and policy for the Department of the Interiors fire programs, told Earther that, while the 2017 total budget for this program for both the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service combined was $9 million, in 2018 that dropped to $3 million and funding came only from DOI. Funding for 2019 is dependent on final congressional action (and the Trump Administrations budget proposal, once again, eliminates the program entirely).
The diminishment of this program comes as climate change is upping likelihood of large blazes and causing the cost of wildfires to skyrocket. Before 2000, Simeoni says, the costliest wildfire in the US was the 1991 Oakland fire, at $1.5 billion. The cost of the Camp Fire is not yet certain, but could be upwards of $10 billion. With little governmental support for further research into how fire conditions are changing and how we can adapt, were essentially flying blind into a more dangerous future.
The level of challenge that we have for our societies now is becoming very, very important and we cannot avoid it, Siemoni said. Were messing around in the playground while we have very dangerous and grave things happening and Im afraid well see more drama down the road if were not tackling this phenomenon as we should. We need more people working on this.

Elena Saavedra Buckley,"This story originally appeared on High Country News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. At the end of July, Twitter user Alicia Santana posted a photo of a man sitting in a plastic folding chair in his yard. He’s looking away from the camera, towards a monstrous, orange cloud of smoke filling the sky beyond a wire fence. “My dad not wanting to leave his home,” Santana wrote, ending it with #MendocinoComplexFire. As wildfires spark, parts of the internet glow with them. The #CarrFire, #FergusonFire, #RanchFire and other hashtags spread quickly this summer on Twitter. If past seasons are any indication, there will be thousands more tweets like this, and they will continue as smoke—the insidious second wave of wildfires—spreads across the West. They can also be used for data. In a recently published study, US Forest Service researchers Sonya Sachdeva and Sarah McCaffrey found that, when analyzed in large numbers, tweets about wildfires can accurately model the way smoke moves. In their study, published by the International Conference on Social Media &amp; Society, Sachdeva and McCaffrey analyzed close to 39,000 tweets posted between May and September 2015 in California. They stripped the tweets to reveal their core subjects: smoke in the air, fallen ash, haziness, smell. By tagging the tweets with the location in which they were posted, the researchers created a verbatim map: a landscape of fire based on the people who experienced it. Their modeling proved accurate when compared to figures from air quality monitors. Their results show that what we write online could fill the gaps that traditional data collection leave behind. While still nascent, using social media to study environmental events is a growing field. Images from Flickr can help researchers understand tourism rates in natural areas, and social media often acts as a crucial tool in disaster relief. “Social media is everywhere people are,” Sachdeva said. “Physical monitors of any kind, by virtue of them being physical, can’t do that.” The 2015 wildfire season, including the Rough and Butte fires, burned nearly 900,000 acres in California alone. The smoke-related tweets Sachdeva and McCaffrey used reflect the air pollution’s wide impact. “Abandoned my 2015 #johnmuirtrail attempt… due to Rough Fire smoke. Poor visibility and headache the culprit,” one Twitter user wrote. Another simply read: “#airquality #cantbreathe #roughfire #California.” If someone #cantbreathe due to smoke, they’re inhaling small particles known as as PM 2.5, which measure under five percent the width of human hair. The particles can lodge into the lung tissue and bloodstream and cause health issues, particularly for people with respiratory issues, pregnant women, and children. In extreme conditions, though, the long-term effects can impact others. During the summer of 2017, Montana saw smoke conditions so dense that they maxed out air quality monitoring capacity. Dan Inouye manages the Washoe County air quality management district in Nevada, home to Reno, which has seven air quality monitors. Smoke is rolling downwind from California and into the county. Inouye’s eyes have been watering for weeks, and the air quality index has registered unhealthy pollution levels. “As long as the fires are active, there’s always that chance that smoke’s going to come our way,” he said. Near cities like Reno, air pollution monitoring stations are plentiful. But they’re absent in many rural areas like central Nevada, leaving small communities with less information about the air they breathe. Using alternative modeling techniques, such as Twitter, could help round out those blank spots. How tweeters’ location affected people’s experience of wildfires also factored into Sachdeva and McCaffrey’s research. By analyzing the topics people tweeted about, they could dig into what people cared about based on distance from the flames. The farther away the tweet from the fire, the more people were interested in concrete information: how the blaze started, say, or what NASA images indicated. The closer the tweets got to the blazes, the more people asked for and offered help. Rather than fleeing, McCaffrey learned, victims often stay put—“people are actually going into the fire.” McCaffrey, who has studied responses to wildfires for 25 years, sees them as a high-stakes—and revealing—event in the human-nature relationship. “There’s that narrative that the people in the immediate path are going to freak out,” McCaffrey said, “but the tweets are a clear demonstration that what people are really thinking about is what we should do and how people want to help each other.""",Social media could help monitor air pollution that physical monitors miss.,2018-08-15T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Your Tweets Can Help Map the Spread of Wildfire Smoke,https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-wildfire-model/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b735809be99ce7dfa36496c/191:100/pass/wildfire-1014049338.jpg,wired,Wired,wildfire,0

SARAH VOWELL,"Bozeman, Mont. — Here in the Mountain West, there are no longer four seasons, only two: winter and wildfire. (Unless you’re a tourist, in which case: ski season and fly fishing.) Come August, my sister and I will make our annual bet, for pizza, on what date the first snow will fall in Bozeman, our hometown. I always lose rooting for the earliest possible flurries, since the snows snuff out the region’s last, stubborn wildfires. Then, when the smoke finally stops wafting across the Gallatin Valley, I can put away my eyedrops and see clearly which neighbors fail to abide by the Northern Hemisphere’s most sacred social contract, shoveling one’s sidewalk. Who cares about Republicans and Democrats? In this climate, there are only snow-shoveling solid citizens or the deadbeats whose slippery walks pose a daily existential threat to the brittle bones of my nice, elderly mom. Looking back on this neck of the woods’ multiplying struggles with the effects of global warming — and drying — I have come to think of June 14, 1988, as the first day of the rest of our lives. On that date 30 years ago, lightning struck the Custer National Forest northeast of Yellowstone National Park, igniting the Storm Creek fire, the first of that hot, dry, windy summer’s major infernos to spread into the park. By mid-July, lightning had also sparked the Shoshone, Fan, Red, Clover and Mink fires. On Aug. 20, fireballs conveyed by 80-mile-per-hour winds ravaged 165,000 acres in a single day remembered as Black Saturday. On Sept. 1, a headline in this newspaper announced, “ U.S. Forest Fires Worst Since 1919.” By Sept. 11, when the first snows started to put an end to the ordeal, 1.4 million acres of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned, including more than a third of America’s oldest and most beloved national park.","It’s almost like we have just two seasons now, winter and wildfire.",2018-06-13T23:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Contributing Op-Ed Writer: Shouting ‘Fire!’ in the Burning West,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/opinion/wildfire-west-yellowstone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/opinion/14Vowell/14Vowell-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Wikimedia Commons Image caption The fire burned for nearly three months in Oregon A judge has ordered a teenager to pay more than $36m (£27m) after he admitted starting a huge forest fire that raged for months in the US state of Oregon. Hood River County Judge John Olson ruled the boy must also write apology notes to 152 people who were trapped on hiking trails by the conflagration. The Eagle Creek fire burned for nearly three months in the scenic Columbia River Gorge, destroying several homes. A lawyer for the 15-year-old called the amount ""absurd"" and ""absolutely silly"". In February, the boy - who is not named in court documents - admitted to throwing a firework on 2 September 2017 into the tinder-dry Eagle Creek Canyon - about 50 miles (80km) from Portland. The resulting inferno engulfed 48,000 acres and cost fire crews $18m to fight. Image copyright CBS He pleaded guilty to eight counts of reckless burning of public and private property, two counts of depositing burning materials on forest land, as well criminal mischief and reckless endangerment of others. In a ruling on Monday, the court said the boy must pay $36,618,330 to Eagle Creek victims, including the US Forest Service, the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission, a homeowner and others. He was also ordered to serve five years of probation and perform 1,920 hours of community service for the US Forest Service. The court acknowledged in its ruling that the teen will not be able to pay the full amount. Image copyright Wikimedia Commons But Judge Olson cited ""safety valves"" in state law that allows juvenile offenders to stop payments after 10 years if they finish probation and do not commit any other crimes. Jack Morris, a lawyer for the boy, argued last week that the penalty is excessive and urged the judge to impose a ""reasonable and rational"" amount, reports the Oregonian. But Judge Olson wrote that the figure ""is clearly proportionate to the offence because it does not exceed the financial damages caused by the youth"". He also directed the juvenile probation officers to help the boy create a payment schedule. The teen's mother told the Oregonian newspaper in November that the fire was ""a trauma"" for her son. During his plea hearing in February he begged the court's forgiveness, saying: ""I know I will have to live with his bad decision for the rest of my life, but I have learned from this experience and will work hard to help rebuild the community in any way that I can.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Your pets breathe the same air you do. If youre putting on a mask and taking precautions against wildfire smoke, you should be taking precautions for your pets as well. How to Know If Smoke Is Bothering Your Pet Dogs and cats have similar reactions to the smoke as people do. The American Veterinary Medical Association says these are some signs to look for : Coughing, gagging, or open-mouthed breathing Faster breathing Eyes watering or looking irritated Nasal discharge Fatigue, disorientation, or reduced appetite Birds are even more sensitive to smoke, in part because their lungs are really good at pulling oxygen from the air. This also makes them more sensitive to irritating or poisonous things in the air (think of the canary in the coal mine, which was a real thing.) Keep Them Indoors Smoke-filtering masks arent made for pets, so your best bet is to keep them indoors and keep the air as clean as you can. These steps are similar to what you would do for yourself and your human family: Keep windows and doors closed. Turn off the fresh-air intake on your air conditioner, and set it to just recirculate the air thats already in the house. Use an air purifier. If you dont have one that can handle a whole homes worth of air, put it in the room your pets spend the most time in (or move your pets to the room with the filter). If your pet needs to go outside, limit the amount of time they spend in smoky air, and try to time those trips for the times of day when it seems to be less smoky. Outdoor pets may get a little bit stir crazy, so consider buying or making some new toys to keep them entertained. Plan for Evacuation If the smoke gets too bad, or the wildfires too close, you may have to pack up and leave home. Remember your pets when youre planning your trip: have a proper carrier for birds, cats, and small pets, and figure out what shelters, hotels, or friends houses can accommodate pets. If you have horses or other livestock, call around to find trailers you might be able to rent or borrow in a pinch; the AMVA suggests asking your neighbors, farmers, and haulers well ahead of time.","Your pets breathe the same air you do.

THOMAS FULLER,"Pet Rescue &amp; Reunification, as the volunteers call themselves, have set up night-vision cameras in storm drains and creek beds, where many cats went into hiding. Every evening at dusk they set traps baited with tuna and mackerel, checking them hourly until dawn. Photo Volunteers posted flyers of cats found in the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times “If you want to catch a cat you have to stay up all night — that’s just the name of the game,” Ms. Petruska said as she prepared for another dark and cold round of cat stalking. “I’ve been a horrible insomniac my whole life so it suits me.” Coffey Park, the neighborhood where Ms. Petruska is focusing her efforts, may as well have been struck by a bomb. Well over 1,000 homes were leveled. Ms. Petruska and her team say they realize that with nearly 5,000 homes destroyed in the Santa Rosa area alone their effort is ancillary to the grieving and massive effort of reconstruction that is only just beginning. The bleak landscape of charred lots is still teeming with creatures stealthily crawling throughout the night, mostly unseen. Ms. Petruska says she knows there are still many cats on the loose because her motion-activated cameras capture them nearly every night, along with a parade of other nocturnal animals such as skunks, opossums and raccoons. To the families who lost everything, recounting how Ms. Petruska helped recover their cats often brings tears. “I just wanted my cat — that was the only thing I wanted back,” said Kelly Stinson, whose home in Coffey Park was destroyed. “I spent hours every single day looking for her.“ Photo Barbara Gray, right, and her daughter Kelly searched through a burned property where cat traps had been set out earlier. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Ms. Petruska located Evy and after an evening of coaxing returned a day later and grabbed the cat by the scruff of the neck. Sara Ratekin, a veterinarian who has treated many of the cats rescued by Ms. Petruska’s team, says the fires have shown the ability of cats to survive perilous circumstances. Captured fire cats often arrive in her office with burned paws, singed whiskers — and many pounds lighter than before the fire. Unlike dogs, cats have an instinct to flee when they sense danger, Dr. Ratekin said. “I can explain why they ran away,” she said. “But I can’t explain why they became so wild so quickly.” In August, during the flooding in Houston caused by Hurricane Harvey, cats were spotted by rescue workers swimming or floating on furniture and debris trying to find high ground. THIS IMAGE. Photographer Scott Olson found one angry cat swimming in floodwater. #Harvey pic.twitter.com/yLvsL67BRo — Marcus Yam (@yamphoto) Sept. 2, 2017 When first responders showed up at flooded homes, dogs would often greet them at the door, tails wagging, said Katie Jarl, the Texas director of The Humane Society of the United States. If cats were still home they would often be hiding — and when discovered would need significant coaxing to leave. Photo A cat that was found at the Journeys End Mobile Park in Santa Rosa. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times ”No matter if it’s fires or flooding, or any type of natural disaster, cats will often hide,” Ms. Jarl said. “It can be days or weeks before they re-emerge.” To lure Santa Rosa’s fire cats back into domestic life, Ms. Petruska assembles personality profiles of each cat she stalks. One cat likes the sound of whipped cream fizzing from a can. She carries a can in her car. Another cat answers to the sound of the crinkling of a bag of a specific brand of cat treats. She carries the treats. Unsurprisingly the most effective lure appears to be fish. Ms. Petruska soaks socks in the juices from cans of mackerel and hangs them from trees. On a recent evening at dusk, she drove through the countless rows of burned out houses to a neighborhood near a small creek. In near freezing temperatures, she hauled a cat trap across the molten remains of a home, careful to step over pieces of roofing and other remnants jutting up through the rubble. She passed a random assortment of household items laid bare in the detritus — a solitary teacup, a blackened metal colander and the burned out remains of a washer and dryer — before setting up a metal trap. By morning the trap was still empty. But she has persisted, working through the holidays. Around 10 fire cats have been found without any clues as to their owners; they are being kept at Sonoma County’s animal services department. She has found cats even after owners gave up the search. Cindy Fulwider fled her home in the early hours of October 9 as embers the size of golf balls rained down. She was convinced that her cat, whom she calls Sweet Baby, had perished. Then she got a call five weeks after the fire from one of Ms. Petruska’s team. “I really thought we would never see him again,” Ms. Fulwider said.

Connie Loizos,"In a recent appearance by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki at the South by Southwest Festival, she suggested that YouTube is countering the conspiracy-related videos that have been spreading like wildfire on the platform — including videos telling viewers that high school senior and Parkland, Fl. survivor David Hogg is an actor. Specifically, Wojcicki outlined YouTube’s plans to add “information cues,” including links to Wikipedia pages that debunk garbage content for viewers if they choose to learn more. (Somewhat strangely, no one had told Wikipedia about this plan.) Either way, the platform is going to have do much better than that, suggests a new Business Insider report that says YouTube Kids has a huge problem with conspiracy videos, too. To wit, it’s showing its young viewers videos that teach them the nonsensical, including “that the world is flat, that the moon landing was faked, and that the planet is ruled by reptile-human hybrids,” according to BI’s own first-hand findings. In fact, when BI searched for “UFO” on YouTube Kids — and what kid isn’t interested in learning more about UFOs? — one of the top videos to appear was a nearly five-hour-long lecture by professional conspiracy theorist David Icke, who covers everything in the clip from “reptile human bloodlines,” to the Freemasons, who he credits with building everything from the Statue of Liberty to Las Vegas to both Christianity and Islam. (The Freemasons also killed President John Kennedy, he tells viewers.). Business Insider says YouTube removed the videos from YouTube Kids after its editorial team contacted the company, and that YouTube issued the following statement: “The YouTube Kids app is home to a wide variety of content that includes enriching and entertaining videos for families. This content is screened using human trained systems. That being said, no system is perfect and sometimes we miss the mark. When we do, we take immediate action to block the videos or, as necessary, channels from appearing in the app. We will continue to work to improve the YouTube Kids app experience.” That’s not going to be good enough for parents who are paying attention. Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist who previously led product at YouTube and has a young daughter, may have summed it up best in a tweet that he published earlier this afternoon, writing that “when you create and market an app to kids, the level of care and custodial responsibility you need to take is 100x usual. Clean it up or shut it down pls.” YouTube has been reluctant to tinker with is recommendation algorithm because its “main objective is to keep you consuming YouTube videos for as long as possible” Wired noted in a story published this week that suggested crazy theories are quite sticky. Indeed, reported Wired, despite a recent uproar about all the conspiracy theory content, YouTube still doesn’t have clear rules around when whether these videos violate its community guidelines, which cover bullying, hate speech, graphic violence, and sexually explicit content. Wojcicki said during her festival appearance that “People can still watch the videos, but then they have access to additional information.” Hopefully YouTube plans to do a lot better than that — especially when it comes to its younger viewers. As it is, this editor doesn’t allow her kids to watch YouTube Kids without strict supervision out of concern for what they might see. At this point, we’d be surprised if parents at YouTube feel much differently.","In a recent appearance by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki at the South by Southwest Festival, she suggested that YouTube is countering the conspiracy-related videos that have been spreading like wildfire on the platform — including videos telling viewers that high…",2018-03-17T22:57:19Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Youtube is reportedly introducing your kids to conspiracy theories, too",http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/17/youtube-is-reportedly-introducing-your-kids-to-conspiracy-theories-too/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/youtube-newsletter.jpg?w=640,techcrunch,TechCrunch,wildfire,0
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out. The Ranch Fire can now officially take its place in the record books, having burned a grand total of 459, 123 acres. The Ranch Fire was part of the Mendocino Complex, which lit up on July 27. Paired with the River Fire, the complex became the largest fire in state history in early August. Just a week later Ranch Fire took the title of the largest single fire in California history, fanned by powerful winds over a hot, dry landscape. The Ranch Fire continued its smoldering march through Mendocino National Forest just northeast of Ukiah until it was officially declared out on Wednesday. Crews are doing mop up work, helping clean up fire lines dug to contain the fire and searching for any last hot spots. While the blaze is out, the California’s state fire agency warned plumes of smoke could still rise due to the warm, dry weather. As crews continue assessing the landscape, a large closure remains in effect for the forest, including the Snowy Mountain Wilderness Area. The Ranch Fire was one of a few notable fires in California this summer. The Carr Fire left a swath of destruction in Redding and spawned a firenado while the Ferguson Fire shut down parts of Yosemite National Park. And we may not be done yet. Southern California’s fall fire season is just getting started. The Santa Ana winds that usher hot, dry air into the region helped fan last year’s Thomas Fire, which held California’s largest fire crown for all of eight months. The winds are calm for now, but they may not stay that way. “So after the present reprieve, I would not be surprised to see a renewed surge in heat, wind, and fire activity before the winter rains arrive,” UCLA climate scientist and California weather watcher Daniel Swain wrote on his blog this week. “I’ll keep my fingers crossed that we get a break this year, though. It’s already been a rough few years as far as California wildfires go.” All fires now occur in the context of a warming climate. This was California’s second-hottest summer on record, which no doubt helped the Ranch Fire take the title of California’s largest fire yet. Hotter conditions melt out snowpack earlier and dry out vegetation, creating a landscape more prone to explosive conflagrations. Research has shown that climate change has essentially doubled the area burned in western forests since the 1984.

Jennings Brown,"An Arizona border patrol agent started a wildfire during a gender reveal party involving a firearm and explosives, likely making it the most expensive such celebration in the history of the ridiculous ritual. Dennis Dickey was off-duty when he celebrated the revelation of his unborn childs sex on state-owned property close to Madera Canyon in April 2017, reports the Arizona Daily Star. A forest service agent wrote in a court affidavit that Dickey shot a target filled with the explosive Tannerite. The color of the powder plume that exploded from the target was intended to correlate with the expected sex of the babyblue for boy, pink for girl. This particular method has recently gained popularity among gun enthusiasts, and several examples of the execution have been uploaded to YouTube. The area was under a fire watch at the time, the Green Valley Fire Department chief told the Daily Star. According to the affidavit, the colored explosion ignited one and Dickey immediately reported the fire, saying he had started it. The Sawmill Fire eventually spread across 47,000 acres over the course of a week and drew nearly 800 firefighters. According to a release from the Department of Justice, the blaze caused $8.2 million in damage. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries or damaged buildings. Dickey pleaded guilty on Friday to the misdemeanor offense of causing a fire without a permit, the Daily Star reports. He was ordered to pay $220,000 in restitution and serve five years of probation. It was a complete accident, Dickey told the judge, according to the Daily Star. I feel absolutely horrible about it. It was probably one of the worst days of my life. Dickeys attorney Sean Chapman told the Daily Star that he believes his client will keep his job as a border patrol agent.

CONOR DOUGHERTY and ADAM NAGOURNEY,"The proposed law is the latest twist in a long and contentious fight over rent increases in Santa Rosa. The Sonoma County city, like much of California, is struggling with a difficult housing shortage and rising rents. The City Council passed a rent control and just cause eviction measure in 2016, only to see it repealed by a landlord-backed ballot initiative during a June special election this year. After the fires, community groups continued to organize renters, holding clinics and renewing their push for expanded rights. “The fires are clarifying the deep need that our region has for tenant protections,” said Davin Cardenas, a director of the North Bay Organizing Project.

DAN LEVIN,"CHICO, Calif. Gabe Price was having another rough day. As he had every morning since escaping the deadliest wildfire in Californias history, the 17-year-old had woken up beside his father on a sagging air mattress at his grandparents house, now crammed with four extra people and a dog. Stress filled the cramped rooms like smoke, always on the verge of flaring into another argument. Home or what he had until recently known as home is a pile of ashes. Paradise High School, where he is a senior, is cordoned off in an evacuation zone. Lessons are now all online, and Mr. Price desperately needed to find a Wi-Fi signal. So there he was, walking through a Muzak-filled shopping mall, where the Paradise school district had converted a former LensCrafters into a temporary school, wedged between a JCPenney and a toy store. This is the most stressful environment Ive ever been in, said Mr. Price, over the buzz of Spanish and algebra lessons nearby. Theres nowhere I can get fully comfortable and Ive got so much work to do. In the weeks since the Camp Fire killed at least 85 people and wiped out more than 18,000 buildings in Paradise and neighboring towns, those who fled have urgently searched for housing and normalcy, many still reeling from nightmares of the flames. The burden is particularly acute for Paradise Highs Class of 2019, 240 seniors on the cusp of adulthood whose post-graduation plans have been derailed by more pressing challenges.","In the weeks since California’s deadliest wildfire, the senior class of Paradise High School is scattered across the region and country, their post-graduation plans disrupted.",2018-12-13T16:32:51Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Their Plans Derailed by a Wildfire, Seniors at Paradise High School Wonder What’s Next",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/paradise-fire-survivors-california.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/us/paradise-promo/paradise-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,0
JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"“And it’s not just the individual, either; we go to work and our families always have in the back of their minds that something can happen,” Mr. Feyh said. “My wife had her worst nightmare come true.” Ashley Iverson lost her husband, Cory, in December while he was fighting the Thomas Fire in Ventura County. Mr. Iverson, a fire apparatus engineer with CalFire, had already worked a 24-hour shift but was helping put out spot fires when he became trapped in a gulch. The fire reached him before he could escape. Thousands honored his sacrifice at a funeral in San Diego, his hometown, just days before Christmas. Ms. Iverson was four months pregnant at the time, and today is caring for their two daughters. Sometimes she is overcome by pain, she said. “How can I raise my kids without my best friend? Why don’t they get to have him in their lives?” Ms. Iverson hopes to turn her husband’s tragic death into something positive. She is laying the groundwork for a foundation in his name that will advocate expanding mental health awareness among fire responders and firefighters. She said she finds comfort in knowing that he had dedicated himself to helping people. “After it happened, I took a breath. O.K., the worst has happened. Now what? Where do we go from here?” Ms. Iverson said. “A lot of widows, their life is over. I feel like Cory has given me legs. I’m just so damn proud of him and everything he did.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)","Monday: A longer and more intense wildfire season, a divisive rent control initiative, and Berkeley on a budget.",2018-07-30T13:14:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Increasing Strain on State Firefighters,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/us/california-today-firefighters.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/world/30caltoday-2/30caltoday-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,0

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Just when you think this wildfire season can’t get worse, something new comes along to remind you this year is truly one of rare horrors. Residents of Prince George, British Columbia—a small city 325 miles north of Vancouver—awoke to a sky seemingly devoid of sunlight. The city sits just to the east of British Columbia’s raging wildfires, which have sent smoke all the way across the Atlantic. To get there, the smoke has to pass over Prince George. Freaky orange skies have been the norm as a result, but the smoke became so thick on Friday that it turned the morning sky inky black well after sunrise. Residents turned their headlights on for the morning commute as the halogen glow of streetlights continued to illuminate the road. Even for a town that has been blanketed in smoke for more than a week, the scene was a first of its kind. In my years of covering climate change and the wildfires that accompany it, I can’t recall seeing anything quite like it myself. While conditions cleared up a bit by mid-morning, air quality remains off-the-charts bad, according to ratings from British Columbia’s government. Local journalist Nicole Oud tweeted that you “can feel the smoke and ash the second you step outside.” Other cities in the area are also dealing with high levels of pollution, which can cause respiratory problems even for healthy adults. The vast majority of the province continues to face high or extreme wildfire risk due to hot, dry conditions that have plagued much of the West Coast for the past month. Fires have burned nearly 1.1 million acres in British Columbia for the year-to-date, basically tripling the annual average. The ratio is likely to only become more lopsided with 10 new fires that lit on Thursday in addition to the 500 burning. That means it’s also possible the sunrise could again go up in smoke.","Just when you think this wildfire season can’t get worse, something new comes along to remind you this year is truly one of rare horrors.

Megan Geuss,"reader comments 3 Earlier this week, a 16-inch-by-16-inch, battery-operated hobby drone crashed in Arizona's Coconino National Forest, several miles north of Flagstaff, Arizona. The drone caught fire when it crashed, igniting a grassland area called Kendrick Park. The Kendrick fire spread more than 300 acres, but it was contained by 30 firefighters within the day. Coconino National Forest spokesperson George Jozens told Ars on Friday that it was unclear what kind of drone caused the crash, but the pilot had been identified and was charged with starting a wildfire by Forest Services Region 3 Law Enforcement. Ars contacted that department for comment, but we have not yet received a response. Penalties for starting a wildfire can range from fines to community service to jail time. Drone use and wilderness areas have been in conflict in recent years. Drones have grounded fire-fighting planes and helicopters, which usually fly low to the forest. Having a drone come in contact with propellers could endanger a firefighter's life. Lawmakers have pushed to criminalize flying drones in wildfire areas because grounded aircraft can cost cash-strapped fire-fighting departments thousands of dollars as fires burn out of control. At the same time, law enforcement has happily embraced drones for a variety of purposes. However, this is one of the few instances where a drone crash caused the wildfire in question. A similar incident happened last summer, when the US Air Force accidentally crashed an unmanned aircraft with a 130-foot wingspan—an RQ-4 Global Hawk—in the Inyo County National Forest just outside of Lone Pine, California. That crash started a small wildfire. AZ Central reported that the Kendrick fire took place in an area that had received adequate moisture over the winter, but grassy fields in the region are still highly flammable even in March. Jozens told Ars that it's legal to fly a drone in the National Forest as long as the pilot doesn't take off or land in a wilderness area and as long as there are no wildfires in the area. Drone pilots must also adhere to FAA rules.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"A few refuse to talk about the fire, saying they cannot relive those days. Everyone here describes a rebuilding that took years. They say there is no way to predict precisely what will be most challenging for the thousands of California residents whose lives have been upended by fires this year. “You’re having to make a lot of very big decisions financially and otherwise at a time when your mind is kind of reeling,” said Paula Baker, whose home on Pinecastle Street was destroyed in 2003. To receive insurance money, she recalled, she had to figure out how many T-shirts were in her drawers and what canned goods had been in her cupboard. “It was exhausting.” Photo More than 8,500 firefighters were battling six wildfires in Southern California on Sunday. The fire that destroyed these homes in San Diego County is more than 60 percent contained. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times More than 8,500 firefighters were battling six blazes across Southern California on Sunday. The largest, the Thomas fire, remained out of control and made its way from Ventura into Santa Barbara County, burning more than 170,000 acres and 710 buildings. Officials ordered evacuations in parts of the wealthy coastal towns of Carpinteria and Montecito and warned that all residents should be prepared to flee. The fire in northern San Diego County had been 60 percent contained by Sunday morning, but officials said that strong winds could easily rekindle the flames. After touring Ventura on Saturday, Gov. Jerry Brown blamed climate change for the growth and strength of wildfires. “This could be something that happens every year or every few years,” he said. “We’re about to have a firefighting Christmas.” It will not be the first holiday tinged by smoke at St. Gregory the Great, a Catholic church in Scripps Ranch. In 2003, an early Sunday Mass ended with cellphones buzzing as people realized their homes were in the path of the fast-moving fire. Many fled their homes assuming they would be back within hours, but instead were forced out for weeks. The church soon became a hub for victims, as volunteers set up dozens of tents in the parking lot to hand out clothes, food, baby bottles, anything that might be useful. One volunteer batted down the idea of giving out Christmas trees, since many people had no place to put them. The 2003 fire eventually burned more than 280,000 acres, destroyed more than 2,200 houses and killed 15 people in San Diego County, one of the largest wildfires in state history. It hopscotched across and within neighborhoods, scorching some homes while leaving others untouched. Photo Jim Kuhlken walks his dog, Chula, on Pinecastle Street, a street where most of the houses were destroyed by a wildfire in 2003. He came up with a plan to hire one builder for as many homes as possible, allowing homeowners to get more house for less money. Credit Andrew Cullen for The New York Times “We wanted a sense of normalcy as soon as possible,” said Cynthia Collins, who considers her family of seven blessed because their home suffered only smoke damage. “But we might have tried too quickly. It’s not the same normal.” Ms. Collins said that she saw relationships of dozens of her neighbors destroyed in the aftermath of the fire, as they argued over what rebuilt homes would look like or whether residents with wood fences were to blame. Many couples divorced under the stress, she said, and she blames the lingering impact of the smoke for children and young adults suffering from cancer. She anxiously thought of it again this week, coughing on smoke just days after doctors said a lump in her daughter’s thyroid was benign. Like others, Ms. Collins had thought of her home within city limits as completely safe. Her season of dread stretches longer and longer, as fires during the winter months become more common. She has vowed to never use wood on her property and urges other residents to do the same, but many have moved in since the fire and may not feel so vulnerable. The rebuilding here took years; in 2005 an article in the local newspaper found that just a third of residents whose homes were destroyed had moved back. In Scripps Ranch, the reconstruction drastically altered the landscape, turning single-story ranch homes into mini-mansions with turrets and Italian-style stone décor. Photo Jim Kuhlken rebuilt his house and patio after the 2003 fire. Credit Andrew Cullen for The New York Times After Jim Kuhlken, a landscape architect, learned that his recently renovated house had burned to the ground along with about 50 others on his block, he came up with a plan to hire one builder for as many homes in the neighborhood as possible. His pitch was simple: “If we can do this as a group, we can do it a lot cheaper.” Today, his 3,200-square-foot craftsman-style house includes his favorite addition: a courtyard with a fountain, a trellis and two Adirondack chairs. His then 15-year-old daughter helped decorate and later became an interior designer. Dan Luka remembers the relief he felt when he signed with the developer that Mr. Kuhlken had helped arrange. It meant he could build a larger home with the same amount of insurance money and make fewer decisions — the kind of advice he would offer anyone starting to recover now. “And install internal sprinklers,” he added with a bit of a grim chuckle. “Before the threat of fire was kind of academic. Today, I see everything as a potential fuse.” Now, he feels his blood pressure rise every time he sees flames on television, smells even a whiff of smoke or hears helicopters overhead — just as he has for the last week.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Im going to stay here in Chico and just become one of Chicos homeless people until I can get back up the hill, said Ms. Roberts, 73, who lost her home in Paradise and had been staying with her dog, Princess, at the Neighborhood Church shelter in Chico, an official Red Cross site that closed and moved farther away last week. FEMA couldnt seem to help me, the Red Cross couldnt seem to help me, I havent had one penny for relocation, I havent been approached that theres a room in town other people have, but Ive received nothing, and we dont have anywhere to go. Sites like the Walmart lot, where many self-described burnouts those who lost their homes to the Camp Fire have taken refuge, pose considerable dangers. Several volunteers said they had seen people who were displaced by the fires become targets for theft by those who were already homeless. Theyve been through the good, the bad and the ugly here, said Rich Wilson, 68, a volunteer outside Walmart. James Tyler Steen, 49, who had been homeless in Paradise for five years and has been living on the grass outside Walmart since the fire, said there is a big difference between the original homeless population and more recent additions. Youve got the parking lot, and then youve got the field, he said, referring to the division of space outside the shop. Money is the difference. Their needs are met; these needs arent. These guys take their needs, these guys buy their needs. Mr. Brown acknowledged that there were tensions, but he added that in the midst of it all, there was also some camaraderie and a shared sympathy for the desperation of the situation. The homeless here are actually teaching the people who have never been homeless how to survive, he said, like how to stay safe in the tents, where to find food, and how to keep warm as flash floods bore down from the recent rains. And thats a big positive, he said.","A chimney was all that the Camp Fire left standing of a house in Paradise, Calif., one of 14,000 residences destroyed in Butte County.

PETER EAVIS,"On Thursday, the company said it was stepping up equipment inspections in areas that regulators have identified as having a high fire risk. We recognize that more must be done to adapt to and address the increasing threat of wildfires and extreme weather in order to keep our customers and communities safe, John Simon, PG&amp;Es interim chief executive, said in a statement.
PG&amp;E said its bankruptcy filing was meant to protect it from becoming overwhelmed by its wildfire liabilities. But some investors said PG&amp;E did not need bankruptcy protection because it earns enough money to pay the wildfire claims as they come due. PG&amp;Es shares, which have more than doubled in recent weeks, were down about 1.5 percent on Thursday morning.
The company has already used its bankruptcy filing to halt payments to some wildfire victims. PG&amp;E has stopped making payments for claims from the 2015 Butte Fire. But the fire does not appear to pose a large financial burden to the company. In the fourth quarter, PG&amp;E recorded legal costs of $9 million for the Butte fire, a fraction of the expenses from the other fires.
Due to recent wildfire-related lawsuits and the subsequent financial uncertainty surrounding them, PG&amp;E has stopped making settlement offers to individual plaintiffs at this time, the company said in an email message. Under the Chapter 11 process, any Butte Fire settlements that have not been paid will be addressed in the bankruptcy case.","The remnants of mobile homes in Paradise, Calif., after the Camp Fire.

KIRK JOHNSON,"But getting to that point is hard. Infant mortality is a problem. Few seeds survive to germinate. Scientists trying to restore land devastated by wildfire say coating the seeds with the protective layer may help them through the vulnerable early days. The thinking is a little like swaddling a baby. The idea is still in testing. Along the way, the fires are also becoming their own brutal testing ground. They have gotten bigger, with more acres burned per fire. Last year came close to the record on that measure. And the fires are often hotter as well, enough in some cases to all but sterilize fragile rangeland soils deep below the surface, making regeneration harder. Why has so much rangeland been burned? It’s partly that this type of land is less treasured than the green, forested places that attract hikers, campers and nature lovers. Grass and sage country is important for ranchers, bird-watchers and for devotees of Edward Abbey and his book “Desert Solitaire.” But when blazes roar through, there are fewer people and buildings that must be defended. With limited budgets, firefighting agencies like the United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have to prioritize. Many range fires burn until they go out on their own.","Wildfire has destroyed acres of rangeland. Now scientists are trying to restore it.

"Amir Vera, CNN","(CNN) An off-duty border patrol agent wanted an explosive gender reveal party for his family and friends, but he ended up igniting a wildfire that spread to Coronado National Forest in Arizona. Dennis Dickey, 37, of Tucson, Arizona, has to pay more than $8 million in restitution, starting with a $100,000 initial payment and monthly payments thereafter, the Department of Justice said in a statement. Dickey pleaded guilty Friday to a misdemeanor violation of US Forest Service regulations for igniting the Sawmill Fire, the statement said. He agreed to a sentence of five years of probation and will make a public service announcement with the Forest Service about the cause of the blaze. His gender reveal party was on April 23, 2017, according to CNN affiliate KGUN-TV. Expectant parents throw such parties to tell family and friends the gender of their baby. In this case, Dickey's plan was to shoot a rifle at a target containing Tannerite, a highly explosive substance that would have exploded to reveal either blue powder for a boy or pink powder for a girl. Dickey shot the target, causing it to explode and start a fire that spread and resulted in what was known as the Sawmill Fire, the Department of Justice said. The Sawmill Fire burned nearly 47,000 acres owned by the state of Arizona and various federal agencies. The Coronado National Forest is federal land operated by the US Forest Service. Firefighters from at least 20 agencies fought the fire for about a week, the affiliate reported. Dickey immediately reported the fire and admitted to starting it, the Department of Justice said. CNN has reached out to Dickey's attorney, but has not heard back. Dickey has not revealed the gender of his baby, KGUN reported.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Local officials have hit back at President Trump's claims that firefighters don't have enough water Twin wildfires in California, known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, have grown to become the largest active wildfire in state history, officials said on Monday. The fires have spread rapidly in recent days to burn 283,800 acres of land - an area almost the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters are tackling 16 major blazes across the state amid hot weather, strong winds and low humidity. At least seven people have been killed in the Carr fire in the state's north. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump has reiterated social media comments that the fires' spread is being ""made so much worse"" by California's environmental laws. Local officials and experts have criticised and dismissed his tweets. Where are the fires burning? More than 14,000 firefighters and hundreds of US army personnel are trying to contain the more than a dozen major fires burning throughout the state. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Officials say the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two nearby fires being treated as the same incident, has surpassed last year's Thomas Fire to become the largest in state history. Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) described the wildfires as ""extremely fast, extremely aggressive, extremely dangerous,"" ""Look how big it got, just in a matter of days... Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen,"" he said on Monday. It is only 30% contained so far, with authorities warning it could take another week to get the blaze under control. Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". What is the row with Mr Trump?

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding Californias Camp Fire was the worlds costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that poor forest management is to blame for Californias wildfires woes. He also again threatened to cut off FEMA aid to the state.
The news was announced this morning on Trumps communication platform of choice, in a typo-laden tweet that has since been taken down and rewritten with the standard English spelling of forest.
Heres the original:
The confusing wording of the tweet has led some outlets to report that the president already ordered FEMA to cut off funding to the state of California. But as we should all be well aware at this point, Trump has a habit of sounding off about matters of national importance without bothering to inform the parties involved, whether hes firing the secretary of state via Tweet or attempting to kick transgender people out of the military.
FEMA told Earther that a statement was being prepared in response to Trumps supposed order, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details. The spokesperson did say that FEMA has continued to pay for disaster recovery despite the government shutdown. There are no disaster projects on hold presently and we are not aware of any that will have to be put on hold in the near future, FEMA said.
The California Governors Office of Emergency Services and state fire agency CalFire, which coordinate with FEMA on wildfire responses, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Trumps tweet.
Its not the first time Trump has at least threatened to pull federal aid to California as fires in the state spiral out of control. He issued a similar ultimatum back in November as firefighters were in still battling the Camp Fire. Its also hardly the first time Trump has pointed a finger at state environmental policies or forest management as the cause of Californias fire woes. Hes been doing so months, although Trumps fallacious fire culprit seems to have evolved over time from environmentalists who are wasting the rivers by diverting them into the ocean to state forest managers who cant be bothered to rake enough. 
Every version of these wild-ass claims has been thoroughly debunked by everyone from state firefighters who say they have plenty of water to fight the blazes, to Republican voters in Malibu who have correctly observed that better forest management wouldnt have prevented wildfires in their forest-free backyards to the president of Finland who said he never told Trump good forest management is the result of raking.
A charitable read on Trumps thought-salad about forest management is that hes heard about how the antiquated Forest Service practice of stamping out small brush fires has caused fuel loads to increase on forests throughout the West, priming them for larger fires.
But as University of New Mexico fire scientist Matthew Hurteau explained in a Guardian article in November, this is not the predominant cause of the recent fires that have scorched California.
Rather, human development at the wildlife urban interface has upped the number of fires being sparked, whether due to poorly-maintained power lines or an errant cigarette butt, in addition to putting more people and property in harms way. And climate change has primed landscapes to burn more frequently and more intensely, with hot weather and persistent drought turning landscapes into tinderboxes and causing fire season to start earlier in the spring and extend later into the fall.
Whats more, as Axios notes, more than half of Californias forests are federally-managed, and more fires burned on federal land than state land last year.
Hopefully, this latest threat to cut off FEMA aid will turn out to be as empty as the last one. 2018's wildfires took a devastating toll on California, and the state needs all the help it can get. Since President Trump issued disaster declarations for Ventura, Los Angeles, and Butte counties, FEMA has approved nearly 49 million in federal aid, according to a data tracker on the agency website. On Tuesday, newly-elected Governor Newson, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington state sent a letter to the federal government asking for more collaboration on managing the unprecedented fires the West faces.

JENNIFER MEDINA and SARAH MERVOSH,"The fires are fueled by extreme heat and parched vegetation from years of drought. And firefighters have repeatedly been vexed by the soaring temperatures and rugged terrain of the current fires. Scientists say climate change is a central factor in creating the atmospheric ingredients that make wildfires like California’s more extreme. Warmer global temperatures, driven by the greenhouse gases emitted from man-made activity like burning coal and driving cars, has led to droughts as well as more intense heat waves that last longer. The result: increasingly intense fire seasons that start earlier and last longer. “You combine drought and heat, you get record wildfires. It’s not rocket science,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it is still not possible to quantify the role that climate change plays versus other factors from more housing developments to the way forests are managed. But, Mr. Wehner said, “It’s fair to say that there is a human influence, and it’s not small.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday. It has so far destroyed 143 structures, including 75 residences. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said.

TIM ARANGO,"Every fire is investigated, and as wildfire seasons have grown worse, California has been more aggressive in holding people accountable — either with criminal charges for arson or negligence, as with Mr. Martinez, or, if there is a deep-pocketed culprit, with a lawsuit to recoup costs from fighting the fires. In the summer of 2013, a wildfire broke out in Riverside County and grew to threaten the desert resort town of Palm Springs. No one was killed, but it took thousands of firefighters, and almost $26 million, to put it out. Investigators found the blaze started with a faulty electrical box on a private property. Lawsuits in both state and federal court against the owner, a wealthy Saudi businessman, are still pending, although the state case may be resolved soon by mediation, according to the Idyllwild Town Crier, a newspaper in the area where the fire occurred. “Our civil cost recovery is definitely something we do on a regular basis,” Ms. Tolmachoff said. “Ninety-five percent of these fires are caused by humans and they could have been prevented somehow.” Last year the state saw what was then its biggest wildfire in recorded history — the Thomas Fire, in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties — and its most destructive, the Tubbs Fire in Northern California’s wine country. The causes of both fires are still under investigation, but some lawsuits point the finger at the power companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. And in several other Northern California fires last year, Cal Fire determined that faulty power lines were the cause. In the aftermath of those fires, California’s power companies have received close scrutiny from the State Legislature. “They talk about climate change,” said Steve Campora, a Sacramento lawyer who has made a career of suing utility companies on behalf of fire victims. “And climate change makes it more difficult to control the fire. But climate change does not cause ignition.” Edward Struzik, a fellow at the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy in Ontario and the author of “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” said he believes fires will continue to get worse, year by year, through a combination of climate change and human activity. “There is no end in sight for this fire activity,” he said. Referring to the human causes of wildfire, he added that “education is still a really big problem. There are many people who are oblivious to the dangers and volatility of forests.”","Firefighters battled the Mendocino Complex Fire this month.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In California, a wet winter no longer protects landscapes from the kind of intense wildfires the states been experiencing lately. 
A new study published Monday analyzed the historical relationship between wet winters and extreme wildfires. Over the past 400 years, the two rarely overlapped, but thats all changing now.
The paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses climate models and weather records to piece together this relationship. The international team of researchersfrom places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Germanys Institute of Coastal Researchfound that the North Pacific jet stream, which is usually responsible for Californias rain, determined whether the state would suffer an awful fire season between 1600 and 1903. A lot of rain from December to Februarytypically meant a low-key wildfire season.
However, that link weakened after 1903. Fast forward to 1977 and the link between the jet stream-induced rainfall and wildfires is pretty much gone.
Thats for two reasons, said lead author Eugene Wahl, a paleoclimate researcher with NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. First, federalfire suppression policies, which began following the removal of Native Americans from their lands. Native Americans practiced subsistence burning,which reduced fuel for wildfires.Their removal (and genocide, combined with the new fire suppression policies, led to the build up of massive amounts of fire fuel.
This helped uncouple the winter Jet Stream activity from the following fire season conditions, Wahl told Earther in an email.
On top of that physical alteration to the environment, now theres climate change. Our carbon emissions are causing temperatures to rise, which is resulting in a longer, hotter fire season. This allows wildfires to thrive despite the increased wet-season moisture the team expects California will see in our changing world. In fact, increased wet-season moisture could increase fuel loads in the same way that fire suppression used to.
Just look at 2017. That year saw a very wet winter, per the study, yet it still experienced extreme events like the Thomas Fire and Tubbs Fire, which were responsible fora combined 24 deaths and 318,7000 acres burned.
The fact that such extreme wildfires happened in a year with extreme rain is a major shift. The researchers couldnt find a single such instance between 1600 and 1903, before fire suppression techniques began to infiltrate western forests. 
The end of the connection between high water seasons and low-impact wildfire seasons in 2017 could mark a new era. California officials now know fire suppression is bad policy and support prescribed burns, but that doesnt mean the fuel build-up from that policy will just disappear (say nothing of the effects of climate change).
This is bad news for California communities, especially the low income communities of color who are most vulnerable to wildfires. Heavy rains might not be enough to keep them safe anymore.","In California, a wet winter no longer protects landscapes from the kind of intense wildfires the state’s been experiencing lately.

Dell Cameron,"Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday pressed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on its response to Verizon’s throttling of firefighters’ data speeds as they battled a major wildfire in Northern California. The Santa Clara County fire chief, Anthony Bowden, declared last week that Verizon’s decision to throttle the communications of firefighters at a crucial command center during one of the state’s largest wildfires had a “significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services.” Bowden said that Verizon, whom the country fire department had paid for “unlimited data,” hobbled the first responders’ ability to communicate “despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire’s ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.” In a letter Friday, Senator Edward Markey and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo demanded answers from the FCC over what steps it is currently taking to address “critical threats to public safety,” citing its decision to repeal Obama-era net neutrality protections. “To do nothing is unacceptable.” The 2015 Open Internet Order—overturned by the FCC’s Republican majority last winter—reclassified internet providers like Verizon as common carriers under Title II of the Federal Communications Act, granting the FCC regulatory authority that, in this instance, would have allowed the commission to investigate and potential penalize Verizon for its decision. At Chairman Ajit Pai’s direction, the commission abdicated that authority this year. It no longer has the power to establish rules prohibiting Verizon from throttling emergency services, or charging police and fire departments additional fees to maintain their communications at optimal speeds when usage peaks—say, during a wildfire, or an earthquake, or a mass shooting. “The FCC has incorrectly suggested that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could sufficiently fill this void,” wrote Markey and Eschoo, whose congressional districting includes portions of Santa Clara. “We strongly disagree with that assertion.” The FCC did not respond to a request for comment. Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained why the FTC could not fill the FCC’s shoes, noting in a blog post that the FTC cannot act proactively: While proponents of repealing net neutrality will argue the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can manage this specific issue of transparency (they are right to a limited extent), they ignore the most critical differences between FTC power and the now-repealed FCC power. The FTC can only do something after the fact and nothing more. Meaning, in a literal sense, after the fire. And then if this came up again in another state, the FTC would have to wait until after the fire burned there. Notably, the FTC can’t ban throttling and upselling during an emergency. In their letter, the Democratic lawmakers urged the FCC to make use of its Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and investigate the matter, saying that while the FTC may find Verizon’s actions exemplify an “unfair and deceptive practice,” both agencies should use “all of the tools available” to resolve this public safety matter. “To do nothing is unacceptable,” they said.",Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday pressed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on its response to Verizon’s throttling of firefighters’ data speeds as they battled a major wildfire in Northern California.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires. Since early August—wintertime in the southern hemisphere— hundreds of bushfires have flared up in the Australian provinces of Queensland and New South Wales, prompting some local authorities to declare bushfire season open more than a month ahead of schedule. This freak fire lashing has experts extremely worried for what lies ahead as Australia transitions into spring and then summer. “We’re dreading what the rest of the season holds for us,” former New South Wales Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Greg Mullins told Earther. Fueling the flames is a drought that’s been described as the worst in living memory. Last winter was Australia’s hottest on record and the driest since 2002, and for large swaths of eastern and southern Australia, there’s been little rain to slake the thirst since. About 60 percent of Queensland is currently in drought. So is 100 percent of New South Wales, a province that produces a quarter of the nation’s crops. Many of its fields are looking frighteningly brown. This winter has also been unusually warm, and that combination of heat and drought is causing landscapes to light up like a tinderbox when something provides the spark. For the most remote fires, the spark is often lightning, but a large number of the blazes are being started by humans as well. Mullins said farmers often use small, contained fires to burn off weeds or undergrowth outside of fire season, but some of those burns have gotten out of hand this winter. Fire managers, who typically use the winter to conduct prescribed burns that reduce fire fuel, are grappling with a similar issue because of the parched conditions. “At least some of the fires in New South Wales originated as hazard reduction burns that got out of control because it was so flammable,” Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council, told Earther. None of this bodes for the months ahead, especially with the eastern Pacific tipping into an El Niño state, something that normally delivers warmer, drier weather to southern Australia. “We’re looking down the barrel at this insane fire season,” University of Tasmania fire ecologist David Bowman told Earther. “It’s difficult to exaggerate just how extreme the whole thing is.” Bowman, Hughes, and Mullins all pointed to climate change as the key driver of longer, more intense fire seasons in Australia, like the one this year’s lining up to be. A 2015 report by the Australia Climate Council reached a similar conclusion, noting that climate change is upping the likelihood of fire weather by increasing the frequency of heat waves and, in southern Australia, exacerbating drought. For Mullins, who’s been fighting bushfires since the early 1970s and whose father was a firefighter for over 60 years before him, decades of life experience tell him how profoundly the fire season has changed. He recalled how the onset of dangerous fire weather used to be far more predictable. Today, it’s not only harder to say when a fire outbreak will occur, but the worst fires are on a scale nobody’s prepared to fight. “It’s the new normal,” Mullins said. “We can’t handle it.”","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires.

Jennings Brown,"A Utah man reportedly spent 30 years building a series of underground bunkers that he hoped would outlive the apocalypse, but half of them couldn’t even survive a wildfire. The system was comprised of four dugouts and cabins built of concrete and corrugated metal, and a few other spots where he stashed his provisions and arsenal of guns and ammunition in trash cans and barrels. All the shelters were illegally built across a 2-mile radius on state and federal property outside of Brian Head, Utah, according to a report from the Associated Press. Two of the shelters burned down in a wildfire last June. “His only intent was to defend what he had there if the end of the world was to come,” Lt. Del Schlosser of the Iron County Sheriff’s Office told AP. Schlosser added that the octogenarian man was preparing for an end-times scenario that could have involved governmental or societal collapse. Authorities have not released the man’s identity, due to an ongoing investigation, but revealed that he lives in the nearby town of Parowan. During a June wildfire that ravaged the area—causing $40 million in damage and destroying 13 on-the-grid homes—firefighters discovered one of the bunkers and cabins after hearing about five minutes of “popping” sounds, according to a release from the Iron County Sheriff’s Office. When firefighters found one of the shelters, they discovered the sounds had been caused by explosive powder. They also found dozens of inactive novelty grenades that had been modified. The man who built the bunkers apparently planned to turn the grenades into useable weapons filled with explosive powder. Days after firefighters discovered the bunkers, FBI bomb technicians investigated and disposed of the weapons and ammunition. Investigators found clues in the shelters that helped them identify the builder. Once authorities contacted the man, he helped them find the rest of his secret spots.

TIM ARANGO,"The National Weather Service had an extreme heat warning in place in Southern California until Saturday night, and officials urged residents to cool off in libraries and city pools. The heat was especially hard on the homeless in Los Angeles, who number in the tens of thousands.

DANA GOLDSTEIN,"But teachers said it was not enough. They have asked for a $10,000 raise, as well as additional funding for local schools and raises for support staff like bus drivers and custodians. About 200 of the state’s 500 school districts shut down on Monday as teachers walked out, defying calls from some parents and administrators for them to be grateful about what they had already received from the state. To pay for the raise, politicians from both parties agreed to increase production taxes on oil and gas, the state’s most prized industry, and institute new taxes on tobacco and motor fuel. It was the first new revenue bill to become law in Oklahoma in 28 years, bucking decades of tax-cut orthodoxy.

Teachers in the state are not eligible for Social Security benefits. Andrew Beaver, 32, a middle school math teacher in Louisville, said he was open to changes in teacher retirement programs, such as potentially asking teachers to work to an older age before drawing down benefits; currently, some Kentucky teachers are eligible for retirement around age 50. But he said he and his colleagues, many of whom have called in sick to protest the bill, were angry about not having a seat at the negotiation table with Mr. Bevin, a Republican, and the Republican majority in the Legislature.

So while gerontologists say the number of documented supercentenarians is around 150, the unverified total may be closer to 1,000. A man who died this year in Chile had claimed to be 121, and a man who died in Indonesia last year said he was 146.

MATT STEVENS,"High summer temperatures have combined with gusty winds, a prolonged, severe drought and an abundance of available fuels — like dry timber, brush and vegetation — to create a dire start to the fire season in the Western United States. Last week, a fire in Northern California burned thousands of acres and destroyed 22 structures, about half of them houses. As of Sunday, more than a dozen major wildfires were also raging in various parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Residents of parts of Huerfano and Costilla Counties were ordered to evacuate. One of the areas evacuated was Forbes Park, which contains more than 3,300 lots of up to to 14 acres. “You all doing O.K. today? Hanging in there?” Mr. Greer asked the residents on Sunday. “We know it’s tough.”","Jesper Joergensen, 52, was charged with arson but the authorities said they do not believe he intentionally started the fire, which covered more than 40,000 acres.",2018-07-02T01:07:37Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Man Faces Arson Charge in Connection With Colorado Wildfire,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/us/colorado-fires-arson-arrest.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/01/us/01WILDFIRES/01WILDFIRES-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,0
TIM ARANGO,"When you are driving through these streets and through these neighborhoods, its kind of Armageddon-like, said Jed Teter, a firefighter with the Los Angeles Fire Department who served in Iraq in 2008 with the Marine Corps Reserves. Same thing in Ramadi. All the trash, all the disarray. At night, when the fires were raging and he was racing to try to spot them, Mr. Spangle was brought back to patrols in Afghanistan. The first night I was out here looking at hot spots, and just how strange the terrain became, being in total darkness without electricity, the experience reminded him of Afghanistan, he said. He was crossing a gully, and the ash made everything look as though it were covered in snow. He came across the burned-out remnants of cars, a fixture of the landscape of war in the Middle East, where any car on the road is a possible weapon packed with explosives. The environments of war and wildfires share a terrifying mixture of randomness and precision. A single ember kicked up by the winds a mile away can land on a house, torching it to the ground, while surrounding homes are left unscathed. Some saw a parallel with the precision-guided bombs delivered by American warplanes, which can take out a single sniper on a roof and not the buildings on either side. But often there is a sense that luck or the grace of God, as one Malibu resident put it Sunday when asked why his house survived while his neighbors homes did not is what explains survival. Travis Wilkerson was a Marine who fought in Iraq in 2007 during the troop surge in Falluja, and also in Afghanistan. For the last five years, he has worked for the Forest Service, and currently serves on a helicopter crew battling fires in remote forests distant from cities and towns. When you walk through an area that has been nuked out, you cant help but go back to the memories of war, he said. The briefings he sits through before going out to fight a fire are peppered with military expressions: aerial assaults, nighttime assaults, a coordinated assault with multiple units. When he sees airplanes circling overhead, as they did near the slopes of Malibu Canyon on Saturday, dropping retardant to slow the fires, he thinks of war.","Streets in Paradise, Calif., were cluttered with fallen utility poles and the burned-out hulks of abandoned cars as a fast-moving wildfire ravaged the town.",2018-11-13T10:00:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Burned-Out Cars, Smoke in the Air, Aerial Assaults, All in California",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/us/california-wildfires-war.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/12/business/00warfire-01/00warfire-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,0
THOMAS FULLER,"Calling forest management a very big problem, he said he had discussed the topic with Mr. Brown. In a Twitter post last weekend, the president said that there is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Experts said the president was wrong to point to forest management many wildfires in California, including the Woolsey Fire in the south, have started in shrub land, not forests. They also point out that forest management in California is largely a federal responsibility; around 60 percent of the 33 million acres of forests in the state is owned by the federal government. Brad Weldon, a carpenter who lives next to the mobile home park that Mr. Trump toured, said he was happy the president had visited. It will open his eyes to what it is, he said. Mr. Weldon, 63, said fires occur regularly during the dry summer months but nothing like the inferno that started Nov. 8. Mr. Weldon described embers larger than basketballs flying past his house and a fire so intense that it roared as loudly as an aircraft engine. When storage sheds holding firearms at a nearby shop selling ammunition caught fire, it set off hundreds of rounds, sending bullets flying. The ground of his house is still littered with casings and slugs. Everything around us was on fire, said Mr. Weldon, who successfully defended his home with a garden hose and five-gallon buckets. He is one of the few residents of Paradise still in the town, which has been evacuated. It was just the presidents second visit to the countrys most populous state since he was elected, underlining the depth of the divide between liberal California and a conservative administration. In campaign rallies before the midterm elections, Mr. Trump and Republican candidates singled out the state as a subject of derision over its high taxes, embrace of sanctuary cities or liberal social policy. Issues like environmental regulation and recreational marijuana use have also become political flash points, and the wildfire was no exception. Last week, as anger swelled in California over the presidents comments blaming forest management, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, called Mr. Trump and described the severity of the fires.","In the incinerated remains of Paradise, the president suggested that forest management was a “very big problem” in California’s wildfire crisis.",2018-11-18T00:34:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Trump, Touring Fire Ruins in California, Repeats Disputed Claim on Forest Management",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/us/trump-california-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/us/politics/18DC-TRUMP1/18DC-TRUMP1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,0

Ed Cara,"It’s not bad enough that the flu virus is tearing the human species a new one this winter. No, it has to go after the only good thing left in our snot-ridden lives: The Dogs. But while the idea of deadly dog flu spreading like wildfire through our nation’s kennels and shelters, as recent headlines suggest, might tug at our heartstrings, it probably isn’t as bad as some media outlets are making it out to be. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the South Bay area has seen around 50 possible cases in a two-week span, according to a local vet. More recently, the San Francisco SPCA confirmed that cases have been seen in the area. And two cases were detected in Canada last December—the first confirmed cases ever seen in the country. But there are no signs of a massive, deadly dog flu outbreak spreading across America. A Fox News article this month did report that cases of dog flu have “spread to at least 46 states”—a startling fact offered with exactly zero sourcing. Digging into it further, it appears to be referencing research compiled by Merck Animal Health, the creators of the only available dog flu vaccine on the market. But the article’s wording doesn’t make clear that Merck’s figures are accounting for all cases reported since 2007. In other words, while dog flu has been spotted in 46 states at some point over the past decade, that doesn’t mean it’s making dogs’ lives everywhere a living heck right this moment. Perhaps unsurprisingly, other outlets have credulously cited the Fox News “report” as evidence that dog flu is running wild across the country. Overhype aside, vets do worry about dog flu. It’s an emerging, highly contagious disease. It’s caused by two different strains of the influenza virus (type A) that have only recently started to infect dogs, meaning the species as a whole is especially vulnerable to catching and spreading it. The first strain, discovered in 2004, mutated from a H3N8 flu virus that jumped across the species barrier from horses; the second strain, found in 2015, is closely related to a H3N2 strain originally found in birds that has legitimately become widespread in parts of Korea and China. Edward Dubovi, a professor of veterinary medicine at Cornell University and one of the first researchers to track dog flu when it sprouted up, tells me that we probably are underestimating the number of cases. While only around 2,000 dogs in the U.S. have ever tested positive for dog flu (there are about 70 million dogs total in the country), according to Cornell’s data, the true number during a 2015 Chicago outbreak alone may have reached as high as 5,000. “When one dog in a kennel of 20 is positive, no further testing is done,” he says. But so far, dog flu outbreaks here have been sporadic, often caused by sick dogs imported from China and Korea. And while it does have a mortality rate of five to eight percent, about 80 percent of dogs who catch it suffer no more than a mild case of the sniffles. Neither strain appears to infect people (though H3N2 does seem to sicken cats). Now, all of that can definitely change, since flu viruses rapidly mutate. But for now, it’s more something to keep a watchful eye on than to panic about. “Is the next plane from Korea or China bringing in a more deadly strain?” Dubovi asks rhetorically. At least one Washington-based veterinarian, Mark Kummer, has denounced the recent headlines, taking to his office’s blog to quell the fears of his customers. In the post, he says he reached out to the Washington State Veterinary Medical association along with several testing labs to confirm that no confirmed cases have been seen in the state in more than two years. And he called dog flu a “low-level” problem that merits no drastic action, like widespread vaccination, right now.","It’s not bad enough that the flu virus is tearing the human species a new one this winter.

SARAH MASLIN NIR,"Burn care is an intricate and multistep process. Doctors must not only heal the wounds with skin grafts and surgeries, but keep the body in balance as it recovers. From the moment burn victims arrive at the hospital they are hooked up to intravenous fluids. That is because the immune system responds to charred skin as a foreign invader like its a splinter, Dr. Greenhalgh said. The surge of inflammation puts the rest of the body at risk of dehydration, in a sense, from the inside out. Skin from Mr. Blevinss hip was grafted onto his hands. For some with large burns, artificial or donor skin, which the hospital keeps frozen in a bank, must be used as a temporary patch until the body can grow enough skin of its own for the graft. Throughout recovery, patients are frequently connected to feeding tubes for a period because their metabolism kicks into high gear: Even lying in hospital beds, patients burn calories about 1.5 times as fast, according to Dr. Greenhalgh, as the body goes into overdrive trying to repair itself. Mr. Blevins was released on Nov. 15, but returned Nov. 29 after infection set in, forcing amputation. Stroking Mr. Blevinss hair as he lay on the bed in their home, his swaddled hands propped on pillows, Ms. Sykes described how he had saved her from a life of methamphetamine addiction, bringing her from Yakima, Wash., to California about five years ago for a cleaner life. Both are recovering addicts, replacing drugs with the joy of motorcycling side by side. Now they fear that the narcotics Mr. Blevins has been prescribed for pain could send them spiraling. The last thing I want to do is come in as a burn patient, and leave as a heroin addict, Mr. Blevins said. Mr. Blevinss jobs as an alarm technician and a home health care provider took the couple from living in a car in 2014, to the little creeper-covered home they share with five cats and three dogs in Los Molinos, about 45 minutes drive northwest from Paradise. They now fear they will lose it. Unlike residents of the fire site, they are ineligible for much of the federal and state aid pouring into the area, because their house did not burn down. Then there are the nightmares. Days revolve around mitigating Mr. Blevinss anxiety a scented candle his fiancée lit set off a panic attack, he said and his twice-daily bandage changes. It is a painstaking process that takes nearly three hours as Ms. Sykes cuts away gauze, removes dead tissue and rebandages each finger. A few days before his amputation surgery, Mr. Blevins said that in some ways, he felt blessed. News reports of his condition led to a reunion with estranged family members, he said, and his bond with Ms. Sykes has deepened. Others, he knows, have lost far more. I pray to God that the families that have lost will heal, Mr. Blevins said. The same way I have got to heal physically, they have to heal emotionally.","Bill Blevins with his fiancée, Mary Sykes, at the U.C.

Colin Lecher,"When news broke this week that Verizon was slowing California firefighters’ data speeds during a wildfire crisis, there was a predictable outrage over the company’s actions. In a legal brief filed by Santa Clara County fire officials against the FCC’s net neutrality repeal, emergency responders explained how Verizon dropped their connection to a crawl, even after being informed of the emergency. The company didn’t restore the speeds until the fire department paid for a better plan. While Verizon admitted that it made a customer service policy mistake, it was also quick to deny one point: “This situation has nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court,” a spokesperson said in the first line of the company’s response to the incident. “This situation has nothing to do with net neutrality.” Verizon, to its point, was throttling “unlimited” customers in less extreme circumstances who hit certain data thresholds well before last year’s net neutrality repeal. The legal brief also says the filers are not arguing that the throttling would necessarily have been a violation of the previous net neutrality rules, which were passed in 2015. Still, the filers of the brief do argue that the problem is about net neutrality in a different sense. The throttling may not have been a violation of the previous rules, but the brief, also filed by attorneys general in 22 states, argues that the FCC failed to take public safety into account when it passed its repeal. “That was part of the FCC’s original mandate: it needs to be thinking about public safety in its rulemaking,” says Santa Clara County counsel James Williams. As the FCC is required to consider the interests of public safety, the FCC’s repeal is therefore “arbitrary and capricious,” the brief argues. The throttling, the filers say, also showed how service providers will be willing to act in ways that benefit themselves financially in the absence of regulations. “We should expect nothing less than an ISP to act in its economic interest — that’s its job,” Williams says. (Verizon said in its statement that its practice is to not enforce slowdowns during emergencies and that it has removed similar restrictions in other emergency situations.) Others have pointed out that, under the previous rules, customers had a path to complain to the FCC when they believed throttling was unfair. In this case, that route was largely re-directed to the FTC, a structure that’s been criticized as insufficient. The FCC limited consumers’ ability to complain Gigi Sohn, who worked on the net neutrality rules under the previous FCC chairman, argues that there is some question about whether Verizon’s actions would have violated the 2015 rules. But, regardless, she believes the repeal eliminated a route that would have given them recourse to make an expedited case in front of the agency, which could have resolved the dispute more quickly. Instead, Verizon and the fire officials had a frantic, lengthy back-and-forth over email, an exchange that appeared in the brief. “If the net neutrality rules were still in place,” Sohn says, “trust me, I don’t think there would’ve been a monthlong conversation about this.”","When news broke this week that Verizon was slowing California firefighters’ data speeds during a wildfire, there was a predictable outrage over the company’s actions.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Californias largest utility is in a death spiral in wake of the deadly Camp Fire last fall. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. (PG&amp;E) announced Monday itd be filing for bankruptcy on January 29.
This news comes after CEO Geisha Williams stepped down from her position Sunday and just days after Moodys downgraded PG&amp;Es credit rating to junk status. So yeah, things arent looking too bright for the company, which may be responsible for the devastating Camp Fire that devoured the city of Paradise back in November. The wildfire killed some 86 people and injured countless others (including two incarcerated firefighters), making it the deadliest blaze in Californias history.
A federal judge announced last week hes planning to order the utility to inspect its electrical grid and clean up the trees near and around its lines. If ordered, the utility must meet these demands by summer when the states wildfire season officially begins.
This is hardly PG&amp;Es first rodeo with wildfires. In fact, its infrastructure has sparked at least 1,500, per Wall Street Journal reports, including a dozen Northern California fires in October 2017. Together, wildfires from 2017 and 2018 have resulted in some $30 billion in potential liability costs for the company. PG&amp;E could even face murder charges for lives lost during these deadly events.
Following PG&amp;Es bankruptcy announcement, its already-shit stock crashed nearly 50 percent this morning. Its hoping that filing for bankruptcy can help it bounce back. So far, the company doesnt expect this move to impact its 15 million customers.
The people affected by the devastating Northern California wildfires are our customers, our neighbors, and our friends, and we understand the profound impact the fires have had on our communities and the need for PG&amp;E to continue enhancing our wildfire mitigation efforts, said interim CEO John Simon in a press release. We remain committed to helping them through the recovery and rebuilding process.
But the company may be nearing its end. The state is considering whether to break PG&amp;E up into smaller pieces, or even take it public. No matter what happens, customers shouldnt face significant power outages, per the San Francisco Chronicles analysis.
Whatever happens to PG&amp;E, California is set to become drier and warmer in the face of climate change, further increasing the risk of wildfires.

Shannon Liao,"Slack was late to the world of workplace messaging apps. When it arrived in in 2013, it didn’t appear to offer much that was new — chat rooms and direct messaging were already available in a host of apps. But its co-founder Stewart Butterfield cannily presented it as a powerful alternative to email and, over time, as a command hub for the workplace that would integrate all the other software a company uses into a single interface. Slack spread like wildfire, and today is worth at least $7 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. Now the company plans to make its stock available for purchase: the company filed its initial public offering today. It is expected to become one of the most valuable tech companies to go public since Snapchat. It didn’t get this far without some carnage. Slack beat out tons of messaging apps on its way to the New York Stock Exchange, skillfully incorporating features that are fun (unlimited custom emoji reactions to messages) alongside those that are simply necessary (records retention features for large corporations). One app it didn’t necessarily beat yet and that is arguably its biggest rival: Microsoft Teams. Microsoft has bundled Teams with Office 365 subscriptions, which becomes useful if you still use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, instead of the Google alternatives. By making Teams free for Office 365 users, Microsoft has essentially made the service into an easy default for many, and that could pose a challenge to Slack. It’s also hidden just exactly how many users are on Teams, although we know 329,000 organizations are on the service, as of September last year. Here are some of the rival apps that have come — and in some cases, gone — since Slack came around. Internet Relay Chat The grandfather of internet chat is even older than AOL Instant Messenger. It’s an open protocol, and so it’s still alive and kicking — but it just never achieved the scale and popularity that Slack has, perhaps because it was just a little rough around the edges. Skype In the early 2010s, Skype was a common choice for workplaces to send quick messages when needed. But as a sort of all-purpose messaging app, Skype never really made adjustments for its enterprise users and seriously lacked integrations with other services. For over a decade, it didn’t even have the ability to record calls. I remember Skype fondly for letting you place international calls for a couple of dollars, but it was never great for remote work. Its animated emojis were also super corny. HipChat HipChat has been literally eaten by Slack, which acquired it from Atlassian in July of last year. Slack looked very similar to HipChat when it launched — but HipChat was slow to add third-party integrations, and lacked the free version that made Slack a hit with tiny startups. Atlassian attempted to launch a true Slack competitor called Stride in 2017, but gave up on it after it got little traction. Google Hangouts Chat Google Hangouts Chat remains a cult favorite thanks to its unlimited messages, easy access to other Google services, and more visible discussion threads. But as a lightweight chat client, Google Hangouts Chat was never going to compete with an enterprise-grade solution like Slack. (That was supposed to be the job of Google Hangouts Meet, which is a different thing that definitely... exists.) Facebook’s Workplace Facebook launched a version of its social network for the office in 2016.

Mark Kaufman,"The burning forest just outside of Yosemite National Park in California has choked the air inside the park's iconic valley marked by imposing granite walls that stretch hundreds of feet into the polluted sky. The West's fire season is now well underway, and it has been further stoked by heat waves and especially parched land. As a result of the now over 36,000-acre Ferguson fire, Yosemite — one of the most heavily-visited national parks in the country — has been inundated with tiny bits of particulate pollution, covering the park in a thick haze. SEE ALSO: California hit with two heat waves in less than a month. Here's why it matters. As of Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Forest Service assigned the Yosemite valley an ""Unhealthy"" air quality rating, meaning that everyone should reduce time outside, and people who are especially sensitive to this kind of pollution should avoid prolonged exposure. Yosemite's Half Dome peak can be seen at the top left, but the valley beyond is thick with wildfire haze.

Breathing this particle-laden air over time has been repeatedly tied to heart and lung diseases, particularly the accelerated hardening of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels. Although the park's visitor center remains open, Yosemite's site says that ""smoke may be heavy at times,"" and to ""expect poor air quality &amp; visibility."" The smoky Yosemite Valley Tuesday morning, as picked up by park webcams. Image: Webcam by Yosemite Conservancy A webcam maintained by the Yosemite Conservancy shows live views of the smoke-choked valley as the fires continue to rage. California has already experienced a busy fire season, as large fires returned to California's wine country in early July. This follows on the heels of 2017's terrible season — the state's worst fire year on record — which burned 1.2 million acres of land, an area the size of Delaware. This included December's destructive Thomas Fire, which burned less than 70 miles from Los Angeles. It proved to be the largest fire in California's history, burning an area nearly the size of sprawling Los Angeles itself. Since the early 1980s — when more reliable, modern record keeping began — the Forest Service notes that the amount of land that burns each year has generally doubled. Mismanaged forests and irresponsible behavior in fire country are both to blame, but every fire today is further enhanced by climate change-boosted temperatures, which parch Western land, turning it to tinder.","The burning forest just outside of Yosemite National Park in California has choked the air inside the park's iconic valley marked by imposing granite walls that stretch hundreds of feet into the polluted sky.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The president did not specify which federal payments might be withheld. But California itself allocated $256 million this year toward lowering wildfire risk. In recent years the Forest Service has tried to rectify its past forest-management practices by conducting more prescribed or controlled burns to get rid of dead vegetation that could fuel future wildfires. But its budget has been overwhelmed by firefighting costs. Congress passed a budget this year designed to fix some of those problems (and create a dedicated firefighting fund), but it will not take effect until next year. Mr. Trump may also be referencing a debate put forward by logging interests, which argue that selective cutting would reduce Californias wildfire problem. A century of fire suppression allowed flammable material twigs and brush to build up in forests nationwide. As fires have gotten bigger and more destructive, the administration and Republicans in Congress have supported calls by the timber industry to clear out potential fuel by letting the land be logged. In an opinion piece published this year in USA Today, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed Californias wildfires on environmentalists who oppose logging. He wrote: Every year we watch our forests burn, and every year there is a call for action. Yet, when action comes, and we try to thin forests of dead and dying timber, or we try to sustainably harvest timber from dense and fire-prone areas, we are attacked with frivolous litigation from radical environmentalists who would rather see forests and communities burn than see a logger in the woods. It is true that California has a lot of dead timber 129 million trees spread across 8.9 million acres, according to a Forest Service estimate. But the dead trees themselves do not catch fire easily, because they are too big, said Chad T. Hanson, the principal ecologist at the John Muir Project of the nonprofit Earth Island Institute.","On Twitter, the president claimed that the state’s wildfire woes are a result of poor forest management.

SIMON ROMERO and THOMAS FULLER,"We had dry winds and low humidities and it extended that dry period, Mr. Rasch said. It also created ideal fire conditions. Driven by extreme winds, the Camp Fire swept through the town of Paradise on Nov. 8, burning more than 153,000 acres and destroying more than 13,500 homes. The death toll, already at 81, is likely to rise. The fire is now about 80 percent contained. Years of drought have parched Californias forests, killing more than 100 million trees this decade. Although a wet winter two years ago helped fill the states reservoirs, most of California is classified as being in a moderate drought. Now with the storm, meteorologists are worried that heavy rain could trigger mudslides. Mr. McLean of Cal Fire said firefighters have cut paths into steep hillsides to help arrest the fire and are now concerned with the stability of paths and dangers to those working in the area. Youve gone from dirt to mud, he said. The rains will also flush the toxic ash and debris from the fires into storm drains and waterways. In the tent encampment in Chico, there was both despair and resolve. James Steen, a roofer and truck driver who was unemployed when the wildfire destroyed his home in a rural area near the town of Paradise, said he planned to remain in his tent.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) A California utility company said its crews found a damaged transmission tower and holes in a power pole at separate locations near the site where the Camp Fire started. More than a month after the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history broke out, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. released a more detailed account of outages it experienced that day. In a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission, PG&amp;E said one of its employees called 911 on November 8 -- the day the deadly wildfire began -- after spotting flames in the vicinity of a high-voltage tower near the town of Pulga in Butte County. That fire was reported almost 15 minutes after the utility experienced a transmission line outage at the same location, the company said. It was also around the same time the Camp Fire broke out. The electric utility had disclosed in a regulatory filing last month that it ""experienced an outage"" on a transmission line in Butte County about 15 minutes before the wildfire began but had not released additional details. PG&amp;E said in its Tuesday letter that inspectors later discovered that a hook connecting part of the transmission line and the transmission tower was broken. They also found a flash mark on the tower. The company also detailed a second outage at another location. That incident was reported a few miles away from the first outage and about 15 minutes after the wildfire started. When crews went to check the outage a day later, the letter states, they ""observed that the pole and other equipment was on the ground with bullets and bullet holes at the break point of the pole and on the equipment."" Meredith E. Allen, PG&amp;E's senior director of regulatory relations, explained that details about the incidents are preliminary and they remain under investigation. ""The cause of these incidents has not been determined and may not be fully understood until additional information becomes available, including information that can only be obtained through examination and testing of the equipment retained by CAL FIRE,"" Allen wrote to regulators. The Camp Fire burned through more than 153,000 acres in Butte County, killing at least 85 people and destroying thousands of structures. It was contained November 25 after becoming the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency, has said the cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation. On Tuesday, PG&amp;E said ""the loss of life, homes and businesses in the Camp Fire is truly devastating."" ""Our focus continues to be on assessing our infrastructure to further enhance safety, restoring electric and gas service where possible, and helping customers begin to recover and rebuild. Throughout our service area, we are committed to doing everything we can to further reduce the risk of wildfire,"" the company said in a statement. PG&amp;E made its findings public weeks after a federal judge ordered the company to explain any potential role it played in causing the deadly Camp Fire and any other major wildfires in the state. The company has until Dec. 31 to submit written answers to federal officials, according to court documents.

But new aerial imagery released by the city of Redding puts the massive wildfire in a landscape context, revealing the both the power and capriciousness of one the most destructive fires in California history. Firefighters and sheriffs used drones to better assess the damage wrought by the fire and to piece together the history of what happened two weeks ago when it stormed Redding, a city of 90,000, overnight. The blaze has killed at least eight, burned 178,752 acres, and razed 1,599 structures. As of Friday, it was 49 percent contained. The fire swept in from the west of the city where it burned largely in tracts of forest around Whiskeytown Lake. The images from there show charred trees and denuded hillsides. Whiskeytown Lake.

George Dvorsky,"In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee. Alarmingly, winds are expected to pick up in the coming days, making a bad situation potentially worse. The latest California wildfire started in early Monday evening in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, spreading quickly to more than 15 square miles in just a few hours. The fires, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions, are devouring vegetation that hasn’t burned in decades, according to fire officials. To date, around 10,000 people have had to flee their homes. It’s a destructive and dangerous climax to what has been a devastating wildfire season in the state. As of late yesterday, the blaze had burned over 100 square miles in areas just north of Los Angeles and east of Santa Barbara. Currently, there are five active major blazes. Some 150 structures have burned down, including the 82-bed Vista del Mar Hospital in northwestern Ventura. Officials say the number of homes damaged by the wildfires is likely much higher. The wildfire is also causing mass power outages and water disruptions. Around 43,000 homes are currently without power (with more expected), and the Casitas Municipal Water District has advised residents of the city of Ventura, Upper Ojai Valley, Casitas Springs, and Foster Park to boil their tap water for about a minute before drinking and cooking. Without power, some water pumping systems and fire hydrants are inoperable, complicating matters for fire crews. The largest of the five wildfires, the Thomas Fire, has reached and skipped across the 101 freeway just north of Ventura, burning through oil fields, and reaching the Pacific Ocean. This fire is moving extremely quickly, torching an acre per second. As of Tuesday, the Thomas Fire has spanned 50,000 acres, and is listed as “zero percent contained” by fire officials. No fatalities have been reported to date, but three firefighters in LA were hurt and taken to a hospital where they’re listed in stable condition. “This is life in Southern California. This is where we live,” Mark Gennaro, who’s home of 12 years was destroyed, told The Washington Post. “I stand on that back hill and I see all that brush and I’m like, ‘Something’s gonna happen at some point.’” About 150,000 people in LA have been affected by evacuation orders for the Creek Fire near Sylmar and Lake View Terrace. Curfews have been enacted in the city of Ventura from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am. In Ventura, more than a quarter of its 100,000 residents have been told to evacuate. And it’s not over yet. After a brief respite late yesterday, the Santa Ana winds are expected to pick up today and tomorrow, gusting as fast as 35 to 50 mph, according to National Weather Service. This will likely fuel the fires even further, and possibly start new fires as it blows embers and ash elsewhere. The dry Santa Ana winds are caused by high pressure in the Great Basin and lower pressure off the coast. In the previous two years, rains have arrived prior to this stage in the wildfire season, but the region hasn’t seen any rain in the past three months. California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared state of emergency for Ventura County, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said “We expect to be out here all week fighting and containing this fire,” Some 1,100 personnel are currently battling the wildfires. “We’ve been watching all these disasters on TV, you really don’t think about when it happens to you, and what do you pack in that moment?,” said Ventura resident Samantha Wells-Zuniga on KABC news. “Now, everything that I have, except for my lovely family, is gone.” Beginning Monday night, dry conditions combined with the most intense Santa Ana wind event of the… Read more Read [ CNN, LA Times, Washington Post ]","In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee.

While we’ve recently a bit preoccupied with Florence’s record-setting rain and the strongest storm on Earth playing Jenga with Hong Kong’s skyscrapers, British Columbia has quietly continued to burn. As of Monday, 3.3 million acres of the province had burned, nearly 10 times higher than the annual average over the past 10 years. This has been British Columbia’s worst wildfire season on record, besting a mark set just last year. Thank you, climate change. While cooler weather has helped tamp down flames, there are still 11 fires of note and dozens of other blazes the provincial fire service is battling. And one of those fires appears to have whipped up a firenado, the most on-brand weather disaster of 2018. Video captured by firefighter M. C. Schidlowsky shows the firenado sucking up 100 feet of hose, the white hose line disappearing into billowing smoke. Schidlowsky said in a caption on the original video that the hose melted as the firenado raged for 45 minutes. It’s unclear which of the 11 fires this is from, but there are a few burning in the vicinity of the Vanderhoof, which is where the original video is tagged. This isn’t the first firenado of 2018. That distinction belongs to a whirling frenzy of flames and wind whipped up by California’s Carr Fire that killed at least one firefighter. Scientists are studying it intensely to understand what led to such a large, powerful firenado to form. The British Columbia firenado doesn’t appear to anywhere near as large as the Carr Fire’s version, but it sure screwed over the crew out there fighting it.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","An incredibly dangerous wildfire has exploded to life in Northern California. The Camp Fire has spurred numerous evacuations in Butte County as it races across the landscape. The fire was first reported at 6:30 a.m. PT, and grew to at least 5,000 acres in three hours. Californias state fire agency reported the fire is very dynamic and that [s]trong winds are moving the fire quickly. The official estimate of acreage burned is almost certainly on the low end, as the fire is spreading at an astonishing 80 acres per minute. Smoke from the blaze is already descending on the Bay Area some 150 miles away. In addition to powerful winds, humidity is in the single digits, drying out vegetation. That has created what Redding TV meteorologist Rob Elvington called unprecedented conditions for this time of year, providing ample fuel for the Camp Fire to run wild. All this has led to a growing list of evacuations. Video depicting the evacuation shows traffic moving in a contraflow pattern, with cars flowing in one direction on both sides of the a highway to get people out of harms way and stalled traffic amidst a hellscape of smoke and flames. Paradise, a town of 27,000, sits directly in the Camp Fires path. Its rapid growth and early-morning arrival means that residents didnt have much time to leave or firefighters time to prepare, leaving them to play a game of catchup against an extremely active fire. And the gridlock coupled with the rapidly-growing fire has reportedly led some to abandon their vehicles and shelter in place. Meanwhile firefighters operating bulldozers have been authorized to push cars off the road to clear a path and try to beat back the flames. In short, this is a chaotic nightmare situation. Unfortunately its also one that has become all too familiar to Californians in recent years. The largest fire in state history set Southern California ablaze in 2017. It held the record for less than a year, though, as the Ranch Fire took its place in the record books this year. California has had four of its top 10 most destructive fires burn in the past two years, the most recent being the Carr Fire that destroyed entire neighborhoods in Redding, a city of 90,000 in the northern part of the state. Climate change coupled with growing number of people living where the forest meets the city has increased the risk of these types of fires. And humans are setting more blazes than ever. Its enough to make one wonder how much longer we can keep building in harms way.",An incredibly dangerous wildfire has exploded to life in Northern California.

Tom McKay,"Wildfires in California have continued to ravage large portions of the state, with the Thomas fire in southern California now entering its 13th day and claiming over 267,500 acres of land, CNN reported. The wildfire is now the third-largest in California history and is just 40 percent contained, with over 8,400 firefighters and $110 million in resources deployed to fight it. Now-familiar scenes posted by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department and others this weekend showed Ventura and Santa Barbara counties descending into a nightmarish state, just as with a prior spate of wildfires elsewhere in California earlier this year. Ventura resident Patricia Rye told KEYT she had woken up in the middle of the night after her son-in-law arrived and did not have time to grab anything before the fire approached her building. “I didn’t have time to take anything,” Rye said. “My wallet, or any of my personal things. I literally left with the clothes on my back. If I had been thinking I would have got into my car, but I wasn’t thinking so my car was there.” Elsewhere, CNN reported, thousands of people were evacuated and animals at the Santa Barbara Zoo were loaded into cages in anticipation of a possible emergency. The Thomas fire could be on track to become the largest fire in recorded California history, the L.A. Times reported, potentially surpassing both the 2003 Cedar fire (273,000 acres) and the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire (300,000 acres). UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the paper that half of the largest wildfires in the state since 1861 have occurred in the last 15 years, with humans primarily to blame—both as a result of arson or accidental fires being started by them or due to persistent regional drought, which is linked to climate change. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” Keeley said. “... What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Associate director of the Center for Environmental Journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder Michael Kodas wrote in the L.A. Times that prior to 1995, the U.S. averaged one “mega-fire” of more than 100,000 acres a year. California now experiences one such fire a year on its own, while the U.S. averages nearly 10. Elsewhere in the paper, concerned readers urged fellow residents to stop building homes or developments in the wildland-urban border zones where the fires spread. [ CNN / L.A.

Stephen J. Bronner,"April 23, 2018 6 min read In this ongoing column, The Digest, Entrepreneur.com News Director Stephen J. Bronner speaks with food entrepreneurs and executives to see what it took to get their products into the mouths of customers. Michael Palmer says that he always joked with his family that one day they'd own McConnell's, a 70-year-old ice cream brand beloved in their hometown of Santa Barbara. That actually came to be -- about a year after a wildfire destroyed their house in 2008. ""In the wake of that, we were trying to figure out what to do,"" says Palmer, who made wine and worked in branding full-time before taking over the company. ""We were approached by the owners of McConnell's, which was probably headed towards bankruptcy, about the possibility of taking it on. So rather than rebuilding our house, we rebuilt the old dairy."" Related: How This Former Lawyer and Investor Built a Multimillion-Dollar Health Food Company That Now Sells to 10,000 Stores Image Credit: McConnell's Ice Cream The Palmers used their insurance money, along with other funds, to rebuild the dairy operation and purchase new equipment. They opened a handful of scoop shops in California (there's four currently with plans to expand to seven by the end of the year) and worked on boosting the company's small retail operation. The Palmers also utilized their connections in the food world -- his wife Eva Ein is a chef -- and partnered with them to sell its ice creams in restaurants in California. Unlike most other ice cream brands, McConnell's is also the manufacturer, meaning its makes the cream and is responsible for the ingredients that go into its products. Retailing between $8 and $10 a pint, McConnell's is now sold in more than 2,000 stores throughout the U.S., including Whole Foods. The company also ships its products nationwide through its website and runs a pint of the month club. It has made more than 100 flavors with at least 40 on the market at a given time. The most popular flavors include Eureka Lemon &amp; Marionberries and Sea Salt Cream &amp; Cookies. Entrepreneur spoke with Palmer about growing a legacy brand, the right way to approach growth and his thoughts on taking outside funding. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. How did you approach retail distribution for the brand? It was less about knocking down a national distributor or retailer and more about trying to appeal to regions that would appreciate our product for what it is and what makes it different. We're family owned, we're not private-equity backed. It wouldn't have made a lot of sense to just blow it up. We want to concentrate on the quality of the product. What can entrepreneurs learn from your experience with retailers? There's a real tendency for entrepreneurs to want to get big and achieve critical mass fast. The first thing you have to do is learn your business and product and figure out what makes that product unique and then how to bring that to market in a way that's compelling. If you're just selling what everyone else is selling, it's a very hard thing to do. It all comes out of a great story, because that's what allows people to emotionally connect with what you're doing. Image Credit: McConnell's Ice Cream Related: This Former Google Exec Shares Why Leaders Get Happiness Wrong and Why Meditation No Longer Makes Sense What has been your biggest challenge so far and how were you able to overcome it? Like every small business, cash is always the thing, or lack thereof, that will crush you. There have been any number of challenges in running this business. We just built the new dairy and it was a massive project that took the better part of two and a half years. During that time, we had any number of challenges in addition to just paying the bank loan. Why not seek outside investment? It's certainly possible that at some point we will consider outside investment. We do get approached with some frequency; we've come very close. Taking outside money is a great thing for some companies, because for so many businesses, the answer is scale. They think that sales are going to help everything, and for some small businesses, particularly in the first few years, great sales do overcome a lot. They overcome a lack of rigor and management, because if you've got a lot of money coming in, you can make more mistakes. But there are a lot of ways to grow. There's something to be said for a healthy business that's growing steadily and got positive cash flow. What's your goal for the business in the next three years? So much of this business is a race to the bottom, for profit’s sake. While profit is critical -- and we must continue to grow -- our goal has always been the same: to make the finest ice creams and dairy products in the business. It’s important to make the process be the thing. We believe and hope this is what distinguishes us and that people will over time recognize what makes McConnell’s so special, and this will pave the way for a successful future. We have also been approached about a book, and we’re slowly working on that. Image Credit: McConnell's Ice Cream Related: How 2 Friends Quit Their Jobs and Pursued Their Dreams of Purple Ice Cream That Gets Thousands of Likes on Instagram Are there parallels between ice cream and wine? Food in general tends to attract certain people, and it's usually not the people who are attracted to technology, for instance. There's a nurturing thing about food. You're giving something you've made to someone else. I love the idea of growing things, whether growing grapes, which we then turn into wine, or taking a raw material like cream and then turning it into ice cream. Can you tell me something interesting about yourself that you think helped you launch and grow this business? I am stubborn. I tend to look at the landscape of something I'm about to get involved in and learn as much as I can within reason about it. But you can only learn so much, until you're actually in the trenches doing that thing. Once I've made my decision, I stick to that decision until I'm convinced by my wife or more frequently my daughter that I'm wrong. There is no entrepreneur that I've ever met who's had it easy. Everything looks like an overnight success. There's no such thing. You have to be diligent and committed. There's a lot more reasons why you can't do this than why you can. There are a lot easier ways to make a living.

Deborah Hastings,"An off-duty Border Patrol agent who admitted accidentally starting a massive wildfire during a gender-reveal party must pay $220,000 in restitution, a federal judge ruled. Dennis Dickey pleaded guilty Friday to a misdemeanor charge of causing a fire without a permit. Nearly 800 firefighters battled the 47,000-acre wildfire for about a week last year. The Arizona blaze, which came to be known as the Sawmill Fire, started when Dickey shot a high-velocity firearm at target containing Tannerite, an explosive substance that was supposed send colored powder into the air, thereby declaring his baby's sex. Instead, the explosive started a wildfire. Dickey summoned authorities, but the fire quickly grew out of control, fed by dried ground cover and dry conditions. Cost of battling the fire totaled about $8.2 million, authorities said. Under his plea agreement, Dickey will pay $100,000 from his retirement fund and the remaining amount in monthly payments of $500 for the next 200 years. He also will ordered to serve five years probation when he is sentenced on Oct. 9, authorities said. ""It was a complete accident, "" Dickey, 37, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Leslie A. Bowman in court Friday. ""I feel absolutely horrible about it. It was probably one of the worst days of my life,"" the Arizona Daily Star reported.

Joe Evans,"Arizona border agent Dennis Dickey will have to pay a massive fine after he and his wife's gender reveal party started a wildfire that racked up $8.2 million in damages. An Arizona border agent is facing a huge fine after he accidentally started a fire that burned 47,000 acres during a gender reveal party for his wife, according to Tuscon.com. Dennis Dickey will be required to pay $220,000 in fines after pleading guilty in federal court to charges of starting a fire without a proper permit. According to Dickey’s plea agreement, he’s required to pay $100,000 in restitution when he is officially sentenced Oct. 9, along with another $120,000 in monthly $500 payments for the next 20 years. Dickey will spend 5 years on probation as well. The fire started after Dickey ignited Tannerite — a highly explosive substance designed to light and burn when shot — according to court documents from U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Brent Robinson. The target was filled with either blue or pink powder to celebrate and announce the gender of Dickey and his wife’s child, Dickey’s attorney Sean Chapman told the Arizona Daily Star. “Dickey immediately reported the fire to law enforcement, cooperated, and admitted that he started the fire,” Robinson wrote in official court documents. The ensuing explosion was caught on film. Tannerite has been connected to several wildfires in other Western U.S. states. The targets have even been banned in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming. According to Colorado Public Radio, U.S. Attorney John Walsh said of Tannerite targets, “When you shoot these, they blow up, and they blow up pretty spectacularly, which is why they’re popular.” The targets have caused three fires in Colorado and a total of 16 in 8 western states since 2012. Walsh says that it’s cost nearly $33 million to fight those fires. “The reality is you don’t want to have on your conscious [sic] starting a huge forest fire,” he said. “You don’t want on your conscious [sic] or frankly the possibility of bearing legal responsibility for a forest fire that once it gets going ends up burning houses, burning businesses burning not only the forest but puts firefighters at risk. And God forbid that someone actually gets injured or killed.” Border agent to pay $220k for Tucson-area wildfire sparked at gender-reveal party https://t.co/HifawVkH4g pic.twitter.com/Irm3OKeykC — Arizona Daily Star (@TucsonStar) September 29, 2018 The massive fire that Dickey started, deemed the Sawmill Fire, burned for nearly a week in 2017 and ended up costing about $8.2 million. U.S. Magistrate Judge Leslie A. Chapman allowed Dickey to borrow from his retirement fund to pay the upcoming $100,000 fine. Chapman declined to order Dickey to pay back the $8.2 million full cost of the fire, comparing it to”getting blood from a stone.” Chapman also felt that since Dickey had not set the fire on purpose, he would not be charged with arson. The charge that Dickey ended up with was a petty offense, and the judge said that he fully expected Dickey to be able to keep his job as a Border Patrol agent. While no injuries were reported as a result of the fire, and no buildings were destroyed — some Arizona neighborhoods were forced to evacuate. “It was a complete accident,” Dickey said in court. “I feel absolutely horrible about it. It was probably one of the worst days of my life.”",The Inquisitr Border Patrol Agent Given $220K Fine After Gender Reveal Party Starts 47000 Acre Wildfire The Inquisitr Arizona border agent Dennis Dickey will have to pay a massive fine after him and his wife's gender reveal party started a wildfire that racke…,2018-10-01T16:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inquisitr.com'}",Border Patrol Agent Given $220K Fine After Gender Reveal Party Starts 47000 Acre Wildfire - The Inquisitr,https://www.inquisitr.com/5094315/border-patrol-agent-given-220k-fine-after-gender-reveal-party-starts-47000-acre-wildfire/,https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arizona-Wildfire.jpg,,Inquisitr.com,wildfire,0
Reuters Editorial,"TAOS, New Mexico (Reuters) - A man was arrested on Saturday on charges of starting a forest fire in Colorado that has destroyed structures and forced hundreds to evacuate their homes in one of dozens of wildfires raging across the drought-hit U.S. southwest. Jesper Joergensen, 52, was taken into custody for suspected arson that started the Springs Fire, the most active of around 10 blazes in Colorado, the state hardest hit by fires, according to Costilla County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. Joergensen is not a U.S. citizen and will be handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement once he has faced arson charges, said a Costilla County detention officer. The officer could not immediately say what nationality Joergensen held. The fire has scorched over 38,000 acres (15,378 hectares) between the towns of Fort Garland and La Veta in southern Colorado, forcing more mandatory evacuations of homes and ranches on Saturday in a mountainous area of public and private land. The fire continued to grow, fueled by temperatures in the mid 80s Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) and had zero percent containment as of Saturday afternoon. Air tankers and helicopters dropped fire retardant and water on the blaze. Authorities asked evacuated residents not to fly drones to check on their properties as the devices posed a danger to aircraft and would force them to be grounded. An unknown number of structures were consumed by the fire, said Bethany Urban, a public information officer. No injuries have been reported. Gusty winds, single-digit humidity and hot temperatures have fueled the fires and could ignite new blazes in the U.S. West, the National Weather Service said in several warnings. The largest wildfire in Colorado, the 416 Fire, has charred almost 47,000 acres about 13 miles (21 km) north of Durango in the southwest corner of the state, and is 37 percent contained, said public information officer Brandalyn Vonk. About 10 smaller wildfires were burning in New Mexico and three in Arizona, with much of the two states suffering extreme or exceptional drought conditions. All but the northeastern corner of Colorado is experiencing moderate to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Mark Kaufman,"Rain will be the antidote to the worst of this California fire season. Most years, some rains would have already arrived. But California's grasses, woodlands, and forests remain profoundly parched with some areas even matching or exceeding records for dryness after record-breaking summer heat and persistently dry autumn winds. While rains won't completely stomp out California's fires, it will significantly reduce the likelihood of vast areas of land continuing to catch fire. This year's sustained dryness, however, is a foreshadowing of future parched, rainless falls. ""Its been pretty bleak this year,"" Paul Ullrich, a climate scientist at the University of California, Davis, said in an interview. There's no immediate rainfall on the horizon this week that might douse the expansive flames of either the deadly Camp and Woolsey fires, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Though, some weather models show perhaps a little rain falling in Northern California next week. But the bigger picture about dry California autumns which means a longer, more potent fire season is growing increasingly clear. ""What were seeing is a harbinger of things to come as this century progresses,"" Sasha Gershunov, a research meteorologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in an interview. Specifically, recent research provides strong evidence that California is going to see a shorter, more concentrated rain season. That means more rain packed into December through February, but critically, less rain during the fall and spring. SEE ALSO: How California erupted in flames overnight ""There is a big concern going forward when it comes to future fire seasons in California,"" said Ullrich. During the fall, the winds pick up in California, which fan the flames. This will always be a problem it's an ingrained and expected part of the region's climate. But now, the winds are blowing over dryer vegetation, and the results have been historically destructive and deadly. Making matters worse, concentrated deluges during rainy winters ( like that of 2017 ) means vegetation will flourish after the rains, only to be dried out by drought, hotter summers, and arid falls. ""A really wet season loads the gun for the following year, giving more vegetation to burn,"" Neil Berg, a climate scientist and associate director at the UCLA Center for Climate Science, said in an interview. ""That is something we call whiplash."" ""Living in extremes its going to become one of the pressing problems of our time,"" added Berg. There are two main drivers of California's condensed rainy season, and accordingly, drier falls. One is simple physics: As it grows hotter on Earth due to climate change, the atmosphere absorbs more water. So ""whenever you have rainfall, you have more rainfall,"" but there's less moisture available in spring and fall, said Ullrich. Second, the weather systems that bring storms to the Golden State propelled by strong, higher atmospheric winds called the jet stream are getting pushed farther north. That means more of California will be will be subjected to drier, desert-like conditions, explained Gershunov. ""We can expect a longer dry season,"" Gershunov said. Although the rains haven't shown up much this fall, that certainly doesn't mean the entire season will be a wash. About 12 to 15 percent of California Octobers see negligible rain, noted Ullrich. So this may be just be a dry start to an average (or above-average) rainy season. ""But it would be extremely anomalous if we had no rainfall for the next month,"" Ullrich said. When the rains do come, the only hope is that they're normal. Heavy rains drive terrible mud slides down burned land and there's now a lot of freshly burned terrain. And like anywhere, too much rain at once means flooding. Unfortunately, with the extreme and historically unprecedented levels of carbon collecting in our atmosphere, temperatures are expected to continue rising this century. California should expect less rain in the fall, more land torched by fire, but more deluges during the winter. ""The rains are usually so welcome, but not in their extreme form,"" said Berg.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A stubborn Colorado wildfire grew by around a fifth on Saturday, consuming sparsely populated land as low humidity and high winds left firefighters bracing for it to spread, officials said. “Weather will be a concern this weekend as critical fire weather conditions are expected,” fire officials said in a Saturday email update on the so-called 416 Fire. “Southwest to west winds will be strengthening across southwest Colorado this weekend.” The Haines Index, used by firefighters to assess the stability and dryness of air over fires, is at its maximum level of six, officials said. “This indicates that there is a high potential for extreme fire behavior, intensity, and growth,” they added. As of Saturday morning, the Colorado fire remained at 10 percent contained, but it had grown by about 1,500 acres (607 hectares) since Friday, mostly in less inhabited areas to the west that officials said they were monitoring while they concentrate on protecting structures to the east, north and south. Officials said they ramped up their response to the fire, which had scorched 8,691 acres, up from 7,180 the day before, to a maximum Type 1 from Type 2, implying additional resources to battle the blaze. In 2017, a near-record 10 million acres (4 million hectares) were burned in U.S. wildfires, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The same agency issued a June forecast for “above-normal significant large fire potential” this month in Southern California and the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, because of a deepening drought and ample fuel for wildfires. Firefighters have kept the Colorado fire to the west of Highway 550 and away from structures, county commissioners in La Plata County, Colorado, said in a Saturday Facebook post. Fire officials said in the Saturday update that Highway 550 was closed from mile marker 32 to 47 and pilot cars were escorting traffic through there. A new blaze about 13 miles to the west, known as the Burro fire, prompted U.S. Forest Service officials on Saturday to close part of the Colorado trail in the San Juan National Forest.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - The Mendocino Complex became the largest wildfire in California state history on Monday as it raged at the southern tip of the Mendocino National Forest, state wildfire officials said. The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged, has burned 283,800 acres (114,800 hectares) and was still growing, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The Californian town of Paradise has been devastated by the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. At least 81 people have lost their lives and hundreds more have been reported missing. As families across the US come together for Thanksgiving, Paradise's residents are beginning to assess the damage to their lives and the town they called home. When gale-force winds drove flames from the Camp Fire through dried-out scrub and trees into Paradise on 8 November, its people fled for their lives. In the space of a day, the flames had engulfed much of the town - home to 27,000. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Some of the victims died trying to get away, while others were discovered in the burned-out ruins of their homes. An estimated 13,000 homes were destroyed, with many of the town's mainly-wooden houses quickly reduced to ashes. The authorities are still working to search and identify bodies as the fire continues to burn in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. While a forecast of heavy rains could help extinguish the flames, it could also hinder the search for the remains of victims and cause misery for those left homeless by the disaster. Thanksgiving plans As the rest of America sits down to celebrate Thanksgiving on Thursday, those left homeless by the raging Camp Fire are contemplating their futures. A number of organisations are on hand to help with the immediate crisis, providing shelter, clothes and food. And for Thanksgiving itself, meals are being donated by several non-profit organisations - the day seen as a chance to bring together those affected to start the healing process. For Kassy Parish, 19, such generosity after the trauma of the fire has been comforting. She plans to spend Thanksgiving at her mother-in-law's, but a stranger has offered her twin sister, Alli, somewhere to sleep and invited her to join his family for the annual celebratory meal. ""It's brought out so much good in a lot of people in the area,"" said Kassy. ""A lot of people have been getting together and making sure everyone is taken care of."" Image copyright Kassy Parish Image caption Kassy Rose Parish, her twin sister Alli and their family home before the fire Kassy was staying with her mom and stepfather at their home on Skyway - one of the three main routes into Paradise - when the fire spread through the town. Their house was burned down. Her six siblings also lost their homes. Before the disaster struck, the town was a popular retirement spot and, according to the latest census, about a quarter of the population was aged 65 or over. Kassy worked as a personal carer providing support for adults in the town when they were unable to live independently. She plans to stay in the town, where everyone knows everyone. ""I know it's going to take a couple of years until Paradise is rebuilt but I have lived here all my life,"" she said. Acres of land destroyed The Camp Fire scorched 152,000 acres of land along with the thousands of the homes built on it. The blaze is still only 75% contained. The fire isn't expected to be fully under control until the end of the month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Although, there is no exact figure for the number of people left homeless, six official evacuation centres have been set up, including two in fairgrounds which had closed for the season. Some people have also taken refuge in tents or cars. Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers are helping run the emergency shelters, which slept up to 950 on one night, as well as providing meals for all evacuees. They are also dealing with a fast-spreading norovirus outbreak, which has been reported at four of them. The Red Cross is helping people search for those still missing, through their safe and well website. Sean Smith, debris coordinator for the California Office of Emergency Services told Time magazine the post-fire clean-up would be the biggest since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. One estimate puts the cost at $1.2 billion (about £900m). Along with the 13,000 homes destroyed, almost 500 businesses have also been hit. Morgan Stanley estimates insured property losses could approach $4 billion (£3.1m), while Moody's Investor Services puts the figure at $6.8bn (£5.3m). ""It's one of the worst disasters that I've seen in my career, hands down,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long told a news conference. While federal funds are expected to provide about 75% of Paradise's recovery costs, the state of California will also contribute. Image copyright Justin Sullivan The money will help rebuild streets, public utilities and buildings and possibly install a new sewer system - Paradise was the largest town in California relying on septic tanks - but families without insurance may have to bear the cost of rebuilding their own homes. Kassy and her family have set up a crowdfunding page to help them get back on their feet. Others are expected to do the same. 'Survived three fires' But for Maurine Johnson, who has lived in Paradise for more than 60 years, it is too soon to contemplate the future. The 79-year-old great-great grandmother has lost her family home and her estate agency business, built up over many years with her late husband. Her two sons have also lost their homes. She has experienced blazes before, but this one was different, she said. ""We have been through two or three fires up there and never felt threatened or worried."" Maurine, who fell over and broke her nose and damaged her teeth while visiting her sister-in-law at one of the evacuation centres, described how she fled her home with just one change of clothes and her mobile phone. She admitted she still did not appreciate the gravity of her situation, but has been cheered by other people's generosity. Image copyright AFP ""I am having to wear donated clothes,"" she said. ""It's a humbling experience when you are having to take from people."" It is this spirit of giving that has led many organisations to provide 15,000 Thanksgiving meals to Camp Fire survivors at several locations, including shelters, on Thursday. Food for the Thanksgiving Together events will be provided by the non-profit World Central Kitchen and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, while celebrity chefs will work side by side with Paradise restaurant owners to prepare the food. ""We have seen the power of food to bring communities together, especially in times of great need,"" reads a post on the World Central Kitchen website. But the question for many of those affected by the Paradise fire, is whether they will return to the town. Mayor of Paradise Jody Jones believes they will and that the town will be reborn. ""We're committed to rebuilding,"" she said. ""It's not an 'if', it's 'How long is it going to take?'"" But Maurine, who is considering winding up her estate agency business and retiring, fears many will not return. People are already moving on, she said. ""They are leaving the state - others won't be back.""

Andrew Freedman,"California's Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties has eclipsed the 2003 Cedar Fire as the largest wildfire in Golden State history, at a whopping 273,400 acres. This puts the blaze's burned area as larger than New York City, and nearly the equivalent of the sprawling city of Los Angeles. The fire has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged 280 more. During the past week, firefighters have made significant gains, with the state reporting 78 percent containment as of early Sunday morning. The record size was eclipsed on Dec. 22, with additional growth possible before full containment is made sometime in early 2018. SEE ALSO: Surreal scenes of devastation across Southern California from unrelenting wildfires This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fast-moving fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. The state is seeing a trend toward more damaging wildfire seasons, with 14 of the 20 largest blazes on record occurring since they year 2000. This is due to a combination of factors, from climate change to urban sprawl. Temperature departures from average during summer 2017 across the state of California. Image: noaa/ncei. The Thomas Fire, along with other blazes that erupted across the state during the late summer and fall, resulted from a combination of climate extremes that are becoming more common in the state as a result of global climate change. Repeated, record heat waves sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. Meanwhile, a large bulge, or ridge, in the jet stream has been steering Pacific storms away from California week after week, pushing the fire season deeper into the year. Computer model projections show virtually no precipitation falling in southern California during the next two weeks, for example. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this image of the Thomas Fire burn scar on Dec. 18, 2017. Image: nasa Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change.

As a result of these back-to-back extremes, thousands of California's trees have died, leaving them susceptible to toppling, taking power lines with them, during the typical Santa Ana and "" El Diablo "" wind events that struck during the fall and early winter. Both the wine country fires and Thomas Fire occurred during periods of these intense winds, and downed wires are a suspected cause of some of the blazes. December is not a typical month for California wildfires. In fact, it's usually part of the state's critical wet season, which provides the rain and mountain snow needed for replenishing water supplies.","California's Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties has eclipsed the 2003 Cedar Fire as the largest wildfire in Golden State history, at a whopping 273,400 acres.

SIMON ROMERO,"Robert Talk, 61, a former amusement park worker, said he enjoyed telling jokes and sharing gossip with the evacuees. He said that his small dog, Princeton Peabody, interacts effortlessly with strangers, making it easy to start conversations with people in the camp. Were kind of all in the same boat now, arent we? Mr. Talk remarked. Its good for normal folk to realize were just like them. A lot of us are in this situation through no fault of our own. Maybe thisll open eyes, so we can start helping each other more.

With a smile, she pointed to her tent and said: Look at my new condo. Luxurious, isnt it? Ms. Clark, 39, said that money was now a problem after the house where she lived with her boyfriend was destroyed. She said she was unemployed, and wondered how much longer they could sleep rough outside the Walmart. She, too, was wary about going to one of the shelters, saying she had heard talk that viruses were spreading there.

Andrew Freedman,"A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage. These events caused 362 direct deaths. These figures come from a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Monday morning. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005, when losses totaled $215 billion, largely due to the three major hurricane strikes of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. SEE ALSO: Disastrous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season ends, with hard-hit areas still reeling The number of billion-dollar events tied 2011 for the most such disasters in a single year. The Western wildfire season alone, which scorched California in particular, cost at least $18 billion, NOAA said, tripling the previous record annual wildfire cost. Hurricane Harvey, which caused the most extreme rainstorm ever observed in the U.S., had total costs of $125 billion, just behind Hurricane Katrina in the 38-year period of record for billion-dollar disasters. Insurance companies are still tallying the damage for some of these events, so these costs may yet rise further. Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total costs of $90 billion and $50 billion, respectively, and Hurricane Maria, which demolished Puerto Rico's power grid, ranks as the third-costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation. The spike in costs for 2017 isn't directly tied to global warming, but numerous recent studies have found that extreme heat, wildfire, and rainfall events are becoming more likely and more severe due to climate change. This could, in turn, make such disasters more expensive, depending on how vulnerable the impacted areas. In deluging Houston with up to 60 inches of rain in just a few days time, Hurricane Harvey, for example, hit one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the U.S., where rampant urban development did not take into account the threat of heavy rainfall. Third-warmest year for the U.S. The NOAA report also found that 2017 was the third-warmest year on record for the lower 48 states, with an average annual temperature that was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th Century average. This was slightly cooler than 2012 and 2016, but it marks the 21st straight warmer-than-average year for the country. In other words, if you were born in the U.S. in 1997 and remained here since, you've never experienced a cooler-than-average year in the U.S. In fact, the globe has not experienced a cooler-than-average month since December of 1984. Strikingly, the five warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. have all occurred since 2006, NOAA found. This year, every state across the lower 48 and Alaska had an above-average annual temperature, and five states — Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina — had their warmest year on record. Thirty-two additional states, including Alaska, had a top-10 warmest year. One way that NOAA measures extreme weather is via the Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account temperatures, precipitation, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other factors. In 2017 it had the second-highest value in the 108-year period of record, which was more than double the average. Only 2012 had a higher value on this index, NOAA said. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures, one-day precipitation totals, days with precipitation and landfalling tropical cyclones contributed to the elevated extremes index, NOAA found. According to NOAA, during the past 38 years, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative costs for these 219 events exceed $1.5 trillion.","A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes California's latest catastrophic wildfire, the Camp Fire, was impossible to outrun when it first began burning. Officials say winds caused the blaze to burn through 80 miles (128km) of Northern California's hillside in just one hour. So how can you escape such a blaze, and why is the western US state so susceptible to these deadly fires? What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" H ow do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days Why are California fires so devastating? According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.",Fires have claimed dozens of lives in California.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In news that’s become all too common, a massive wildfire swept into a California city overnight. Hundred-foot walls of flames and traffic jams created a nightmare scenario in and around Redding, California, a city of 90,000. Neighborhoods and even entire surrounding towns have been evacuated, including a news station that stayed on the air until they were force to leave mid-broadcast. In their update late last night, CAL FIRE said that the hard work of nearly 1,750 firefighters couldn’t contain the flames due to “extreme fire behavior and unfavorable weather conditions.” As of midnight, the fire ballooned 50 percent overnight to 44,450 acres and was only three percent contained. “This fire is extremely dangerous and moving with no regard to what’s in its path,” CAL FIRE Chief Brett Gouvea said at a news conference late last night. Up until Thursday, most of the damage played out west of Redding, with the Sacramento River acting as a buffer between the city and the flames. Residents there have seen signs of the fire for days as it whipped up smoke and towering pyrocumulus clouds, as well as news reports of its trail of destruction. But on Thursday night, the fire jumped the river, sparking an evacuation of the neighborhoods on the western edge of town that caused bumper-to-bumper traffic. Around 2:30 a.m. local time, CAL FIRE also issued a mandatory evacuation for Shasta Lake City, a town of 9,000 on the northern edge of Redding. As fire started to rampage through the neighborhoods, firefighters stopped their containment efforts and began doing everything they could to get residents to safety. Local news report indicate that entire neighborhoods were ablaze. CAL FIRE is reporting that only 15 structures have been destroyed and another five have been damaged, but those numbers will surely rise as the sun comes up on the Redding area and firefighters begin to assess the damage. There has also been at least one fatality (a bulldozer operator who was working to contain the fire). That number that may unfortunately rise given the speed with which the fire tore into town. KRCR, the local NBC affiliate, was in one of the mandatory evacuation zones. Visibly uneasy anchors signed off, saying “we are going to leave the station because it is now unsafe to be here” as they cut to the station’s webcam showing the quintessential suburban view of street lights and trees lit by the bright glow of fire burning in the night. A scorching heat wave has helped create such dangerous conditions. Temperatures reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit in Redding yesterday and are forecast stay above 110 degrees Fahrenheit all weekend. The 10-day forecast shows 100+ degree Fahrenheit heat is likely to continue throughout next week. The heat, coupled with the moderate drought gripping the western portion of Shasta County, is a potent combination. But the fire has burned so intensely that it also appears to have created its own weather, as the heat from the flames rises and stirs the atmosphere. Towering pyrocumulus clouds, basically fire-driven thunderstorms, were clearly visible on satellite images during the day. The powerful winds that come along with those clouds likely spurred the Carr Fire on over dried-out brush and forest. The fire is one of three large blazes that have lit up California. The Cranston Fire continues to burn largely out of control about 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles, while the Ferguson Fire forced Yosemite National Park to evacuate visitors for the first time in decades. They come a year after the state had both its most destructive and largest wildfires ever recorded. The major blazes are a reminder that we’re living in a changed climate that’s increasing the odds of wildfire conditions. Wildfire season in the West is now 105 days longer than it was in the 1970s, and large fires are becoming more common, according to research by Climate Central (full disclosure: I used to work there). Climate change is responsible for half of the uptick in fires from 1984 to 2015, according to a 2016 study. In California in particular, recent research shows that precipitation in spring and fall—the shoulder seasons to California’s wet winter—is likely to dry up, further lengthening wildfire season. All this is happening as more people move into wildfire-prone areas, raising the risks of devastating consequences like the ones playing out in Redding. And it’s of course why we need to start preparing now for more intense urban fires.","In news that’s become all too common, a massive wildfire swept into a California city overnight.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction. It’s the latest reminder that we now live in an era of fast-growing, hard-to-contain megafires. Update 8/7: Well, it happened: The Mendocino Complex fire now stands at 283,800 acres and containment remains low. It’s eclipsed the Thomas Fire and still growing. The Mendocino Complex fire, which includes the Ranch and River fires burning side by side in Lake and Mendocino counties, currently stands at a combined 274,000 acres, placing it just shy of the Thomas Fire as largest wildfire in modern state history. The fires are still growing, and state officials believe the fire complex could climb to the top of the list soon, according to the LA Times. “Look how big it got, just in a matter of days,” Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), told the LA Times. “Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn’t happen. That just doesn’t happen.” Indeed, the fires exploded into existence just 10 days ago on July 27, and have been consuming land at breakneck speed. The larger of the two—the Ranch Fire—makes the top 10 list in its own right. As of this morning, the blaze had torched 225,000 acres and was just 21 percent contained. The River Fire, meanwhile, is closing in on 50,000 acres and nearly 60 percent containment. Thousands of personnel are working to contain the fires, which together threaten thousands of structures. But with scorching temperatures and little rain on tap for the next few days, they may prove hard to stamp out. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump declared a “major disaster” in California, ordering that federal funds be made available to help the state cope with its destructive blazes and help residents affected by the Carr Fire, another enormous wildfire burning not too far away in Shasta and Trinity counties. Trump also took to Twitter to blame California’s “bad environmental laws” for the situation and to falsely assert that the state is somehow diverting water it could be using to fight fires into the ocean. So, there’s that. The truth is that mega-fires like the Mendocino Complex are increasingly becoming the norm out West thanks to a combination of more humans living at the wildland-urban interface, persistent drought, misguided policies that caused large amounts of vegetation (aka fire fuel) to build up on landscapes, and climate change. “Our contribution to climate warming has effectively made fuels 50% drier and doubled the amount of western forests that have burned since 1984,” Jennifer Balch, a fire ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Earther via email. John Abatzoglou, a climate scientist at the University of Idaho, noted several climate and weather factors that set the stage for the Mendocino Complex conflagration. There was the very wet winter of 2016-2017, which “helped created a bumper crop of grasses last summer,” as Abatzoglou put it in an email. This year’s fire season has been incredibly dry, with unusually hot nights since July that have inhibited fire-suppression activities. Abatzoglou also pointed to the long-term trend, noting that the dryness of fire fuels and frequency of hot nights have trended upwards in recent years. The rise in extreme fire activity across the West has been on display over and over in recent months, and it’s clear we need to get our shit together. A wildfire fix in the 2018 omnibus spending bill was a step in the right direction, allowing federal agencies to access disaster funds rather than tapping their normal budgets to deal with the biggest blazes. But there’s still plenty more work to do, from allocating additional resources toward removing vegetation on wildfire-prone landscapes to setting and enforcing strong building codes to holding those who start fires accountable. We could also try doing something about climate change.","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction.

Makini Brice,"(Reuters) - A fast-growing California wildfire that has already forced thousands to flee their homes and shut down a large national park surged overnight into Saturday, as fatigued firefighters battled gusting winds. The blaze in Mendocino County, about 90 miles (145 km) north of San Francisco, had spread to cover a total of 201,471 acres (81,500 hectares) by early Saturday, after increasing more than 25 percent in size from Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. It was 34 percent contained. The Mendocino Complex Fire is now the state’s largest fire at more than two-thirds the size of sprawling Los Angeles, and has forced the evacuation of nearly 16,000 residents and destroyed more than 100 structures. It has swelled to become larger than the deadly Carr Fire, about 100 miles (160 km) to the northeast, which has killed at least six people and destroyed more than 1,500 homes, businesses and other structures. Firefighters have managed to contain 41 percent of that blaze and authorities are allowing some people who had evacuated to return, Cal Fire said. Both areas remained under a “red flag warning” issued by the National Weather Service for strong winds, low relative humidity and temperatures topping 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), all conditions that can drive the growth of wildfires. This year’s California wildfire season has been more destructive than in years past, burning about 290,000 acres (117,300 hectares), more than double the five-year average over that same period, according to Cal Fire. In total, 14 states are currently reporting large fires. Most are in other western states but wildfires have also struck Texas and Florida, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have blackened 4.9 million acres throughout the United States, significantly higher than the 10-year average, according to the center.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A Colorado wildfire nearly doubled in size from Saturday to Sunday and prompted hundreds more evacuations as dry and windy conditions were expected to persist, officials said. The so-called 416 Fire in southwest Colorado had burned nearly 17,000 acres by Sunday morning, an area larger than Manhattan. The fire located north of Durango was 10 percent contained, the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team said. The fire had burned about 9,000 acres by early on Saturday, according to an aerial survey. A mandatory evacuation order was issued on Sunday for approximately 675 residences, bringing the total number of homes under evacuation to almost 2,000, La Plata County, Colorado, spokeswoman Megan Graham said. Law enforcement officials are going door to door and residents have been warned to leave via calls to their phones, text message and emails, Graham said. Low humidity and high winds have left firefighters bracing for the fire to spread and the weather was expected to be dry and windy on Sunday. Images on social media showed large plumes of smoke disseminating above mountains against a backdrop of blue sky. A blaze known as the Burro fire prompted U.S. Forest Service officials on Saturday to close part of the Colorado trail in the San Juan National Forest. In addition, an air quality health advisory was extended on Sunday due to unhealthy levels of smoke, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. In 2017, a near-record 10 million acres (4 million hectares) were burned in U.S. wildfires, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The same agency issued a June forecast for “above-normal significant large fire potential” in Southern California and the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, because of a deepening drought and ample fuel for wildfires.

Rachel Kraus,"The wildfire-prone Santa Monica Mountains might sound like a terrible location for a billion dollar museum containing priceless works of art. But when Los Angeles' Getty Center was conceived by its board in the late 1980's, they were well aware of the risk. In fact, the fire currently raging across the highway from the Getty as of Wednesday is exactly the scenario the museum was built to withstand since it first opened its doors in 1997. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying The center uses a variety of architectural and design techniques to mitigate the adverse affects of wildfires.

The Getty Center is closed to the public today. The fire is northeast of the Getty Center and east of the San Diego Freeway. Air filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke. We continue to monitor the situation and will issue updates as we have them. — J. Paul Getty Museum (@GettyMuseum) December 6, 2017 Early Wednesday morning, a brush fire in West Los Angeles quickly grew to over 50 acres, prompting the shut down of the 405 freeway, and threatening the wealthy neighborhood of Bel-Air, as well as other nearby communities like Brentwood and Westwood. The latest figures from the LA fire department put the blaze at 150 acres. The fire is raging on the east side of the freeway, where Bel-Air residents have been told to evacuate. According to the LA Times, several homes in the area have already succumbed to fire. The Getty Center is a 940,000-square-foot complex that fills 24 acres of the 110-acre Santa Monica Mountains site. It's also on the freeway's west side. But 10 lanes of concrete doesn't mean the museum is safe - all it would take is one ember blown from the adjacent hillside to set aflame the western hills on which the Getty sits. But even in that scenario, thanks largely to architect Richard Meier, the art at The Getty - including Van Gogh's ""Irises"" - is surprisingly secure. ""Meier was sensitive to the fact of where the Getty was being built,"" Hartwig said. ""And of course, very, very sensitive to the fact that it would contain world class art that had to be protected."" Vincent Van Gogh's 'Irises' is part of The Getty's permanent collection. Image: The Getty center The Getty Museum is essentially a fortress specifically designed to protect itself and the art it houses from fire damage. That's because its founders were well aware that the low-moisture vegetation growing on the mountains make for ""volatile fire risk,"" according to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The museum is built of non-flammable materials including travertine and aluminum panels. And landscapers placed fire-resistant plants with high water content around the compound's perimeter. Inside the building itself, a ""sophisticated"" air filtration system pushes air out of the galleries, and seals them off from smoke and fire. The Getty closed the museum to visitors on Tuesday, before the Wednesday fire, to protect the art from smoke that had reached West Los Angeles from the Thomas, Creek, and Rye fires to its north. Due to continuing smoke from fires in the region, the Getty Center and Getty Villa will remain closed to visitors tomorrow, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. pic.twitter.com/rAxpPYx0GT — J.

But that's par for the course for the museum, which Hartwig says consistently works closely with the LA fire department and police department to ensure the building's security. Because of the smoke, the Getty was already closed to the public the day the fire broke out. But the museum faced a more unexpected wildfire scenario in 2015. During that year's Sepulveda Pass fire, the Getty had to evacuate visitors from its premises before it could put the air filtration safeguards in place.

Tom McKay,"Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003. Per CNN, Cal Fire says the blaze has now burned through some 1,063 buildings and is just 65 percent contained weeks after starting on December 4th. It also said it expects fire crews to be working on the blaze 24/7 until at least January 7th. The fire began in Ventura County and spread to neighboring Santa Barbara County, fueled by flame-optimal winds and plenty of dry brush to burn. As the L.A. Times reported, the official list of wildfires only dates back to 1932 because prior records are less reliable. One contender for the all-time spot remains the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire, which reputedly scorched some 300,000 acres (and some research supports those accounts ). Large stretches of southern California now lie in ruins. In some cases, the fire spread so fast that terrified residents were forced to evacuate without their possessions in the dead of night as smoke surrounded their homes. “I feel like I’m spinning,” local resident Jeff Jacobson, whose house was mostly burned, told the L.A. Times. “I’m overwhelmed and stressed, which is hard because I need to be clear-minded.” According to officials, this is the worst season for wildfires in memory. Wildfires have ravaged vast parts of the state this year, with blazes burning from southern California all the way up to wine-growing regions hundreds of miles to the north. The frequency of massive fires in the state has dramatically increased in the last few decades, due to both accidental blazes started by humans and trends linked to climate change like extreme droughts. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the Times. “What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Fire officials said that the blaze is contained enough that any further spread will be the result of deliberate actions by firefighters, not uncontrolled expansion. “The main fire itself will not have any growth,” the California City Fire Department’s Captain Brandon Vaccaro told the Times. “Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.” [ CNN ]","Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes in Southern California over the span of a week due to wildfires sweeping the region. In response to the ongoing devastation, Apple announced on Monday that it is donating $1 million to aid in relief efforts. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by the fires in Southern California, including our colleagues, friends and their families,” the company said in a statement, posted in a tweet by KTLA reporter Rich DeMuro. “Apple is donating $1 million to aid in the rebuilding and recovery efforts of the communities that have been impacted.” We have reached out to Apple for comment on how it determined the amount of its donation and where, specifically, it is donating the money. Apple has donated to relief efforts in the past. It donated $1 million to Northern California wildfire relief efforts in October and also matched employee donations. And without question it’s a good thing to provide resources following natural disasters. But it’s also important to understand just how impactful these contributions are. Apple is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and it’s on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar company. One million dollars is generous, but the cost of wildfires is astoundingly more than that. Cal Fire has an emergency fund budget of $426 million, KCRA reported, but it cost the department approximately $70 million more than that to fight wildfires from July 1 through December 7. “This is the worst season I’ve had — the longest, most devastating, most loss of life, most loss of structures,” Michael Bradley, Northern California assistant region fire chief, told KCRA. “Rate of spread is extreme.” I’m not shitting on Apple for donating 1,000 iPhone X’s-worth of money to help wildfire relief efforts, but Apple is the largest public company in the world. It’s important to remember how much Apple’s worth, versus how much it donated, versus how much is really needed to help. This is good, albeit incremental, support. But it’s also great PR for the tech giant.

Amy Beth Hanson / AP,"(HELENA, Mont.) — The spruce tree destined to serve as the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree was carefully selected from a Montana forest and hauled across the country in a special truck to preserve its freshness. The 79-foot-tall tree, which was lit up last month during a ceremony with congressional members, had its own website and social media presence. Now, some Montana companies hope to keep its fame alive by trucking it back home so it can be used to help rebuild a historic chalet in Glacier National Park that was destroyed in a wildfire last summer. Some critics questioned the amount of fuel that would be burned to haul the tree back across the U.S. when Montana has plenty of trees, while others didn’t mind as long as taxpayer money wasn’t involved. The effort is certainly more sentimental than practical, but no public money is being spent and no one can profit from the tree’s use, said Bruce Ward with Choose Outdoors, the Denver-based nonprofit that organized the effort to bring the tree to Washington. Ward got in on the idea after SmartLam, a Montana wood products company, contacted him about doing something besides letting the celebrated tree end up as mulch for the Capitol lawn. A few phone calls and goodwill gestures later, plans call for the tree to come back in pieces. It was removed Tuesday morning, officials said. F.H. Stoltz Land &amp; Lumber in Columbia Falls has agreed to process the wood, but vice president and general manager Chuck Roady noted that spruce is a softer wood and more suited for door or window frames or fireplace mantles than structural use in the new park chalet. Glacier officials are waiting to see how the still-standing rock walls of the Sperry Chalet fare over the winter before deciding on any restoration plans, park spokeswoman Lauren Alley said. Organizers asked Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester for his support and he wrote to Capitol officials asking the tree to be released to Montana for use in the chalet. “This wooden and stone landmark, built in Glacier’s rugged backcountry more than a century ago, is irreplaceable,” Tester wrote. “But efforts are underway to rebuild the Sperry Chalet, and I can think of no better use for some of the Montana lumber in our Capitol Christmas Tree to assist in that endeavor.” Ward had asked if the logs could hitch a ride back with a Montana-made copper star that topped the tree. Whitewood Transport Inc., which hauled the tree to Washington, said they could work that out, he said. This isn’t the first time the Capitol tree has been given a second life. In early 2013, former U.S. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell arranged for the tree from a Colorado forest to be returned to the state. The Coors Brewing Co. trucked the tree back to Colorado in 6-foot (2-meter) pieces and the wood was used to make park benches, Ward said. “For me, it’s a great way to return a historic souvenir to the state to be used for worthwhile purposes,” Ward said Monday.",The historic chalet was destroyed by a wildfire,2018-01-10T22:13:08Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree Is Being Trucked Back to Montana to Restore a Ski Lodge,http://time.com/5097970/us-capitol-christmas-tree-ski-lodge/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/white-house-christmas-tree.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,wildfire,0
Andrew Freedman,"The wildfires raging across Southern California have scorched tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and disrupted countless lives. While the scenes of flames screaming up hillsides, and smoke trailing hundreds of miles out over the Pacific are dramatic, they're not unprecedented. In fact, they're not even that rare. However, they are likely to be more damaging in the future, and more common in certain parts of California and the American West in general, thanks to climate change and other factors. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Wildfires, particularly during the fall, are endemic to California. In Southern California, the biggest blazes tend to flare up when the dry, warm Santa Ana winds blow, sometimes unceasingly for days on end. This week, for example, the Santa Ana wind event began on Monday, and is not forecast to stop until Friday night. Flames from a wildfire leap above traffic on Highway 101 north of Ventura, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2017. Image: Noah Berger/AP/REX/Shutterstock Much of the time during these events Southern California gets lucky, and there are no major blazes to speak of. It's not one of those years. This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. Known as ""El Diablo"" winds in this area, the offshore airflow was instrumental in propelling the wildfires faster than people could get out of the way, let alone allow firefighters to squelch the flames. Santa Ana winds result from a particular weather pattern featuring a high pressure area anchored over the Great Basin, and a low pressure area southwest of California, over the Pacific Ocean. The air pressure contrast between these two systems results in a funneling of air from east to west. As the air descends from the higher elevations toward the coast, it warms and dries, leading to extremely low humidity. These background conditions set the scene for a major fire, provided there's a spark. This year, there's been added fire risk from repeated heat waves that have sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, further drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. “It’s the coincidence of an ignition,"" that determines whether a Santa Ana event will lead to major fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, in an interview. ""And the two big causes of ignitions during Santa Ana wind events are power lines that blow down from the strong winds and arson."" The winds themselves can initiate a fire by downing power lines, something suspected in the fires that affected Northern California in October. Power outages preceded the Thomas Fire in Ventura on Tuesday, as well. Upper level winds showing the huge area of high pressure, or ""ridge,"" in the jet stream across the West, highlighted with the blue box. Image: earth.nullschool.net Importantly, the winds also make the fires nearly impossible to contain, blowing hot embers well ahead of the fire line, allowing blazes to hop across 10-lane highways with unsettling ease. The National Weather Service has been warning of the likelihood for ""extreme fire behavior"" with any fire that starts during this long-lasting wind event, going as far as designating the fire danger as ""extremely critical"" in the Los Angeles area. Once the fires get going, they can create their own weather, sucking in air from surrounding areas and lofting it upwards, promoting further fire growth and unpredictable behavior. Longer term trends This week, the high pressure area, or ""ridge"" in the jet stream, is extremely pronounced, part of a tendency toward more extreme weather patterns across the country. Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change. Last summer was the state's hottest on record, following a wet winter, which in turn followed the worst drought in modern California history. These episodes of weather whiplash have left the Golden State's trees stressed, making them more susceptible to toppling over from strong winds. Multiple studies have found that long-term climate change, which is mainly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, is raising the risk of large wildfires in the Western U.S. However, according to the USGS' Keeley, this doesn't apply to the lower elevations of southern California. His research has shown that the warming climate is leading to more frequent and larger fires in Northern California, particularly in high elevation forests, he said. There are broader, non-climate forces at work, too. Population growth is placing more people in harms' way, including by building in areas at the so-called wildland-urban interface, or WUI, where areas that traditionally burn as part of their natural ecology butt up against homes and businesses. In short, urban sprawl is not helping solve our wildfire problem. Keeley emphasized this point, saying that it's not just climate change, but global change that will alter wildfire severity and risk going forward. Wildfires are likely to have more catastrophic human impacts due to population growth along with climate change, he said. California statewide average temperatures for June through Nov. 2017. Image: noaa/ncei. For example, he cited a 1964 wildfire that burned almost the exact same area as the deadly Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. However, back then, the blaze caused no fatalities and only destroyed about two-dozen homes. Since that fire, though, he said the population in that area grew fivefold. “We need to be thinking about all the global changes that are taking place,” Keeley said. In the near-term, though, the Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday night, and may hit 70 miles per hour in some spots of Southern California on Thursday. In other words, this latest round of fires, which is a sign of the state's heritage and future challenge in a warming world, may yet grow worse.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""These fires may be a glimpse into SoCal's future under climate change."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-UjmGCjSM8A3WRuM-dU4wz3FFDc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F12%2F2c93672f-2bfe-c7a0%2Fthumb%2…",2017-12-06T22:40:04Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires,http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/causes-of-southern-california-terrifying-wildfires-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/44W3cplqc12pcASZtA9Xo3fYuNs=/1200x630/2017%2F12%2F06%2F0c%2Ff6cdf617cb964daf939a45ff2bdc5e85.b9168.jpg,mashable,Mashable,wildfire,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Dogs are being used to search for human remains among the devastation US President Donald Trump is heading to California to survey the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history. The Camp Fire in northern California has killed at least 71 people. More than 1,000 people are reported to be missing, although officials say that figure could fluctuate. Leaving for California, Mr Trump again focused on forest management as a cause of the blazes, a claim that has been disputed by experts. On top of the Camp Fire, firefighters are also tackling several other blazes, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives. And adding to the misery, scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters and the air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst. Heavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation. What's the latest on the Camp Fire? The death toll rose to 71 on Friday after seven more bodies were found in the town of Paradise, which has been all but destroyed by the fire. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains eight days on after the Camp Fire first broke out. Image copyright AFP Image caption The town of Paradise is in ruins Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea put the number of people unaccounted for at 1,011, a sharp leap from the 631 reported just 24 hours earlier. However, he described the list as ""dynamic"", ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names,"" he said. Some of those on the list may be fine but unaware they have been reported missing, or unable to call, authorities say. The Camp Fire is now about 50% contained but fire officials say they may not have it fully under control until the end of the month. What kind of welcome will the president get? Mr Trump is due to meet survivors and firefighters involved in tacking the blaze when he touches down. Asked on Fox News if he thought climate change had contributed to the wildfires, he said ""Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management."" California Governor Jerry Brown, who has criticised this argument as simplistic, said he would welcome the president to the state. ""Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,"" he tweeted. Media caption California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son Others suggested the president faced a difficult reception. One woman who voted for Mr Trump and was forced to flee Paradise said she disagreed with his assessment. ""I would tell him that this fire has nothing to do with forest mismanagement. Thousands and thousands of homes got destroyed with no trees around,"" Roslyn Roberts told Reuters. Another woman, living in a shelter, told Associated Press: ""If you insult people, then you go visit them, how do you think you're going to be accepted? You're not going to have a parade.""

Tom McKay,"Donald Trump’s administration has moved to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration take control of California water management under the official rationale of fighting the state’s rampaging fires, saying that the water “should be prioritized for wildfire response instead of endangered species protections,” ABC News reported on Wednesday. Of course, state officials say that there is more than enough water to fight the fires. The Commerce Directive announced a directive on Wednesday ordering the National Marine Fisheries Service, a sub-agency of NOAA, to “facilitate access to the water needed to fight the ongoing wildfires affecting the State of California.” Per ABC News, said directive would allow federal officials to overrule protections for threatened and endangered wildlife: The change announced Wednesday would allow federal agencies to expedite decisions about water under an emergency provision of the Endangered Species Act. The directive specifically says that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Marine Fisheries Service, will take over management of water during the wildfire emergency in California. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross directed the Service to tell other federal agencies “the protection of life and property takes precedence over any current agreements regarding the use of water in the areas of California affected by wildfires.” That follows on a very ill-informed tweet from the president earlier this week accusing California officials of wasting water needed to fight the fires, namely that it is “being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” (Actual wildfire experts point to the state’s extreme droughts, which are being worsened by climate change, as well as human encroachment in wildfire-prone areas and arcane funding laws that force the Forest Service to raid its regular forest management funds for emergency firefighting, per the New Republic.) This is probably all as cynical as it sounds, because firefighters who can’t access protected waters are obviously not the cause of the fires raging throughout much of the state. The Trump administration has been hostile to endangered species protections overall, as well as sought to undermine strict California environmental laws on everything from auto pollution to a water-use plan designed to protect salmon. As ABC News noted, there is “concern” what Trump actually intends to accomplish as a result of the order is injecting itself into a fight between the salmon fishing industry, which wants to reduce stress on populations critical to its future, and industrial farmers that want access to protected waterways. Per the Los Angeles Times, wildlife experts say the move is nothing more than a pretext to give the Trump administration the power to bypass laws protecting endangered species and redirect the water to “corporate agribusiness”: “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Kate Poole of the Natural Resources Defense Council said after the statement was issued. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Natural Resources Defense Council water division senior director Kate Poole told ABC News. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “At this point, water supply hasn’t affected any of our operations,” Cal Fire deputy director Mike Mohler told the Times. As the paper noted, firefighters have been drawing water from the Clear Lake reservoir to fight the nearly 300,000-acre Mendocino Complex fire, but the order could be a pretext to undermine California’s regulation of the Shasta Lake reservoir, which feeds recently devastated salmon smolt populations in the Sacramento River. The Times added: As we’ve reported, the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency, has proposed changes in both state and federal water projects to “maximize water deliveries” to non-environmental users and consider “modifications to regulatory requirements” established by the biological opinions. ABC News added that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recently wrote an op-ed saying that part of the solution to the fires needs to include a more “aggressive approach to thinning of forests. That approach is less controversial, but much of the necessary funding is tied up in budget fights, according to the New York Times. University of California, Merced management professor LeRoy Westerling told the paper that California “spending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands... And all that money is being raised because we’re putting a price on carbon.” According to CBS News, firefighting costs in California more than tripled from $242 million in the 2013 fiscal to $773 million in the fiscal year ending in June 30, while smoke from the fires now consuming some 600,000 acres across the state now cover three-quarters of the state.

Lauren Sommer,"A house being rebuilt in Sonoma County where the Tubbs fire burned last year. The Tubbs fire was the most destructive fire in California history, destroying more than 5,000 structures. Lauren Sommer/KQED The drywall is finally ready to go up at Paul Lowenthal's new house, just outside Santa Rosa, Calif. After going through the most destructive blaze in California history, his long rebuilding process is almost done. Fueled by extreme winds, Sonoma County's Tubbs Fire last year killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes and buildings. Since then, the community has banded together to pick up the pieces. But it's also been grappling with a tough question one that faces fire-ravaged communities around the state: With wildfire a normal part of the California landscape, how and where should residents rebuild to protect themselves? Hundreds of Sonoma residents have opted to stay put, both financially and emotionally tied to their land. Lowenthal is one of them. He left his home on a windy night one year ago, called into work as Santa Rosa's assistant fire marshal. The Tubbs Fire was spreading into town and he had to get people out. ""It was exploding at a rate that I would have never imagined,"" he says. ""I left in my work truck and uniform and thought: worst case scenario, I'll be back tomorrow morning."" Later that night, he drove past his own neighborhood. Do I think those areas will burn again? Absolutely. It's done it before. Paul Lowenthal, assistant fire chief, Santa Rosa, Calif. ""You couldn't actually make out individual homes in here,"" he says. ""It just looked like an entire wall of fire. And then realized right away my house is gone."" He worked the next five days on just a few hours of sleep, until finally, he stopped to take stock. ""And then realized I have nothing,"" he says. ""Literally had nothing."" Picking Up the Pieces ""Do I think those areas will burn again?"" Lowenthal says. ""Absolutely. It's done it before."" It happened 54 years ago, when the Hanley Fire burned almost exactly the same area. But Lowenthal was keenly aware of this latest fire's effect on an already-tight housing market. ""I made a decision that it made more sense to rebuild here,"" he says. His daughter was also a big part of that decision. ""Could I have convinced her that we could live in a really cool place somewhere else?"" he says. ""Maybe. But this was our home."" In the hills above Santa Rosa, wooden frames of houses are rising among the blackened trees. Many of the rebuilt homes will include new fire-resistant building materials, something few had when the fire swept through. But many others almost 2,000 of the destroyed structures will not be required to meet building standards for wildfire-prone areas. That's because of California's decade-old zoning rules. Some homeowners are taking it on themselves to meet those building standards anyway, dipping into their insurance payouts to cover the cost. Others are not. City and county governments are under pressure to build new housing in areas at risk for wildfire because of the region's severe housing shortage. As people are trying to heal and recover, local leaders have been faced with balancing those delicate issues. With climate change making California's fires more extreme, their decisions will affect lives for decades to come. Wildland building codes This time, Lowenthal says, his new home will be built with cement-fiber siding and other fire-resistant materials and will better prepared to withstand fire. ""Between the roof, the siding, things of that nature, it was definitely a step that I wanted to take,"" he says. But Lowenthal isn't legally obligated to do any of that, as his home was outside the area subject to California's ""Wildland-Urban Interface Codes."" They include a broad range of standards for siding, roofs, decks, and windows, as well as requirements for gutters and attic vents that are meant to prevent embers blown ahead of a wildfire from igniting a home. Nearly a year after the Tubbs Fire, Paul Lowenthal's rebuild is finally nearing completion this time with more fire-resistant materials. Lauren Sommer/KQED The zones were established by a set of 2008 Cal Fire maps that outline wildfire risk by considering vegetation, fire history and slope. Sonoma County's zones are based exactly on those maps, while the city of Santa Rosa had extended the stricter requirements only somewhat beyond what was on the state maps. Almost 2,000 buildings destroyed in the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa and Sonoma County weren't mapped in those zones and won't be required to use fire-resistant materials. ""We don't have an extra set of rules or requirements that we put on people to rebuild,"" says David Guhin, Santa Rosa's director of planning and economic development. Guhin says Santa Rosa would be on shaky legal ground if it imposed new wildfire building codes on structures that weren't required to meet them when they were destroyed. But, since most of the homes were built decades ago, before most modern building codes, he says even the basic code upgrades for the new structures will help. ""The housing stock that's going in is much more resilient than the previous house stock,"" he says. Updating the Cal Fire maps Still, many believe Cal Fire's maps are outdated, since they don't reflect the extreme nature of today's fires. The maps assumed fairly benign weather conditions, just 12 mph for ""mid-flame"" wind speed, the height that affects fire behavior. During the Tubbs Fire, gusts hit almost 80 mph. Cal Fire is in the process of updating the fire hazard maps using more realistic data, including localized information and historic fire conditions. A draft of the maps is expected sometime next year. The new maps could put many homes into a fire hazard zone that aren't in one today. But several North Bay officials say the community can't wait for that to be sorted out. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This community needs to rebuild. Tennis Wick, Permit and Resource Management Department, Sonoma County ""I take solace in that the existing code is significantly better than what was there before,"" said Tennis Wick, who heads Sonoma County's permit and resource management department. ""I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This community needs to rebuild."" Wick says many homeowners are choosing fire-resistant materials anyway, such as cement-laden siding and metal roofs. Giving homeowners choices Some fire victims have opted to pull up stakes after living through the fire's emotional trauma or due to steep rebuilding costs. In the hilly Fountaingrove neighborhood of Santa Rosa, for-sale signs sprout from empty lots among the construction sites. But many other homeowners are tied to their property, either restricted by insurance policies that prescribe where they can rebuild, or simply priced out of other Bay Area homes. And that concerns Santa Rosa City Council member Julie Combs. ""I know I've heard stories about flooding along the Mississippi and thought, 'Why did they keep rebuilding there?'"" said Combs. ""I'm all for having property owners have choice,"" she adds. ""And right now, we aren't really giving them a choice to not build on the land they're tied to in a high-fire-hazard area."" Combs says she's interested in programs like those that already exist for flooded homes, where governments or neighbors can buy out inundated properties so they won't be re-developed. She's not confident that today's wildfire building codes are enough to protect people. The codes are meant to reduce risk, but don't eliminate it. Within the Tubbs fire footprint in Santa Rosa, 22 homes were built before the fire with the most recent wildfire codes. Twenty-one of them burned anyway. ""That doesn't strike me as particularly good odds,"" says Combs. Struggle over new housing Homeowners considering not rebuilding face another hurdle: there are few other places to go. In Santa Rosa, the Tubbs Fire obliterated five percent of the city's housing stock, exacerbating an already brutal housing market. Before the fire, the city estimated it needed 5,000 more housing units. The fire added 3,000 more to that number. ""We need to walk and chew gum at the same time,"" David Guhin of Santa Rosa says. ""We're going to rebuild our community as fast and quickly and as efficiently as we possibly can, but we also have to build new homes as fast as we can."" Santa Rosa is pushing for more ""in-fill development,"" putting housing downtown and closer to public transit. ""We made that a priority this year,"" he says. ""We put a number of polices in place such as expedited permit processing, reducing the impact fees substantially for housing in the downtown core."" But there has long been pressure to build in the surrounding hills, where the wildfire risk is highest. ""Development of single-family homes on the outskirts of town will happen on its own,"" Guhin says. ""There is a market for that."" A new project looks for approval In February, the Santa Rosa City Council faced down that question. San Francisco-based City Ventures asked for a zoning change to allow its Round Barn Village project to go forward. The 237-unit townhome development is proposed for a hillside that burned in the Tubbs Fire. A new housing project in Santa Rosa, California is proposed for a hillside burned in the Tubbs Fire. Lauren Sommer/KQED City Ventures made the case that the homes would be built using wildfire standards and would provide much needed affordable housing. ""We absolutely need the housing,"" said council member John Sawyer at the meeting. ""And lots of mistakes were made in the past with saying no."" But doubts hounded Council member Julie Combs. ""We are setting a precedent to build more new housing in a fire hazard area when we vote today,"" warned Combs at the meeting.

Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires. What's more, over the same period, the state has experienced eight of its 10 most destructive fires in history. The U.S. Forest Service is in its highest level of fire response, with 29,500 firefighters battling blazes around the nation. Most, however, are combating fires in the super-parched West, where the record-breaking Mendocino Complex promises to spread even more.","For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history.

Mark Kaufman,"Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast. They're escaping the smoke. Davis, California, sits amid a layer of wildfire smoke in Northern California. To the northwest, the largest fire in state history, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn. To the southeast, the Ferguson Fire has closed down smoke-choked Yosemite National Park indefinitely. And to the North, the Carr Fire, infamous for its towering fire tornado, still burns. SEE ALSO: California just had its hottest month on record, and that means more wildfires The air quality in the region around the fires — whose spread has been enhanced by extreme heat parching the land — is some of the worst in the world. ""I decided to go out to the coast for a couple days because it was so ridiculous,"" Wexler said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service illustrated how winds have lifted bounties of smoke across the entire U.S., bringing pollution even beyond the East Coast. Smoke from the western fires is making it all the way to the East Coast and beyond (at least aloft—mostly above a mile above the surface). Here's the vertically integrated smoke (HRRR model from last night). Another map showed some smoke near the surface even in New England. pic.twitter.com/0Jl6WDAFjg — NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) August 8, 2018 That said, it's not as if these smoke particles are harmful to those on the East Coast. By the time that smoke arrives in Boston and New York, the particles have been diluted with fresh air, and certainly can't be seen, nor are concentrations unhealthy. It's normal for pollution to waft from west to east across the country, just like pollution from China is regularly transported over the Pacific Ocean into the U.S. That's how air generally moves over the Northern Hemisphere, said Wexler. But it's much rarer for even low concentrations of smoke to find their way across the nation. ""It doesn’t happen every day,"" Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab, said in an interview. ""But, it can happen."" ""Normally, the pollution isn’t so great that it’s noticeable when it gets east,"" added Wexler. But just how bad is the air pollution in large regions of the West? ""It's been like a reasonably decent day in Beijing,"" said Wexler. ""That's really telling. It’s really awful there."" ""It’s unbelievable,"" said Pfister. She noted that planes flying over the area, as part of a National Science Foundation-funded wildfire study, have picked up some alarming pollution numbers. It's expected that particulate matter — tiny fragments of pollution 30 times thinner than a human hair — would be bad. But the flights even picked up abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be dangerous to human health in enclosed spaces, and at worse, lethal. However, some of the measured values around the fires are about 5 parts per million, or ppm, which are not considered nearly dangerous — but it's still telling. ""These are values you don’t typically find near the surface in the U.S.,"" said Pfister. ""Maybe you’ll find that if you stick your head into the exhaust of a car."" It's not carbon monoxide, however, that people in burning regions need to be concerned about. One of the main factors that's figured into air quality ratings is particulate matter. Both U.S. government and university researchers have repeatedly shown that breathing this stuff is bad for your heart, as it accelerates plaque build-up in blood vessels. In some areas of Oregon, the Air Quality Index currently registers as ""Hazardous."" In Redding, California, where a fire tornado spun for 80 minutes last week, the air quality is rated as ""Unhealthy."" But out near the windswept coast, like in San Francisco, the air quality is ""Good."" It's likely that the West will be intermittently blanketed in unhealthy to hazardous air for months ahead, as the fire season is not nearly over. Rains aren't expected for months, and more temperature and fire records might be broken. Many Westerners aren't near the fires themselves. But it's harder to outrun the smoke. ""In my experience, it's never been this bad,"" said Wexler.","Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them California's biggest wildfire on record is expected to burn for the rest of the month, fire officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex Fire has already engulfed 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles. Barely a third of it is under control, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Firefighters are tackling 18 major blazes across the state amid strong winds and low humidity. The fire - which comprises two blazes in the state's north - was declared the biggest in California's history on Monday. Officials had set a target to extinguish the fire by mid-August, but they now say they will need until early September. The fire has burned 75 buildings and led to thousands of evacuations. A separate blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more that 1,500 structures. Burning through almost 160,000 acres, it was 47% contained by late Monday. Meanwhile, more fires have been breaking out, adding to the mammoth workload of fire crews. The so-called Holy Fire, in southern California, grew dramatically and rapidly on Monday, with two hikers needing to be airlifted to safety. How are firefighters coping? At least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but they also receive $2 (£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires. Firefighters told the LA Times about their gruelling schedule. One said his crew had slept - sitting up - in the seats of their fire engine on some nights. ""It's been pretty crazy - they're calling this the new norm,"" said Omar Estorga, captain of a crew working on the Carr Fire. ""In years past, there were one or two big fires a year. Now they're doing three to four huge fires in a week."" Nearly half of the 10 largest California wildfires on record have occurred in the past decade, according to Reuters news agency. Officials have rejected a theory, tweeted by President Donald Trump, that the fires' spread was being ""made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Deputy fire chief Mr Mclean dismissed Mr Trump's comments to US media, saying firefighters had ""plenty of water"" to carry out their work. Will it get worse? National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned that conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Strong winds that have powered the third-largest wildfire in California’s history were expected on Sunday to further fuel a blaze that has burned 267,500 acres. Nearly 8,500 firefighters are battling the so-called Thomas Fire in Southern California, which began Dec. 4 and has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and threatened 18,000 more, including homes in the wealthy town of Montecito just outside the coastal city of Santa Barbara. While the winds were expected to ease on Sunday near Santa Barbara, northeast wind gusts up to 55 mph were forecast through Sunday for parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, National Weather Service forecasters said. The blaze, centered less than 100 miles (160 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, has forced evacuations that turned neighborhoods into ghost towns and filled the air with smoke. The fire is now 40 percent contained despite hot Santa Ana winds that have powered its expansion, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank. Firefighters were employing more than 970 fire engines and 34 helicopters to battle the blaze. Firefighters keep watch on the Thomas wildfire in the hills and canyons outside Montecito, California, U.S., December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Gene Blevins “It is a beast,” Santa Barbara County Fire Department Division Chief Martin Johnson told a news conference on Saturday. “But we will kill it.” Five of 20 most destructive fires in recorded history ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire. The Thomas fire, the seventh-most destructive in state history, forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. It was also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California. On Saturday, evacuation orders were issued for parts of Santa Barbara County as high winds whipped the fire through bone-dry terrain. In Montecito on Saturday, smoke billowing from nearby canyons and pushed by the high winds choked the air, hindering aircraft from dropping flame retardant, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. An evacuation order for the city of Ventura was lifted on Saturday morning. Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. The blaze’s first fatality, he died of smoke inhalation and burns, the Ventura County Medical Examiner’s office said.

Robert Jablon,"A California wildfire that has killed two people and seared its way through cities, towns and wilderness northwest of Los Angeles became the largest blaze ever officially recorded in California on Friday, authorities said. The Thomas fire took only 2 ½ weeks to burn its way into history books as unrelenting winds and parched weather turned everything in its path to tinder — including more than 700 homes. The fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties had scorched 273,400 acres, or about 427 square miles of coastal foothills and national forest, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. That was 154 acres larger than California's previous fire record holder — the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County that killed 15 people. The Cedar fire had been recognized as the biggest California wildfire in terms of acreage since 1932. Some fires before that date undoubtedly were larger but records are unreliable, according to state fire officials. A firefighter and a civilian fleeing the flames died in the Thomas fire as days of unrelentingly dry, gusty winds drove the flames. At times firefighters were forced to retreat to safe areas and simply wait for the flames to pass so they could attack them from the rear. Often erratic gusts combined with extremely low humidity — it dropped to just 1 percent on some days — pushed the blaze with virtually unprecedented speed, blackening more ground in weeks than other fires had consumed in a month or more. On Wednesday, as the fire continued to march north and west, Santa Barbara County fire Capt. David Zaniboni was awed by the speed of its growth. ""Those (other) fires burned for weeks and weeks and this fire is only a few weeks old,"" he said. ""It's incredible."" By that point, firefighters already were beginning to take advantage of a lull in the weather. Several days of easing winds allowed crews to burn and bulldoze protective firebreaks in the foothills above threatened communities, including the celebrity enclave of Montecito. By Thursday, most of the southern end of the fire also was surrounded and the last mandatory evacuation orders were called off. As of Friday, while 18,000 homes and other buildings were technically still at risk, there was little flame showing in previously burned areas and the fire was moving slowly through remote wilderness. The fire was 65 percent contained and colder, moister weather was helping. Although some 50-mph winds gusts were recorded, it produced ""no remarkable fire activity"" near Montecito or other areas, according to a state fire report. Brush and timber in the area remain tinder dry, and fire crews are setting backfires to burn it out, and that could add to the fire's size. ""The main fire itself will not have any growth,"" Capt. Brandon Vaccaro of the California City Fire Department told the Los Angeles Times. ""Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.""","NBC Southern California California Wildfire Now Largest in State History NBC Southern California Fire broke out in the Santa Ana River bottom in Riverside Thursday Dec. 21, 2017.

Mark Kaufman,"The consequences of America’s swelling wildfire problem are traveling well beyond blackened, ashy forests. They're now tainting the air in cities and towns over vast regions of the western U.S. Since the mid-1980s, fine bits of air pollution that have been repeatedly linked to heart and lung diseases have diminished in a good portion of the United States — except in an expansive zone of the western part of the country. In this region, which extends north from Utah to Montana and west from Oregon to Wyoming, the most polluted days — when the air quality is at its most harmful — are getting even worse. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The culprit, say atmospheric scientists in a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study published Monday, is expanding wildfires, which are burning considerably more land than they were three decades ago. “It’s not just a rural thing anymore,” Anthony Wexler, director of the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center who took no part in the research, said of the bad air. The red area shows the zone in the U.S. where the worst days of particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5) are getting worse. Image: Image adapted from McClure C.D. and Jaffe D.A/PNAS Wexler, speaking from smoky Aspen, Colorado, near where blazes had recently charred the Rocky Mountains, noted these tiny particles — which at their largest are still 30 times thinner than a human hair — don’t just transform blue skies into unsightly hazes. “It’s also a killer,” said Wexler. A recent 10-year-long Environmental Protection Agency study observed some 6,000 people and found exposure to this particulate matter, known formally as PM 2.5 (for particulate matter less than 2.5 microns across), accelerated the build-up of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels, which leads to heart attacks, strokes, and even death. A size comparison of Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) pollution versus human hair and sand particles. Image: epa “Lots of people have been predicting that this [harmful air pollution] would be happening in the next decades — but we’re starting to see it now,” Dan Jaffe, a study coauthor and University of Washington atmospheric researcher, said in an interview. The worst polluted days, when this tiny pollution is at its highest, comes out to around seven extremely unhealthy days a year. “At high levels, it affects everybody,” said Jaffe, even people in fine health. “In short, it’s harder to breathe.” And wildfires aren’t expected to diminish anytime soon. They’re a result of a hotter climate, which parches the land and provides fires with more fuel. The recent return of large blazes to California’s wine country, for example, were largely stoked by hot temperatures, turning abundant vegetation to tinder. “We’re right in the middle of climate change,” Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab who had no involvement in the study, said in an interview. A wildfire burns in southern Colorado on June 28. Image: Uncredited/AP/REX/Shutterstock “There’s yet another record, and yet another record, and yet another record,” said Pfister, referring to the increased frequency of record-breaking heat as average temperatures continue to climb. “Climate change is definitely not getting better.” All three atmospheric scientists, however, pointed out that that climate change certainly isn’t the only culprit in increased wildfires over the last few decades. The U.S. government’s historic mismanagement of forests, specifically by not allowing fire-prone underbrush to burn away in typical fires, has given large fires more fuel to burn, and an upper hand. But higher temperatures are simply the elephant in the room. “It’s hotter than it used to be,” said Wexler. And this heat, unfortunately, helps drive a vicious cycle of more heat. As more forests burn, they don’t just release bounties of tiny bits of matter into the air; they also fill the atmosphere with more carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes “substantially to the global greenhouse effect,” according to the U.S. Forest Service. And more greenhouse gases mean more trapped heat in Earth’s atmosphere. “It’s a circle,” said Pfister. A plane dumping fire retardant near Idaho's 2016 Pioneer Fire. Image: U.s. Forest Service/Kari Greer As the planet continues its accelerated warming trend, this means government air quality warnings in communities long distances from burning forests will likely become more frequent, she said. “Take it seriously. Stay indoors,” said Pfister. “Sometimes it’s pretty healthy to be a couch potato."" Bad air may make for a grimmer future, but there is the ever-conspicuous solution: Slashing the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere – which requires the transformation of how nations generate electricity and fuel transportation. “We can do something about it by addressing climate change,” added Pfister. Though in the short term, the West will burn, like it is this summer. “It’s going to be a tough season,” said Pfister.","The consequences of America’s swelling wildfire problem are traveling well beyond blackened, ashy forests.

Matt Novak,"Did you see that video of the town crier announcing the engagement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? Yes, the happy couple are really going to have a royal wedding. But that “town crier” is just a random guy dressed in goofy clothes and has nothing to do with Buckingham Palace. The self-appointed town crier, whose real name is Tony Appleton, has been around for years. He announced that a royal baby was on its way in 2013, and popped up again in 2015 when the baby was born. But again, he has nothing to do with the royal family, despite what some American news outlets might have you believe. ABC News posted an uncritical video of the dude and Business Insider did the same before changing its headline and story to acknowledge that Appleton has nothing to do with the royal family. And he’s fooled plenty of others in the past. So why does Appleton do it? “I’m a royalist. I love the royal family,” Appleton told the Associated Press in 2013 while admitting that he has no official royal duties. “I came unannounced.” Many people are wise to Appleton’s fakery, but that doesn’t stop plenty of American news outlets from seeing a guy in a tricorn hat and thinking, yeah this seems normal. And from there, it spreads like wildfire across social media. But I suppose it’s not entirely our fault.

Andrew Freedman,"Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control. At least three large fires are currently burning in and around Los Angeles, including one — the Thomas Fire — which has already burned at least 90,000 acres near Ventura. Early Thursday morning, authorities closed the 101 Freeway in both directions due to strong winds pushing fire close to the road, cutting off movement between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Evacuation orders have gone out for idyllic communities in the Ojai Valley, as well as parts of Santa Barbara, as flames move toward the coast, according to the LA Times. More evacuations are likely on Thursday. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The weather conditions on Thursday are downright dire, with strong, damaging winds rushing through mountain passes and down hillsides toward the coast. This will create extraordinarily dry air, and make any new fires or ones that are already in progress extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control. California’s fire history is replete with Santa Ana-driven, damaging blazes. However, the combination of factors present on Thursday — powerful winds, preexisting fires, desiccated vegetation, and also population growth — make it stand out as an especially risky day for the state. According to news reports, more than 200,000 people have been evacuated due to the fires, and this number may climb as the winds interact with the fires to push them in new directions at a faster clip. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which forecasts the risk of wildfires based on anticipated weather conditions, fire weather is likely to be ""extremely critical"" — a rare designation reserved for only the most threatening situations — in a swath of Southern California on Thursday. These combustible conditions are going to affect about 9.5 million people, the SPC forecasts. Another 10.7 million people reside in a ""critical"" fire weather zone, including the city of Los Angeles. Elevated fire risk is forecast for Southern California straight through Saturday. ""Large fire spread and extreme fire behavior will occur with any new/ongoing fires,"" the SPC said in a forecast discussion. Average temperatures across California during the summer months (June, July, and August) in 2017. Image: NOAA The high winds may prevent aircraft, including helicopters and heavy water bombers, from doing their work, as well. This further inhibits firefighters' ability to contain these blazes. The National Weather Service is predicting strong winds to last all day on Thursday. The winds have already exceeded hurricane force in some high elevation areas, with gusts above 75 miles per hour. While wildfires are a typical occurrence in Southern California each fall, when the dry, offshore Santa Ana winds blow, the current blazes are occurring later in the year than normal. In addition, conditions in the region are far drier than they normally would be. These fires are an illustration of how short-term weather variability can interact with longer-term climate trends to create a precedent-setting, potentially deadly extreme event. A fire sends embers all over residential neighborhoods north of Ventura, Calif. on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: Marcus Lam/LA Times via Getty Images ""The risk of large wildfires in coastal California typically peaks in Autumn after the long dry summers — typical of California’s Mediterranean climate — increase the flammability of the vegetation that fuels wildfires,"" LeRoy Westerling, a scientist researching climate and wildfire at the University of California at Merced, said in an email. ""The overlap between the dry fuels and these warm dry wind events marks the peak fire risk for the year in coastal California,"" Westerling said. ""Usually, Autumn rains put an end to the fire season by wetting fuels and raising humidity, even though wind events may continue to occur."" The problem is, Westerling noted, it hasn't rained much in Southern California since March. The state also had its hottest summer on record, which dried out the vegetation that grew after one of its wettest winters, forming a perfect weather whiplash combo that is conducive to igniting large fires. ""Southern California has remained unusually dry through November and into December this year, extending the high fire risk fueled by the confluence of dry conditions and Autumn winds that are driving the large fires burning in coastal Southern California,"" Westerling said. While these fires cannot be directly tied to climate change, since they were most likely ignited by downed power lines or arson, they are consistent with what scientists expect to occur more frequently from a warming, drying climate in much of California. The entire American West, in fact, is likely to see — and in many cases has already seen — an increase in the size and frequency of large wildfires. ""Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation as well as increasing temperatures,"" Westerling said. ""This means that the probability of extremely large wind-driven fires in California occurring later in the year is increasing.""","Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","As residents of Malibu fled their seaside city in droves to escape a raging wildfire on Thursday, volcanologist Jess Phoenix hitched her two-horse trailer to her Ford F-250, hopped on the 101-freeway, and headed straight for the inferno. There were animals that needed rescuing. As a breeder and proud owner of two horses, Phoenix knows a thing or two about helping the animals out in difficult circumstances. As a scientist whos done field work around active volcanoes, she knows her way around a fiery disaster zone (although fires and volcanoes are different ). And as an Angeleno deeply embedded in Southern Californias equestrian community, she knew that some of the more than 100,000 people ordered to evacuate as the Woolsey and Hill fires tore through Malibu and surrounding areas on the night of November 8 had equine companions in need of help. In other words, driving into the smoldering heart of horse country as flames raced down the hillsides wasnt much of a choice. The fire was coming onto the highway, and cop cars were blowing past me with their lights on, Phoenix told Earther. It was insane. Phoenix is part of Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation, a 13,000 member-strong community of horse lovers who have space to shelter the animals or trailers to pick them up in, and wholl come to rescue when disaster strikes a community. On Thursday night, she evacuated four horses, starting in the city of Agoura Hills and then moving west into the rugged equestrian community of Hidden Valley in the Santa Monica Mountains. Those four pickups alone took all night. I would have done more, but the cell phones went down, she said. That really was a big problem. Fortunately, there were a number of folks out helping evacuate animals, including trained volunteers like Phoenix and professionals with Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control and Ventura County Animal Services. Along with horse owners who were able to evacuate their animals themselves, rescuers were soon flooding into designated animal shelters like Pierce College in the west San Fernando Valley. The college campus, which includes a 225-acre farm, has for years served as a shelter during the fires that so frequently plague the region, and its staff was ready. We have horse stables, corrals, people who understand equestrians, vets we can bring in, Pierce College public information officer Doreen Clay told Earther. Theres a lot of equestrian activities out on this west side of town. When Phoenix dropped off her first rescue horse at Pierce College on Thursday night, the shelter was nearing capacity. Soon it was overflowing with more than 250 rescue animals, Clay told Earther. In the days since the fire flared up many folks have taken their animals home, but as of yesterday morning, there were still 153 horses and 20 mini horses, along with donkeys, goats, sheep, chickens, and tortoises. The nearby Hansen Dam Equestrian Center, also a designated shelter, was similarly slammed. Northwest of the fires near Oxnard, the Ventura County Fairgrounds and the Humane Society of Ventura County started picking up some of the overflow. Greg Cooper, Director of Community Outreach at the Humane Society, said that his private non-profit jumped to 24/7 emergency services within an hour of the first fire, with equestrian teams heading out to rescue horses, donkeys, cows, and other livestock in the Malibu area. That included pulling animals from Zuma Beach, which became a temporary refuge for horses, llamas, and a now internet-famous pair of alpacas. Cooper told Earther that the Thomas Fire, which tore through Ventura County last year and became the largest fire in Californias history until the Mendocino Complex unseated it this summer, provided practice for the rescue teams. The Thomas fire taught us a lot of things, Cooper said. We thought we were prepared for intake. We have spent the entire year getting our property more organized and increasing capacity. As the influx came in [this time around] it was much easier to do intake. Cooper said the Humane Society would continue sheltering animals and providing 24/7 care as long as it takes. Randy Freeman, marketing manager at Ventura County Animal Services, echoed that sentiment regarding the temporary shelter at the county fairgrounds, which was sheltering 180 horses, ponies, and other large animals as of Tuesday night. The animals may need help a while longer. As of Tuesday, the Woolsey Fire had torched nearly 100,000 acres, destroyed an estimated 435 structures and claimed two lives, according to Cal Fire. Full containment is expected by November 18, but even as thousands of people start to return home, recovery will be a long, painful process for many residents and their animal companions. At least one ranchWhite Cloud Ranch in Malibu burned to the ground, although, thankfully, all 48 horses and ponies were evacuated. The bright spot amidst all the horror is how the community came together to help one another, and nowhere is that more evident than in the mass mobilization to rescue creatures that cannot rescue themselves. It will be everybodys turn sooner or later. I have to tell you, the community has been amazing, Clay said, recalling how volunteers with the animal welfare organization Operation Blankets of Love showed up with supplies and stayed on campus for three days to help the small animals. In addition to the local vet the school partners with, a volunteer vet showed up out of nowhere to lend a hand, too. Phoenix said that as designated shelters became full Thursday night, private barns across a wide area started making themselves available. People were driving these animals 70, 80 miles away from the fire, she said. She also made her home available for people and animalsthe calculus was simple. It will be everybodys turn sooner or later, Phoenix said.","As residents of Malibu fled their seaside city in droves to escape a raging wildfire on Thursday, volcanologist Jess Phoenix hitched her two-horse trailer to her Ford F-250, hopped on the 101-freeway, and headed straight for the inferno.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The Camp Fire that overtook the Northern California town of Paradise last week quickly became the most destructive wildfire in state history. Now, with more than 42 dead and hundreds still missing, it is the states deadliest. The Camp Fire began on Thursday. Downed power lines likely sparked the blaze, but powerful winds and bone dry conditions quickly turned that spark into a major conflagration. It raced across the landscape, burning up to 80 acres per minute and leaving precious little time for authorities to alert residents in Paradise, a town of 27,000 that stood directly in the fires path. When the evacuation alert came, traffic jams quickly clogged the roads heading out of town. Residents fleeing in cars were forced to abandon their vehicles on the road as the fire quickly overtook the town. The fire is still burning largely uncontained, but first responders have begun to sort through the eerie aftermath. In addition to assessing burned houses, cars, and forests, theyve begun to discover the bodies of victims who were unable to escape the flames. Authorities have accounted for 42 victims as of Monday night, surpassing the 1933 Griffith Park Fire that was formally Californias deadliest. Many died in their cars or on the road as they tried to escape the flames. Other bodies have been found in homes where people attempted to ride out the fire or simply couldnt evacuate. At a press conference on Sunday night, Cal Fire officials said there are still 228 people unaccounted for. The Peshtigo Fire in 1871 is considered the deadliest fire in American history, killing up to 2,500 people. There were of course no phones, TV, or internet to alert people of the incoming blaze or cars to escape it. The Great Fire of 1910 that struck Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia, is another historically deadly blaze. Records kept by the National Interagency Fire Center show that it, charred 3 million acres in the Northern Rockies and killed 78 people, many of whom were wildfires. The blaze set in motion widespread changes for forest management in the U.S., including decades of fire suppression. Those policies coupled with climate change and more people living in forests have in part given rise the dangerous fires we see today. The risks for intense conflagrations are only going to increase as the climate warms further. In any other world, the Camp Fire would be a jumping off point to discuss how these factors interact and how the federal government could help ensure this type of event never happens again. Instead, were debunking the presidents cruel and ignorant tweets.","The Camp Fire that overtook the Northern California town of Paradise last week quickly became the most destructive wildfire in state history.

THOMAS FULLER and MITCH SMITH,"They later watched their house burn down on CNN, and assumed that the old Ford had also been destroyed. Despite repeated attempts, they have not yet been allowed to return to their property. Were trying to be as brave as we can, said Mr. Westbrook, a retired Costco worker who has been staying with his sister since the fire. When you start talking about it, its hard to talk about. We start choking up. When he is finally allowed back in, Mr. Westbrook will find a neighborhood in ruins. Houses are gone, trees stripped, power lines flattened. But there are odd patches of normalcy, testaments to the unpredictability of a wildfire. Down the block, an old Chevrolet El Camino was untouched. A festive lawn decoration in Mr. Westbrooks yard survived. And so did the Model T. The 1915 Ford, bought a year ago for $16,000, was just the latest antique car Mr. Westbrook had acquired. He had paid a mechanic to fix it up, and then practiced driving it on the country roads near his house, sometimes getting up to 35 m.p.h. But its skinny tires and unique pedal system made maneuvering it a challenge. He had recently put it up for sale. Im too danged old to learn how to drive the thing right, and I dont want to hurt it, Mr. Westbrook said. The old cars fate is now fairly low on his list of concerns.

Steve Gorman,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A wildfire burned unchecked early on Friday in northern California, threatening homes and shutting down an interstate highway where motorists had to race from their vehicles. The Delta Fire has already scorched 22,000 acres (8,903 hectares) since it began on Wednesday in a Shasta-Trinity National Forest canyon along the Sacramento River, about 250 miles (402 km) north of San Francisco, the California Interagency Incident Management Team said in an advisory. As of Thursday, firefighters had been unable to contain the blaze, said Brandon Vaccaro, a spokesman for the Delta fire command team, but a gradual rise in humidity is forecast, which could help slow the fire’s growth. A stretch of Interstate 5 remained closed on Friday after the fire came near the highway. Motorists were forced to flee on foot on Wednesday before flames engulfed their cars and trucks, local media reported and fire officials said. The fire was threatening about 150 homes and other buildings in the sparsely populated region. About 300 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, Vaccaro said on Thursday. Farther north, an evacuation warning was in effect for the town of Dunsmuir, advising some 1,600 residents to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice. The blaze was near the site of the Carr fire, which killed eight people and incinerated hundreds of dwellings in and around the town of Redding this summer, becoming one of California’s most destructive wildfires on record. No casualties have been reported from the Delta Fire. The blaze has raged with the same intensity seen in several wildfires in recent months. Fueled by drought-ravaged pine forests thick with dead and dying timber, flames spread quickly, leaping from tree-top to tree-top and hurling showers of embers into more dried-out vegetation. The Delta fire was one of about 15 blazes burning across California this week. Three times more ground has burned in California so far this year than at the same point in 2017, which ranks as one of the most destructive seasons on record.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year. At the time, the decision seemed like a no brainer, leaving behind a landscape dominated by humans for one where homes mingled with the forest and rolling chaparral hills of Northern California. But the dream of moving home turned into a nightmare on an early October night. Whipped by gusty winds and tinderbox conditions, the Tubbs Fire roared into town, melting cars, consuming homes, and leaving nearly two dozen dead en route to becoming California’s most destructive fire in history. By the time the flames were contained on Halloween, the fire had claimed 5,636 structures, including Wentz’s parent’s home where she had grown up. “I’m definitely reconsidering my whole perspective of where I want to live and how I want to live and how I want to raise a family,” Wentz, a staff attorney at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Earther. “It’s hard to explain that, to feel like I can’t return to that place.” Millions of Americans may soon be forced to confront similar feelings. California has been at the epicenter of a fiery crisis over the past year as everything from iconic locales like Wine Country to interstate towns like Redding burn. More generally, across the West towns small and large have been decimated by wildfires in recent years thanks to rising temperatures, more human-sparked fires, and more humans living in harms way. It raises an uncomfortable question that coastal residents, policymakers, and insurance underwriters have been forced to grapple with in recent years: Is it worth it to build (or rebuild) in a landscape primed for explosive fires? The answer—for now—is yes, but that calculus could change as rising temperatures and more frequent droughts conspire to make the forest a riskier place to live. And it’s an open question of who will foot the bill as that risk increases—and what happens when the risk becomes too high. “Increasing wildfire risk is a top concern of many insurers,” Chris Folkman, a senior director at catastrophe modeling firm RMS, told Earther. 2017 was the costliest wildfire season in American history. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimates that were $18.4 billion in wildfire-related damages, including three separate California fires that topped $1 billion. The losses were an eye opener for insurers. Folkman said the previous standard for issuing policies in fire prone areas relied on surcharges in high risk areas based on what insurers viewed as “frequent but manageable outbreaks of claims.” “As we’ve learned from recent events, this approach will no longer cut it,” he said. Indeed, this year has seen fire-lated damages continue to mount, with the Carr Fire currently sitting as the sixth-most destructive fire in California history and the Ranch Fire taking the claim as the largest. Across the West, more than 5.9 million acres have burned for the year-to-date, upwards of a million acres more than than the 10-year average. Rising temperatures are in part responsible for more dramatic wildfire. But humans are making fires worse in other ways as well. The vast majority of fires are started by us, and decades of fire suppression have increased fuel loads for incendiary fires. Perhaps most importantly, there’s more people living at the so-called wildland-urban interface or WUI, than ever before. A paper published earlier this year found that from 1990 to 2010, the WUI grew from 224,325 square miles to nearly 297,300 as 13.4 million new homes were built there. “This area is larger than the state of Wisconsin, and made the WUI the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States,” Miranda Mockrin, a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who co-authored the paper, told Earther. All of this means more property and people in harm’s way, upping the risk of catastrophic fires. There are a few ways that risk is currently being mitigated. The most obvious is firefighting to either tamp down fires or control them in ways that can help clear some of that heavy fuel load. But fighting fires is a costly endeavor. Last year, the federal government spent $2 billion fighting wildfires with state agencies chipping in billions more to combat blazes. “A lot of that money is spent on protecting homes,” Judd Boomhower, an economist at the University of California, San Diego studying fires, told Earther. That creates what economists call a moral hazard, essentially encouraging risky behavior. In the case of wildfires, firefighting incentivizes people to either move to fire-prone areas or rebuild after disaster strikes. This means insurance rates don’t reflect the true risks. What’s more, a number of states have something called the FAIR Plan, which offers individuals insurance in areas deemed too disaster prone by private insurers. That includes a number of fire prone states, such as California, New Mexico, and Oregon. Those policies often have high premiums and are only viewed as a last resort. But California law also prohibits insurers from cancelling a homeowner’s policy while they’re rebuilding after a fire or other natural disaster. Moreover, companies have to renew a policy at least once after that, making rebuilding a much more attractive option. “I think we’re on a threshold.” Boomhower said (while stressing he was not advocating for it) that the most market-based solution would be to charge communities a fee for firefighting services. While private wildland firefighting might be a libertarian wet dream, it’s definitely not politically palatable. It’s also unfeasible to let insurers cancel policies in the wake of wildfire damage, since kicking people while they’re down is a surefire way to lose an election. But taking the two most obvious fixes off the table doesn’t mean the problem is totally intractable in the short-term. In her work looking at the wildland-urban interface, Mockrin found some communities were already adapting to our hotter, more flammable present in the wake of fires. Their solutions ran the gauntlet from voluntary programs and education about risks to more stringent building codes. But nearly all the solutions have focused on new builds, leaving older homes facing higher risks. “It’s very rare to see regulations that require retrofitting,” she said. “The only thing I’ve seen for that is if your roof needs to be replaced, it has to be fire resistant.” Folkman said RMS is working on a new wildfire model that will help capture some of the risk in more actionable terms. The idea is that quantifying the biggest risks—say rising temperatures, drier fuels, or housing density—will allow state agencies or even local communities can take more preventative actions that keep houses safer. It could also help insurers set rates that are more in line with the risks while also rewarding good behaviors. That’s something already happening in some places. In Colorado, for example, a number of insurers require some fire mitigation for homeowners to get a policy. Beyond these fixes, there’s even bigger picture stuff, like prescribed burns to reduce fuel loads, fixing the firefighting budget or, you know, reducing carbon emissions so the climate doesn’t get even hotter and more fire-prone. But eventually, the rising tide of risk and repeated losses could be too much, forcing individuals and communities to confront some hard truths. Wentz wasn’t ready to leave California so soon after moving back home. Instead, she settled on buying a place in what she described as “the center of town.” It’s a compromise much like managed retreat somewhat inland from the increasing rising ocean to a place where risk is lower but still present. “Over half the acreage in Lake County has burned over the past five years,” Wentz said. “You’re seeing fires come through multiple times. Once you have two fires in the area over a couple decades, that’s a sign to insurance companies. I think we’re on a threshold.” We could find out what’s on the other side sooner than later, and it’s unlikely to be pretty.","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year.

Hindustan Times,"The Karnataka government sought help from the Indian Air Force on Monday as it raced to contain fires raging in Bandipur forests, home to one of the country’s most popular tiger habitat and where an estimated 3,000 hectares of land is estimated to have been burnt down over the last five days.
An estimated 1,000 people — 300 local villagers and at least 500 state forest staff — too joined in fire-fighting efforts even as dry, windy conditions continued to fan the flames and officials grappled with a lack of local sources of water. 
“Decided to use Air Force’s help to contain the fire. The Air Force chief was contacted and a request was placed for immediate help. The Air Force Chief responded positively and preparations are on for operation,” chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said in a tweet on Monday.
The chief minister also held a review meeting with chief secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar, senior police officers, and forest department officials to coordinate fire-fighting efforts.
The fire first came to notice on Friday, though it is unclear how many hours had passed before it started. Officials of the Forest Survey of India, a Union government agency that monitors forest fires using satellite reports, said alerts had been automatically sent out at 2:20pm on Friday.
The forest fire has gutted thousands of acres of land and is feared to have killed hundreds of wild animals, reptiles and insects. “Forest fires not only destroy habitats and food sources, but they also kill thousands of smaller mammals, ground-nesting birds, insects, slow moving reptiles and other wildlife species. Even young ones of animals such as tigers, leopards, dholes, chital, sambar deer are at times killed by forest fires as the mothers leave them in tree cavities and smaller dens,” said Sanjay Gubbi of the Nature Conservation Foundation.
The 874 sq km Bandipur national park and tiger reserve is among the most popular protected areas in India. The park, along with neighbouring national parks of Nagarhole in Karnataka, Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu and Wayanad in Kerala constitute one of the largest contiguous forests in India. Initial estimates indicate nearly 3,000 hectares may have been turned to ash – an area roughly the size of 1,500 grounds the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Environmental experts said the areas hit could take 25 years to recover. “Regardless of the reason, the damage caused this time is incredible. I think for the flora to recover completely, it might take another 25 years even,” said retired forest official HC Kantharaju said.
State forest officials said the principal cause of the fire is the weather, which has been unusually warm over the past month and is now marked by dry winds. But officials also suspect the role of “miscreants”, who may have deliberately started the fire to protest that forest department’s delay in hiring fire spotters. 
“Fire was man-made. It is believed that miscreants from the area have set the fire as an act of vengeance for not being hired as fire guards this season,” said P Sridhar, principal chief conservator of forest, Karnataka. 
A fire spotter earns 320 per day and each range hires at least 10, making it a critical source of income for many in the region.
According to the Air Force, two helicopters flew 10 sorties on Monday, dumping approximately 30,000 litre of water to fight the fire in the region. “The helicopters have been positioned at Mysuru and will commence the fire fighting operations at sunrise,” a statement said.
Movement of people and vehicles, including cars, buses and trucks have been banned on the National Highway-67 and inter-state roads until further notice across Bandipur.

"Brent Rose on Earther, shared by Maddie Stone to Gizmodo","I cant tell you how it started, or even where or when. I will not be the most informed person that you will find regarding the fire currently invading the city of Malibu. I can tell you, though, what it felt like trying to get out of there Friday morning, and what it looked like. A little over three years ago, I moved into a van and started driving around the country for a project I was calling Connected States. On Thursday night, I was parked at friends property in southern Malibu, about a mile up a canyon. I woke up at 8am Friday morning for a physical therapy appointment 5 miles north on the Pacific Coast Highway (aka the PCH). I realized that I didnt have any reception, but that isnt totally unusual for the area. The winds had been extreme all night, and I figured a tree had taken out some power-lines. Photo: Brent Rose When I got down to the PCH at about 8:20am, I saw that traffic was bumper-to-bumper heading south. Its LA, so traffic is par for the course, but this was much worse than usual. I figured a tree must have fallen on the highway, too. I started heading north, and finally my phone got back online, and I saw a text from my mom saying, Please tell me that you have evacuated to somewhere safe!! Thats when I realized that something was very wrong, and it was a whole lot worse than a downed power-line. Some of my video footage is in this video. I called my mom back, and thats when I heard about the fire. Suddenly, everything made sense. I promised her Id get out as quickly as possible. I was kicking myself, though. Id just driven five miles toward what now appeared to be a giant mushroom cloud forming over the hills, and traffic heading south was basically stopped. I had probably added three to four hours to my evacuation. I checked Google Maps, and all of the canyon roads heading east looked to be at a standstill, or blocked off by police. I knew that I didnt want to get stuck in one of those with flames approaching. North still looked relatively clear, though. And if I made it as far as Oxnard (northwest of the fire) I figured from there I could cut east to highway 5 and get back to LA. So thats what I did. Photo: Brent Rose It was a questionable choice. Traffic was moving more or less freely because everybody was headed in the opposite direction. Seeing that gave me a sinking feeling. Was I doing something very stupid? I pulled over and talked to a cop, though, and he told me that the PCH was basically clear to Ventura. Despite it being the direction of the fire, he thought it was a better idea than sitting in the traffic and waiting for the fire to close in, so I went for it. Photo: Brent Rose As I got closer to the largest cloud of smoke Ive ever seenand I was in Sonoma when the Wine Country fires broke out last yearI started seeing massive flames on the hills. The winds were still blowing hard from the east, so those flames and smoke were all heading toward the ocean, and to those of us on the PCH. My eyes, nose, and throat were all burning by this point. Photo: Brent Rose On the radio I heard the anchor tell people with horses and livestock to head to the parking lot at Zuma State Beach, just as I was driving by it. Sure enough, there were horses being led across the road. Eventually, the smoke got so bad that I poured water onto a t-shirt and used it as a mask. I wish Id thought of it sooner, as a nasty headache was already setting in. Photo: Brent Rose By the time I reached Ventura County around 10:30am, the smoke had gotten much worse. It effectively looked like the sun had set. Everybodys headlights were on, and white ash rained down from the sky. It would have been beautiful if it wasnt a harbinger of devastation. I didnt have reception for most of the drive, so I was eager to let my family know I was okay. Photo: Brent Rose I managed to get in touch with a friend back in LA shortly after I crossed the county line, and he told me his friends in Malibu Lake had almost certainly lost their house late Thursday night. Another friend of mine is from Paradise, CA. Both of her parents lost their homes as the blaze tore through the city Thursday night. Luckily, they got out in time. Photo: Brent Rose Eventually, I made it all the way to Oxnard, which is where I am now, writing this from a café, and trying to figure out where to go next. Oxnard isnt in immediate danger from the fire, but the air quality is awful. Having made it all the way here, heading back to LA isnt a particularly appealing prospect. For all of the times when the whole #vanlife thing is a pain, I have to say Ive never been more grateful for it than I am right now. I didnt have to scramble to gather important documents or photos, or make any tough decisions about what to take and what to leave behind. I just stuck the key in the ignition and went. So many others werent so lucky, and my heart goes out to all of them. Im hoping that sweet little canyon in Malibu, with my friends family home, will still be there when the smoke clears, but ultimately Im thankful that I got away unscathed.

"Matt Novak on Earther, shared by Matt Novak to Gizmodo","Americans of all political persuasions are rushing to blame the devastating Camp Fire on their political foes, but Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke would like everyone to take a deep breath and calm down... and recognize that radical environmentalists are to blame. Zinke, who is under investigation for numerous alleged ethics violations, appeared on the Breitbart News podcast on Sunday where he found a sympathetic audience for his vitriolic bullshit. Its not a time for finger pointing, Zinke said before immediately pointing fingers. We know the problem, its been years of neglect and in many cases its been these radical environmentalists that want nature to take its course. We have dead and dying timberwe can manage it using best science, breast [sic] practices. To be clear, no credible scientist believes that radical environmentalists are to blame for the devastation of the Camp Fire, which currently has a death toll of 79 victims with roughly 700 people still unaccounted for. The direct cause of the fire is still under investigation, but climate change has made this the worst wildfire in Californias recorded history. You look at Finland... Zinke continued before trailing off and not doubling down on President Trumps claims about how they rake the forests in that country. Instead, Zinke pivoted rhetorically and mentioned... Germany. I had an opportunity to live in Germany... Germany has the Black Forest, their forests are healthy. They dont have the catastrophic burns because they manage the forests. And I will lay this on the foot [sic] of those environmental radicals that have prevented us from managing the forest for years. And you know what? This is on them. The interviewer then asked a really strange question that seemed to be teeing up some kind of conspiracy theory. I dont know too much about the geography of California, but are we sure that both of these are wildfires? the interviewer asked. Well, you know, whats the definition of a wildfire? Its either ignited by lightning, by human... theres some suspicion that it could be a power line, Zinke responded, clearly thrown by the idiocy of the question. You can listen to the entire interview over at Breitbarts Soundcloud account, if you really hate yourself that much. The interview ends with Zinke saying the allegations against him are outrageous and false. He characterized the attacks on his family, though some of the allegations directly involve his wife and Zinkes attempts to get her classified as an Interior Department volunteer so that she could travel for free. This is how angry the resistance movement is, Zinke said. Im an American first, Ive always been red, white, and blue.

 Australia's record-breaking heat saw a high of 49.5C north of Adelaide
Australia recorded its hottest month ever in January, with mean temperatures exceeding 30C (86F) for the first time.
The extreme heat, during the country's summer period, was ""unprecedented"", according to the Bureau of Meteorology.
At least five January days were among the 10 warmest on record, with daily national temperature highs of 40C.
The blistering conditions caused wildfire deaths, bushfires and a rise in hospital admissions. It also led to the death of more than 90 wild horses.
The mean is the average between the average coldest temperature and average hottest temperature.
Rainfall was also below average for most areas, meteorologists said.
This comes at a time when across the Pacific, temperatures have plunged to -37C (-35F) in parts of North America due to a polar vortex.","For the first time, January saw mean temperatures exceed 30C (86F) across the country.",2019-02-01T07:22:30Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Australia records hottest month ever in January,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-47085785,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B78/production/_105427486_mediaitem105427482.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,wildfire,1

In the northern town of Paradise, an eerie calm has settled over some areas as the burned out remains of civilization are surveyed. Paradise has been hit by the Camp Fire, one of two major wildfires turning thousands of peoples lives upside down. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the fire quadrupled in size overnight overtaking 70,000 acres and firefighters are still working to contain it. So far, five people have been confirmed dead. They were found in vehicles trying to escape the blaze. Footage of the aftermath is trickling out online and you can see two devastating clips below.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Coping with the aftermath of such a disaster can be daunting enough at any age, but for those in their 70s and 80s, it can seem almost impossible. Half of them dont have it in them to start all over again, said Mari Stewart, the nursing supervisor for the clinic at the East Avenue Church in Chico, which has been turned into a shelter. Disasters can go on taking a heavy toll long after the initial crisis has passed, experts say. Being cut off from your medicines, being cut off from your medical care, being cut off from your social supports, the added stress of having lost things and living in an evacuation center and having to relocate studies clearly show that there are additional hospitalizations that occur, even deaths that occur, in the months afterward, said Dr. David Eisenman, the director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters. When older people are displaced, he said, for them to not be allowed to rebuild and live in their community again might produce a kind of harm thats much greater than if you or I or younger people had to rebuild and move away. By the time the Camp Fire was declared contained on Sunday, it had burned more than 153,000 acres and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, almost 14,000 of them residences, with hundreds more damaged. The death toll for the fire stood at 85. Most of the 500 evacuees who have been in and out of the East Avenue Church shelter since the fire began have been older people, said Ron Zimmer, the pastor of the church. The challenge, he said, is not just caring for them, but finding long-term answers for people who have lost everything and have little wherewithal to rebuild. Younger families tend to have larger social circles, Mr. Zimmer said, but our seniors tend to have closing social circles, so they dont have anywhere else to go.","Many who fled the flames ravaging Paradise, Calif., were retirees with health problems and few resources. “Half of them don’t have it in them to start all over again,” a nursing supervisor at a shelter said.",2018-11-25T23:25:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After a Wildfire, Rebuilding Life Can Be Hardest for the Oldest",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/california-wildfire-senior-shelter.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/us/26calfire1/26calfire1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,1
"SIMON ROMERO, TIM ARANGO and THOMAS FULLER","One of the criticisms or the lessons learned was, hey, try to stagger your evacuations, Sheriff Honea said. In Paradise, the sheriff ordered staged evacuations according to zones in immediate peril. If everyone had been ordered to leave at once, the evacuation may have been more perilous, he said. If we hadnt tried to evacuate those zones with an imminent threat versus the ones where the threat was progressing towards them, I believe the traffic would have been even worse, he said. Paradise, given how it was planned and developed over decades, with homes built on a ridge surrounded by forests and just a handful of roads out, seemed poised to one day face disaster. The town studied evacuation routes after a 2008 wildfire in the area. The Paradise mayor, Jody Jones, is a traffic specialist who spent years working for the state agency that manages roads. But the mayor and other law enforcement officials argued that the Camp Fire spread so quickly at one point moving the equivalent length of a football field per second that it overwhelmed the ability of emergency workers. After the 2008 wildfire, a Butte County Grandy Jury report noted the difficulty residents had in evacuating, and advised that the authorities find ways to make it easier for residents to escape. Instead, the authorities narrowed Skyway in the center of town to improve pedestrian safety, reduce traffic and promote commerce a decision that is sure to be scrutinized in the aftermath of the Camp Fire. Eric Reinbold, the police chief of Paradise, was skeptical that removing a lane from parts of the downtown area made the evacuation more difficult. I dont know that it would have made a difference or not, Chief Reinbold said. You just cant evacuate that many people in minutes or hours. A recent editorial in the The Chico Enterprise-Record described the towns preoccupation with emergency evacuations in recent years. People prepared. Fire prevention officials planned. They drilled. They worked with homeowners. They invented fire-safe councils and Fire on the Ridge and sent fire prevention officials to schools via a program called Fire Pals. They raised money to keep fire lookouts open when the state said it wouldnt. Eventually, geography and topography proved to be the trap everyone thought it was. John Owens counts himself among the lucky residents of Paradise. He and his wife and their dog are now sleeping in a friends car in the parking lot of a Burger King in Chico. Their home in a trailer park in Paradise was destroyed, as was his Ford pickup, for which he had no insurance. But were alive, man, said Mr. Owens, 57, a welder. He said he had been working in Chico on the day of the fire when he got a call from his wife, who was at home.","In the frenzied first hours of the Camp Fire as it bore down on Paradise, Calif., only a fraction of residents received emergency alerts or evacuation orders from local authorities.",2018-11-21T18:40:32Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","A Frantic Call, a Neighbor’s Knock, but Few Official Alerts as Wildfire Closed In",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/us/paradise-fires-emergency-alerts.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/us/00firealert-01/00firealert-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,1
CHRISTINE HAUSER and LOUIS LUCERO II,"In Durango, Colo., the authorities canceled the city’s annual fireworks display because of the dry conditions. Other events were affected by the smoke, said Michael Kelly, a community events supervisor. The city’s Freedom 5K race and an outdoor reading of historical documents were canceled because of poor air quality. A pancake breakfast and a bicycle ride were delayed, but they began later in the day, after some of the smoke had cleared. Mr. Kelly said city officials, worried about a recent drought, canceled the fireworks display before the 416 fire started. “We didn’t want to take the risk,” he said. Officials considered holding a laser and drone show, but decided not to because it would have been too expensive, he said. “But there are still a lot of people in town and we are going to show them a good time,” Mr. Kelly said. Fireworks were also canceled in Silverton, Colo., a town with a sightseeing train and soaring mountain ranges just north of Durango. The city said that visitors heading to the town to celebrate “will be greeted with a stark reminder of just how dangerous wildfires can be.” “The 416 fire has left a 20-mile scar between Hermosa and Needles on the west side of the road,” the city said, referring to Highway 500. “Thousands of people were displaced.”","Drones and light shows are becoming popular in some Western states, as Independence Day celebrations are adjusted because of wildfires and drought.",2018-07-04T20:58:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A July 4 Without Fireworks?

Mark Kaufman,"After leaping over California's Sacramento River, the swiftly-moving Carr Fire entered the City of Redding, home to more than 90,000 people, on Thursday night. The firestorm melted transmission lines, sent a towering, mushroom-like cloud into the sky, and prompted the evacuation of entire communities in the western part of the city. And two people have already lost their lives while fighting the fire. ""It easily moved across the river,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, who works and lives in Redding, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: The heat waves scorching Europe were given a serious boost by climate change ""The river is reasonably wide in that location,"" Belongie added. ""It’s normally a significant barrier — but not when you have that sort of fire."" Redding sits in a heavily-forested region of the state, a place rife in dry vegetation, like much of parched California. Making matters worse, the National Weather Service predicts temperatures in Redding will hit 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, prompting the service to issue an ""excessive heat warning."" ""It is extreme fire behavior — and dramatic — just like you would see in the Hollywood movies, if you will,"" said Belongie. ""It's quite the disaster."" The forests around Redding are particularly fire-prone, as extended periods of warm weather have dried out the grasses and vegetation, turning them to tinder, said Belongie. The Western U.S., and California specifically, have been besieged by powerful fires this summer, which recently forced the closure of a smoke-filled Yosemite National Park. This follows on the heels of California's worst fire season on record — in 2017. This is part of a growing trend, as wildfires now burn substantially more land than they did 30 years ago. Burned forests are now releasing so much fine, burned material into the air that, during the worst events, a vast swathe of the Western U.S. now experiences worsening air quality, while the rest of the nation's air gradually improves. Wildfires may be common in the Western U.S. — sparked by lightning, downed power lines, or people acting foolishly — but their acceleration into massive, dominant fires is further stoked by human-caused climate change, say scientists. Warm air further dries out the land and provides blazes with more fuel, though gusty winds are hugely important contributors — if not the most important factor. Historic mismanagement of forests also play a significant role. If you live in NW #Redding GET OUT NOW, ! Run, walk just get out, streets are bottlenecked and clogged do not wait! #Carrfire — Bernie Deyo (@EPN473) July 27, 2018 As of Tuesday, the Carr Fire, which started on July 23, had expanded to over 44,000 acres, with barely any containment. Conditions are ripe for the continued spread of the blaze, as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) noted that ""continued hot, dry weather is forecasted for the remainder of the week with triple digit temperatures."" Belongie said she has prepared for the worst, if flames, edged on by winds pushing flames over parched land, continue moving through Redding. ""I’m one of the luckier ones, as we got everything important to us out of the house,"" she said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Marina Galperina to Gizmodo","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post. Punching in different keywordshurricane, wildfire, heat waveturned up photos from around the world. Eventually, I settled on Southern Californias Woolsey Fire bearing down on the mansions of Malibu, because it best encapsulates this moment in time. Its the perfect metaphor for 2018, the year when climate changes influence on our weather crystalized further, when it the flames showed up in our proverbial (and in some cases, literal) backyard. And the planet, our home, will go up in smoke if we dont act soon. It wasnt just fires either. Heat, winds, water, and other weather disasters created horrific damage all over. Here are all the ways the world burned in 2018, a catastrophe that will only get worse if we dont address climate change soon. Flames The Woolsey Fire was a $1.6-billion disaster that wouldve been the worst imaginable fire this year if not for what was happening in Northern California at the same time. The Camp Fire burned an entire town to the ground, left dozens dead, thousands without a home, and caused California to temporarily have the worst air quality on the planet. But Californias fire story doesnt even stop there. In August the Mendocino Complex became Californias largest in history, just a year after the Thomas Fire took the title. Oh, and of course there was the Carr Fire, which also cracked the list of most destructive fires in Californias history and spawned a massive firenado. And flames were hardly limited to California. British Columbia saw day turn into night thanks to wildfires. Sweden went up in smoke. So did Siberia. Even as winter has quashed the flames in the northern hemisphere, now its Australias turn to face unprecedented fire conditions. Heat You cant really have flames with heat. And in a warming world, theres heat in spades. This year will likely go down as the fourth-warmest on record for the globe. Next year could be even hotter. While only the Earth itself really experiences the global average temperature, the rest of us felt its rise in the form of heat waves. The aforementioned Scandinavian fires wouldve been impossible without record heat that seared the region this summer. In fact, much of Europe was gripped by heat, and weird things happened. The ice on top of Swedens tallest mountain shrunk so much, it lost the title of tallest mountain. Englands long-buried ancient villages emerged in the form of crop markings. Then there were the records. Temperatures rose above freezing at the worlds northernmost weather station in the dead of the dark, Arctic winter. Japan had its hottest day ever recorded. A heat wave led to the hottest day ever recorded in all of Africa. Pakistan saw the hottest April day ever recorded on Earth. Death Valley recorded the hottest month on Earth period. It was hot, yall. Waves, wind, and rain After 2017, you would think we could get a break with the hurricanes and typhoons and whatnot. But no. The U.S. saw record-setting Florence and Michael devastate North Carolina and Florida, respectively. Each storm is a multi-billion dollar disaster, marking a second straight year of multiple violent hurricanes hitting the U.S. A freak tropical storm also made landfall in the Great Lakes, because why not. Other cyclone basins also delivered punch after punch after punch. The eastern Pacific churned out multiple storms that underwent rapid intensification. In the central Pacific, Hurricane Lane brought torrential rain to Hawaii, while Walaka washed an entire island off the map. In the western Pacific, we saw a freaky annular typhoon with a huge eye as well as widespread destruction in the Marianas Islands thanks to Typhoon Yutu. The basin also spawned the strongest storm on Earth of 2018: Super Typhoon Mangkhut had winds reach 200 mph over the open ocean, though thankfully they quieted down by landfall. This list is hardly exhaustive, but then, wed be here for days if it were. The point is were seeing more catastrophic weather, climate change is in part behind it, and the time to address it is in short supply. The weather wont stop in 2019. There will be more records and losses and questions about how to rebuild or even if we should. But that doesnt mean were screwed. It means we need courage, and on that front there are some encouraging signs, including new members of Congress who actually get the monumental challenge we face and are willing to rise and meet it. Hopefully with their leadership, 2019 will look a little less bleak.","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Massive, ravaging wildfires are now the norm on the West Coast, with the state of California now regularly breaking fire records, Canada’s British Columbia experiencing the third-worst fire season in recorded history, and all the smoke from those fires spreading across much of the continent and even further. But don’t worry, an area man has a plan, according to Global News, and that plan is blowing all the smoke from Canadian wildfires back up across the border with box fans. Per Global News’ report, Spokane, Washington resident Caleb Moon formed a Facebook event titled “ Blow Spokane’s Smoke Away to Canada.” It is impossible to believe that the August 24th event, which asks each of the city’s 550,000 to place “at least 5 box fans on their roof” to accomplish this, is anything but a joke. But Moon at least played it earnest in an interview with the network: The event may sound like a joke, but Moon said he’s serious about this. “We figure a small box fan can move smoke about six feet, so if you put 500,000 of them together, you can do the math on that, we can probably get it pretty far into Canada,” he said. British Columbia Centre for Disease Control senior environmental health specialist Sarah Henderson told Global News the idea was “very ridiculous,” noting that a fan does not magically clean air but “pulls air through it.” So even if it did work—which, again, it would not—the fans would probably just pull in fresh smoke from California. In any case, dumb plans for how to deal with the wildfires are kind of in vogue in the U.S. right now. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has spent much of the past few weeks rambling about how the fires are caused by anything from poor forest management to “environmental terrorists” and definitely not climate change, as is agreed to be a major factor by experts. Donald Trump has blamed the fires on “ bad environmental laws ” preventing firefighters from just spraying them with water, which is complete nonsense but nonetheless served as a pretext for the White House to seize control of protected California waterways and open up more federal lands to logging.

Lexy Savvides,"This is part of our Road Trip 2018 summer series "" Taking It to Extremes,"" which looks at what happens when people mix everyday tech with insane situations. Smoke is billowing from a five-story window. In between those thick plumes, I know there are two people trapped inside — but I can see only one. How do I know there's a second person? From a thermal image that's being livestreamed from a drone. Thanks to the video's clear picture of who's inside the room, incident command instructs a firefighter to climb the ladder and make the rescue. Fortunately, this isn't a real fire. It's a demonstration at a Menlo Park Fire District station in California, showing a crowd of firefighters how new drone imaging technology can help search and rescue operations. In the heart of Silicon Valley, Menlo Park is perfectly situated to test new technology. It's also received donations from Facebook to buy drones and thermal cameras. The timing of the demonstration couldn't be more apt. It's fire season in California, and thousands of firefighters are battling blazes across the state, like the mammoth Mendocino Complex Fire that's already torched nearly 423,000 acres and the Carr Fire, which has so far destroyed 1,600 structures and claimed seven lives. To help win their war against wildfires, state and federal departments are turning to drone missions for reconnaissance and data gathering. The California Air National Guard, for example, is using a military grade UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), called the MQ-9 Reaper, at both the Mendocino Complex and Carr fires. The drone captures live video of the blaze from 20,000 feet and can stay in the air for hours, identifying where the fire is spreading. No matter if they're small quadcopters or larger fixed-wing drones, UAVs are becoming an invaluable tool for firefighters to safely identify threats and reduce exposure to dangerous conditions. Some are equipped with lidar technology, which uses pulsed light to measure distances and generate precise, 3D fuel maps that show where fires are most likely to spread. The Menlo Park Fire District was one of the first in the US to start a drone program. In the four years since, more than 180 fire departments across the country have bought drones for fire and rescue operations. Relatively few have pushed drone usage to the same level as Menlo Park, which has set up a dedicated drone command center and which trains firefighters from around the country to pilot the aerial devices. These eyes in the sky can navigate tight spaces and fly lower than helicopters can. With them, crews can see objects in the path of a fire, areas of intense heat and even people trapped in areas of thick smoke. Last year, the Menlo Park team flew drones equipped with thermal cameras to help battle the South Fork Fire in Yosemite National Park. The images showed crews when a fire had jumped a containment line and helped them steer clear of dangerous conditions, like weakened trees and intense heat. ""How guys get killed is weather changes on a dime, sometimes there's no real warning,"" says Tom Calvert, Menlo Park Fire's battalion chief. ""By having a drone, your sphere of awareness gets a lot bigger."" Send in the drones Menlo Park Fire Capt. Chris Dennebaum walks me through the tech room at the back of the station. It's filled from with cameras, TVs, chargers, an assortment of batteries and what I'm really here to see: the drone collection. The department has almost every consumer DJI drone, including the small Mavic Pro, which you can in the air within minutes after unfolding its arms. There's also the larger Phantom 4 (the most popular drone flown in the US) used for training and mapping missions. Then we get to the serious flying machines that not only capture images but can also carry a payload. The DJI Matrice 210 and 600 hold up to 10 pounds — so anything from cellphones to LED lights to radios to life preservers can potentially be dropped to people who need them. These larger drones can also carry impressive camera systems. One camera, for instance, boasts 180x zoom, while the DJI Zenmuse XT2 has two eyes in one: a thermal module to see areas of heat through smoke, and a regular 4K camera. The capability lets pilots lock onto the hottest object in the frame, or add the regular video image on top of the thermal image. Lidar can produce detailed images of power lines, poles, trees and other potential fire hazards along the power grid. Flight Evolved ""Flying with just thermal imaging active means the pilot can quickly lose depth perception,"" says Dennebaum. That's why it's helpful to be able to toggle between the views or overlay one on top of the other. Menlo Park is also building a mobile drone command center that'll allow the crew to pilot several aircraft at once and view data across multiple screens. The command center can also provide the public with real-time video updates about areas that've been destroyed, spared or remain in danger. Spreading like wildfire More than 170 wildfires burned 245,000 acres in Northern California last October. Cal Fire blamed 12 of those fires on PG&amp;E's "" electric power and distribution lines, conductors and the failure of power poles"" — when tree limbs fell on power lines. PG&amp;E rebuts this. ""Based on the information we have so far, we continue to believe our overall programs met our state's high standards,"" the company said in a statement. Many utilities are turning to drones to mitigate fire threats, often with the help of San Diego-based Flight Evolved, which uses lidar-equipped UAVs to build 3D maps that reveal potential fire starters along the grid. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison, for instance, use these 3D maps to see if power lines are sagging in extreme weather or if poles are decaying and need replacement. ""It can be used for a lot of structural engineering analysis to determine where things are in their relation to trees, vegetation, houses or potential issues that might cause fire hazards,"" says Flight Evolved owner David Ilgenfritz. Something different Fire departments and universities are also exploring new ways drones can fight ever-worsening wildfires. In Colorado, the Center of Excellence for Advanced Technology Aerial Firefighting (part of the state government), is trialing a system that sends live drone footage straight to firefighters' phones. Using a mapping engine originally developed by the Air Force called ATAK ( Android Team Awareness Kit ), crews can track each other's position and see real-time data on the fire itself. The mapping system gives everyone a clear picture of who's doing what and where they're located, as well as critical weather information. A drone shot of the devastation left by the Carr Fire. Image from the Menlo Park Fire Drone Team, Alameda County Sheriff's Office and Contra Costa Sheriff That's great where there's mobile coverage, but that's not always a given. ""The challenge with ATAK is it runs great on the phone, but if you can't connect one firefighter to the next, it really doesn't make sense,"" says Ben Miller, the center's director. One of the tools the center is testing to create network coverage is a GoTenna Pro, a small stick firefighters can use to make an ad-hoc mesh network. Miller's group eventually hopes to use something called a pseudo satellite: solar-powered, fixed-wing UAVs flying at 60,000 feet and transmitting broadband to expand internet access or replace downed infrastructure like cell towers. Sky pilots I'm sitting in a drafty warehouse a few miles from the Menlo Park fire station, where firefighters are training to fly drones indoors. It's a challenging environment even for experienced pilots: They have to fly in a confined, poorly lit space marked out with nets and traffic cones. Hobbyists generally fly drones on days with little wind, no rain and good lighting. Firefighters rarely get to pilot their drones in similar conditions. ""First responders are trained to deal with any type of stress very quickly and appropriately, but this is new technology,"" says Romeo Durscher, director of public safety integration at DJI. Relatively few fire departments have the resources to run their own drone training program. It has a value you just can't deny anymore."" That's where Skyfire Consulting's two-day training comes in. The course brings fire crews up to speed on everything from managing airspace to advanced maneuvers. Skyfire has taught more than 120 departments across the US, including the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Fremont and Redwood City. Once students nail down the actual piloting, they move on to other challenges, like interpreting data to spot potential hazards and to determine where fires will most likely spread. It's a tough ask, because the pilot's brain has to alternate between flying the drone line-of-sight, watching the camera image on the control screen and working out what's actually happening in the frame. This thermal image taken by drone shows an area's hot spots. Menlo Park Fire District Augmented reality could reduce this heavy mental load. One example is the free First Response app from Edgybees, designed for police, fire and local governments. With it, geographical data such as power lines, street names and team locations gets overlaid on top of the camera's video image. That gives pilots a clear, single-source view of potential issues or hot spots without needing to cross-reference another map. Over time, the augmented view from Edgybees could be integrated into ATAK to combine communications and situational awareness. Edgybees was used last year in rescue operations during hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the Northern California wildfires. ""Having UAVs out on these incidents is gonna be the new way we're doing business,"" says Calvert. ""It has a value you just can't deny anymore."" Drones also play an important role after the fire's been put out. During the Carr Fire, crews piloted low-flying drones to capture 360-degree images of the destruction. For the residents forced out of their homes, this provides invaluable information on property damage to help insurance claims. Withstanding the heat Drones are a lot more rugged than you might think. If one crashes, you can often change out propellers or plastic components, and the drone's good to go for another flight. If you accidentally fly directly into smoke, you just use Q-Tips to clear out carbon built up inside the aircraft. Click here to see more Road Trip adventures. Antonio/E+/Getty Images But this doesn't mean they don't run into some fire-specific problems. Dense smoke can sometimes knock sensors and cameras for a loop. Dennebaum tells me about a drone that sensed smoke as a solid object, triggering the collision avoidance system. Then there's battery life. While some larger drones can fly for up to 40 minutes, maneuvering in high winds or carrying a payload can significantly cut flight time. Still, this restriction may have a bright side: It gives pilots the mental break they need to help them refocus. Drones offer an unparalleled perspective for firefighters to spot threats. But the real potential is yet to come. Fire crews could deploy swarms of drones to get different views of the same fire, or send up drones with water tanks to complement traditional aerial firefighting tools, such as helicopters and planes. ""This sounds like a Jetsons future,"" says Durscher, ""but I think this is really around the corner.""

Matthew Reisen and Pilar Martinez | Journal Staff Writers,".................................................................................................................................................................................... ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Residents of Ute Park were being told to leave their homes Saturday night due to the encroaching Ute Park fire, which started Thursday afternoon and nearly doubled to more than 27,000 acres since Friday night, according to N.M. State Forestry officials. Spokeswoman Wendy Mason said the mandatory evacuation order was put in place after an increase in the fire’s behavior, and size, as it rages to the south of the small community. “The evacuation is a proactive measure to ensure that the residents are safe and firefighting personnel are able to operate within the community,” she said. “Crews are conducting point protection around the structures and will conduct burnout operation throughout the night to help protect the community.” The fire was zero percent contained as of Saturday afternoon, with 447 personnel, dozens of fire trucks and eight helicopters working to contain the blaze. “The plan is to go direct as possible to limit fire spread, but safety is our number one priority,” she said. “Given the dynamic situation, firefighters are focused on protecting values at risk and limiting the fire’s spread where they can do so safely and effectively.” Shelters have opened for evacuees in Raton and Eagle Nest. The Raton shelter is at Raton Convention Center, 901 S. 3rd Street, and the Eagle Nest shelter is at Eagle Nest Senior Center at 74 N. Tomboy Dr. Mason said firefighters took advantage of favorable conditions Friday night to conduct a strategic burnout, between State Road 204 and Highway 64, to help protect structures in the Cimarron area. She said crews are still assessing the damage, but so far at least 12 non-residential buildings have burned at Philmont Scout Ranch and 296 structures are still threatened in the Cimarron community. The fire has prompted the closure of highways and state parks. Highway 64 between Eagle Nest and the junction with State Route 55, Highway 21 from Springer to Cimarron, and State Route 58 from I-25 to Cimarron are closed. Cimarron State Park is also closed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Randall Hergert said the weather patterns are set to shift today, bringing a good chance of moisture, cooler temps and possible thunderstorms to the Ute Park area. “It’s no guarantee that a storm will hit that fire, but there is certainly a good chance that one will go over the area,” he said. “It’s going to bring some welcome rain there.” He said the chances of rain at Ute Park are around 80 percent. At the same time, Hergert said hazards with those storms include gusty winds that could fuel the blaze, frequent lightning that could threaten fire crews and if the rain is hard enough — flash flooding to the burn scar. “That’s something we’re keeping an eye on,” he said. Going forward, Hergert said wet conditions could continue into Monday before things get more dry into the rest of the week but not the “critical” fire conditions the area has been seeing. Residents displaced from the fire will still be able to cast votes in the primary election, and can vote at either the Raton Convention Center or cast a provisional ballot at the Eagle Nest Community Center, according to the Colfax County Clerk. “Despite this terrible disaster, it’s important that we ensure all Colfax County voters are able to cast a ballot in this election if they so choose,” said County Clerk Rayetta Trujillo in a news release.","Albuquerque Journal Ute Park evacuates as fire swells to more than 27000 acres Albuquerque Journal A plume of smoke from a wildfire rises behind Philmont Scout Ranch, Friday, June 1, 2018, near Cimarron, N.M.

Karolina Tagaris,"MATI, Greece (Reuters) - In a scorched and blackened pine forest, Dionysis Tsiroglou and his team of volunteer rescuers are searching homes ravaged by Greece’s deadliest wildfire, looking for the missing. “Their relatives are asking us to move mountains - ‘I want my aunt, I want my uncle, my son, my daughter, my father, my mother’,” he said. No one can say how many are missing after a blaze that tore through the coastal resort town of Mati, east of Athens, on Monday, trapping people in their homes or cars and forcing others to jump off cliffs or into the sea. Rescuers estimate between 60 to 100 people are still unaccounted for and authorities cannot confirm a figure. The missing may be among the dead, the fire service said, their bodies burned beyond recognition. Photos, some of young children, have been shared on social media in an effort to track people down. At least 80 were killed and scores were injured. “We’re going from house to house, anywhere we believe there may be someone trapped, someone who burned inside, someone missing,” Tsiroglou said. “So far, our search has been fruitless.” Parts of Mati, a popular spot for Greek holiday-makers, mainly pensioners and children at summer camps, are now a collection of burned-out cars, their melted alloy wheels snaking along the streets. Skeletons of houses with collapsed roofs stand in courtyards alongside a deserted playground, its slides and see-saws wrecked by the flames. Inside homes, paint peels off the walls and shattered photo frames are strewn across mantelpieces. “Owners are asking us to save whatever we can from their houses,” Tsiroglou said. The team, volunteer rescuers from the western city of Messolonghi, were drafted in on Tuesday and have been working around the clock since, resting only for two hours on the hot asphalt, Tsiroglou said. “We will work non-stop until the night falls, and tomorrow, until the search operation ends.” Writing by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Louise Ireland","In a scorched and blackened pine forest, Dionysis Tsiroglou and his team of volunteer rescuers are searching homes ravaged by Greece's deadliest wildfire, looking for the missing.",2018-07-25T11:30:18Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}","House to house, Greece searches for missing in wildfire aftermath",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-wildfire-rescuers/house-to-house-greece-searches-for-missing-in-wildfire-aftermath-idUSKBN1KF1IO,https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180725&t=2&i=1286906828&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE6O13B,reuters,Reuters,wildfire,1

Gillian Flaccus / AP,"(PORTLAND, Ore.) — Just two months after a wildfire wiped out Paradise, California, officials are gearing up for this year’s fire season and fear the government shutdown could make it even more difficult than one of the worst in history.
The winter months are critical for wildfire managers who use the break from the flames to prepare for the next onslaught, but much of that effort has ground to a halt on U.S. land because employees are furloughed. Firefighting training courses are being canceled from Tennessee to Oregon, piles of dead trees are untended in federal forests and controlled burns to thin dry vegetation aren’t getting done.
Although the furloughs only affect federal employees, the collaborative nature of wildland firefighting means the pain of the four-week-long shutdown is having a ripple effect — from firefighters on the ground to federal contractors and top managers who control the firefighting strategy.
State and local crews who need training classes, for example, are scrambling without federal instructors. Conservation groups that work with the U.S. Forest Service to plan wildfire-prevention projects on federal lands are treading water. Annual retreats where local, state and federal firefighting agencies strategize are being called off.
The fire season starts as early as March in the southeastern United States, and by April, fires pop up in the Southwest. Last year’s most devastating fire leveled the Northern California town of Paradise just before Thanksgiving, leaving just a few months to prepare between seasons.
“I think a lot of people don’t understand that while there’s not fire going on out there right now, there’s a lot of really critical work going on for the fire season — and that’s not getting done,” said Michael DeGrosky, chief of the Fire Protection Bureau for the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.
It’s especially important with climate change making wildfire seasons longer, deadlier and more destructive.
DeGrosky was supposed to be teaching a course this week for firefighters who want to qualify for the command staff of a fire management team. But the class was canceled without instructors from federal agencies.
Similar classes were called off in Oregon and Tennessee, and others face the same fate as the shutdown drags on. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats are at odds over funding for a border wall.
A dozen senators from Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Colorado, Nevada, West Virginia and Michigan sent a letter this week to Trump warning that the shutdown would put lives at risk this coming fire season. Classes necessary for fire incident managers, smokejumpers and hotshot crews are in jeopardy in the near future, the senators said.
Smokejumpers parachute into remote forests to battle blazes not inaccessible by firefighters on the ground and hotshot crews are small groups of elite firefighters trained to battle the most ferocious flames.
The winter is also when seasonal firefighters apply for jobs, get the required drug tests and move to where they will train and work. In many cases, there’s no one to answer the phone or process the applications, and some potential recruits may decide to work elsewhere to avoid the hassle.
“Even if the shutdown ends and we start hiring people, we will have missed the cream of the crop,” DeGrosky said.
The U.S. Forest Service said in an email that the agency was committed to hiring for temporary and permanent firefighting positions and would continue critical training “to the extent feasible.”
The first session of an apprenticeship program for wildland firefighters went ahead this week, Forest Service spokeswoman Katie O’Connor said.
“The agency is assessing and prioritizing the activities we are able to maintain while in shutdown status. We are unable to speculate on specific impacts while the government shutdown is ongoing and ever-changing,” O’Connor said in a statement.
Conservationists and fire managers say there are other concerns.
Clearing and thinning projects and planned burns on federal land that could lessen fire danger by weeding out flammable debris also are largely on hold in California, Oregon and elsewhere. Private contractors say they have received letters telling them to stop the work.
There’s already a backlog of such projects in federal forests in Oregon and Northern California, said Michael Wheelock, president of Grayback, a private contractor in Grants Pass, Oregon.
Intentional fires can only be set in a narrow winter window before temperatures and humidity falls — and that is rapidly closing, Wheelock said.
“Every week that goes by, it’s going to start increasing the impact,” he said.
Joyce McLean, who lost her and her husband’s home in Paradise last November, supports Trump’s push for a border wall but worries what will happen if firefighters aren’t prepared for next time.
“I hope there are no more forest fires,” said McLean, 74. “I wouldn’t wish that on nobody.”

Reuters,"CARPINTERIA, CA - DECEMBER 12: A smoke-filled sky filter orange light around surfers as the Thomas Fire continues to grow and threaten communities from Carpinteria to Santa Barbara on December 12, 2017 in Carpinteria, California. The Thomas Fire has spread across 365 miles so far and destroyed about 800 structures since it began on December 5 in Ojai, California. David McNew/Getty Images (Reuters) - A fast-moving wildfire driven by hot, dry and windy conditions threatened more than 600 homes and other buildings in Northern California early on Tuesday after forcing some 3,000 residents to evacuate. The Pawnee Fire, which broke out on Saturday near the Mendocino National Forest 70 miles (110 km) northwest of Sacramento, had destroyed 22 buildings and charred more than 10,500 acres (4,200 hectares) by late Monday night, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Lake County, the location of the blaze, on Monday. The scores of firefighters who will seek to contain it on Tuesday face the prospect of temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 C), 15 mile-per-hour winds and 30 percent humidity, according to the National Weather Service. The fire was 5 percent contained on Monday evening, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The Pawnee is one of four major wildfires burning in California as temperatures rise across the state. None are reported to have caused injuries. To the east, the Lane fire in Tehama County had blackened 3,800 acres and threatened 200 buildings, fire officials said. It was 40 percent contained. The Shu Fire burning some 50 miles (80 km) east of Sacramento near the El Dorado National Forest, was threatening the community of Happy Valley, fire officials said, prompting evacuations and road closures. That blaze was 50 percent contained. The Stoll Fire, north of Chico, had burned 270 acres and destroyed multiple homes since breaking out on Saturday, according to CalFire, but was 60 percent contained on Monday.","David McNew/Getty Images A fast-moving wildfire driven by hot, dry and windy conditions threatened more than 600 homes and other buildings in Northern California early on Tuesday after forcing some 3,000 residents to evacuate.

Jim Carlton,"A fast-moving wildfire has shut down a nearly 50-mile stretch of one the busiest freeways in Northern California, after it torched at least two big rigs and forced motorists to flee cars and trucks as the state endures one of its worst fire seasons. The so-called Delta Fire broke out shortly after noon on Wednesday about 10 miles north of Redding, Calif. It is the same area where the Carr Fire broke out in late July, destroying hundreds of homes and killing three firefighters. No injuries were reported in the latest inferno, which fire officials said was human-caused without providing details. Officials said the blaze rapidly expanded through tinder-dry brush and timber above Shasta Lake to form a front up to 3 miles wide with 300-foot-high flames that jumped across busy Interstate 5 on Wednesday, setting off a panic as motorists who could feel the growing heat abandoned about a dozen vehicles. “When the inside of your car gets 30 to 40 degrees hotter in a few seconds, that’s scary,” said Brandon Vaccaro, spokesman for an interagency command in charge of fighting the fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Law-enforcement officials closed the interstate, forcing detours on the busiest highway link between California and Oregon. Siskiyou County sheriff’s officials said they anticipated Interstate 5 would remain closed until Thursday afternoon, but warned the closure could last longer. The fire surged to more than 15,000 acres and prompted mandatory evacuations of some homes and businesses as well as en evacuation warning for the 1,600 residents of Dunsmuir, about 15 miles away, Mr. Vaccaro said. Sheriff’s officials said the fire’s momentum slowed early Thursday but picked up again in the afternoon. The incident added to California’s fire misery this summer. The famed Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park was ordered closed for nearly a month as the nearly 97,000-acre Ferguson Fire raged nearby. Meanwhile, two blazes that merged into the Mendocino Complex Fire consumed nearly 460,000 acres north of San Francisco, setting a record for the state’s largest wildfire. In all, officials from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said they responded to fires that blackened about 614,000 acres so far this year as of Sept. 2, compared with a five-year annual average of about 158,000 acres. When including fires on land managed by the U.S. Forest Service, the total so far this year is about 1.3 million acres. Fire experts attribute the increased activity, in large part, to lingering damage to trees and other vegetation from California’s five-year drought.

Paige Lavender,"Reports of a shooting trigger an avalanche of misinformation on the internet. When a woman opened fire at the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, on Tuesday, Twitter immediately lit up with false and inaccurate reports, some from seasoned journalists and reputable news outlets. With gun violence regularly at the forefront of the news, this faulty dialogue has become commonplace. But there are ways to keep fake news from spreading after a shooting. Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner. In the moments after a shooting, law enforcement officials and first responders are trying to figure out what’s happening and whether a situation is escalating. Police scanners allow anyone, anywhere to listen to their conversations unfiltered. Their questions about a crime scene, their speculation about what might be coming next, all the comments made in the midst of a chaotic situation are on display ― including things that turn out to be totally wrong. During the YouTube shooting, a first responder was heard on the scanner saying 37 individuals would need “triaging,” or medical attention. In reality, four people were treated for injuries ― three who were shot, and one who injured an ankle while running from the shooter. But it was easy to find tweets that said 37 people were injured. Even some journalists and news outlets, like Newsweek, shared the line. (They later deleted their tweet.) Twitter Law enforcement officials and first responders aren’t journalists. Their conversations immediately after a shooting are rooted in speculation, not fact. Be careful how you label a shooting. A lot can sound like “shots fired.” Cars backfiring and fireworks are two things commonly misreported as shootings. Even when shots have actually been fired, that doesn’t always mean there’s an active shooter, or someone with a gun continuing to go after others. Even when there is an active shooter, it doesn’t always mean anyone has been shot. Even if a person was shot, it doesn’t mean the suspect is carrying out a “mass shooting,” the definition of which is not clearly defined. (An incident is commonly called a mass shooting if three or more people in a similar location are shot, though law enforcement and media outlets often use different standards for the term.) Don’t assume you know the shooter’s motive. Several outlets, including the Associated Press and CNN, reported the YouTube shooter was involved in a domestic dispute, which wasn’t true. Sometimes a shooter’s motive remains unclear for months, as is the case with the Las Vegas massacre. Wait for an official confirmation before sharing a suspect’s identity. With almost every major shooting in America come false reports of the shooter’s identity. Sam Hyde, a comedian, is almost always brought up as a “shooting suspect,” his image being shared so often The New York Times called it “ an identifiable meme.” Adam Lanza, who killed students at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was found with his brother Ryan’s ID, leading several media outlets to initially report he was the suspect. After the YouTube shooting, BuzzFeed’s Jane Lytvynenko kept track of hoaxes, including a tweet that claimed she was the shooter. 29: This is literally me. pic.twitter.com/lSCgaF49SH — Jane Lytvynenko 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ (@JaneLytv) April 3, 2018 Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner. Seriously, don’t. Take eyewitness accounts with a grain of salt. People in stressful situations don’t always know the full details of what’s going on around them. Many only see one area of a much larger crime scene. It’s common for law enforcement to investigate leads on multiple shooters after a mass shooting situation that was carried out by one person, thanks to conflicting reports from people who were there. But there’s almost always just one shooter. Be careful when talking about the number of victims. Numbers included in official statements from law enforcement statements and hospitals are often updated to more accurately reflect who was treated. And there’s often confusion about the extent of injuries during a shooting ― just because someone was injured doesn’t mean they were shot; just because someone was shot doesn’t mean they were killed. Be mindful of where the media is getting its information. Anonymous sources and eyewitnesses are commonly cited by journalists after a mass shooting. While that information can often help paint a picture of what’s unfolding, it can also be very, very wrong. News outlets will often cite other news outlets’ reporting after a shooting, and it’s good to know the original source of any information you’re reading. A “fact” about a shooting may be widely reported, but only supported by one source talking to one outlet. Don’t believe everything you see on Twitter. Is the person tweeting new to Twitter? Do they normally post from the area where the shooting occurred? A few seconds of digging can help add clarity to who a person is and if they’re legit. Doctored photos are often shared after mass shootings. You can find an image’s origin by doing a reverse image search. After the YouTube shooting, one victim’s Twitter account was hacked. An individual posed as a YouTube employee to try and trick a HuffPost reporter into sharing false information. Don’t trust that people in your Twitter timeline have accurate information or good intentions. Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner. I actually cannot say this enough. Be careful about what you share. Doctored Facebook posts and tweets with bad information spread like wildfire after a shooting. Before hitting the share button, make sure the information you’re flagging for your friends is accurate by taking a few seconds to fact-check. And remember the internet is massive ― things you share will be shared and shared and shared again, going way beyond your friends.",Misinformation spreads like wildfire after a shooting.

Sean O'Kane,"Hertz announced Tuesday that it is going to lean on facial recognition and fingerprint verification technology to speed up the rental process at airports. The rental car giant struck a deal with biometric airport security company Clear to provide the technology. The two companies have already rolled out this new offering, called “Hertz Fast Lane powered by Clear,” at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It will only be available to members of Hertz’s Gold Plus Rewards program, and these renters will have to enroll with Clear separately. Hertz won’t charge extra for the fast lane, but renters will still have to pay for Clear if they want to use the service for faster access at airport security. For Hertz Gold Plus members only, and coming to dozens more airports in 2019 Hertz and Clear plan to expand the biometric fast lane to more than 40 other locations in 2019, including Los Angeles International Airport, New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, and San Francisco International Airport. The Clear biometric checkouts will allow renters to take off with their cars in just “30 seconds or less - a time savings of at least 75 percent,” according to Hertz. That means we’re not talking about an enormous amount of time savings. By that math, the current process takes two minutes. Still, biometric security is spreading like wildfire at airports around the world. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced a road map in October for rolling out biometric security measures for domestic flights, expanding on a previous project for international flights that was fast-tracked by the Trump administration in 2017. Before that, airlines like Delta and British Airways were experimenting with using biometric tech to speed up things like boarding and bag drops.","The new Hertz “fast lanes” are part of a partnership with biometric airport security company Clear.

Lee van der Voo,"CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Rebuilding Paradise, California, after it was leveled by fire three weeks ago will pose a new massive challenge to the devastated mountain community - starting with complicated insurance claims for nearly 14,000 lost homes. At least 88 people were killed in the Camp Fire and nearly 200 others are still listed as missing, making the wildfire the deadliest in state history. Law enforcement officials say the search for remains in the ash and rubble has officially ended. Some of those who escaped the flames only to find themselves homeless are expected to be allowed to return to inspect their properties as early as next week. Many will find themselves essentially starting over, facing months or even years of rebuilding and seeking compensation for their losses. Christopher Gregg, whose home in Paradise was a total loss, said he’s not getting answers to the question of when he will be compensated by his insurance company. “They say, ‘We’ll let you know as soon as we can.’ Well, when can we get back on our feet, is my question. I’d like to know... When do we get a chance to resume some portion of our lives?” he said. Insurance teams began gathering in Chico in the early days of the fire that erupted on Nov. 8 and rapidly engulfed Paradise about 20 minutes away and surrounding communities. Working out of truck trailers, temporary tents and recreational vehicles in mall parking lots, and equipped with generators and satellite communications, insurance adjusters say they have been stymied in part by a ban on flying drones over what is left of the town of 27,000. Insurers responding to natural disasters typically use drones to obtain 360-degree views of damage when access is limited. But the drones have been restricted as crews work to clear downed trees and power lines, as well as burn debris and restore infrastructure. BILLIONS IN LOSSES Pop-up insurance booths are a common site these days in California as it experiences its most destructive wildfire season on record. A total of 7,579 fires have burned some 1,667,855 acres, an area roughly the size of Delaware, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Moody’s last week estimated total insured losses at $10-$15 billion from the Camp Fire and the Woolsey fire, which was burning at the same time in the foothills above Malibu in southern California. Insurers say climate change is a factor in the more intense fire seasons and are raising rates or even dropping coverage. “We’re seeing these fires these last few years that people have defined as 1-in-500-year-type events... Absolutely we’re seeing some things change and climate change is playing a role in that,” said Suzanne Meraz, spokesperson for CSAA Insurance Company. Insurers now often use computer models to generate house-by-house risk predictions, factoring in such features as local topography and brush cover instead of just using a more general history of blazes in a region. Paradise resident Ed Riddle was focusing on one task at a time. His home is a total loss, confirmed by a friend who was able to take pictures. “I kind of feel like a turtle on its back looking for a rock,” he said.

I’m told I shouldn’t make any decisions quickly about that,” he said.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of firefighters were building barriers and constructing containment lines early on Friday to slow an approaching wildfire threatening to torch thousands of homes in a lakeside community southeast of Los Angeles. More than 21,000 people have been evacuated in and around Lake Elsinore where furious flames and billowing smoke rose into the sky at the edge of the city of 60,000 as the blaze, dubbed the Holy Fire, burned nearby in the Santa Ana Mountains. “It feels like a war zone,” Ana Tran told the Los Angeles Times as ash and flame retardant fell on her neighborhood. The fire, which was five percent contained, was being fueled by dry brush covering steep terrain and stoked by erratic wind gusts during the night, said Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for the incident said. “Strong down drafts is making the fire move aggressively downhill,” said Nguyen, noting that firefighters were working to build barriers and containment lines to protect more than 2,000 homes at risk from the fire. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the relatively small blaze that consumed more than 10,200 acres (4,128 hectares) since it began on Tuesday, fire officials said. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the area on Thursday, freeing up additional resources to battle the blaze. Forrest Clark, 51, was charged with setting the fire, the Orange County District Attorney Office said. The Holy Fire was one of several fires burning in California that have displaced tens of thousands of people. Wildfires across the state and region could be further stoked by strong gusts, low humidity and hot weather on Friday and Saturday, forecasters warned. In Northern California, a mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire burning around Redding was killed in a traffic collision on Thursday, bringing the death toll from that blaze to eight, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said. The 178,000-acre Carr Fire has killed two other firefighters along with three members of one family and has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. It was 49 percent contained with firefighters struggling in steep terrain to control the blaze, CalFire said. More than 4,000 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 305,200 acres in three counties north of San Francisco, CalFire said. Two firefighters were injured and 119 homes destroyed by that fire which now ranks as the largest fire on record in the state.

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 10, 2018 He also reportedly sent out an email to Tesla employees giving them permission to assist in any way they could, and for them to ""not worry about payment"" according to the memo obtained by Electrek. ""If theres any way for Tesla to be helpful, please provide assistance and dont worry about payment,"" Musks email reportedly said. This wouldn't be the first time Musk has volunteered his or his companies' services to help a disaster. In 2017, on Musk's orders, Tesla shipped its Powerpack and Powerwall batteries to hospitals ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Then in the summer of 2018, Musk attempted to help with efforts to rescue the Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave for 17 days. He controversially insisted on building a kid-sized "" submarine "" and sending it to Thailand to transport them through the treacherous tunnels. While Musk likely had good intentions, his offer ended up being more interference that would land him in hot water with British cave diver Vern Unsworth, who did help rescue the trapped team, and whom he repeatedly accused of being a pedophile. Bizarrely, after initially apologizing to Unsworth, Musk backpedaled and doubled down on the unsubstantiated claim after immaturely goading the cave diver into suing him, which is happening. The question facing Musk is has he really changed his tune? Can he and Tesla really provide actual aid without interfering with the authorities? Or is this yet another marketing ploy to shout out Tesla veiled as an offer of help? After the episode in Thailand over the summer, some think that Musk's seemingly always-buzzing noggin is just savvily taking advantage of another unfortunate situation.","As California's deadly wildfires rage on, none other than billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk has come forth to offer help once again.

Mark Kaufman,"Oakland, a Northern California city with a population of over 425,000, had the worst air quality in the world Saturday morning. Wildfire smoke wafting over from the still-growing Camp Fire by far the deadliest wildfire in state history had inundated many heavily-populated California cities and towns with small bits of pollution thinner than the width of a human hair, called Particulate Matter 2.5, or PM 2.5. Berkeley Earth, a scientific climate organization, keeps tabs on air pollution around the globe. As of Nov. 17 at 9:30 a.m. ET, Oakland topped the global list with particle concentrations of 167 g/m3 (meaning micrograms per cubic meter) which are levels deemed ""Very Unhealthy"" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Coming in a distant second is Kanpur, India with particulate levels of 132. For reference, air pollution experts consider India to have the worst air pollution on the planet. Last week, air pollution levels in India's capital city of New Delhi were literally off the charts. The Northern California cities of San Francisco and Oakland also placed in the top five, as of Saturday morning. Friday, the air pollution was no better, with the five top spots all taken by heavily-populated California cities: Stockton, Sacramento, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. Increasing amounts of unhealthy to hazardous air pollution in the U.S. is one of the most well-understood and predicted consequences of climate change, as warmer climes produce larger wildfires. It's also well understood that particulate air pollution doesn't just make it difficult to breathe in the short term, but it's linked to serious heart disease. A recent 10-year-long Environmental Protection Agency study observed some 6,000 people and found exposure to this particulate matter, known formally as PM 2.5 (for particulate matter less than 2.5 microns across), accelerated the build-up of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels, which leads to heart attacks, strokes, and even death. SEE ALSO: When will this terrible wildfire season in California end? California's sustained air quality woes have been further aided by a common weather phenomenon known as an inversion layer, wherein air pollution gets trapped under a layer of warm air, trapping the cooler air below. Climate scientists expect California to experience more smoke-filled autumns as the century progresses, specifically because falls are expected to be drier. This sets the stage for profoundly dry grasslands, scrublands, and forest, which are likely to ignite with any spark. The parched Golden State, however, may get a reprieve from fires around Thanksgiving. Wet storms from Alaska may pour rain over the ashy, smoke-ridden land.","Oakland, a Northern California city with a population of over 425,000, had the worst air quality in the world Saturday morning.

"SIMON ROMERO, JOSE A. DEL REAL and THOMAS FULLER","Sheriff Allman dispatched a team to Butte County that is charged with identifying potential homes that have remains.

Sheriff Allman, who has conferred regularly with Sheriff Honea, predicts the search will continue well into next year. We are going to be finding people into the spring, he said. Theres no doubt about it. But experts are also careful to note that experience suggests the number on the missing list does not necessarily correspond to the total number of fatalities. In the aftermath of last years wildfires in Northern Californias wine country, the list of the missing swelled. Sonoma County alone received reports of 2,269 people unaccounted for as distant relatives called from faraway states with vague stories that their family members may have been in the area. A team of dozens of detectives and probation officers pared down the list by using what Sgt. Spencer Crum of the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office called good, old-fashioned detectives legwork. It took between one and two months to close out the list of the missing, Sergeant Crum said. The death toll in Sonoma County was finalized at 24. Many people whose loved ones are still missing particularly if they are elderly have held on to hope they made it to safety but have been unable to call for various reasons, because they do not own a cellphone or lack familiarity with social media.

Reuters Editorial,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California wildfire was close on Saturday to becoming the state’s third largest blaze on record, with more devastation possible from a resurgence of the harsh winds that have fueled the deadly fire’s growth. The so-called Thomas Fire has destroyed more than 1,000 structures, including about 750 homes, in coastal communities in Southern California since erupting on Dec. 4, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement. It has cost $97 million to fight the 256,000-acre (103,600-hectare) blaze, with thousands of firefighters contending with it around the clock and helicopters and airplanes being used to drop retardant on the flames. The vast landscape charred by the blaze, which is centered less than 100 miles (161 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, is approaching the 257,314 acres (104,131 hectares) destroyed by California’s Rim Fire in 2013. The Rim Fire is the third-largest blaze on record in the state. The Thomas Fire is only 35 percent contained and it threatens 18,000 structures, officials said, including some in the wealthy enclave of Montecito just outside the city of Santa Barbara. The blaze is chewing up tall grass and brush as it expands along the scenic Pacific Coast. Thomas wildfire burns above Bella Vista Drive near Romero Canyon in this social media photo by Santa Barbara County Fire Department in Montecito, California, U.S. December 12, 2017. Courtesy Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department/Handout via REUTERS The hot Santa Ana winds that have helped the fire grow, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank, were forecast to remain strong through Saturday evening in the Santa Barbara County mountains, the National Weather Service warned. Gusts of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) were expected. From Saturday night through Sunday evening, the winds could lash neighboring Ventura County, the Weather Service said. That is where the Thomas Fire first began due to unknown causes, and where it was still burning. Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. Fire officials said Iverson, the blaze’s first fatality, left behind a pregnant wife and 2-year-old daughter. The Thomas Fire was one of several major blazes that broke out in Southern California this month, although the others have been contained. The blazes forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. The fires were also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California.

Reuters Editorial,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Firefighters in California will be tested by vicious winds on Friday morning as they battle a huge wildfire that has claimed the life of one of their colleagues and torched more than 700 homes. Cory Iverson, 32, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection engineer, was killed on Thursday while tackling the so-called Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. “Cory Iverson... made the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of others,” said Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean during a community meeting on Thursday night. Fire officials released little information about the circumstances surrounding Iverson’s death. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that he perished in an accident near the community of Fillmore, where a mayday alert was sounded. Santa Ana winds and humidity in the single digits has helped stoke the blaze that has swept through dry vegetation since it erupted on Dec. 4 near a small private college in Ojai. It has since blackened more than 249,000 acres (about 390 square miles, or 1,000 sq km) and is now the fourth-largest wildfire on record in California since 1932. On Friday morning powerful winds are forecast which will subside during the day, the National Weather Service said. “Winds will weaken Friday, turn westerly early Saturday, then become offshore and gusty again late Saturday night through Sunday evening,” the service said in an advisory. The wildfire remained a threat to some 18,000 homes and other structures in the communities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Summerland and Montecito along California’s coastline, especially if hot, dry Santa Ana winds return. The Thomas Fire, which was 35 percent contained as of Thursday evening, has burned 729 homes to the ground and damaged another 175. The blaze has displaced more than 94,000 people. The fire and others to the south in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have disrupted life for millions of people over the last 11 days.

ABC News,"Heavy rains pounding Southern California for a second day caused flooding and loosened hillsides as officials in fire-ravaged communities warned people to stay off roads over fears of destructive mud flows. Water and debris in lanes shut down coastal U.S. 101 and traffic accidents on rain-slicked roadways across the region slowed the Tuesday morning commute to a crawl. Several inches of rain fell in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, where thousands of residents evacuated over fears of mudslides in areas where the state's largest-ever fire raged last month. ""Creeks that normally would be dry would turn into raging rivers of mud and debris and large rocks and trees,"" said Robert Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management. ""These can be quite damaging. They'll destroy roads, they'll take out homes."" Forecasters issued flash flood warnings and predicted that the cold front with powerful winds could bring higher rain totals to downtown Los Angeles than seen in the past 10 months. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for about 700 homes in former burn areas of Los Angeles County. A winter weather advisory was in place for mountain areas, where officials warned motorists to prepare for difficult travel conditions, including gusty winds, low visibility and snow-covered roads Flash flood watches were also issued for parts of Sonoma and Mendocino counties north of San Francisco, warning that the rains that were saturating the area Monday night could trigger mudslides in areas devastated by October wildfires. The blazes leveled entire neighborhoods, killing 44 people and destroying more than 8,900 homes and other buildings. A yearslong drought eased in the state last spring, but Northern California had a dry start to winter and hardly any measurable rain fell in the south over the past six months. The extremely dry conditions and high winds last year led to some of the most destructive blazes on both ends of the state. Now, the storm coming in from the Gulf of Alaska could dump up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain on Northern California areas still recovering from fires before clearing up by Tuesday evening, National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said.

Reuters Editorial,"SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (Reuters) - Crews battling a massive wind-driven California wildfire that has torched nearly 800 buildings and charred 230,000 acres are bracing on Monday to protect communities menaced by flames along the state’s scenic coastline. A fire crew passes a burning home during a wind-driven wildfire in Ventura. REUTERS/Mike Blake The Thomas Fire ignited last week and is burning in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. “Fire will continue to threaten the communities of Carpenteria, Summerland, Montecito and surrounding areas,” the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)said in a Sunday night update. Santa Ana winds and the rugged mountainous terrain have hindered firefighters as they battle the blaze, which has destroyed 790 houses, outbuildings and other structures and left 90,000 homes and businesses without power. “A lot of these guys (firefighters) have fought a lot of fires in the past few months and are fatigued,” said Fire Captain Steve Concialdi, spokesman for the Thomas Fire. Concialdi said firefighters from 11 Western states are aiding firefighting efforts. The fire is 10 percent contained, down from 15 percent on Saturday after it blew up on Sunday, growing by 56,000 acres in one day and making a run of 7 miles, Concialdi said. Nearly 5,800 firefighting personnel are working on the blaze, Cal Fire said. The cost of fighting as of Sunday was nearly $34 million, the agency added. It is already the fifth-largest wildfire on record in California. At the University of California, Santa Barbara, final exams set for this week have been postponed, Chancellor Henry Yang said in a letter to the campus community. Air quality and transportation issues, along with power outages that have affected the school’s information technology department, forced the delay of exams until January. Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground this week. Both the Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were 90 percent contained by Sunday morning, officials said, while the Skirball Fire in the posh Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles was 75 percent contained. North of San Diego, the 4,100-acre (1,660 hectare) Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained by Sunday and most evacuation orders had been lifted.

Dan Whitcomb,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A massive, out-of-control Northern California wildfire that destroyed 68 homes and forced thousands to flee has become the fifth largest in state history, officials said on Sunday, as crews battled high temperatures and strong winds. The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged near Ukiah, north of Sacramento, exploded by 25 percent overnight and had blackened nearly 400 square miles as of Sunday morning, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. “The Mendocino Complex Fire has charred more than 254,000 acres, making it the fifth largest blaze in California’s history,” AccuWeather said on its website. “Firefighters will continue to face local gusty winds and building heat this week.” The Mendocino is one of 17 major wildfires burning across California that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to declare a “major disaster” in the state, ordering federal funding to be made available to help recovery efforts. “Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property loses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,” the White House said in a written statement. The PG&amp;E Corporation said on Sunday that a 21-year-old apprentice lineman, Jay Ayeta, had been killed when his vehicle crashed in western Shasta County as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain to battle the nearly two-week-old Carr Fire. Ayeta was the seventh person to die in that blaze, which has scorched more than 154,000 acres in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento, including two young children and their great-grandmother whose home was overrun by flames, a resident who authorities said refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders, and two firefighters. Firefighters had managed to contain 41 percent of the Carr blaze by Sunday, and authorities were letting some evacuees return. This year, California wildfires have burned more land earlier in the fire season than usual, Cal Fire director Ken Pimlott said during a news conference on Saturday. “Fire season is really just beginning. What seems like we should be in the peak of fire season, historically, is really now the kind of conditions we’re seeing really at the beginning,” he said. Through last week, California fires had torched about 290,000 acres (117,300 hectares), more than double the five-year average over that same period, according to Cal Fire.

Lauren Migaki,"Clark Howe, age 12, poses for a portrait. Lauren Migaki/NPR With wildfires still raging across parts of Southern California, dozens of schools have been closed. Many will stay that way till the new year. That gives educators valuable time to think about what they can do, when school resumes, to help students who have been traumatized by these fires. One answer can be found a few hundred miles north, in Santa Rosa, California. In late October, students there returned to class after three weeks away. A massive wildfire had swept through the city of 175,000 and the surrounding county, killing at least 22 people and destroying or damaging at least 5,500 structures. The Tubbs fire took the homes of many students at Northwest Prep Charter School, a small secondary school in northwestern Santa Rosa. Given the trauma their community had just experienced, teachers knew they couldn't dive right back into algebra. On the first day back, all 75 students at Northwest Prep gathered in a community circle and spoke about the fire's impact on their lives. ""I think every one of the students who lost a home spoke during that discussion, which we didn't expect,"" says Jessica Hadid, the language and communication teacher there. One of those kids was Clark Howe. The seventh-grader remembers Oct. 9 clearly: He woke up to a chaotic scene around 1:30 a.m. His dad told him they needed to leave right away. Clark grabbed some of his things and rounded up the family dogs. After picking up a neighbor who couldn't drive, his family headed out onto the packed roads, full of other people evacuating their homes. ""We were all really nervous, there were just cars everywhere, people driving on the wrong side of the road, fires starting on lawns,"" Clark says. ""We were all just really scared for what could happen."" His family made it to safety, but their home, located in Santa Rosa's Coffey Park neighborhood, was completely destroyed. They lost some of their most prized possessions: a classic Mustang in the garage, some favorite stuffed animals left behind in Clark's bedroom. ""Nothing was left,"" Clark says. ""Everybody lost something."" Before returning to school, Northwest Prep's teaching staff received trauma-based training to help students cope with the aftermath of the fires. But the teachers also wanted to do something in the classroom. ""We realized we needed to do something, as a school, to help our students and really our whole community process what we'd all been through,"" says Alyssa Dossat, a math teacher at Northwest Prep. When she was evacuated from her own home, Dossat took her kids to a museum. Her 7-year-old was looking at an exhibit about earthquakes that struck California in 1906 and 1989. ""She was reading it going, 'Mom, who, who wrote this? Who are these quotes from?'"" Dossat says. ""I said, 'They're just from people, sweetie, that's how it works. That's how we record history that way.'"" In that moment, Dossat had an idea. This could be done in her school. At that, an oral history assignment was born. As part of the project, Northwest Prep students will use their smartphones and tablets to record stories from the Tubbs fire and its impact on the Santa Rosa community. From there, students will curate and archive the firsthand accounts. The fire has brought the community together, says Adam Napoleon, a social systems teacher. He hopes the project will go beyond storytelling and provide a ""sense of healing"" to both the students and their interviewees. ""They can provide not only this historical record, but this emotional healing aspect that a lot of people in our community need right now,"" he says. After the fire, Clark Howe was eager to get back to school and be with his friends — many of whom also lost their homes. As he returned, he sometimes found it hard to talk about the fire and remember all that was lost. But, Clark says, it's also been really helpful to talk about it — and he can't believe the support he has received from his community. His family received many donations and has since been able to relocate to an apartment building. They plan to rebuild their home. Last weekend, Clark's family and neighbors returned to their old neighborhood to put Christmas decorations on one of the only trees left standing after the fire. ""We're not struggling very much anymore. We're looking for some good holidays,"" he says.","Experiencing a natural disaster can traumatize children.

I’ll give you a hint: flame on. Gun laws can vary greatly between states, and they can be hard to find when you’re just digging… Read more Read Believe it or not, there are no federal laws governing private ownership of flamethrowers or flamethrower-like devices (they’re considered “extended-reach torches”). It all comes down to individual state laws, and for the most part, everybody is surprisingly pretty chill with you bringing the heat. Only two states in the country restrict the devices: California and Maryland. They’re completely banned in Maryland, and can only be obtained in California with a permit issued by the State Fire Marshal ( Let’s see your papers, Musk ). Failure to get a license in California is a misdemeanor that could lead to a year of jail time, or a fine of $10,000. That means you’re technically free and clear to buy and own flamethrowers in the other 48 states. Using them, however, may be a completely different story. Obviously, using them on people—even overly eager, wannabe stuntmen—is illegal, but it could also be illegal to play “Look I’m a dragon” with non-living targets as well. Some states may list these types of propelled-flame devices under the “fireworks” category, which means there are more stringent laws in effect for most states. And even if you’re just looking to burn out some weeds on your property, you should always consult your state’s burn laws before you go into your back yard, say a cool catchphrase like “Need a light?”, then unleash hell on some dandelions.

The XM42 has a reach of 25 feet, while Musk’s is more of a creme brûlée torch that looks like a video game gun cut from Destiny. It’ll burn stuff up close, and is definitely a dangerous fire hazard, but it’s probably not going to be useful as a weapon at least.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire. The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Thousands more mountain residents were evacuated from the path of California’s biggest wildfire on Friday as fatigued firefighters battled gusting winds driving one of the state’s worst fire seasons in a decade. The Mendocino Complex Fire grew to 157,450 acres (63,700 hectares) late Friday, about half the size of Los Angeles, forcing nearly 16,000 homeowners to flee a blaze that has destroyed 88 structures about 93 miles (150 km) north of San Francisco, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). Its size overtook the deadly Carr Fire, about 100 miles (160 km) to the northeast, which is among 17 major blazes burning in tinder-dry forests and woodland peppered with dead trees from the state’s 2011-2017 drought. The Carr Fire spawned a “fire whirl” of flames and winds in excess of 143 mph (230 kph) on July 26 that had the strength of a severe tornado and uprooted trees and toppled power lines, according to a tweet by the National Weather Service. Fueled by triple-digit temperatures, the blazes have put California on track for its most destructive fire year since 2008, in terms of area burned, said Cal Fire Deputy Chief Scott McLean. “These fires are just unpredictable and extremely dangerous. They’ve killed, they’re killers,” said McLean. “It’s going to go through you, around you, over you.” Four wildland firefighters have died in California this year, twice as many as in all of 2017. They included a bulldozer operator whose vehicle nearly slipped off a mountain trail three times before it rolled into a ravine and crushed him at the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite National Park, a Cal Fire report said. The report called for better “risk assessment” among firefighters. Several days of light winds have helped teams control smaller blazes, but they faced a “red flag” warning for increasing winds and heightened fire danger going into the weekend. Firefighters from 16 states have rushed to California, and authorities were reinforcing 3,232 personnel on the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two blazes. The Carr Fire is 39-percent contained, but firefighters are widening fire breaks to prevent winds from causing it to flare up again. It has destroyed 1,567 homes and other structures and blackened 133,924 acres (54,197 hectares), making it the sixth most destructive California wildfire on record.

Gina Martinez,"After losing their home to California’s deadliest wildfire, one couple had an unexpected reunion with their loyal pet. K9 Paw Print Rescue, a non-profit, Bay Area-based animal rescue group, said on Facebook this week that the couple returned to the site of their lost home in Paradise, Calif., and their beloved dog Madison was there as well. “They hoped and prayed he would be OK,” the group posted. “When they finally got clearance to go back to the lot where their house once stood… Madison was waiting there for them as if he were protecting his former home. Never give up!” November’s Camp Fire in Northern California was the deadliest wildfire in state history, with 85 confirmed deaths and over 18,000 structures destroyed. As the wildfires spread, many residents had to abandon their home and belongings. In some tragic cases, fleeing residents had to leave pets behind. Shayla Sullivan, who said she volunteered in the fire zone, explained how she orchestrated the reunion in the comments of the Facebook post. Sullivan said she initially found the couple’s other dog Miguel and reunited them, but Madison remained in the canyons guarding territory, making him harder to catch. In the meantime, Sullivan left food and water out for Madison until she could lure him back home. Sullivan said she met with Andrea Gaylord, one of Madison’s owners, and had the idea of placing an article of clothing that would smell like her to “keep Madison’s hope alive until his people could return.” Sullivan happily posted that the plan worked out. “Well, I’m so happy to report that Andrea was allowed to return to her property today and there Madison was,” Sullivan wrote. “He had stayed to protect what was left of his home, and never gave up on his people! I’m so happy I’m crying as I write this! He didn’t give up through the storms or the fire!

LISA FRIEDMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. So did the president capture the causes of the California wildfires accurately? Lisa: The president’s tweet said that the California wildfires were worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Virtually every scientist and forest management expert agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweet was scientifically and factually inaccurate. Mr. Trump’s other admonition that California “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” raised fewer objections. But, state officials pointed out, California devoted more than $250 million in state funds this year alone on efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires. How about the president’s point about water policy? How is that related to wildfire management and firefighting? Is there any connection, as the president suggested?","Wednesday: Hazardous air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, accusations of slogan-stealing in the 10th district, and LeBron James excites bike activists.",2018-08-08T13:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Your Questions About Fires and Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/california-today-fires-and-climate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/us/07CALTODAY-01/merlin_142056570_ff8f2de5-3943-43a0-894e-84c0995be321-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfire,1
Paul Rogers,"CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device With the death toll at 83 and counting, the Camp Fire in Butte County ranks as the deadliest wildfire anywhere in the United States in 100 years. But the last time a wildfire killed this many people in America, many of the circumstances were eerily similar: Parched forests. Strong winds. Terrified townspeople killed while fleeing in their cars. Towns wiped off the map. A nation stunned. It happened in 1918 in Northern Minnesota, near Duluth. “Our photos are black and white,” said Rachel Martin, executive director of the Carlton County Historical Society in Cloquet, a town of 12,000 people. “The images from California’s fire are in color. But they look similar. When I heard Jerry Brown on TV, I thought he could be talking about this area. All the conditions were the same. America was a different place in 1918. Woodrow Wilson was president. World War I was in its final weeks. Charlie Chaplin filled movie theaters. Women still didn’t have the right to vote. And much of the country was built around a rural farming economy. On an unusually hot, sunny day on Oct. 12, and following a several years of drought, sparks from steam-powered locomotives ignited the vast pine forests of Northern Minnesota, about 100 miles north of Minneapolis. The monstrous blaze took people by surprise. Huge walls of flame, fed by piles of branches and bark left from logging operations, roared into towns like Cloquet and Moose Lake, wiping several off the map. The fire burned into the city of Duluth. Thousands of desperate people escaped on trains, or survived by diving into lakes and streams. The smoke plume was so big ships in the Atlantic Ocean reported it. Scores were killed as they tried to flee in Model T cars, which crashed and burned along the rural roadways as flames overtook them. When it was over, more than 4,000 houses and 41 schools were destroyed, 249,000 acres blackened and 453 people were dead. Many bodies were never found. It was the worst disaster in the United States since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Get breaking news alerts on wildfire and other important stories – Sign up now People who live in the small towns near Duluth have marked this year with tributes and commemorations of that terrible event 100 years ago. They have watched with sadness at California’s loss. And they know how long the scars and memories will last. Thats how you tell time around here,” Martin said. “Something either happened before or after the fire. Every family from here who has lived here a long time has family stories to tell. We have filing cabinets full of them. It was a really big deal. Cloquet, Minnesota was destroyed in a huge wildfire in October 1918 that killed 453 people. (Carlton County Historical Society) Families died while trying to take refuge in wells and root cellars. One family, the Soderbergs, lost 13 people, including nine children, when they hid in a root cellar and the fire consumed all the oxygen. A 27-foot-tall obelisk at Riverside Cemetery in Moose Lake marks the spot where 200 victims were buried in a mass grave. The event remains the deadliest disaster in Minnesota history. After the fires, residents sued the railroad companies, but didn’t win repayment until 1935 after 17 years of court battles. In the weeks after, people flocked to the town to help it rebuild. As with other decimated towns, and likely with Paradise, some survivors moved on for good. “The weekend after the fire, 300 carpenters from Duluth built hundreds of houses,” Martin said. “They worked furiously to make it livable. But a lot of people didnt come back. They stayed with relatives or couldnt afford a new house. It displaced a lot of people. Letters from survivors paint a harsh picture — some of which is echoed in the stories from Paradise. The flames looked as if they reached the sky, and it roared like thunder,” 20-year-old Tony Hanson wrote in a letter to his sister Alice, after the Cloquet fire. “I cannot tell how terrible it looked out on the west side. Mothers with children in their arms all burned together. Car after car all along the road were burned and Moose Lake is under military rule. It is just covered with tents soldiers guarding everywhere. You have to get a pass to go in and out of town. They caught one man robbing the dead they held a little trial and took him out and shot him.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Wildfires that destroyed entire American towns were not uncommon in the late 1800s and very early 1900s. The 1871 Peshtigo Fire killed about 1,500 people in Wisconsin and Michigan, with so many fatalities that there werent enough survivors in some communities to identify the dead. The Great Fire of 1910 burned 3 million acres in Washington, Idaho and Montana, killing 86 and sending smoke plumes to New York. Afterward, the U.S. Forest Service set a policy of putting out fires by 10 a.m. the next morning, and radios, helicopters, planes and other equipment improved safety dramatically over the generations. But now, with hotter, larger fires growing ever more intense in a warming world, creating fire tornadoes and walls of flame hundreds of feet tall, whole towns could again burn down, fire experts say. “Fire scientists Ive been talking to have been predicting this,” said Michael Kodas, author of Megafire: The Race to Extinguish a Deadly Epidemic of Flame. “Were finally seeing it happen. Its terribly sad. Its probably going to happen again and happen more often. Fires destroyed whole neighborhoods in the San Diego suburbs in 2007. They burned into the city limits of Colorado Springs, the second largest city in Colorado, in 2012, destroying 346 homes. Last year, the Tubbs fire leveled 2,800 homes in Santa Rosa, killing 22 people. Complete California wildfire coverage with latest updates and stories from the scene – Read the stories Jeff Masters, a meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground, a weather website, put together a list of the most deadly wildfires in U.S. history, combining information from databases and other sources. When he saw where the Paradise fire fit in — on par with fires from a century gone by — he said it underscored the impact of warmer temperatures, longer fire seasons and millions of people who now live in fire-prone areas. “I was shocked,” he said. “We thought we eradicated this. Its a very sobering reminder we are in a new climate regime, and some of the old threats we thought were past are with us again. The same goes for hurricanes. Were an increasingly vulnerable society. We have more people, more people in harm’s way, and more extreme weather. That’s adding up to higher death tolls.

KATU Staff,"THE DALLES, Ore. – A fast-moving wildfire has grown to nearly 45,000 acres in Wasco and Sherman counties, burning through structures and forcing people to evacuate their homes. Deputies said they found a person dead Wednesday afternoon near a tractor that had been burned by the flames. The Substation Fire broke out on Tuesday near The Dalles. Wind coupled with the hot, dry conditions caused the fire to quickly spread across the regional terrain of grass and shrubbery. Late Wednesday afternoon, the Sherman County Sheriff's Office issued a Level 3 (GO) evacuation for the towns of Moro and Grass valley. Wasco, which is nearby, is under a Level 2 (GET SET) evacuation. Oregon Dept. of Transportation officials closed down a large portion of Highway 97, from Biggs Junction to Madras - where it joins Hwy 197 to the south. Governor Kate Brown declared the fire a conflagration earlier in the day, which allows the state fire marshal to mobilize fire resources to help fight the fire. Calmer wind conditions are allowing firefighters to better fight the fire, which is primarily burning through the Deschutes Canyon area. The Deschutes River is closed to river traffic, and crews are working to evacuate hikers and campers in the area. Air resources - both helicopters and jets - are working to help with the fire suppression. Lt. Damon Simmons, a spokesman for the Oregon State Fire Marshal, said the fire growth is slowing, but that could change at any moment. ""Yesterday, when we saw a big push was in the afternoon and evening. So that is still a big concern as these winds pick up,” said Lt. Simmons. No word on what caused the fire. The Red Cross has set up a shelter at The Dalles Middle School for those displaced by the fire. The sheriff's office said Home at Last will take care of dogs for free and the The Dalles Riders Club can help take care of other animals. LEVEL 3: Moro and Grass valley are under a Level 3 evacuation A Level 3 evacuation was put in place for Eight Mile Road at Emerson Loop Road to Emerson Loop Road and Company Hollow Road, as well as all of Wrentham Market Road and Mason Road. Deschutes River from Sheers Bridge to the mouth and Deschutes Park are at Level 3. South of Gordon Ridge Rd from the Deschutes River, east to Hwy 97 and south to King Lane, South along Sayers Rd to Payne Loop is a Level 3. LEVEL 2: Wasco is at a Level 2 notice. North of Gordon Ridge Rd to Interstate 84 and HWY 206, east to Hwy 97 and south along Henrichs, Doumand and Lone Rock Rd, and south to Rutledge Lane, as well as the area further south between Finnegan Rd to the Deschutes River is a Level 2.

JONATHAN J. COOPER / AP,"(PARADISE, Calif.) — With hugs, teachers and a touch of anxiety, thousands of children returned to school and some semblance of routine Monday, three weeks after Northern California’s deadly wildfire destroyed their homes and classrooms. Schools in Butte County have been closed since Nov. 8, when the blaze swept through the towns of Paradise, Concow and Magalia in the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century. At least 88 people were killed and dozens remain unaccounted for. About 31,000 students in all went back to school. Many of them are going to class in other buildings because their schools were damaged or destroyed, or are inaccessible inside evacuation zones. Some families have left the state. Others are staying with friends or relatives, too far from the fire-stricken area to drive in every day. But nearly all the teachers are returning to provide a familiar and comfortable face to the children who are able to make it to class. “It’s important that the kids are able to stay together and have some sort of normalcy in the crazy devastation that we’re having now,” said Jodi Seaholm, whose daughter Mallory is a third-grader. Mallory underwent radiation in October to treat a recurrence of brain cancer and showed no fear, Seaholm said, but “this situation with her house burning down has absolutely devastated her.” Counselors brought in from around the country were in nearly every classroom Monday to help children who were distressed by their escape through a burning town and the loss of their homes, Paradise Superintendent Michelle John said at a celebratory news conference. Many of the teachers lost their homes as well. “Our kids are traumatized,” John said. “Their families are traumatized.” Two neighboring school districts have allowed children from Paradise to take over available space. Kids who previously went to Paradise Elementary are going to school in Oroville, while children from Ponderosa Elementary are going to a school in Durham. Most of Paradise High School survived but is inaccessible. The district doesn’t have space yet for intermediate and high school classrooms, so for the 13 days before the holiday break begins, those students will learn through independent study. They will have access to online assignments and a drop-in center at the Chico mall where they can get help from teachers or see classmates. But schoolwork will probably be secondary to dealing with trauma and reconnecting with friends, said Paradise High Principal Loren Lighthall. “They don’t have their church, they don’t have their school, they don’t have their work, they don’t have their friends. They don’t have any of that stuff and we’re asking them to write five-paragraph essays?” Lighthall said. “It’s just unreasonable at this point. We’re going to do it, but we’re going to be super flexible with what we require.” Marissa Nypl is living with her family at her husband’s coworker’s home in West Sacramento, which is 90 miles (145 kilometers) from her 10-year-old daughter’s temporary school in Durham, until they can move into a rental home much closer. It’s too far to drive every day, but Nypl wanted to be sure her daughter was there to be with her peers on the first day back. “The school’s going to be the only thing they have to latch on to to feel like something’s still routine,” she said.

Matt Simon,"Nestled in the foothills of Californias Sierra Nevada Mountains is the quaint Gold Rush town of Nevada City. Surrounded by unkempt brush, the old, highly flammable city is in danger: with Californias wildfires raging with unprecedented ferocity in recent years, one spark could doom Nevada City to the same fate that neighboring Paradise met in November.
But not if the goats get there first. Realizing its predicament, Nevada City has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay goats (or, more accurately, their herders) to clear brush at the edges of town. Its called, yes, Goat Fund Me. And its part of an ungulate awakening: All across the state, business is booming for herders as panicked homeowners and towns reckon with the wildfire menace.
There is no single explanation for why Californias wildfire problem has gotten so bad. Climate change is oneless rain in the fall means dryer brush, which in turn coincides with seasonal winds that fan massive blazes. More cities encroaching on wildlands is another.
Yet a third factorthe one most pertinent to the interests of goatsis the fact that California has been really, really bad about clearing the brush that turns into tinder. For comparison, the southeastern US, an area only five times bigger than California, did prescribed burns on 5.5 million acres last year, 100 times more than the Golden State. Prescribed burns are expensive, and a huge chunk of Californias fire money goes to battling ever-larger blazes.
Goats, though? A herd's work is relatively cheap, around $1,000 an acre (200 goats can tear through an acre a day). I realized money was an issue, says Nevada City vice mayor Reinette Senum, who launched Goat Fund Me. We can go out and pursue grants but that takes months, and we don't have months. The best time for the goats to do their thing is in the winter, before new growth blooms during the rains of spring. That and the ranchers already have their goats rented out for the rest of the year.
The first step is to identify the most prone areas with the help of the fire chief, then reach out to residents there to tell them that there might soon be a special scent in the air. You've got to let neighbors know: for a couple days you might get a smell, says Senum. Your dogs might be disturbed because they're smelling goats and may want to go after them.
To be clear, the goats dont work alone. They have human handlers and their own muscle in the form of a big white dog. They're fiercely protective, says Brad Fowler, owner of the vegetation management company The Goat Works, which is working with the city. In California we've got mountain lions and coyotes and recently wolves. The dogs, just by their presence and their bark, discourage predators to go somewhere else.
The operation doesnt simply amount to letting goats loose on a property. Basically we have a mobile ranch, says Fowler. We're taking a ranch essentially with all the infrastructure that's included in that to every place we go. The team sets up solar-powered electric fences to keep the goats penned in a particular area. If possible they hunt down local creeks or ponds, but they may also truck in their own water.
But for the most part, once theyre in place, the goats are self-starters. Theyre highly efficient vegetation managers, since they convert a plants solar energy into protein and poop, which nourishes the ecosystem, whereas human crews have to cart off what they clear. Theyll eat most plants from the shoulder up, so dead grasses and such. (If you want to really clear grass, sheep are your best bet.) Nevada City has a particular problem with out-of-control blackberry bushes, whose thorns are no problem for the goats. They've got really nimble lips, says Fowler. It's funny to watch them. They'll hold the branch with their lips and reach in and bite it off with their back teeth.
Being goats, though, they dont necessarily abide by human notions of containment. A bad day would be, you get a call that all your animals are two miles away from where they're supposed to be, says Fowler. The good news is when that happens, people don't get as upset about it as they would if, say, your bulldozer got loose and ran over a bunch of houses. As long as they stay out of traffic, Im OK.
On their own, goats only do part of the job; theyre more of an advance party. They get in there and strip out the brush enough for human crews to come in with chainsaws to cart away the bigger branches and such. Of particular convenience is the fact that goats will happily eat poison oak. They're cute little things, but it's only one little piece, says Senum. Who doesn't love a goat?
Still, the firefighting ruminant business is booming in California, beyond Nevada City. It seems like everybody kind of woke up with these big fires, says Fowler. And I tell you what, there's a huge opportunity. If somebody wants to get into the business, now would be a good time.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Teams searching for remains from the deadliest wildfire in California history were able to comb through wreckage in dry weather on Saturday, but rains are expected to return next week and officials warned of a threat of mudslides. The so-called Camp Fire all but obliterated the mountain community of Paradise, 175 miles (280 km) northeast of San Francisco, on Nov. 8, killing at least 84 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes. Some 475 people from Paradise and surrounding communities remain unaccounted for, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Hundreds of police officers and volunteers have searched in and around Paradise since the fire swept through the area. The 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of rain that fell there during the last few days turned ash from the thousands of destroyed homes into slurry, complicating the work of finding bodies reduced to bone fragments. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has warned that remains of some victims may never be found. Teams resumed their search on Saturday, Butte County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Miranda Bowersox said, ahead of more rains that are expected to start on Wednesday. A total of 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of rain is forecast for areas burned by the Camp Fire from Wednesday through Saturday, said meteorologist David Roth of the federal Weather Prediction Center. Rainfall earlier this week did not trigger any large debris flows, but Roth said the danger of a mudslide will remain far into the future for hillsides that flames have stripped of vegetation. “Any heavy rain event really for the next few to several years would be a problem there,” he said. Authorities said they would lift evacuation orders in some areas south of Paradise on Saturday. The city of Paradise was a popular destination for retirees, with people ages 65 or older accounting for a quarter of its 27,000 residents. Most of the victims of the fire identified so far were of retirement age. With help from rainfall, firefighters have contained 98 percent of the blaze, which torched 154,000 acres (62,000 hectares) - an area five times the size of San Francisco, officials said. Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire. Thousands of people forced to flee Paradise spent Thanksgiving in warehouses in the nearby city of Chico, or with friends or relatives in nearby towns.

Dozens of people - including families with children - have died as they tried to escape the flames. But fires are also raging in Sweden, as far north as the Arctic Circle, and have caused huge damage in countries including Portugal, the UK and the US in recent months. So what is happening to cause these infernos and how can we tackle them? Flames take hold Fires can occur naturally in woodland or brush, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, the vast majority of wildfires - as many as 90% worldwide - are started by humans, according to experts. The cause could be barbecue charcoal, a discarded cigarette or even arson. As long as there is fuel and oxygen available, the flames can take hold easily. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A strong wind blows embers in California Greece had an unusually dry winter and spring this year, leaving grass and scrubland particularly flammable, says Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). As well as a lack of rainfall, wind also determines how devastating the fire will be, depending on its strength and direction. ""Burning embers can travel quite far and start new fires that could spread for kilometres if they are big enough,"" says Smith. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: Dry grass burns as fire crews tackle the flames in Greece Surface fires - burning on a forest floor, for instance - tend to spread slowly and can be more easily controlled. In fact some surface fires can be good, says Cathelijne Stoof, a wild land fire expert based in the Netherlands. ""It helps plants regenerate,"" she adds. ""The problem is when the flames can climb up low level branches and get to the tops of the trees. That's when you can't stop it."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 15 July: Due to the dry weather, about 80 wildfires have been burning in Sweden The most dangerous part of a blaze is called the head fire, explains Thomas Smith. It is driven forward by the wind and is very difficult to fight directly because it has long flame lengths. Image copyright AFP Image caption 17 July: This aerial view provided by the European Space Agency shows smoke billowing from several fires between the west coast of Norway to central Sweden. Head fires burn with blacker smoke But it is not just wood and grass that quickly become fuel for wildfires. Nearby homes and vehicles will combust because of the materials they contain, such as plastics and rubber. Hazardous In Greece, cars in the road caught fire before the surrounding verdant trees because they were more flammable. And they did not need to be directly licked by the flames to do so. ""It comes down to the amount of energy given off by the flames,"" says Smith. ""The cars could be tens of metres away and still be close enough to ignite."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 24 July: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati near Athens Sadly, people are often killed by wildfires as they attempt to escape. Many of the victims in Greece were trapped in traffic jams as people tried to flee as fast as possible, according to forest risk management expert Alexander Held. But this could have been avoided with better evacuation plans in place, he says. Fine fuel such as dry shrubs should be cleared away from roadsides and houses to stop flames getting close, he adds. ""This was a bomb waiting to explode."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: The contents of a home, including dry wooden beams, go up in flames in Greece Heat and flames are the most immediate dangers people face in a wildfire. However, smoke can also be harmful if you have an existing condition such as asthma or lung disease, or are exposed for weeks or months.

Fumes produced by burning plastic or asbestos inside homes are much more hazardous. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 25 March: Ruins of a house are out of bounds after a bushfire in Tathra, Australia As well as changing climates, the differing land use over the centuries has led to more wildfires in Europe, according to experts. ""There used to be small agricultural fields across Europe and people would manage the land,"" says Cathelijne Stoof. ""But in the 20th Century people moved away and the land became overgrown. So when you do have a fire it spreads much more easily."" In the case of the huge fire near Saddleworth Moor in North West England, it was not just the vegetation that caught fire. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At its peak, the fire on Saddleworth Moor covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km) and burned for three weeks ""This fire definitely did get into the soil,"" says Dr Thomas Smith. The moorland is made up of peat soil, which is carbon-rich and needs little oxygen to burn, he explains. ""The fire gets underground and smoulders away.... It makes it much more difficult to put out."" Fighting fire Image copyright PA Image caption 28 June: Firefighters tackle a wildfire with beaters on Winter Hill near Bolton, UK Firefighters have a range of techniques to try to tackle a blaze by depriving it of oxygen or fuel. They need to have the right training to know which one will work the best. In the recent UK wildfires, they used beaters and water hoses to extinguish the flames. Dropping water and fire retardant containing fertiliser from planes and helicopters may also slow the spread of flames. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 7 December 2017: A plane drops fire retardant near a home near Los Alamos Road in Murrieta, California, last December Experts say one of the most effective methods of tackling wildfires is building firebreaks by clearing vegetation. But this is ""dirty and hard work"", says Alexander Held, and not an option that is always popular in public opinion. ""You can send a lot of helicopters and planes but without crews on the ground you won't put it out,"" he insists. Cathelijne Stoof agrees on the importance of creating firebreaks: in some places firefighters will create controlled fires to draw the energy out of the blaze they are battling. And she says fire prevention and land management should be ""sexier"" than it is now.

William J. Broad,"The Planet Labs fleet is part of a larger trend toward miniaturization. Satellites are shrinking in size and expanding in ambition. Made smaller, the craft are less expensive and more accessible to a wider group of interests, and they enable, among other advances, the ability to observe Earth's environment more completely and regularly than ever before. ""It's unbelievably significant,"" S. Pete Worden, a retired Air Force general and NASA official who now chairs the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, said of the trend. ""At first they were toys. Now it's revolutionary."" For years, space was dominated by just two nations, the United States and the Soviet Union. Their designs were big: Rockets grew taller than 20-story apartment buildings. Satellites expanded to the size of city buses. Spy satellites unfurled antennas nearly as large as football fields. The debut of the iPhone in 2007 signalled to a new generation of satellite-makers that their creations, too, could shrink. Early models were called PhoneSats because their electronic cores were made of smartphones. The satellites cost just $7,000 apiece. Today, relatively small rockets send aloft satellites the size of handbags, knapsacks and pizza boxes. The spacecraft teem with tiny sensors, circuits, lenses, motors, batteries and antennas. Last year, a single launch in India cast into orbit 104 satellites, shattering the previous world record for deployment. The spacecraft came from India, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, as well as from two U.S. companies, including Planet Labs. Ghana, a West African nation, entered the Space Age last year with a satellite the size of a can of beans. Outer space is being democratized. Typically, the new spacecraft cost so little to build and send aloft that universities and even high schools are getting into the act. On Nov. 10, students from six high schools in Irvine, Calif., cheered as their tiny craft was carried into orbit. Its mission is to study Venus. ""It's been really great,"" said Brent Freeze, an aerospace specialist who advises the 160 students. ""It's a way to get smart young people to talk to each other and work together."" Even NASA, a founding member of the big-is-better club, has joined the new wave. In May, it fired a pair of briefcase-size craft, known together as Mars Cube One, toward Mars the first miniaturized probes to fly beyond Earth orbit. In October, after a voyage of nearly a half year, one of the twins snapped the first picture. ""Finally seeing the planet is definitely a big win,"" said Cody Colley, a mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Late last month, the pair flew past the red planet and successfully demonstrated that miniature devices can relay data from a lander on Mars back to Earth, paving the way for improved exploration. Mini, many, mighty To be sure, huge satellites still regularly fly into orbit, especially ones devoted to espionage and national security. These gargantuan craft are made by some of the world's largest corporations, and the costs can run to billions of dollars creating an incentive to keep making them big, aerospace critics say. But small is more affordable. After going through an experimental phase of development, minisatellites began to soar in number, said Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks global launches and publishes Jonathan's Space Report. The total number of spacecraft weighing 22 pounds or less grew from 12 in 2011, to 89 in 2013, to 125 in 2015, to 291 last year. McDowell expects the number to keep rising as more groups and companies join the trend. ""There was a feeling for a long time that space was a mature field,"" he said. ""That's gone away now."" Many of the new craft do traditional jobs on the cheap, such as assessing crops, mapping cities, relaying signals and managing natural resources. Wall Street analysts use the new flows of information to better assess futures markets. Companies such as Planet Labs want to make Earth observation less about spying than about helping scientists and the public better track environmental change, in an effort to improve management and remediation. On Dec. 3, a SpaceX rocket in California sent aloft 64 satellites made by Planet Labs, and a total of 17 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Finland, Italy, Jordan, Poland, South Korea and Thailand. The rocket also carried IRVINE02, the second minisatellite built by students of the Irvine school district. Another, a backpack-size craft made in the United States, is to open up and bounce radar signals off Earth's surface a major feat of miniaturization. Traditional space-based radars can see at night and through clouds but require big antennas. Instead, Capella Space, based in San Francisco, hired an origami expert to figure out how to fold a nearly 100-square-foot antenna into a tight bundle. ""It's the first of its kind,"" said Payam Banazadeh, the company's chief executive. ""Out of a tiny box comes a humongous structure."" Bigger goals lie ahead. The nation of Ghana is looking to build a tiny spacecraft with cameras powerful enough to track illegal mining and deforestation. Elon Musk, known for his Tesla cars and SpaceX rockets, wants to build a network of 12,000 tiny satellites that would beam internet access to billions of people in rural and suburban areas around the globe. Last February, when SpaceX launched two test satellites, Musk tweeted in clipped prose that the orbital network, called Starlink, ""will serve least served."" The company plans to start launching the satellites next year and have a rudimentary network in place by 2020, although the income potential for space-based internet is unclear. Not every space mission can use tiny satellites. Miniaturization may not work for orbiting telescopes used in astronomy, nor for high-powered satellites that beam television signals to rooftop antennas and home viewers. But the appeal of miniaturization is likely to grow: a large mission becomes less vulnerable to total failure if it can be subdivided into many tiny parts. ""You add robustness,"" said McDowell, the Harvard astronomer. ""That's been talked about for a long time, but now it's happening."" With the California fires now under control, Planet Labs is looking for new situations that could benefit from eyes on high. ""We're space geeks,"" Marshall, the company's head, conceded. But the goal, he added, was not just to reinvent the age but to learn ""how to use this technology for good."" Freeze, adviser to the satellite-building high school students in California, said he liked to think of the endeavour as reviving the lure of the unknowns: ""Our team,"" he said, ""has been working around the clock.""","Briefcase-sized minisatellites are changing the world above us TheRecord.com The Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in the state's history, was fully contained through the hard work of firefighters on the ground, with some help from a swarm...",2018-12-16T20:57:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thespec.com'}",Briefcase-sized minisatellites are changing the world above us - TheRecord.com,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9081418-briefcase-sized-minisatellites-are-changing-the-world-above-us/,https://dynamicmedia.zuza.com/zz/m/original_/e/4/e4df7aeb-fe7f-42f4-b146-f0d5292e4738/B88498959Z.1_20181216152514_000_GPQEC0H7.3-0_Super_Portrait.jpg,,Thespec.com,wildfire,1
Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A firefighter was killed on Saturday while battling a wildfire burning near Yosemite National Park, California state fire officials said, bringing to at least 10 the number of such deaths this year as wildfires rage across the U.S. West. Braden Varney was killed on the fireline while operating a bulldozer at the Ferguson Fire early this morning, said Scott Maclean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). Further details on Varney’s death were not immediately available. “The winds are really erratic, there’s just no moisture in the vegetation, it is still so dry regardless of what rains we’ve had,” Maclean said. Varney was using the bulldozer to try to hold back a blaze that has burned 150 acres (61 hectares) in rugged, inaccessible forest near Savage Trading Post, some 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Yosemite in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and about 140 miles (225 km) east of San Francisco. Nine U.S. wildland firefighters had been killed up to Tuesday as the United States faced another extreme year for wildfires, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) data. Fourteen wildland firefighters died in all of 2017 when the United States suffered its second worst wildfire year on record, with 10 million acres (4 million hectares) blackened. Varney worked for CalFire. The last CalFire firefighter to die was in December 2017 on the Thomas Fire, the largest in California’s history and one of a rash of blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed 43 people in the state. Nearly all of California faces abnormally dry or drought conditions, even though the state’s historic 2012-2017 drought is officially over, according to the Drought Monitor agency. The state has had its worst start to the fire period in a decade, with 220,421 acres burned through Thursday morning, according to NIFC data. U.S. wildfires have already burned more than 3.3 million acres this year, more than the year-to-date average of about 3 million acres in the past 10 years, according to the NIFC tracking website. As the summer continues, the risk of large wildfires is set to reach normal levels in much of the Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas, thanks to strong summer rains, but risk levels will remain above normal in California through at least October, according to NIFC data.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Climate lawsuits have been piling up on the coasts. But a pioneering duo of Colorado counties and the city of Boulder have filed the first landlocked lawsuit against big oil earlier this week, suing Exxon and tar sands producer Suncor Energy. It represents a new front in the legal war that’s pitting communities stuck paying for the costs of climate change against the companies that caused it. And it could spread to neighboring states in flyover country. “Yes, sea level rise will be important,” Elise Jones, a commissioner in Boulder County who is part of the new suit, told Earther. “Middle America is being hit by climate change, too. We thought it was important that we tell that story.” The story is one of both big, present impacts visible in the wildfire-scarred hills and flood-scoured waterways, and small ones tucked away in the Excel spreadsheets about the costs of road paving, culverts, and air conditioners for schools. “In our eyes, it’s a pretty simple issue of property rights,” David Bookbinder, a lawyer with the libertarian Niskanen Center who is consulting on the case, told Earther. “We have local communities faced with tremendously escalating costs of dealing with climate change. It’s not some future hypothetical. It’s been happening for years. It’s happening for today, and quite literally, local taxpayers are getting stuck with the bill.” Boulder County, for instance, is still recovering from a 1,000-year rainfall event in 2013 that sent murky torrents of water streaming down canyons, tearing out roads and bridges, and inundating the city of Boulder. “Middle America is being hit by climate change, too.” The county blew through its $65 million in reserve cash shortly after the disaster. To make up for the shortfall, it asked residents to approve a five-year sales tax hike. It also relied on federal funds and public tax money to help with cleanup and recovery. And Jones told Earther recovery still isn’t over. “I was a brand new commissioner when the flood hit and I remember somebody saying it was going to take at least five years to rebuild and I thought they were crazy,” she said. “But it’s going to take a full decade to recover from that one incident.” Research has shown climate change increased the intensity of the rainfall event by about 30 percent. The rise in extreme precipitation events portends an even more challenging—and potentially costlier—future. Good news! Oil companies are woke to the reality of climate change. There’s just one small hitch.… Read more Read A county-commissioned report shows that even without climate shocks like the 2013 flood or a 2010 wildfire that was Colorado’s most destructive at the time, the cost of adaptation will be steep. Peering into those Excel sheets and then overlaying the climate impacts of more heat, wildfires, and increased risk of drought between the deluges revealed the county could be stuck with a bill of up to $157 million in adaptation costs if we do nothing to curb carbon emissions. Boulder is a comparatively wealthy county with a solid tax base of 319,000, but Jones said the burden of adaptation is too much to handle, which is why they’re suing oil companies. “We can’t afford it and it’s not fair,” she said. If that’s true for Boulder County, then it’s even more so for San Miguel County, which is also part of the suit. The county is located in southwest Colorado, and home to spectacular peaks straight off the Coors label ( seriously ) as well as sprawling farm land. Its tax base is smaller than Boulder’s but, as with so many counties in the West, the infrastructure needs are the same. “San Miguel County has a population of less than 8,000,” Bookbinder said. “They have as many roads as Boulder County and they’re 1/40th of the size. They’re in a box. They have to spend money and there’s no one handing out hundreds of millions [for upkeep].” The lawsuit against Exxon and Suncor is one way to find funds. Oil companies have known for decades about the impacts of climate change, all while spending millions to sow doubt publicly. Exxon’s knowledge was exposed in groundbreaking reporting from by InsideClimate News in 2015 and since then, other dominoes have fallen. Those reports have opened oil companies to a growing host of lawsuits by local governments seeking damages, and criminal investigations by attorneys general in Massachusetts, New York and elsewhere. Suncor was named in the Colorado lawsuit because it worked in the state and produces the dirtiest oil on the planet in the form of Albertan tar sands. “The idea that the fossil fuel industry would say, yep our products are causing this, we’re going make more of them, [including] products that are more carbon intensive seems absurd,” Bookbinder said. “Talk about giving the finger to local governments.” It will likely take years for all these suits to wend their way through federal and state courts. Whether they result in payouts or settlements is still very much unknown, but Amy Markwell, a lawyer for San Miguel County, told Earther the defendants’ arguments aren’t that hard to follow. “Climate change can be a fairly complicated issue but this lawsuit, we’re trying to keep it pretty simple,” she said. “Your neighbor does something that damages you or your property, you can go to your local courthouse and seek local damage payment.” This is, in essence, the same argument that coastal communities are making. The new Colorado case shows the damages landlocked counties face will be different but no less severe, and that big oil can expect more legal challengers from all corners to come looking for a just settlement.","Climate lawsuits have been piling up on the coasts.

Alexandria Sage,"COTTONWOOD, Calif. (Reuters) - Tucker Zimmerman has gotten little sleep during the raging deadly fire in Shasta County, California. The retired U.S. Marine has rushed into a new battle, as a volunteer rescuing stranded horses and other livestock. “I’m just the guy who moves stuff around,” he said modestly. The “stuff” he speaks of refers to the panicked horses and other livestock he wrangles out of harm’s way when they get left behind after the humans have fled. With a large trailer borrowed from his job selling tractor equipment, Zimmerman has ventured daily into various evacuation zones just as homeowners threatened by the Carr Fire were rushing in the other direction. On Saturday, he had just delivered to safety five horses he managed to capture in one newly evacuated area, before receiving a call to pick up others nearby. The horses were being taken to stables, rodeo grounds and ranches whose owners have opened their property to the steady stream of livestock rescued by Zimmerman since Wednesday. “He restored my faith in humanity,” said Noah Urban, an Oregon resident whose stranded 6-year-old horse named Bolt was saved by Zimmerman. The two connected through Facebook. “You’re not just helping the animals, he’s helping people to alleviate their stress,” Urban said. “It would be like losing your children. If you had to leave them behind, I can’t even think about it.” Zimmerman is not alone. Communicating through social media, text messages, radio and word-of-mouth, a network of animal lovers and animal-control authorities have banded together over the past few days to rescue as many stranded critters as possible. At an outlet mall in nearby Anderson, the din of barking fills an empty storefront used as overflow housing for the animals of Haven Humane Society. Besides their usual charges seeking full-time homes, volunteers were accepting dogs and cats brought in by evacuated residents unable to care for their pets while displaced. Four Pomeranians delivered in two armfuls sniffed their new cages, a fuzzy Newfoundland mix pawed at his cage, and a tabby cat huddled wide-eyed gazing at the commotion. Only a small green turtle delivered in a glass tank seemed unfazed. Dan Fults, 47, and his wife had dropped off their Huskies, Balto and Lucian, to be cared for at the facility, an hour after fleeing their home. The couple were keeping their two cats and a parrot for the time being. “Sure, I have valuable things in my home, but the pets obviously take priority,” Fults said. Back at the Cottonwood Creek Ranch, Zimmerman was in his truck responding to the latest calls for assistance. “When I was deployed (in the military), I couldn’t have animals, but I am an animal lover,” he said. While Zimmerman has a proven talent for handling nervous horses, he doesn’t discriminate against two-legged creatures in need of help. “I saved a guy named Matt. He was trying to water down his house” as flames erupted, Zimmerman recalled. “I said, ‘Let’s go!’” Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Steve Gorman and Sandra Maler","Tucker Zimmerman has gotten little sleep during the raging deadly fire in Shasta County, California.

Rollo Ross,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - Assisted by calmer winds at their backs, firefighters in northern California on Tuesday stepped up a drive to surround a deadly blaze raging for more than a week around the city of Redding, as 14 people listed as missing turned up safe. Six others reported missing in the fire zone, 160 miles (260 km) north of the state capital Sacramento, remained unaccounted for, said Redding police Sergeant Todd Cogle, who has overseen the effort to find them. Frustrated in their search after discovering most of the homes of missing individuals were spared from the fire, police took the unusual step of publicizing the names of 20 people whose whereabouts were unknown. Within three hours, 14 of them, previously unaware they were being sought and unreachable by cell phone, were located when they saw their names on television or the internet and contacted authorities, Cogle said. “It speaks to the power of the media and social media,” he told Reuters. Cogle said he was hopeful the remaining six would show up safe as well, adding that at least half of their homes were still intact. The Carr Fire, which erupted last Monday, has claimed six confirmed fatalities since gale-force winds whipped the blaze into a cyclone of flames that jumped a river and roared with little warning into Redding and adjacent Shasta County communities on Thursday night. Whole neighbourhoods were laid to waste as residents fled for their lives, many carrying only their pets and few belongings. Among the dead were two firefighters, as well as two young children who perished with their great-grandmother as they huddled under a wet blanket while their house went up in smoke. Nearly 900 homes and 300 other buildings were reduced to ruins in what state officials now rank as the seventh most destructive wildfire in California history. Some 3,600 firefighters arrayed against the blaze gained further ground, helped by a second day of diminished winds. State fire officials reported 27 percent of the blaze’s perimeter corralled by containment lines, up from 5 percent during much of the past week, even as the footprint of scorched landscape grew to 110,000 acres (45,000 hectares). Some evacuees have been allowed to return home, though as many as 37,000 remained displaced. Lighter winds also gave a boost to some 2,000 firefighters battling a pair of fires at the southern end of Mendocino National Forest, where some 12,200 people were under mandatory evacuation orders. Those blazes, dubbed the Ranch and River fires, have charred more than 74,000 acres (30,000 hectares), with containment measured at 12 percent for the two together. The Carr Fire stands as the most formidable of 94 wildfires burning across 13 U.S. Western states, from Texas to Alaska, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. California, with 17 large active blazes reported, has been one of the hardest hit, with a volatile mix of triple digit-temperatures, erratic winds and drought-parched vegetation fueling intense wildfire activity.

Alexandria Sage,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - A monster wildfire in northern California burned unchecked on Saturday after it killed two firefighters, destroyed hundreds of structures and sent thousands of frantic residents racing from their homes. Some 3,400 firefighters on the ground and in helicopters and airplanes battled the 48,300-acre (19,500 hectares) Carr Fire early on Saturday as it ripped through Redding, a city of 90,000 people, in California’s scenic Shasta-Trinity area. More than 38,000 residents in Redding and elsewhere in Shasta County fled their homes as the fire began to gain speed and intensity on Thursday, destroying 500 structures and leaving Keswick, a town of 450, in smoldering ruins. The fire, which was just three percent contained after igniting six days ago, has been fed by high temperatures and low humidity, which were expected for at least the next week, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) Director Ken Pimlott. “This fire is a long way from done,” he said. A bulldozer operator and a member of the Redding Fire Department were killed in the blaze. A Redding hospital said it had treated eight people, including three firefighters. The flames erupted into a firestorm on Thursday when it jumped across the Sacramento River and swept into the western side of Redding, about 150 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, before gale-force winds during the night created a fire “tornado.” “This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity, uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways,” Pimlott said. Firefighters and police were hustling door to door to usher civilians out of harm’s way, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). California has had its worst start to the fire season in a decade, with 289,727 acres burned through Friday morning, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) data. Governor Jerry Brown requested emergency federal assistance to prevent an “imminent catastrophe” as Shasta County tried to find supplies and water for evacuated residents and care for horses and cattle rescued from ranches and farms. Wildfires have blackened an estimated 4.15 million acres (1.68 million hectares) in the United States this year. That was well above average for the same period over the past 10 years but down from 5.27 million acres (2.13 million hectares) in the first seven months of 2017, NIFC reported. Cal Fire said the Cranston Fire, about 110 miles (177 km) east of Los Angeles had blackened 12,300 acres and was 16 percent contained. The Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, which has charred 46,675 acres, was 29 percent contained.

Reuters Editorial,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - California firefighters on Monday were gaining ground on a massive blaze that has killed six people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, while rescuers searched for seven people unaccounted for in the wildfire. The Carr Fire, outside Redding, California, ignited a week ago and doubled in size over the weekend, charring an area the size of Detroit, forcing 38,000 people to flee their homes and claiming lives of two firefighters and another person, as well as a woman and her two young great-grandchildren. Centered 150 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, it is the deadliest of the 90 wildfires burning across the United States. Collectively, wildfires have blackened 4.4 million acres (1.8 million hectares) of land so far this year, 21 percent more than the 10-year average for the time period, according to federal data. The more than 3,000 firefighters battling the Carr Fire began to turn the tables by Sunday afternoon, cutting containment lines around 17 percent of its perimeter, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Previously the fire was just 5 percent contained. Gale-force winds that drove the fire late last week have eased to moderate speeds, but temperatures are again expected to top 100 Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. Firefighting officials on Sunday also said they would begin to return people to their homes as soon as possible. The fire grew rapidly beginning on Thursday, confounding fire officials with the speed of its movement. “Unfortunately this new normal is kind of upon us in California,” Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said on CBS This Morning. “More deadly, more destructive fires, more often and it’s obviously requiring additional resources.” At least 874 buildings have been destroyed by the 95,000-acre blaze, Cal Fire said. The fire leveled the town of Keswick, home to 450 people. It also sparked an effort to rescue people’s horses and livestock in the rugged region, a popular fishing destination. Some 260 National Guard troops and 100 police officers were stationed in evacuated neighborhoods to guard against looting, and the Shasta County Sheriff’s office said two people had been arrested over the weekend for looting. Another California fire prompted a rare closure of much of Yosemite National Park last week, while a third forced mass evacuations from the mountain resort community of Idyllwild, east of Los Angeles.

Associated Press,"(LOS ANGELES) — Southern California Edison said Tuesday its equipment likely sparked one of two ignition points for the massive wildfire that tore through California’s central coast last year. Witnesses reported flames near the company’s power poles in Ventura County last December and the utility “believes that its equipment was associated with this ignition,” Edison said. Dozens of lawsuits allege Edison equipment caused the deadly Thomas Fire, but the statement marked the first time the company made such an acknowledgment. Edison hasn’t determined if its equipment started the second ignition point nearly 6 miles (10 km) away. Fire officials declined to comment on Edison’s statement because no official cause of the fire has been determined. A multi-agency investigation is continuing. Investigators were looking at “every possibility” ranging from weather to human or even animal factors, and the nearly year-long probe probably won’t be completed for another 30 days, Ventura County fire Capt. Stan Ziegler said. The Thomas Fire was the second-largest in California history, scorching 440 square miles (1,140 sq. km.) and destroying more than 1,000 buildings in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Two people died. A month later, heavy rains fell on hills left bare by the fire, unleashing mudslides that killed 21 and left two missing. Edison’s disclosure came as an update to investors but was released publicly to keep communities and customers informed, the company said.

Ed Cara,"The stomach flu has touched ground on the 2018 Winter Olympics, which begin in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Thursday, and officials are pulling out the stops to keep it from derailing the games. According to CNN, Olympics organizers have reported 41 security guards afflicted by “a sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea” over the weekend, four days before the games are set to begin. The guards are thought to be afflicted by norovirus, an incredibly contagious and prolific germ typically spread through eating contaminated food and water or even touching contaminated surfaces. Norovirus is the most commonly reported source of food poisoning, and it causes more than 600 million cases every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms, aside from vomiting and diarrhea, also include nausea, fever, and headaches, and typically last one to three days. As anyone who’s had a particularly unlucky cruise might know, the virus thrives in confined spaces, since it can take as little as 12 hours after you’ve been exposed to become sick and contagious. All 41 guards were reportedly staying at the same apartment, but it’s not known how they became sick in the first place. Trying to head off the outbreak before it spreads like wildfire, officials have momentarily sequestered 1,200 guards in their rooms and replaced them with 900 military personnel as of Monday afternoon. Buses and public spaces have also been decontaminated. Meanwhile, Olympic and public health officials at the Korean Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) are scrambling to identify the source of the outbreak. “KCDC dispatched an immediate response team to the Pyeongchang site to check additional people for symptoms, check the origin of the exposure, take measures to control infection and prevent spread,” the agency said in a statement Monday. Norovirus feels like a living nightmare, but thankfully, it’s rarely life-threatening for most (exceptions include the very young and immunocompromised). The guards are reportedly in stable condition. If that’s not enough of a bad omen, the Olympics are now expected to begin during what might be a record-breaking cold snap.

Associated Press,"(BERLIN) — German insurance company Munich Re says the Northern California wildfire that killed dozens of people and burned down the town of Paradise was the world’s costliest single natural disaster in 2018.
The reinsurance giant said on Tuesday that the November fire caused overall losses of $16.5 billion. The company said some $12.5 billion in losses were insured.
The firestorm destroyed thousands of homes and other structures.
Munich Re said losses from all natural disasters reached $160 billion last year, above the inflation-adjusted average of $140 billion for the last 30 years but below 2017’s hurricane-driven high of $350 billion.
Board member Torsten Jeworrek said increasing wildfires in California appear linked to climate change.
He was quoted saying that “action is urgently needed on building codes and land use to help prevent losses.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California. The Monday morning update from CAL FIRE shows that 966 structures have been destroyed, making the Carr Fire the eighth-most destructive wildfire to hit the state. At only 20 percent contained, the fire still poses a risk to 5,012 more structures, according to CAL FIRE, meaning that amount of property lost (and its ranking on the list) could rise, especially as assessment crews are able to access more areas that were hit by the fire. At least six people are dead and more are missing, numbers that could sadly also rise. The majority of the losses have occurred in neighborhoods on the north and western side of Redding, a city of 90,000 located on Interstate 5 about two and a half hours north of Sacramento. The Carr Fire rushed into town on Thursday night, jumping the Sacramento River and continued its rampant growth on the backs of gusty winds and 110-degree-Fahrenheit heat. The fire continued to grow over the weekend, doubling in size from day to day before it slowed down on Sunday night. As of Monday, the fire has burned 98,724 acres. The heat in particular has led to near-record-low vegetation moisture, leaving trees, shrubs, and grassland primed to go up in smoke. Vegetation has burned so intensely that the fire has sparked a vortex of smoke and flames, twisting fire tornadoes, and towering pyrocumulus clouds. Smoke has blanketed much of Northern California, spiking air quality to unhealthy levels. Four of the 10 most destructive fires in state history have occurred in the past year, and eight of them have happened since 2000. Three of them occurred last year alone as part of the conflagration in Wine Country and the Thomas Fire that hit Southern California. This wildfire season has proven to be catastrophic as well. Beyond the Carr Fire, wildfires have burned 410,000 acres, more than double the average for this point in the year, according to statistics compiled by Steven Bowen, a meteorologist at insurance company Aon Benfield. The dangerous Ferguson Fire caused Yosemite Valley to be evacuated as a safety precaution last week. And earlier this month, the County Fire ripped through Yolo County, eating up 1,000 acres of land per hour at its peak as onlookers watched its advance from a casino parking garage. The stories of this fire season and last reflect two troubling realities: climate change is increasing the risk of conditions that lead to explosive fires, and a growing number of people are living at what scientists call the urban-wildland fire interface. It’s a dangerous combination that could further rewrite the record books.",The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California.

Juli Clover,"Verizon recently throttled the data used by a Santa Clara, California fire department that was in the midst of fighting wildfires, reports Ars Technica. Verizon's actions were outlined this week in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys challenging the recent repeal of net neutrality rules. According to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden, the fire department paid Verizon for ""unlimited"" data, but its data speeds were heavily throttled while it was combating the still-ongoing Mendocino Complex Fire until the department shelled out more money for an upgraded unlimited plan. Verizon's data throttling policies affected ""OES 5262,"" a fire vehicle with a Verizon SIM card that is responsible for acting as a ""command and control resource"" for ""the rapid deployment and organization of thousands of personnel and hundreds of fire engines, aircraft, and bulldozers."" Data speeds were reduced to 1/200, interfering with the vehicle's ability to ""function effectively."" Santa Clara Fire communicated with Verizon via email about the throttling and requested that it be ""immediately lifted for public safety purposes,"" but Verizon staff demanded the fire department update to a new plan before service could be restored. Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but, rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan. As Ars Technica points out, even when net neutrality rules were in effect, major carriers imposed throttling during times of network congestion. The fire department claims, however, that it was throttled at all times (not just at peak congestion) once the vehicle's 25GB data limit was exceeded. Net neutrality rules also allowed for Internet users to file complaints for unjust or unreasonable prices and practices, but the complaint option has been eliminated, giving Santa Clara no options for contacting the FCC over Verizon's practices. Bowden said that Verizon's throttling had a ""significant impact"" on the fire department's ability to provide emergency services. The Mendocino fire was also not the only time Verizon's throttling limited fire services, with other incidents occurring in December and June. According to Bowden, the Santa Clara Fire Department believes that Verizon is going to continue to use catastrophic events to force public agencies into higher-cost data plans. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher cost plans ultimately paying significantly more for mission critical service-even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. After a long series of emails ( PDF ) with Verizon, the Santa Clara Fire Department was ultimately required to purchase a data plan that costs $99.99 per month for the first 20GB of data usage and 8GB of data per gigabyte afterwards to avoid throttling during emergencies. Verizon has not yet responded to requests for comment on the Santa Clara Fire Department's addendum.

SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying The fires began on Monday night and continued to spread throughout the day on Tuesday. So far, the Rye Fire in Santa Clarita has burned 1,000 acres, per ABC News. Santa Ana's Creek Fire has destroyed 11,000 acres, according to the Los Angeles Times. And the Thomas Fire, which has been burning the longest, has torn through a massive 50,000 acres in Ventura County.

NASA satellite shows smoke plumes and heat signatures (red dots) from the wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area on Dec. 5, 2017 Image: NASA WorldView The fires have spread so quickly and grown so large thanks to the California weather phenomenon known as the Santa Ana winds. The east-to-west blowing winds come from the Pacific and tap into warm and dry conditions inland. The winds push against the air coming from the LA basin's eastern mountains, which compresses the wind and heat between the ocean and the mountains, further drying out vegetation that has dried out over the summer. The phenomenon makes for dangerous fire conditions, which is now affecting residents across Southern California, from Ventura County to the north, and Santa Clarita and Santa Ana to the east. The Los Angeles Fire Department has ordered the evacuation of the 20.5 square miles including and surrounding the Creek Fire, which jumped the 210 Freeway and is threatening Santa Ana's Sylmar and Lake View Terrace neighborhoods. The Rye Fire in Santa Clarita prompted the shutdown of Highway 5. Reuters reports that hundreds of homes have been destroyed by the Thomas Fire. Across Southern California, people are packing up their homes, and rescuing and sequestering animals, to salvage what they can from the blaze. Some residents were even seen fighting the fire with water hoses. LA County Fire Chief Daryl L.

John Walsh,"Firefighters in Northern California struggled to get the upper hand on a three-day-old wildfire that scorched more than 30,000 acres as of Friday evening. Warm weather and winds amplified the danger as flames moves through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest region. The wildfire was growing ""incredibly fast"" after having burned 22,000 acres by Thursday, Shasta-Trinity Cal Fire Unit Chief Mike Hebrard told local reporters Friday. It was zero-percent contained. The Delta Fire was initially reported as three separate fires on Wednesday. But those combined into one and spread at a rate of one mile-per-hour at its height, Capt. Brandon Vaccaro, a fire spokesman, told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. Vaccaro said he believed the fire was human-caused, but the circumstances were not immediately clear. At least 300 people were forced to evacuate their homes in Shasta and Trinity counties. Some 1,600 residents in the town of Dunsmuir, about 280 miles north of Sacramento, were told to be prepared to evacuate. Two homes in small mountain communities were damaged by the fire as of Friday, according to another Los Angeles Times report Friday. The wildfire led to major traffic disruptions in the region when the flames threatened Interstate 5. A roughly 45-mile section of the freeway has been closed since Wednesday. California witnessed the worst wildfire in its history in July. The Mendocino Complex Fire, which also occurred in the northern part of the state and scorched more than 450,000 acres, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Friday.","The Delta Fire in Northern California scorched nearly 25,000 acres of dry wildland as it raged on for a third day.

Aditya Shah,"Whenever I get a chance, I pick up my camera and spend hours capturing the immaculate beauty of Big Basin Redwood State Park. It’s been my favorite pastime for years. Giant sequoias, which are the world’s largest single trees and largest living thing by volume, always help me understand our connection with something bigger than ourselves. Last year, those towering trees were being turned into ashes by wildfires. 2017 was California’s most destructive wildfire season on record, with more than 9,000 fires burning approximately 2,200 square miles of forest. Watching the destruction of centuries-old trees, I challenged myself to find a solution to stop this colossal loss. When I was 15 years old, I had started a nonprofit organization, Raindrop US, to help raise awareness about the California drought. I also created the “Green Society” at my school, Monta Vista High School, to increase awareness about global warming. It was in meetings of this society last April that I began to partner with Sanjana Shah, a friend and fellow student, to create a permanent solution to wildfire prevention. Sanjana shares my passion for environmental issues and has received multiple national and international awards in the environment space, including the U.S. Presidential Award in 2016. We decided to develop a device that could identify and predict areas in a forest that are susceptible to wildfires, providing an early warning to fire departments. Available tools measure most of the factors responsible for wildfires like wind speed, wind direction, humidity, temperature. However, biomass, which is created by years of falling branches and trees, is challenging to estimate and measure. Using TensorFlow, Google’s open source machine learning tool, we can analyze images of biomass and estimating their moisture content and size to determine the amount of dead fuel.","Whenever I get a chance, I pick up my camera and spend hours capturing the immaculate beauty of Big Basin Redwood State Park.

The fires are being fed by the desiccated remains of lush vegetation that grew during one of the wettest winters on record in California, only to endure a record warm and dry summer.

Colleen Slevin / AP,"DENVER — A growing wildfire destroyed more than 100 homes in the Colorado mountains, while other blazes across the parched U.S. West kept hundreds of other homes under evacuation orders Tuesday and derailed holiday plans. Authorities announced late Monday that a fire near Fort Garland, about 205 miles (330 kilometers) southwest of Denver, had destroyed 104 homes in a mountain housing development started by multimillionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes in the 1970s. The damage toll could rise because the burn area is still being surveyed. Tamara Estes’ family cabin, which her parents had built in 1963 using wood and rocks from the land, was among the homes destroyed. “I think it’s sinking in more now. But we’re just crying,” she said. “My grandmother’s antique dining table and her hutch are gone.” “It was a sacred place to us,” she added. Andy and Robyn Kuehler watched their cabin burn down remotely. The couple monitored the cabin’s surveillance video from their primary residence in Nebraska and watched as the ash and embers turned into roaring flames. “We just got confirmation last night that the house was completely gone. It’s … a very sickening feeling watching the fire coming towards the house,” the couple wrote in an email Tuesday. The blaze, labeled the Spring Fire, is one of six large wildfires burning in Colorado and is the largest at 123 square miles (318 square kilometers) — about five times the size of New York’s Manhattan. While investigators believe it was started by a spark from a fire pit, other fires, like one that began burning in wilderness near Fairplay, were started by lightning. Nearly 60 large, active blazes are burning across the West, including nine in New Mexico and six each in Utah and California, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In Utah, authorities have evacuated 200 to 300 homes because of a growing wildfire near a popular fishing reservoir southeast of Salt Lake City amid hot temperatures and high winds. Several structures have been lost since the fire started Sunday, but it’s unclear how many, said Jason Curry of the Utah Division of Forest, Fire and State Lands. Darren Lewis and his extended family planned to spend the Fourth of July at a cabin built nearly 50 years ago by his father and uncle in a wilderness area nestled between canyons and near a mountain river. Instead, Lewis and his family will spend the holiday nervously waiting to hear if a half-century of family memories go up in smoke because of the fire, which has grown to 47 square miles (122 square kilometers). “There’s a lot of history and memories that go into this cabin,” said Lewis, 44, of Magna, Utah. “The cabin we could rebuild, but the trees that we love would be gone. We’re just hoping that the wind blows the other way.” Meanwhile, a wind-fueled wildfire in Northern California that continues to send a thick layer of smoke and ash as far as south of San Francisco was threatening more than 900 buildings. The massive blaze was choking skies with ash and smoke, prompting some officials to cancel Fourth of July fireworks shows and urge people to stay indoors to protect themselves from the unhealthy air. At least 2,500 people have been told to evacuate as the sprawling blaze continues to spread, said Anthony Brown, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Brown said the blaze that started Saturday and is surging through rugged terrain northwest of Sacramento has grown to 109 square miles (280 square kilometers) amid hot and dry weather expected throughout the day. It was 5 percent contained. “The weather is better than what we had over the weekend. But it’s still hampering our efforts and it’s an area of concern,” he said. So far this year, wildfires have burned 2.7 million acres in the United States, according to the fire center. That’s a bit below last year’s acreage to date — which included the beginning of California’s devastating fire season — but above the 10-year average of 2.3 million acres. Because of the Independence Day holiday, authorities are also concerned about the possibility of campfires or fireworks starting new fires because of the dry, hot conditions. In Colorado, many communities have canceled firework displays, and a number of federal public lands and counties have some degree of fire restrictions in place, banning things like campfires or smoking outdoors. In New Mexico, all or part of three popular national forests remain closed because of the threat of wildfire, putting a damper on holiday camping plans. The forests that are open have strict rules, especially when it comes to fireworks. “We’re just urging people to use extreme caution,” said Wendy Mason, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico State Forestry Division. “We want people to have fun and enjoy themselves, but we prefer they leave the fireworks shows to the professionals.”",The growing wildfire is over 200 miles southwest of Denver,2018-07-04T00:36:04Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Colorado Wildfire Destroys Over 100 Homes in Community Started by Magazine Publisher Malcolm Forbes,http://time.com/5330053/colorado-wildfire-100-homes/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/colorado-wildfires.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,wildfire,1
Morgan Sung,"Guy Fieri isn't just the mayor of Flavortown. He's a national hero. As the Carr fire scorches through Northern California, becoming the seventh most destructive fire in the state's history, Guy Fieri rushed to feed the thousands of first responders and evacuees. Some people think the celebrity chef has been more helpful during this disaster than Elon Musk was during the Thai cave rescue. SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's kid-submarine was 'a PR stunt,' Thailand cave rescue diver says The Carr fire started on July 23, torching more than 112,000 acres and sweeping through the city of Redding. Fieri drove from Napa Valley on Saturday, and José Andrés' nonprofit World Central Kitchen joined him two days later. Since Monday, Fieri and his team have prepared over 1,000 meals twice a day with the disaster aid organization Operation BBQ Relief. ""My son and I, and his buddies, and a bunch of mine, we loaded up our caravan from wine country and drove four hours up here,"" Fieri told ABC7. ""We're in tough times... with all of the things going on, you take a moment like this and you really see America is made of a lot of great people coming together."" This is the second time that Fieri has volunteered to feed victims of California wildfires. Last October, he and his family had to evacuate their Santa Rosa home when fires threatened his neighborhood. Three days later, he arrived at the evacuation center with a smoker and a wood fire oven to cook for the displaced shelter residents, preparing 1,200 meals in one lunch. He told KQED that the move wasn't a ""PR stunt."" ""If that's what you think and you're that shallow at a time like this with what we're facing, then there's no changing your mind about that,"" he said during the October fires. ""I'm not promoting anything. I'm just here cooking. This is feeding people. People need help, and I'm here to help. That's it."" And some Twitter users pointed out that unlike certain rich celebrities who try to swoop in during disasters, Fieri's efforts were genuine. In a now-deleted tweet, @BowieWhale said, ""Guy Fieri has, with no publicity, been feeding 5000 wildfire evacuees, proving that he is much more decent and altruistic than Elon Musk."" They're referring to the cave debacle, when Musk tried to save a team of boys who were stranded in an underwater cave in Thailand. Musk commissioned a kid-size submarine, went on a Twitter rant when it was criticized as ""not practical,"" and then called Vern Unsworth — one of the lead rescuers — a ""pedo"" after he dismissed the mini sub as a ""PR stunt"" that had ""absolutely no chance of working."" Musk managed to make the rescue mission about himself, and then when he couldn't be the hero, still managed to make it about himself. Which is why Guy Fieri is the internet's new darling. With his bleached spiky hair and weird affinity for flame-printed button up shirts, Fieri has been written off as a cheesy dad way past his prime. But compared to Musk's ridiculous narcissistic Twitter feuds with pretty much anyone who criticizes him, Fieri's once tacky quirks are actually kind of endearing.

Andrew Freedman,"Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes. The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, expanded from nothing to 31,000 acres in just a few hours thanks to fierce Santa Ana winds. The strong winds also caused power outages, plunging thousands of residents of Santa Barbara and Ventura into the dark as flames rushed in. SEE ALSO: 'We're just existing': What it was like to survive the deadly Northern California wildfires The fire has come close to downtown Ventura, a city of more than 100,000 people about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Social media images taken by evacuating residents show nightmarish scenes of onrushing flames. According to the Ventura County Fire Department, 27,000 people have evacuated. One of the structures that succumbed to the fast-moving flames was a large apartment complex. Santa Ana winds blow offshore, from east to west, tapping into warm and dry conditions inland. Close to the coast, these winds compress the air coming off the hills and mountains to the east, further warming and drying out the air mass, and helping to dry out already combustible vegetation. The fire threat had been anticipated, as the National Weather Service issued a rare ""critical"" fire outlook for Southern California on Tuesday due to the Santa Ana wind event. High wind warnings and red flag warnings were in effect for much of Southern California. The Thomas Fire was visible from space, via the Suomi-NPP satellite as well as other observing platforms. Heat signature from the Thomas Fire depicted from the Suomi-NPP satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: NOAA. Typically, the fire season in Southern California peaks in October, but it can occasionally flare up again in November and December. In this case, a strong area of high pressure has built in across the West, and the clockwise air circulation around that high pressure is responsible for triggering the Santa Ana wind event. The Storm Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service, issued a forecast discussion on Tuesday morning warning that fire weather conditions will further deteriorate during the day, as winds increase, humidity drops, and temperatures climb. The Weather Service has designated parts of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino, and Riverside counties as being in ""extremely critical"" fire weather risk, which is the highest category. These areas could see sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the Storm Prediction Center said, with gusts up to 80 miles per hour in hills and mountains. Relative humidity levels could drop to as low as 4 percent in these areas, the center stated. The immediate Los Angeles metropolitan area is included in the slightly less serious zone of ""critical"" fire danger. The October wildfires that killed more than 40 people and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in northern California also occurred during a period when strong, dry offshore winds were present. Such winds can allow a fire to spread quickly and erratically, including by spreading burning embers far out in front of the main blaze. This hampers firefighting efforts and can force hasty evacuations.","Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes.

Associated Press,"(SANTA BARBARA, Calif.) — The fourth-largest wildfire in California history continues to grow and threaten thousands of homes despite armies of fire crews and fleets of bulldozers and aircraft. Although Santa Ana winds eased on Friday amid the blaze northwest of Los Angeles, they are expected to return with a vengeance over the weekend. And the fire is so large that winds on one end may be gustier than those on the other side. The 11-day-old Thomas fire surging through Ventura and Santa Barbara counties had devoured some 400 square miles (1,000 square kilometers) of brush and timber and burned more than 1,000 buildings, including well over 750 homes. Another 18,000 buildings are still in jeopardy, including mansions in the wealthy enclave of Montecito. The fire is only 35 percent surrounded despite efforts by some 8,000 firefighters, 32 helicopters and 78 bulldozers. Santa Barbara has had only a tiny amount of rain since Oct. 1, the start of the new water year, and is more than 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) below normal to date. The fire already has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings, including well over 700 homes, and threatens 18,000 more structures. Another focus of firefighting was on the eastern flank in canyons where a state firefighter was killed Thursday near the agricultural town of Fillmore. Officials have released no details on the death of 32-year-old Cory Iverson. The National Weather Service forecast extreme fire danger or “red flag” conditions through at least Saturday evening, with winds gusting to 40 mph in the Santa Barbara County mountains where the fire is burning. Firefighters were facing first northerly “sundowner” winds through the night that could turn into northeasterly Santa Ana winds, driving the flames in another direction. Everything about the fire was massive, from a footprint larger than that of many cities to the sheer scale of destruction that cremated entire neighborhoods or the legions attacking it: more than 8,000 firefighters from nearly a dozen states, aided by 32 helicopters and 78 bulldozers.

IVAN PENN,"When the utilities dont get what they want, they start turning the power off, said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group active on a range of issues. They were disappointed in the Legislature. They clearly want more. They want no liability. Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, which represents consumers before California regulators, said her organization worried about the companies broad authority to cut peoples power. Its always scary to consumers to trust them with a such a life-and-death issue, Ms. Spatt said. Wildfires have moved from a seasonal event to a year-round occurrence. State law allows the utilities to cut power to customers whenever there is a risk to public safety. The change in weather patterns that were seeing, we have to look at everything in a new light, Mr. Herrington said. It is something that truly is a last resort for us. Southern California Edison used blackouts in wildfire prevention in 2003 and again in 2017 in the Idyllwild area of Riverside County. It warned 130,000 customers over the weekend that they could face blackouts in the face of increasing Santa Ana winds a longtime autumn scourge, blowing hot, arid gusts from inland deserts toward brush and woodland. San Diego Gas and Electric became the most frequent user of the strategy after a series of fires in 2007 killed 10 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Since 2013, the utility has cut service 19 times to customers. On Sunday and Monday, 4,000 of its customers received warnings of possible blackouts, though just 360 lost power.","Citing safety concerns, power companies are cutting off electricity when and where the hazard is greatest.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Were going to lose thousands of dollars worth of shrimp, T.J. said. And dont ask about the oysters. The shrimp business is off and on, always, he said. The oyster business has been really bad. Really bad. There are so few wild oysters left that the Wards turned to oyster farming two years ago. They did not yet know the status of their 750,000 to one million farmed oysters after the storm. We never thought it wouldve been this bad, said Melanie Ward, T.J.s wife. Downtown Apalachicola, with its neatly painted storefronts, counted itself lucky, despite the surge of seawater that left debris strewn everywhere. Shops that had been boarded up with plywood showed minimal damage a shattered window here, a watermark there. A county hospital that closed before the storm had a damaged roof.

Andrew Freedman,"President Trump's first official State of the Union speech began with a reminder of the disasters that have befallen Americans during the past year, from wildfires in California to three of the top 5 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history. ""We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined,"" Trump said. ""We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine."" During 2017, the U.S. was struck with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage, which set a new record. It was enough devastation to get attention of the global business and political elite, who in Davos, Switzerland, ranked climate change and extreme weather events as the greatest threat to global security and prosperity. SEE ALSO: Weather and climate disasters cost the U.S. a record $306 billion in 2017 It wasn't enough carnage, though, to get a climate denying president to make basic connections between the disasters befalling his nation, and human-caused climate change. Trump rightfully cited examples of courageous rescuers from Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and the deadly California wildfire season. But he did so totally divorced from the broader context that is raising the risks of more and bigger disasters in the years to come. Instead, he portrayed it almost as just a string of bad luck. Hurricane Harvey rainfall annual exceedance probabilities. Image: noaa. ""We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane,"" Trump said. He also pledged continued assistance to hard hit areas, from California to Florida to Puerto Rico. ""To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands — everywhere — we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always,"" Trump said. His words likely rang hollow in some areas, like Puerto Rico, where FEMA's food and water deliveries stopped on Wednesday, as the agency officially shifts from a crisis to a recovery phase of the ongoing disaster. Nearly half a million people still lack power more than four months after the storm. scientists have made clear, in studies both before and soon after these extreme weather events, that climate change is ushering in a new era of extreme weather But scientists have made clear, in studies both before and soon after these extreme weather events, that climate change is ushering in a new era of extreme weather that requires policies to be put in place that make the country's infrastructure more resilient, and head off the worst consequences of climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the Trump administration is mounting an all-out assault on not only environmental regulations, from the planned pullout of the Paris Climate Agreement to an executive order rescinding Obama-era protections mandating that infrastructure plans take sea level rise into account. The administration's new infrastructure plan would also gut the environmental review process for approving new roads, bridges, tunnels, and more, including reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, not to mention the changing risks of so-called ""100-year"" floods. Simply put, climate scientists nearly unanimously say that the climate of our grandparents is gone, and what was a 100-year flood is now occurring far more frequently as the climate warms. The fact that Trump is causing us to lag behind the shifting climate risks more damage from floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. Take Hurricane Harvey, for example, a storm so full of superlatives that meteorologists are still trying to wrap their heads around it. According to a recent assessment from the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Harvey which made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm in late August, was the most extreme rainstorm ever recorded in the U.S. The maximum rainfall total was a staggering 60.58 inches near Nederland, Texas, with 18 locations seeing more than 4 feet of rain during the course of a few days. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a large portion of the Houston area saw a 1,000-year or greater flood, meaning that it had a chance of less than 0.1 percent of occurring in any given year. But those odds are deceiving, because the probability of precipitation and heat extremes is rising in many locations as human activities belch more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the air. there was nothing purely natural about the disasters that befell this country in 2017 According to research by Adrian Borsa of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which was discussed at a scientific conference in December, ground-based GPS sensors even detected an overall sinking of southeastern Texas by up to 1.5 centimeters under the sheer weight of the rainfall. The GPS network provided an estimated total size of the rainfall of about 24 to 34 trillion gallons of water, Borsa said during the Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Studies published since Harvey have shown that the storm's rainfall totals were made more likely due to global warming, since warming air and ocean temperatures have resulted in greater amounts of water vapor available for storm systems to tap into. One study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that climate change likely increased Harvey's total rainfall in the Houston area by about 38 percent, and boosted the chances of observed rainfall by a factor of about 10. Other studies published since the storm, which have also focused on the changing odds of such an extreme flood event, have also found sizable increases in the risk due in large part to global warming. The aftermath of a firestorm that struck Santa Rosa, Calif., seen on Nov. 5, 2017. Image: george rose/Getty Images This year was also a terrifying preview of what may be to come for Californians, as a warmer, drier climate brings the ingredients together for fast-moving, large wildfires. This year's wildfire season was California's worst on record, with communities like Santa Rosa and Montecito now synonymous with disaster. Wildfire dangers, like flooding damage, are also intertwined with myriad development decisions that are putting more Americans in harms' way. For example, Houston is now wrestling with their longtime lack of zoning regulations, and how that worsened the flooding from Harvey. If Trump truly wants to be ""with"" us, as he said in his speech on Tuesday night, he could start by admitting the obvious — there was nothing purely natural about the disasters that befell this country in 2017, and his policies are only putting us in more danger for many years to come.","President Trump's first official State of the Union speech began with a reminder of the disasters that have befallen Americans during the past year, from wildfires in California to three of the top 5 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history.

Jonathan J. Cooper / AP,"PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — Monday marks a return to school and some semblance of routine for thousands of children who lost their homes to a deadly wildfire in Northern California.Schools in Butte County have been closed since Nov. 8, when the Camp Fire ignited and quickly swept through the towns of Paradise, Concow and Magalia in what would become the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century. At least 88 people were killed and dozens remain unaccounted for.Officials at the Paradise Unified School District aren’t sure how many of their roughly 3,500 students will show up at makeshift schools that will temporarily replace the eight sites lost to the flames. Some families have left the state. Others are staying with friends or relatives across Northern California, too far to drive every day. But nearly all the teachers are returning to provide a familiar and comfortable face to the children who are able to make it to class. “It’s important that the kids are able to stay together and have some sort of normalcy in the crazy devastation that we’re having now,” said Jodi Seaholm, 40, whose third-grade daughter, Mallory, is about to turn 9. Mallory underwent radiation in October to remove a recurrence of brain cancer and showed no fear, Seaholm said, but “this situation with her house burning down has absolutely devastated her.” Two neighboring school districts have allowed children from Paradise to take over available space. Kids who previously went to Paradise Elementary School will go to school in nearby Oroville, while children from Ponderosa Elementary School will be at a school in Durham. Paradise High School survived but is inaccessible as the region remains evacuated. The district doesn’t have space yet for intermediate and high school classrooms, so for the 13 days before the holiday break begins those students will learn through independent study. They’ll have access to online assignments and a drop-in center at the Chico mall where they can get help from teachers or see their classmates. But academics will likely be secondary to dealing with trauma and reconnecting with friends, said Paradise High School Principal Loren Lighthall. “They don’t have their church, they don’t have their school, they don’t have their work, they don’t have their friends, they don’t have any of that stuff and we’re asking them to write five-paragraph essays?” Lighthall said. “It’s just unreasonable at this point. We’re going to do it, but we’re going to be super flexible with what we require.” Searchers have stopped their methodical search for victims in scorched cars and neighborhoods, but they remain on call if people believe they find bone fragments when they’re allowed back into evacuation zones. Marissa Nypl, 47, is living with her family at her husband’s coworker’s home in West Sacramento, which is 90 miles (145 kilometers) from her 10-year-old daughter’s temporary school in Durham, until they can move into a rental home much closer. It’s too far to drive every day, but Nypl wants to be sure her daughter is there to be with her peers on the first day back for what will likely be an important part of the healing process. The isolation has been hard for the fifth-grader, a shy girl who was just starting to build a strong group of friends. “They’re going to need something that they feel like is still a normal part of life,” Nypl said, noting just about everything in town is gone. “The school’s going to be the only thing they have to latch onto to feel like something’s still routine.” Contact us at editors@time.com.",Monday marks a return to some semblance of routine for thousands of children who lost their homes to a wildfire in Northern California.,2018-12-03T07:05:48Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Children Are Returning to School Three Weeks After the California Wildfire,http://time.com/5469099/california-wildfire-school-children/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/gettyimages-1059659060.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,wildfire,1

A federal judge in San Francisco is barring utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric from reissuing dividends in favor of using the funds for reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires in Northern and Central California.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in a court hearing Tuesday, also said that he will closely monitor PG&amp;E's compliance with new wildfire prevention rules governing tree-trimming near power lines. Alsup is supervising the utility company's felony probation stemming from its conviction in the case of a massive natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010.
""A lot of money went out in dividends that should have went into tree trimming,"" Alsup said to PG&amp;E acting chief executive John Simon as quoted by the Associated Press. ""PG&amp;E pumped out $4.5 billion in dividends and let the tree budge whither. So a lot of trees should've been take down that were not.""
The judge's order does not include the stringent condition requiring PG&amp;E to inspect its entire power grid as he originally proposed.
Company spokesman James Noonan said in an email that ""we share the court's commitment to safety and understand that we must play a leading role in reducing the risk of wildfire throughout Northern and Central California.""
The court's dividend plan was not a surprise. Last month in a court document, Alsup had signaled his intention to order the company not to issue dividends until it complied with ""all applicable vegetation management requirements."" 
PG&amp;E initially had resisted the plan, arguing that it had already suspended dividends in 2017. The dividend payments may not resume without Alsup's permission.
In February, PG&amp;E said that it's ""probable"" that it was responsible for the 2018 Camp Fire that killed at least 85 people and destroyed about 14,000 structures. The company, facing billions of dollars in possible liabilities filed for bankruptcy in January. Alsup is also presiding over that filing in separate proceedings.",The utility company is already on probation for its felony conviction related to a 2010 natural gas pipeline explosion.,2019-04-02T23:03:04Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Federal Judge Imposes New Probation Terms On PG&E To Reduce Wildfire Risk,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/709248544/federal-judge-imposes-new-probation-terms-on-pg-e-to-reduce-wildfire-risk,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/04/02/ap_19054801659445_wide-3f406de30d38274034e7394d2aa7bb24d4518aef.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,wildfire,0
Associated Press,"Evacuations have been ordered as dry, hot winds fuel a wildfire burning in parts of Yolo, Napa and Lake counties, sending a stream of smoke some 75 miles south into the San Francisco Bay Area. The fast-moving blaze that broke out Saturday in western Yolo County has charred at least 44,500 acres — nearly 70 square miles — of dry brush and threatened more than 100 structures in ranchland northwest of Sacramento. No injuries were reported and the exact number of people evacuated was unclear. Cal Fire said Sunday night that the fire was 3 percent contained. Mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for all residences served by Highway 128 between Monticello Dam and Pleasant Valley Road along with areas of north of Highway 128, south of County Road 23 and east of Berryessa Knoxville Road. An evacuation advisory is in effect for areas north of Quail Canyon Road, south of Highway 128, east of the Blue Ridge Mountains and west of Pleasant Valley Road. Autumn Edens marveled as a huge plume blocked the sun while she drove to her job as manager of the Corner Store in Guinda, a town of about 250 people just north of the fire. ""You can see the smoke and you can see an orange-red glow from the flames. It looks like a movie,"" she said. ""I've never seen a fire like that up close and it's an intense feeling."" It was one of two major wildfires in the northern part of the state, where temperatures were soaring, humidity was dropping and winds were steady. A blaze burning for several days to the west in Lake County jumped containment lines Saturday, prompting additional evacuation orders. That fire was more than 70 percent contained after charring about 22 square miles of brush and destroying at least 20 structures. Smoke from the Yolo County fire was contributing to poor air quality in Napa, Sonoma, San Mateo and San Francisco counties, according to the National Weather Service.

Associated Press,"CLEARLAKE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 4:15 p.m. Authorities are ordering residents along a Northern California lake to evacuate homes in the path of a growing wildfire amid concerns that hot, windy and dry weather conditions will persist throughout the weekend. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Jane LaBoa says a wildfire remains several miles from the communities along the eastern shore of Clear Lake, about 110 miles (175 kilometers) north of San Francisco. But LaBoa says its trajectory and the weather forecast prompted officials to evacuate the communities Friday out of an abundance of caution. The wildfire has grown to 175 square miles (280 square kilometers) and is a few miles from connecting with a second blaze that has grown to 64 square miles (105 square kilometers). The twin fires have destroyed 41 homes. ___ 11:50 a.m. A California bulldozer operator nearly slipped off a steep mountain trail three times before his vehicle finally rolled into a ravine and fatally crushed him. A Department of Forestry and Fire Protection preliminary report says each earlier slip alone qualified as a ""near miss"" warning that the century-old mining trail could collapse. The report says 36-year-old Braden Varney was working alone overnight July 14 fighting a wildfire sparked hours earlier outside Yosemite National Park. His assistant had gone to get a new hydraulic hose. Varney's radio wasn't communicating with headquarters, so his assistant relayed messages — until they lost contact. Varney was a 10-year veteran. The report says his death highlights the need for better risk assessment, communication and supervision. Varney became the first of four California firefighters to die this year. ___ 11:15 a.m. Experts say a deadly Northern California wildfire burned so hot at its peak that it created a cyclone of flames that reached 143 mph, ripping through the region with the force of a destructive Midwest tornado. National Weather Service meteorologist Duane Dykema said Friday that the blaze still burning near Redding created a fire whirl that uprooted trees and tore roofs from homes. Dykema says the whirl started when hot air from the exceptionally hot fire rose and twisted tightly, creating a powerful tornado of flames and wind. He says fire whirls are common, but not at the intensity recorded on July 26. The fire burning near Redding has grown to 206 square miles (533 square kilometers) and destroyed at least 1,060 homes. ___ 7:40 a.m. Increasing winds are expected in Northern California areas where deadly and destructive wildfires are burning. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for critical fire weather conditions Friday and Saturday as a series of dry low-pressure systems pass through the region, bringing gusts up to 35 mph (56 kph) in the afternoon. Forecasters say highest threat areas include a fire near the city of Redding and the Mendocino Complex of two fires north of San Francisco. The forecast includes extremely low humidity levels that leave vegetation ready to burn. The 206-square-mile (533-square-kilometer) Carr Fire 100 miles south of the Oregon border is 39 percent contained after destroying 1,060 homes and many other structures. Two firefighters have died there. New evacuations were ordered late Thursday at the Mendocino Complex.","Fox News The Latest: Growing California fires prompt new evacuations Fox News CLEARLAKE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):. 4:15 p.m..

Associated Press,"(LOS ANGELES) — A powerful winter storm unleashed mudslides in Southern California wildfire burn areas and trapped motorists on a major highway, and the northern part of the state braced for more wet weather Sunday.
Saturday’s deluge loosened hillsides where a major blaze burned last year in and around Malibu, clogging the Pacific Coast Highway with mud and debris.
A stretch of the scenic route northwest of Los Angeles was expected to remain closed in both directions until Monday while crews tow away stuck vehicles and clear lanes. No injuries were reported.
The rapper Soulja Boy was among those whose cars were mired in the muck that was up to 4 ft. (1.2 meters) deep in some areas.
The 28-year-old retweeted a photo of the mudslide and posted: “My car got stuck too almost went into the ocean,” along with a prayer emoji.
An automated rain gauge in the western Santa Monica Mountains showed nearly three-quarters of an inch (nearly 2 cm) of rainfall in one hour, said the National Weather Service.
“These are heavy rates,” the weather service tweeted.
Up to 1 ½ in. (3.8 cm) of rain fell in coastal and valley areas, while mountain communities got heavy snow.
Flash-flood watches and warnings were eventually lifted for areas burned by the fires that scorched more than 155 sq. mi. (404 sq. km.) of brush and timber acres in November, destroyed about 1,600 structures and claimed three lives.
The sun emerged in Los Angeles on Sunday and the red carpet for the evenings Golden Globe awards were expected to remain dry. Scattered showers were possible later in the night.
To the north, wind and rain forced delays or cancelations of flights out of San Francisco International Airport for a second day. A wind advisory was in place until 10 p.m. Sunday.
The San Francisco Bay Area could get up to 1 ½ in. (3.8 cm) of rain, with the heaviest downpours coming after sunset.
Strong winds and downed trees knocked out electricity for at least 20,000 customers across the Sacramento region Sunday night. The National Weather Service said Sunday that winds gusted up to 49 mph (79 km/h).
Saturday’s storm brought about a foot (30 cm) of snow to the Sierra Nevada and twice that amount was expected Sunday. A winter storm warning was in effect until 4 a.m. Monday.
Avalanche warnings were posted in parts of California, Nevada and Utah. The Sierra Avalanche Center issued a backcountry avalanche warning for the Lake Tahoe area stretching south into the Sierra along the California-Nevada line from noon Sunday until 7 a.m. Monday.
The National Weather Service says blizzard conditions with gale-force winds could trigger widespread avalanche activity.
Two feet (61 centimeters) of snow was reported at Mammoth Mountain 150 miles (241.39 km) south of Tahoe. More than a foot (30 cm) fell in the upper elevations around Tahoe, including 19 in. (48 cm) at Squaw Valley.
Windstorms that pummeled parts of Washington state and Oregon over the weekend left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity.
A strong system brought winds that registered gusts of about 60 mph (96 km/h) at Sea-Tac Airport in Washington, the National Weather Service in Seattle said. Dozens of flights in the region were canceled or delayed.

Colin Dwyer,"A firefighter snaps a quick picture amid efforts to contain the Thomas Fire in Montecito, Calif., earlier this month. Chris Carlson/AP For the past few days, the weather in Southern California granted firefighters a rare reprieve. Winds dropped, humidity ticked up a tad — and for a brief span, at least, firefighters had a little natural help reining in the massive Thomas Fire northwest of Los Angeles, which they had 60 percent contained by Wednesday morning. But that lull didn't last long. The strong winds and low humidity that helped fan the blaze into California's second-largest wildfire on record are returning. In certain areas, winds are expected to reach 15 to 30 mph, with gusts up to 60 mph. And experts fear the fire's dangerously erratic behavior will return with them. ""There is potential for a flare-up,"" Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the local weather service, tells The Los Angeles Times. A firefighting crew climbs a steep hill in Montecito, Calif., while battling the Thomas Fire earlier this month. David McNew/Getty Images That is far from good news for residents who have been facing down the angry orange glow of the blaze since it took hold Dec. 4. In the more than two weeks since then, the Thomas Fire has been blamed for two deaths, destroyed at least 750 homes and burned roughly 272,000 acres — or a span larger than all of New York City and Boston combined. Before the fire is finally contained, it is expected to pass the 2003 Cedar Fire as the largest since Cal Fire began keeping such records in 1932. Member station KPCC reports that ""more than 8,000 firefighters from nearly a dozen states"" have been gathered to battle the blaze. NBC and The Associated Press note that while the sprawling Thomas Fire is creeping toward a rather notorious perch in history books, it is far from alone. In fact, the blaze is part of an increasing trend: ""Cal Fire reported 6,982 fires in California from Jan. 1 to Dec. 17, including the devastating North Bay fires in October. Those fires scorched more than 505,900 acres, more than double last year's burned acreage count. During that same period in 2016, the state firefighting agency reported 4,759 fires that burned 244,304 acres. ""California's five-year average for wildfires during that time frame is 4,787 and 202,737 acres burned. ""The significant increase in the numbers and size of fires is largely because the state is coming off one of its wettest winters in years in 2016-2017, which left hillsides covered in grass and other vegetation. That grass dried out in summer and turned into tinder, providing fuel for rapidly spreading fires often pushed by strong winds that can carry hot embers for miles and turn small spot fires into infernos. ""The startling number of dead and dying trees also has exacerbated the wildfire threat, Cal Fire officials said. An estimated 129 million trees covering 8.9 million acres have died in California due to drought and bark beetle infestation, according to the USDA Forest Service.""","Lately, firefighters had seen a rare lull in the conditions that helped fan the Thomas Fire into the second-largest wildfire in modern California history. The forecast looks far less kind.",2017-12-20T22:47:11Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","As Winds Rise Once More, Firefighters Fear 'Flare-Up' In Massive Thomas Blaze",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/20/572365832/as-winds-rise-once-more-firefighters-fear-flare-up-in-massive-thomas-blaze,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/12/20/ap_17351081089939_wide-7629c6d0a500f2331ead0ad8fdcf1b2fc2f1396a.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,wildfire,1
Jonathan Shieber,"Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. economy $80 billion last year — and have hit the nation’s bottom line to the tune of roughly $100 billion per year over the last five years, according to a new survey from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
That tally comes as NASA reported that 2018 was also the fourth warmest year ever recorded — continuing a trend of record-breaking global temperatures.
It looks like the anthropogenic causes of climate change are becoming harder to ignore.
Indeed, the NOAA’s Climate.gov report was very blunt about the causes of the increasing frequency with which natural disasters are occurring across the country:
The past three years (2016-2018) have been historic, with the annual average number of billion-dollar disasters being more than double the long-term average. The number and cost of disasters are increasing over time due to a combination of increased exposure, vulnerability, and the fact the climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.
In total, the U.S. was hit by 14 separate disaster events whose costs were more than $1 billion: the litany of climatological horrors included two tropical cyclones, eight severe storms, two winter storms, prolonged drought and wildfires (that probably burned all the partridges out of their pear trees).
As the NOAA report notes, this tally is the fourth highest number of total events ever recorded — behind 2017 and 2011 (tied at 16 natural disasters) and 2015, which saw 15 natural disasters worth more than $1 billion slam the U.S.
Last year was also one of the costliest for the American economy in terms of the impact from natural disasters. The $80 billion price tag is only topped by 2017, when storms, fires, floods and drought cost the economy $312.7 billion (a record); 2005, when the number hit $220.8 billion and 2012 when $128.6 billion was lost due to climate-related disasters.
Of the events that are the most damaging and costliest to the U.S. economy, hurricanes rank the highest. And from 2016-2018 the U.S. was impacted by six separate hurricanes that cost the economy more than $1 billion. In all, those disasters wrought some $329.9 billion in economic damage and killed 3,138 people.
While there’s a tragic, historic precedence for the damage caused by hurricanes, the Western wildfire seasons of the past two years are unprecedented in size and scope in modern history. With costs running over $40 billion, the wildfire costs in the U.S. for the last two years are equal to the cost from fires for the previous 37 years combined.
Meanwhile, NASA scientists have said that the past five years have been, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record.
2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend, said GISS Director Gavin Schmidt, in a statement.
Since the 1880s, the average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit — and this warming is caused in large part by increased emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Schmidt said.
The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt  in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change, said Schmidt, in a statement.
It’s important to note that overall global warming contributes to drastic shifts in climate patterns and climate change. It doesn’t mean that there won’t be conditions of extreme cold as (ahem) some people seem to think.
In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People cant last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2019
In fact, global warming hasn’t gone anywhere… yet.
There is a plan being proposed by Democrats in the House of Representatives that aims to push the U.S. to rapidly decarbonize its economy in a bid to offset some of the worst effects that are expected should global temperatures continue to rise (and if anyone wants to send that to me, I’d be obliged).
Given that most reports put a 12-year time frame around reversing the worst impacts of climate change, and U.S. reports put the potential economic damage of unchecked warming at somewhere close to $500 billion, getting a move on toward possible solutions seems like a good idea. Let’s hope Congress can follow through.","Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. economy $80 billion last year — and have hit the nation’s bottom line to the tune of roughly $100 billion per year over the last five years, according to a new survey from the National Oceanic and Atmospheri…",2019-02-06T21:50:12Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Weather and climate-related disasters cost the US $80 billion in 2018, but go ahead and say climate change isn’t real",http://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/weather-and-climate-related-disasters-cost-the-us-80-billion-in-2018-but-go-ahead-and-say-climate-change-isnt-real/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-28-at-8.53.34-AM.png?w=764,techcrunch,TechCrunch,wildfire,1

You spend so much time crafting valuable content you know will help your audience, yet it doesn't reach them. Related: 4 Steps to Writing Content That Converts The truth is, we live in a world of too much content, meaning you face an uphill battle to capture someone's attention and point them toward it (no matter how good and valuable it may be). Creating great content is only part of the battle, so I'd like to show you the process I take after spending millions of dollars on content marketing that today magnetizes my audience toward what I create, and ensures they actually consume it. Step 1: Understand who the content is for. You need to know your audience, and you need to know who needs your content. This may sound obvious, but it's amazing how many entrepreneurs get this simple first step wrong. You need to get specific about who you're creating your content for. A broad audience will not work in 2018, so your first step is to understand who your audience is. With this as your focal point, you can ensure your content alleviates their specific pain, and only their pain. Related: 3 Ways to Build Your Brand Identity Using Content Marketing Step 2: Understand your audience's awareness level. You cannot treat your entire audience in the same way. They fit into different buckets, and when it comes to their awareness level, there are three: Sidewalk: unaware they have a pain or a problem Slow Lane: aware they have a problem, but unsure what the process is Fast Lane: aware of the process, but unsure of the solution The content you create for someone in your sidewalk is different to the content you create for those in the fast lane. In the sidewalk, you show your audience their problem with micro content that illuminates their pain. In the slow lane, you focus on your process or methodology, educating your audience to what comes next -- the fast lane, where you dive into the solution and how they can fix their problem. Related: The Winning Formula For Content Creation Step 3: Understand what emotion you want to evoke. Once you understand your audience and their current awareness level, you can craft content that evokes a specific emotion within them. Do you want to illuminate a pain? Would you like to help them understand themselves better? Are you trying to debunk a certain philosophy and introduce an alternative idea? It's important your content evokes emotion, because it's emotion that ensures they resonate with it on a personal level. This is the only way to get your audience to share, like or take action in this overwhelming world we live in. This is the part of the process where you take a stranger and transform him or her into an advocate, and it's here your content begins to stand out from everything else. Related: 5 Tips for Creating Quality Video Content Even If You're Clueless How to Begin Step 4: Understand which ""story type"" is most relevant.

The idea here is to pull out stories from your own life (or your business) so you build trust with them, and so they better relate to you and your journey. You need them to connect with your content, and you do this through the art of story. Related: 6 Top Tools to Transform Your Content Marketing in 2018 Step 5: Understand how best to share this ""story type."" Finally, you bring this all together by sharing your content in one of six ways: Personal philosophy: a message you hold true based on your own experiences Personal story: a story or anecdote from your own life Question: where you turn focus to your audience and ask them a question Lifestyle: a message that evokes transparency and invites your audience into your world Results/training: detailed insight into a process, and how to do something Invitation: an invitation to dive deeper, and learn more about what comes next Related: The Secret to Successful Content-Marketing In 2018 Is Having a Strategy, So Get One. Some of these are relevant for longer forms of content, whereas others are perfect for shorter messages. It's during this step you bring intention into your content, ensuring it speaks to the right person in the right way. By bringing these five steps together each time you craft new content, you drastically improve your odds of going viral because you create magnetizing messages that captures your audience and their attention. This is the difference between creating content that nobody cares about and content that transforms strangers into raving fans. I learned this the hard way, spending millions of dollars on content marketing that did okay, but not great. Once I followed these five steps, I went from six-to-seven figures (and beyond). You can, too.
