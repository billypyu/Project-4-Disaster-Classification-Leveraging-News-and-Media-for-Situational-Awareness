MITCH SMITH,"Im looking at global warming I dont need to see the graphs, said Hamburgs mayor, Cathy Crain, referring to the role of climate change in increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. After two record-setting floods in a single decade, Ms. Crain said, Im living it and everybody else here is living it.
The flood spoiled a time of cautious optimism in Hamburg, which like many rural Midwestern towns now has about half the population it once did. Next week, Dr. Wells, the school superintendent, was scheduled to ask state officials for permission to reopen the towns high school, a move seen as crucial to keeping young families in town. Before the water hit, Ms. Crain said, people were talking about building a new subdivision and finding new residents.
But as floodwaters receded in other places, Hamburg remained largely submerged on Wednesday. On the dry side of town, residents visited the school to pick up hot meals and donated clothes that filled the gym. Ms. Crain, who was operating from a makeshift City Hall in the schools home economics classroom, spoke hopefully about getting businesses back open, even as she coordinated more immediate concerns like hot showers and restoring gas service.
We had certainly our horrible moments were not through with that yet, Ms. Crain said. Today, were up and we are saying theres going to be a future. She said she was hopeful once again for another project too: a higher levee.","Hamburg residents held back the Missouri River in 2011, then had to take down the homemade levee that saved them.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"About three-quarters of the land at Dos Rios was owned by a dairy farmer who was tired of dealing with flooding and sold it in 2012 to River Partners, with various state and federal agencies financing the $21.8 million cost. An adjacent farmer then sold his land to the group in 2014 for $9.3 million. The result is 2,100 acres, including three miles of frontage along the Tuolumne River and four and a half along the San Joaquin. River Partners is removing berms along the riverfront that the owners formed from earth and rubble to keep the smallest floods out. A higher, more permanent levee, built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s, protects about 1,000 acres in the core of the project, back from the rivers. Modifications will allow water to enter, so the area will serve as a giant bathtub, holding up to 10,000 acre-feet of floodwater. This will not only reduce river levels, but as the water percolates into the land it should provide another benefit, helping to recharge aquifers that have been depleted statewide because of pumping for agriculture. About 600 acres inside the levee have been converted from farmland to riparian woodlands, and another 700 acres inside and outside the levee are in the process of being restored. The entire project should be finished by the middle of next decade, Mr. Carlon said. River Partners plants many species — trees like cottonwood and black willow, shrubs like golden currant and valley elderberry and a variety of grasses — all of which can recover after being underwater for months. The planting, much of which is done by young workers with the state-run California Conservation Corps, is done with all the precision of modern agriculture. A field about to be restored looks much like any cropland, with furrows and markings where the various young plants are to be placed, all determined ahead of time.",The state expects drier dry years and wetter wet ones in the decades ahead.

"MITCH SMITH, JOHN SCHWARTZ and TIM GRUBER","Many of the levees, usually earthen and topped with grass, were built by farmers decades ago and are now managed by a patchwork of local government agencies known as levee districts that often do not coordinate or even follow the same rules. With increased flooding in the past few years, the levees are being tested more frequently than ever before, straining the finances and expertise of some of those districts. The levee situation has become so grave that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the countrys levee system a D grade in 2017, suggesting $80 billion in investment over 10 years.
When the next one comes along bigger, they either fail or are overtopped again, said Nicholas Pinter, an expert on rivers and flooding at the University of California, Davis.
According to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees infrastructure on the Missouri River and some of its tributaries, at least 62 levees had been breached or overtopped in the Midwest in March, and hundreds of miles of levees had sustained damage.
When they run water over the top of them, theres not anything you can do, said Pat Sheldon, the president of a rural levee district in southwest Iowa that was still paying off repairs from the 2011 flood. This time, Mr. Sheldon said, the damage to the levees was much worse, perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Its terrible, said Mr. Sheldon, whose farm was also cut off by the water.
In Missouri, Mr. Bullock pointed out a levee that last week had been split open and consumed by the river. A large log swirled in the water near where the earthen berm should have been. I dont know what were going to do this time, he said.
The Army Corps of Engineers, which helps determine water levels by operating a series of dams on the Missouri River, tries to balance the needs of many who use the rivers it manages, including farmers, barge shippers, endangered animal species and people who use the water for recreation. Those interests are sometimes at odds, and have been the subject of decades of litigation. Corps officials say they are not allowed to change the congressionally authorized purposes of the reservoirs, though they had been most focused on limiting floods for the past year.
The Corpss No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety, said Maj. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, the Corpss deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations, in a statement. Our current focus is to protect life, mitigate risks to flooding events and repair damages due to the recent events in the basin.","Hundreds of miles of levees in the Midwest have been overwhelmed by the floods, leaving “Swiss cheese” infrastructure and reigniting a flood control debate.",2019-03-31T09:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘Breaches Everywhere’: Midwest Levees Burst, and Tough Questions Follow",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/us/midwest-floods-levees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/us/00levees-01/00levees-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JACK HEALY,"As far as what condition those levees are in, and how vulnerable they are to flooding, it is almost impossible to know. According to the National Committee on Levee Safety, there are no national policies or standards on levee safety, and there is no full assessment of their condition and performance. Only 10 states keep a list of their levees, and fewer than half have a state agency responsible for levee safety.
Weve adopted this piecemeal approach, said Nicholas Pinter, a geology professor at the University of California, Davis. We built these walls up to give the illusion of protection.
From above, the lines of earthen levees that line the Missouri River in Mills County, Iowa, look like they have been decimated by a marauding army. Frigid, murky floodwater pours through huge, ragged gaps and spreads out for miles.
The countys levees held during 2011 floods that inundated towns across the Midwest, but this is different, said Mr. Hurst, the countys emergency management director.
Heavy rains from what meteorologists called a bomb cyclone storm that ripped across the plains fell onto frozen ground, and instead of soaking in, the rains and snowmelt poured into tiny creeks, tributaries and into the Missouri River.
Mr. Hurst said he watched the flow rate at one marker along the Missouri River soar from 16,000 cubic feet per second to 90,000. Water cascaded over the top of levees like a waterfall, he said, eroding the earthen banks and opening eight breaches.","At least 50 levees have been breached or overtopped by rivers engorged with late-winter rains and snowmelt, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.",2019-03-22T22:51:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","As Floods Inundate the Midwest, Many Ask: Will Our Levees Be the Next to Fail?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/us/midwest-flooding-levees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/22/us/22floods1/22floods1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.

Radio stations, particularly in the South, refused to play the Fab Four’s music. Members of the Ku Klux Klan picketed the tour, and conservative groups burned their records. Mr. Lennon apologized at the start of the tour — which ended up being the Beatles’ last — but it was clear he was frustrated by the outrage: “I suppose if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I would have got away with it.

AP,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. In Freemont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriffs Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River. And in Mills County, Iowa, authorities ordered people in some rural areas to evacuate after the Missouri River overtopped levees.
The flooding followed days of snow and rain record-setting, in some places that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilkes death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Freemont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
There is no way out of here unless youve got a helicopter or a boat, the Rev. Mike Bitter, pastor of Christian Church of Waterloo, told the Omaha World-Herald.
Officials in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska were urging people not to drive unless necessary. In Iowa, a section of northbound Interstate 29 that runs parallel to the Missouri River was closed due to flooding. Authorities were rerouting motorists at Kansas City, Missouri, using a detour that took people almost 140 miles (225 kilometers) out of the way.
Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Services Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
What were having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event thats going to happen in early April, he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.
Freeport resident Mary Martin told the (Freeport) Journal-Standard that she went to the store to get milk and bread when she saw floodwaters were rising Friday.
Within an hour of going to the store, I could not get back in. Thats how fast the water was coming up, Martin said.

BARRY MEIER,"The report estimated that the typical six-year delay in starting large building projects costs the country $3.7 trillion in lost economic activity, more than twice the amount needed to address the most urgent infrastructure needs. Along with roadblocks to speedy federal approval, the report blamed delays on such factors as fear of litigation and overly broad environmental reviews on all levels of government. “They have embraced some of the goals and core ideas” in our report, said Philip K. Howard, who heads Common Good and is a lawyer at Covington &amp; Burling in Manhattan. He had been a member of President Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, which disbanded in August after Mr. Trump’s remarks about the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va. An analysis by the Congressional Research Service found that some of the claims in Common Good’s report, including the $3.7 trillion estimate, lacked a statistical basis, though the group had defended its work. Infrastructure experts say that a lack of public and private funding, rather than bureaucratic delays, is the principal reason infrastructure projects stall. (In its budget proposal, the Trump administration has issued a six-page fact sheet about infrastructure funding, including private investment.) Still, they agree that the permitting process can be improved and streamlined. In addition to federal reviews, states and local governments must also approve major proposals — frequently a fraught process — and residents and other interest groups often use the courts to block or delay construction. Several recent projects illustrate the pitfalls new proposals confront and the challenge Mr. Trump faces in breaking the logjams. Politicians Want It Their Way, Or No Way Photo A New Jersey Transit train arriving at Penn Station. Credit Dave Sanders for The New York Times Long-overdue maintenance this summer to the train tracks leading to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan came against the backdrop of a much more ambitious project that never happened. The plan, known as Access to the Region’s Core, or ARC, would have created a new tunnel underneath the Hudson River for New Jersey Transit trains. First unveiled during the 1990s, it was promoted as the nation’s biggest public transportation infrastructure project and was supposed to cost $9 billion, create thousands of construction jobs and was funded by the federal government, New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. After years of environmental reviews, drilling of the ARC tunnel was underway in 2009. But construction stopped for a reason that has doomed other projects — disagreements among the various governments. In this case, it was New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie, who originally supported the tunnel, killed it in 2010 for what he cited were issues related to potential cost overruns. Today, nearly a decade and a thousand train delays later, the concept behind the ARC tunnel has re-emerged in a reconfigured form as the Gateway Program, a $20-billion design that also involves a new rail tunnel below the Hudson River and the rehabilitation of an existing one. It would be used by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains. A small portion of tunnel drilling for ARC will be used in Gateway New York and New Jersey officials support the project, and the environmental review for it took only two years rather than the usual four, said John D. Porcari, the project’s interim executive director. If all goes as planned, the Gateway project is anticipated to be completed in 2026. But there is still one hang-up: The Trump administration has yet to climb onboard. Local Governments Have Ideas of Their Own Photo The Competitive Power Ventures power plant under construction near Middletown, NY. Credit Allyse Pulliam/Times Herald-Record The law generally does not allow the federal government to pre-empt permitting decisions made by state and local officials. So even before federal delays might come into play, some projects are dead — or close to it — on arrival. An exception, experts say, involves areas overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which has jurisdiction over projects such as natural gas pipelines and electric power lines. FERC’s authority recently came into play during a dispute in New York State over a relatively small project: a proposed $38 million plan to build a 7.8-mile-long branch off an existing natural gas pipeline to connect it with a power plant near Middletown, N.Y. When the Millennium Pipeline Company announced the project in 2015, it drew opposition from communities opposed to hydraulic fracking, a controversial method of extracting natural gas that is banned in New York. State officials also jumped into the dispute, arguing in court that FERC had failed, among other things, to account for the environmental impacts of added greenhouse gas emissions from the power plant before approving the pipeline. But in June, a federal judge agreed with Millennium’s argument that state officials had failed to voice their objections in a timely fashion and referred the issue back to FERC, which has since issued a waiver to allow the company to proceed. State officials have asked FERC to review the case. The expected cost of the pipeline extension has since risen to $57 million based on actions that the company said it had taken to address the state’s concerns. Mr. Howard, the lawyer from Common Good, has argued that Congress should enact legislation that would give the federal government more authority to overrule state and local permitting reviews. No such proposal exists in Congress. The Federal Government Is a Bystander Photo Trucks hauling containers from the Port of Los Angeles. Credit Nick Ut/Associated Press Some projects that are big drivers of the economy do not involve federal approvals. Delays result from state and local decisions, and Mr. Trump — or any federal official for that matter — does not have the standing to intervene. A good illustration is the long-delayed effort by the BNSF Railway to build a new intermodal facility in Southern California. The facility would transfer cargo containers arriving on ships from Asia to freight trains headed east to cities such as Denver and Chicago. BNSF says it has invested about $50 million for such things as studies needed to comply with the permitting process. Currently, cargo containers arriving at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are picked up by tractor-trailers and driven to an existing BNSF site in downtown Los Angeles for transfer to trains. BNSF estimates show that it is a journey of 24 miles that 1,000 trucks make daily. In 2005, BNSF announced a proposal to build a transfer point just four miles from the ports that would reduce truck travel, highway congestion and air pollution, according to the company. In 2013, Los Angeles approved the company’s environmental impact report and issued a construction permit. But an environmental group and a local air quality district challenged that decision, citing the facility’s potential impact on nearby residential communities. In 2016, a California state judge upheld that challenge and ordered BNSF to expand its review to include a broader regional study assessing the facility’s environmental impact. The company has appealed that decision and expects a decision in coming months. Environmental Worries Carry the Day Photo A Mojave Desert Tortoise. Credit Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Building of any sort has environmental consequences, and big building can have big consequences, making environmental objections a central factor in delaying federal projects. Such a case is playing out in Utah. A proposed highway, known as the Northern Corridor, is intended to ease future congestion around St. George, one of this country’s fastest-growing metropolitan areas. But the seven-mile-long highway also raises an environmental dilemma because a portion of it would run through federally owned land that is home to a protected species, the Mojave desert tortoise, which can live up to 50 years. The dispute over the highway has been underway for more than a decade. Local officials have argued that they could build the road without endangering the tortoises, and in 2009, a federal law directed the Bureau of Land Management to identify a possible route. But when the bureau released a plan last year, the agency was skeptical of the route favored by local officials because of its potential impact on sensitive habitat. Soon afterward, Representative Chris Stewart, a Republican of Utah, introduced legislation that would require federal agencies, including the bureau, to approve the route if it met all other permitting requirements. In July, the bill passed a House committee and may be taken up by the full House later this year or next. Federal Agencies Don’t Always Get Along Photo Rising waters flood a farm in the spillway of Missouri farmland after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers breeched the levee at Birds Point New Madrid Floodway near Cairo, Ill., to relieve pressure from the rising Mississippi River in 2011. Credit E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune, MCT, via Getty Images Farmers in southern Missouri, who experience severe flooding, have long supported a plan to close a quarter-mile gap in a large levee along the Mississippi River. And since 1975, the Army Corps of Engineers has offered a variety of ways to plug the levee. But that would also drain wetlands and potentially increase flooding elsewhere, causing officials with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to put on the brakes. In 2007, a federal judge blocked further development on the $161 million project, which is known as the St. Johns Bayou and New Madrid Floodway, finding that the Army Corps had failed to use sound science to examine its environmental impact. The agencies then said they would work together to resolve their differences. But by 2013 the gridlock remained so intense that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, placed a temporary hold on Gina McCarthy’s nomination to head the E.P.A. in an effort to resolve the standstill. Last year, President Obama’s Council on Environmental Quality, the White House office, sided with the opponents. It held that efforts by the Army Corps to mitigate the project’s impacts, while extensive, were not enough. That, however, might not be the final word. The environmental council left the door open to resolution of concerns, and President Trump’s nominee to head the Army Corps, Rickey Dale James, owns a business in the area and has been a longtime supporter of the project.

Paulina Dedaj,"After Tropical Storm Gordon drenched parts of South Florida on Monday, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for parts of the Gulf Coast -- where the storm is expected to roar ashore as soon as late Tuesday. Meteorologists have warned Gordon likely will strengthen into a hurricane by the time it reaches coastal Mississippi and Louisiana. Voluntary evacuation orders were issued on Monday for parts of Louisiana for residents in areas outside the levee protection system. Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Monday and said 200 National Guard troops will be deployed to southeastern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center said at 8 p.m. ET that the storm was centered 95 miles west of Fort Myers, Florida. Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 60 mph. After making landfall, it is expected to charge inland over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. The hurricane warning was placed into effect for the area stretching from the mouth of the Pearl River in Mississippi to the Alabama-Florida border. As much as 8 inches of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm could unleash ""life-threatening"" storm surge to portions of the central Gulf Coast. A storm surge warning has been issued for the area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama. The warning means there is danger of life-threatening inundation. The region could see rising waters of 3 to 5 feet. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,"" the center said. Gordon is expected to dissipate by Saturday somewhere in the central U.S. After periods of heavy rainfall, flood advisories were in effect for parts of South Florida late Monday.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Can one town’s solution to flooding be another town’s nemesis? The question goes to the heart of a long-running debate in suburban St. Louis, where a half-dozen communities along the lower Meramec River are grappling with the worst back-to-back floods in recent memory. One of the towns, Valley Park, has a high earthen levee protecting its downtown from rising water. It stayed dry during the epic Meramec floods of 2016 and 2017. The other towns have no levees, and twice they were inundated to the rooftops. Now, as the rebuilding of homes and businesses winds down, a debate over the future of flood risk—and how to defend against it—is stewing along the Meramec, just as it is on other rivers across the country. What is the best way to protect vulnerable communities from severe flooding when the rivers themselves are undergoing dramatic changes? And if one river community takes steps to reduce its flood risk, does it have a responsibility to make sure its solutions doesn’t negatively affect downstream neighbors? Nowhere is that discussion more relevant than on the Meramec, one of the longest free-flowing rivers in Missouri and the site of some of the worst river flooding in the United States over the last 25 years. Along its 220-mile path to the Mississippi, the Meramec drains 4,000 square miles of land from the Ozark highlands to the St. Louis suburbs. It takes on water from forests, farms, industrial sites, and commercial and residential developments. And like many American rivers, it has a checkered health history born of logging, farm runoff, industrial discharges and other ills associated with human development, particularly in its lower basin. Perhaps no symbol of human fouling of the lower Meramec lies just upstream and across the river from Valley Park, where the Peerless Park Landfill sprawls across part of the historic floodway, forming a terraced mini-mountain on the site of what used to be a drive-in theater. Environmentalists contend that the landfill itself has altered the Meramec’s flood profile. On most days of the year, the Meramec flows lazily to its confluence, drawing recreational boaters, tube riders and fishermen who catch bass and catfish from its brown-tinted water. But twice in less than two years—just before New Year’s Day 2016 and again in May 2017—the rain-swelled Meramec rose out of its banks and inundated riverside communities. Among them were the postcard towns of Eureka and Pacific, lying upstream, and the more urbanized suburbs of Fenton and Arnold, which anchor the lower reaches of the Meramec before it joins the Mississippi. Valley Park took a major hit from both storms. Its primary access from all directions—Interstate 44 running east-west and State Highway 141 running north-south—were completely submerged in floodwaters during the two events. The town was stranded from emergency personnel and utility crews. Valley Park city attorney Tim Engelmeyer remembers standing atop the town’s levee as the river crested in 2017, thinking he was watching the second of two biblical floods in just 16 months and wondering if, after more than 125 years of existence, Valley Park would finally succumb to the big one. “What I saw out there was a ridiculously high level of water, like nothing I’d ever looked at before,” Engelmeyer recalled. “It was bad, and it was horrible for every community on this river.” 46 feet of water, 5 deaths Yet while Valley Park takes comfort in the fact that its levee has twice held back historic flooding, other communities up and down the Meramec’s muddy banks face very different risks. “I was here for the floods of the early ’80s and the ’90s,” said Joe Maurath, a 40-year resident and alderman of the city of Fenton, just downstream from Valley Park. “And it’s just at a point now where what we’re seeing is unprecedented. The back-to-back floods [of 2016 and 2017] were unparalleled compared to what we’ve seen in the past.” Agencies charged with investigating flood disasters agree. A report by the U.S. Geological Survey summarizing the 2017 event revealed that the flooding resulted in five deaths in Missouri, while 53 counties were declared federal disaster areas by the Trump administration. At four flood gauges along the Meramec, the river broke century-old streamflow and peak stage records, including a whopping 46.1-foot crest at Eureka, Mo., more than 27 feet above flood stage. In the following months, the Federal Emergency Management Agency paid out $62 million in National Flood Insurance Program claims to Missourians affected by the 2017 floods, while an additional $18 million in low-interest loans and grants was awarded to homeowners, renters and businesses caught in harm’s way. Those kinds of statistics undergird a growing belief among many here that the Meramec is a more dangerous river than it used to be, even though it has experienced major flood events dating to the early 20th century, including a landmark flood in 1982. “It’s overwhelming,” Fenton resident Sue Haskins told the Army Corps of Engineers at a public meeting last November. “I have a small business out of my home.... We never had water for 25 years, and all of a sudden, we got water.” While state and federal officials have identified numerous factors driving the Meramec’s worsening flood profile—including increased rainfall intensity across the region due to climate change, the conversion of historic floodplains into impervious surfaces and backflow flooding from the Mississippi River during high water phases—other observers see a culprit at the river’s edge: the Valley Park levee. Completed in 2005 at a cost of $50 million, the levee is for some a source of consternation. It has helped to drive a wedge between flood control agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the communities the corps has pledged to protect from floods. That’s because floodwater that would normally flow to the outer reaches of the floodplain—including downtown Valley Park—is being displaced and redistributed to other areas. That can raise water levels on nearby properties. Robert Criss is among the most outspoken scientists on these risks. He’s a professor in Washington University in St. Louis’ Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and a national expert on river hydrogeology. In an interview at his campus office in St. Louis, Criss accused government agencies, including the Army Corps, of downplaying the substantial role that levees and other human-built structures play in flooding events. “Don’t let anyone tell you these big floods are about climate change,” he said. “It’s all about the constriction of rivers.” Criss acknowledged that on small to midsized rivers like the Meramec, a heavy rainfall can lead to flash flooding. But such floods usually rise and fall quickly, he said. The main reason that communities on the Meramec are experiencing more destructive floods, he said, is that levee district boards and other oversight agencies keep approving projects that channel the water with new control structures. “The game is that if you build a big levee and you declare to everyone that it protects against a 100-year flood, then you can allow all kinds of new development to happen behind it,” said Criss. “The problem is you’re not only walling off the river from people, you’re also walling it off from its natural floodplain,” he added. “It’s a no-brainer that all of that water is going to be shunted somewhere else, and where it’s going is to communities up and downstream.” ‘Nobody is surprised anymore’ Floodwater was pumped over the Valley Park levee into the Meramec River on Dec. 31, 2015. Patrick Evenson/Missouri Air National Guard/Flickr Not everyone sees it that way. Valley Park city officials and federal river managers, notably the Army Corps of Engineers, refute those claims. They say analyses of peak flow data on the Meramec, including during the two most recent floods, indicate that the Valley Park levee is not a factor behind worsening flood conditions. “This levee did not cause all of this destruction up and down the river,” Engelmeyer, the city attorney, said. “A biblical flood did.” Don Duncan, assistant chief of engineering and construction for the Army Corps’ St. Louis District office, also pushed back on the notion that Valley Park’s levee contributed to the severe flooding. “I’m sure you’re aware that anytime there’s a flood, someone wants to point a finger at why water got inside their home or business,” Duncan said. “After the last two Meramec floods, people latched on to the Valley Park levee and ran with it. They liked the fact that they had a scapegoat to point to.” But flooded neighbors and academics aren’t the only ones making the case about levees. The St. Louis-based Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, which represents environmental, recreational and hunting interests throughout the Mississippi and Missouri basins, has also taken a tough line on levees. The group points to environmental and economic concerns. David Stokes, the alliance’s executive director, said that since the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993, communities up and down the watershed have proposed an unprecedented number of new levees, often spurred by the promise of new development and associated tax revenue. “There has been a lot of argument back and forth about it, but we generally subscribe to the view of the scientists who have done a lot of work in this area,” Stokes said. “The bottom line is when you combine [levee building and floodplain development] with climate change and you get a couple of these horrendous rainstorms over a particular basin like the Meramec, nobody is surprised anymore by what’s happening out there.” Gerald Galloway, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Maryland and a retired Army brigadier general who spent decades analyzing the Mississippi River Basin for the Army Corps and other agencies, acknowledged that the pace of levee building has increased in Missouri and river communities across the country. So, too, he said, have the debates over the impacts of those structures in places like the Meramec. Galloway said he places a high degree of trust in the Army Corps’ analyses of river flows. But he acknowledged that some of the thorniest questions about flooding can only be answered with more comprehensive study of river basins. “Every year, the analysis gets better, our information inputs get better and we learn more and more about what’s happening out there,” he said. “But frankly, this is the type of debate that can go on and on and on.” Here’s his bottom line: “If you live on a river and your property is in a floodplain of some kind, you’re eventually going to get wet.” Even so, federal, state and local agencies are not standing still on the Meramec. The U.S. Geological Survey, in conjunction with the Army Corps, FEMA, the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and others, recently produced a new set of digital flood inundation maps spanning 16.7 miles of the Lower Meramec Basin, including Valley Park and Fenton. The simulations incorporate data from the New Year’s 2016 flood and should provide critical insights as river communities get more serious about disaster planning and flood mitigation. USGS has also initiated a second analysis, still in the planning phases, to determine how land-use change and development over the last 80 years have altered the conveyance of water through the lower part of the basin. “The big story we’re trying to tell is what’s happened over time,” said Paul Rydlund, surface water program manager at the USGS Missouri Water Science Center in Rolla. “We know anecdotally there has been a lot change in the basin since the early 1900s. Our target is looking at how all of that development has changed the way water moves through the floodway.” Meanwhile, the corps is working closely with Meramec communities to identify new strategies for getting people and properties out of harm’s way. One of these approaches involves drafting a new floodplain management plan for the lower basin to help guide land-use planning and development. Matt Jones of the Army Corps St. Louis District’s plan formulation section said a key focus of the new Meramec management plan will be on non-structural solutions to reduce flood risk, such as elevating homes, buying out high-risk properties, and working with municipalities to toughen zoning regulations and building codes. “It’s a way for us to really go to each community to tailor solutions and see what’s in their best interest,” he said. Residents are waiting for answers. Jeff Haase, who has lived on a hilltop subdivision near Arnold since 1993 and who walks regularly in the Meramec River bottom, said he has watched the river change over the last decade as more strip malls and subdivisions have been wedged into the floodplain. It has exacerbated stormwater runoff that has been a problem for years, he said. “If I were to ballpark it,” Haase said, “I’d say a hard rain flows down this hill at about 50 percent higher volume than it did when we came 25 years ago. All of this used to be farmland, and it was wooded over. Now, more and more of the higher areas are being developed. It’s OK for people on the high ground, but it’s not good for everybody else.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.
This post has been updated to reflect Basches expertise is in agronomy.","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster.

Adele Peters,"Less than two years after the city of Lumberton, North Carolina, was flooded by Hurricane Matthew, a levee that protects the city from rising river water has been breached again by Florence. The community is at risk because of geography. But some residents there are also at risk because they’re poor. A series of maps from Direct Relief, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian medical aid, shows the social vulnerability of each community in the path of the hurricane, based on an index from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On a map of socioeconomic risk, Robeson County, where Lumberton is located, is one of the areas shaded darkest for its low levels of income and wealth. Poverty there makes people particularly vulnerable. “If you’re poor, you’re much more likely to see significant adverse effects that require support from outside agencies for a response to a disaster,” says Andrew Schroeder, the organization’s director of research and analysis. Someone may be less likely to have a car and be able to leave. If they rely on food stamps, the system may be disrupted and it may be harder to get food. They may not have the money for a hotel or be able to afford not working. They’re also a little more likely to have a chronic, long-term illness. Explore the interactive map here. [Screenshot: Direct Relief ] “If you’re poor and you’re chronically ill, what’s really going to tip you into crisis is that you can’t get access to medicines even for a short period of time,” says Schroeder. The organization also mapped out risk by disability and the age of residents, since older residents are also more likely to have illnesses, like diabetes, that require an ongoing supply of medicine, and have a harder time evacuating. Deaths from the immediate disaster–such as drownings–could be eclipsed by deaths from emergencies that occur while the community tries to recover. Direct Relief also mapped out the vulnerability of communities based on types of housing and transportation used–including how many people own cars–and based on race and ethnicity, including how many people speak a language that may not be included when government organizations share information about the disaster. “All the things which make your community vulnerable before disaster make your community even more vulnerable during disaster,” Schroeder says. The organization is using the maps to find the areas at highest risk so it can prioritize working with health centers there, and will continue to use them as the region goes through the longer-term process of rebuilding. “That broad focus on making sure that we don’t lose sight of the most vulnerable during disasters is really, really important,” he says.","In places where people already lack resources, it’s much more difficult to recover from a storm.

"USA TODAY, Rick Jervis, USA TODAY","Birders Madeleine Sandefur, Renee Rubin and Joyce Hamilton walk through the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, TX. (Photo: COURTNEY SACCO/USA TODAY NETWORK) ALAMO, Texas — When the border area around the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge flooded during Hurricane Alex in 2010, the ocelots, Texas indigo snakes and endangered Texas tortoises simply crawled, trotted and slithered over the nearby levee to higher ground. If President Trump’s proposed border wall is erected here, that sanctuary would vanish. “This is one of the most diverse habitats in the entire country,” said biologist Tiffany Kersten, a border environmentalist and Friends of the Wildlife Corridor board member. “If a wall was put up … everything that doesn’t fly would be affected.” The Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge — a 2,088-acre tangle of trees, animals, birds and butterflies straddling the U.S.-Mexico border in South Texas — could become the site of one of the fiercest standoffs between federal engineers on one side and locals and environmentalists opposing a border wall on the other.

The Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol declined to comment further on the issue. Congress has yet to approve funding for a border wall. Trump has said he would not extend protection to immigrants brought illegally to this country as children, known as DREAMers, unless Congress earmarks $25 billion for the wall. Senate Democrats have resisted any wall funding as part of a deal. The preserve would be a prime target for the wall because it’s federal land and wouldn’t have to go through the lengthy and costly eminent domain hearings that private property would, Kersten said. “It’s low-hanging fruit,” she said. U.S. Border Patrol agents cross the levee inside the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, TX. (Photo: COURTNEY SACCO, USA TODAY NETWORK) Last week, more than 700 protesters gathered in a field next to the refuge to denounce the prospect of a wall there. Other sensitive environmental areas along the border, such as the Santa Teresa area in New Mexico, are also likely to experience clashes between pro- and anti-wall groups, said Brian Segee, senior attorney with the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s a 2,000-mile-long area with millions of people living in the borderlands and thousands of sensitive environmental areas and endangered species,” Segee said. “The stakes can scarcely be higher.” The Trump administration is attempting to circumvent federal environmental protection laws by filing waivers that allow the government to erect border barriers in ecologically sensitive areas. The administration of George W. Bush filed five such waivers while constructing a border fence, according to federal filings. So far, the Trump administration has filed three, including one that would allow them to build a wall in the Santa Teresa area of south central New Mexico. The Center for Biological Diversity is challenging Trump’s waiver requests in district courts. Segee said it’s only a matter of time before waivers are filed for the Santa Ana refuge. “The administration is looking for a quick and symbolic victory,” Segee said. “Getting rid of the laws is the easiest way to do that.” A Save Santa Ana rally and concert sign across the street from the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, TX. (Photo: COURTNEY SACCO, USA TODAY NETWORK) Santa Ana is unique because it’s the intersection of four ecosystems: coastal influence from the east, desert to the west, temperate climate from the north and tropical to the south, said Kersten, who worked at the refuge as a biologist. The refuge, which has a series of trails that wind through the thicket and lead to the Rio Grande, draws around 150,000 visitors a year and is a major stop for migratory birds, such as the clay-colored thrush and tropical flycatcher, as well as a variety of wildlife and butterflies, she said. Over 400 species of birds have been seen at the refuge. A wall not only would take up three miles of levee in the refuge but about 150 feet of trees and natural habitat would have to be cleared away to make a buffer zone for the barrier. “Knowing that the first segment that goes in would be here, is a huge concern to us,” Kersten said. On a recent afternoon, Joyce Hamilton, 67, and two of her friends wandered through the paths equipped with binoculars and zoom lenses on their camera. Hamilton, of Harlingen, Texas, said she and her friends frequent the refuge to soak in the natural beauty and look for rare migratory birds. On that day, they were looking for the rose-throated becard. “This is one of the most revered wildlife preserves in the valley,” Hamilton said. “A wall here would be appalling.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nYdP3V","The 2,088-acre Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge is home to over 400 species of birds and animals such as the ocelot and endangered Texas tortoise.",2018-02-09T19:23:54Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Texas wildlife refuge could become fierce battleground over Trump's proposed border wall,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/09/texas-wildlife-refuge-could-become-fierce-battleground-over-trumps-proposed-border-wall/323693002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9a0629bb9384864ef713eb243b19b9c340befc47/c=0-278-5472-3370&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/02/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636537802849147040-XXX-santa-5.JPG,usa-today,USA Today,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Associated Press,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Officials in eastern Nebraska are still evacuating communities around rivers that are spilling their banks in the wake of heavy rains and massive snow melt.
Sarpy County officials urged all residents directly along the Platte and Missouri rivers to evacuate Friday morning as water levels continued to rise. The Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office says the Missouri River levee has been breached south of Bellevue.
Officials also ordered the evacuation Friday morning of Villa Springs, a small lake community near the Platte River and Springfield, just southeast of Omaha.
The city of Valley, just west of Omaha, was put on alert Friday to be ready to evacuate should the Elkhorn River rise more.

TED LOOS,"Across the way, Mr. Dion, whose art installations have scientific premises, was painting the inside of a cabin, a temporary structure meant to look venerable, clad in weathered boards and placed on an existing concrete foundation. Its location is the batture, the area between the river and the levee. “Locals know that no sane person would build here,” Mr. Dion said. “So it must be an artwork. They’re probably hoping it’s a new barbecue joint.” The artwork’s imagined resident, a scientist, is melancholy because he is “watching the Gulf disappear in front of us, as we all are,” Mr. Dion said. “We have this spectacle of ecosystem collapse. It’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion.” As if on cue, a mournful ship’s horn sounded. Race is one of the crucial fault lines for the work in “Prospect.4,” as it is in the larger contemporary art scene. Ms. Gaignard, who lives and works in Los Angeles, talked about how she stars in her own photographs, as she installed the show, titled “Grassroots,” in the Ace Hotel. “My mom is white, and my dad is black — I can pass as white, but it’s not my full story,” she said, noting that her father was from New Orleans. Her installation transforms two adjacent gallery spaces, one with 19th-century furniture and old-fashioned wallpaper and another with church pews. The photographs include “Trailblazer (A Dream Deferred),” with Ms. Gaignard dressed in an antebellum-era bustle dress. Mr. Schoonmaker said that Ms. Gaignard was among the artists who could break out to larger fame based on her Prospect work. “Much like Cindy Sherman, she’s a shape shifter,” he said. “Except that she’s a race shifter.” But is a white curator like Mr. Schoonmaker the right person to tackle such issues, especially in New Orleans, where the population is some 60 percent black? “It’s a fair question,” said Mr. Schoonmaker, who specialized in African art in graduate school and has organized several shows on colonialism and race. He was the curator of “Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey,” the African-born artist’s first American survey, which traveled to the Brooklyn Museum in 2013; and “Barkley L. Hendricks: Birth of the Cool” (2008). He also edited the book “Fela: From West Africa to West Broadway. ” “I bring voices to the table,” he added. Mr. Schoonmaker noted that the water theme may have come from a personal wellspring: his North Carolina childhood. “Maybe some of that is just me pouring out my love for the water, growing up around it and fishing and boating,” he said. The Berlin-based artist Satch Hoyt, whose art addresses how African sounds change as they spread, has worked with Mr. Schoonmaker on three shows previously. “Trevor is the type of curator who does a massive amount of research — he doesn’t come into town and plunk something down,” Mr. Hoyt said. His sculpture “Splash, Ride, Crash” is made from 216 cymbals, each representing a musician of the African diaspora. That work is on view at the New Orleans Jazz Museum, as is “Fiend,” a piece by the New York-based artist Rashid Johnson. “Fiend” looks like a large, blocky piece of furniture but is in fact an interactive sound piece. “It’s a microphone,” Mr. Johnson said. “The performer has to perform to the monolith, to the object. Imagine if you were singing to a Sol LeWitt and it could amplify your voice.” The metaphor, Mr. Johnson said, was that of speaking out: “Through social media and protest, you see people trying to make sure their voices are heard.” Curators have to sift through many voices to create international exhibitions. It can be cacophonous at times. Even Mr. Hoyt, who is featured in such shows, said, “Every time I hear of a new biennial I think, ‘Not another one!’” So the leadership of such exhibitions matters to ensure that they remain distinct and necessary. “I think Trevor can see the forest through the trees, and he’s not subject to what’s popular,” Mr. Johnson said. “Art has the ability to heal,” he added. But he didn’t think the speaking-up metaphor of “Fiend,” or the rest of Mr. Schoonmaker’s lineup, was going to heal the city’s wounds tomorrow. “It’s not a social service,” Mr. Johnson said. “My practice has a more philosophical ambition. And over time those ideas may inform practical outcomes.” A version of this article appears in print on November 26, 2017, on Page AR18 of the New York edition with the headline: Looking Toward Higher Ground.

Madeline Farber,"A man in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday, captured a monstrous 120-pound python, officially setting a record for the South Florida Water Management District’s Python Elimination Program. The serpent, a Burmese python, was captured by Homestead resident Kyle Penniston, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) said in a Wednesday news release. VIRGINIA WOMAN SNAPS STUNNING PHOTO OF VENOMOUS COTTONMOUTH SNAKE BARING ITS FANGS The “mammoth” snake measured 17 feet, 5 inches, according to the SFWMD, which added the serpent was the “third caught as part of the program that measured more than 17 feet.” “This snake just showed me you really can do anything. I just caught this python alone, I was riding along the levee and saw this massive girl in the water. Jumped out and grabbed her by the head and realized how big she truly was,” Penniston wrote in a Facebook post earlier this week. The Florida man went on to describe additional details of the capture, stating the python “started wrapping me while I tried getting her up the levee.” At one point, Penniston said, he lost his grip and “as soon as I knew it she had my hand in her mouth.” The python was one of the few caught by a hunter with the SFWMD's Python Elimination Program that measured more than 17 feet in length. “I grabbed my pistol off my sideloaded one in the chamber and it jammed. I kept fighting till we were both dead of energy. I finally was able to get her up the levee and l euthanized her as it’s required by our program,” he added. “With the record catch, SFWMD's python hunters have now eliminated 1,859 of the invasive snakes on District lands, stretching a combined length of more than two miles and collectively weighing more than 11 tons,” the state agency said in a statement following the capture. NEW CROCODILE SPECIES DISCOVERED BY RESEARCHERS The program helps to eliminate the “invasive” species from the Everglades ecosystem, as Burmese pythons there have “decimated native populations of wildlife,” the SFWMD said. Professional pythons hunters, as selected by program officials, are allowed to go on district-owned lands to hunt and then “humanely euthanize” the creatures. “The more that can be eliminated, especially females and their eggs, the better chance future generations of native wildlife will have to thrive in the Everglades ecosystem that Floridians have invested billions of dollars to restore,” the SFWMD said.","A man in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday, captured a monstrous 120-pound python, officially setting a record for the South Florida Water Management District’s Python Elimination Program.",2018-11-08T21:40:06Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}","Florida man captures ‘mammoth’ 17-foot python, sets record",https://www.foxnews.com/science/florida-man-captures-mammoth-17-foot-python-sets-record,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/penniston_17_foot_python.jpg,fox-news,Fox News,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katie Olsen,"An ""art moment"" turned ""art movement"" in the Southern California Desert A small art movement is gaining momentum in Bombay Beach, just 40 miles from the Palm Springs area. The town is situated on the edge of the Salton Sea, California ’s largest inland body of water. The Sea was created by accident in the early 1900s, when a levee broke on the Colorado River dam, causing an influx of water into the low-lying area. Post-war real estate speculators capitalized on this inland sea, calling it the “Miracle in the Desert,” and the “New American Riviera.” Yacht clubs, sport fishing marinas, and vacation homes sprung up along the shores, and for many decades, the Salton Sea was known as a desirable vacation destination. As in all instances where humans imposes their will upon nature, things soon turned upside down. Pollutants from neighboring agricultural sites seeped into the sea, while evaporation caused the water to become more saline. Fish populations bloomed, and with no natural predators, quickly became unsustainable. As the sea lacked oxygen, fish then began to die off by the millions, resulting in a malodorous stench of death and decay that reached as far as Los Angeles. A rainy season and resulting flood in the late 1970s decimated many homes, with the community of Bombay Beach receiving the worst of the damage. Almost overnight, the area was left abandoned. Today, the detritus of the American Dream can be observed decaying on the shores of what has become a ticking-time-bomb of ecological disaster. Until recently, not many SoCal residents were aware of the sea, its history or its environmental significance. by Barry Mulling Fast forward to 2015: Lily White, Stefan Ashkenazy and Tao Ruspoli hatched a plan to raise awareness for the Salton Sea environmental crisis by producing an offbeat art happening in Bombay Beach, a near-ghost town with a population of fewer than 200 permanent residents. The ironically named Bombay Beach Biennale first took place in 2016 and has occurred annually since then, with the latest event commencing late in March. Renowned and emerging artists came together to create a surreal 72-hour experience that encompassed over 150 art installations, performances and musical acts. The event is always free to attend, entirely self-funded and led by a group of dedicated artists and friends who volunteer their time and talents to improving the small town. We’re creating community over commodity “This is not a festival,” states Biennale co-founder and immersive artist Stefan Ashkenazy. “It is a celebration for and by the people who have come to create lasting works in a town where we reside and/or frequent. The work created here is a reflection of the renegade nature of the town’s inhabitants and is imbued with the spirit of the artists that channel the innate freedom permeating Bombay Beach. Irony and juxtaposition provide unavoidable guidance. We are exploring a format for creative exchange where permanent works of art and sculpture come to life alongside a dying sea, as opposed to being choked to death in a gallery or museum inside a living city. We’re creating community over commodity.” Courtesy of Bombay Beach Biennale The yearly gathering serves as an “unveiling” of sorts for new permanent installations that are built to become part of the cultural fabric of the community. The artist group hopes that the ever-growing body of work will drive year-round tourist traffic and interest in the region, thus boosting the local economy and creating awareness for the plight of the Salton Sea. Cultural institutions including an opera house, drive-in movie theater, several museums, and many sculptural works are on view for anyone curious enough to make the trek. “Part of my focus has been the development of institutions which one would expect in a large, vibrant city,” says Ashkenazy. “A hotel, museum, movie theater, opera house, a posh suburb and an amusement park. All of these are designed to play with the environment, poke fun at ourselves, and act as platforms for myself and other artists to explore what each of those institutions mean, both in Bombay (beyond the purview of convention) and well beyond its borders.” by Timothy Uriah Steele New York City artist Greg Haberny has been involved in the Bombay Beach Biennale since its inception. Haberny was introduced to the Biennale by Ashkenazy, whose West Hollywood boutique hotel, Petit Ermitage, features an artist in residence program. The two collaborated on a concept for the first museum in Bombay Beach. The Hermitage Museum was launched in 2016 and transformed a derelict building into a world-class contemporary art space. The exhibition has grown each year and was re-named FOUNDATION FOUNDATION this year. The current exhibition includes work by Greg Haberny, John Plypchuk, Bill Saylor, Timothy Uriah Steele, Steve Hash and Henry Vincent. Haberny is now a part-time resident of Bombay Beach and plans to continue creating work and developing the program at FOUNDATION FOUNDATION. Haberny explains, “My goal is to grant progressive artists from around the world a chance to explore the environmental wonders of Bombay Beach and to challenge themselves creatively by living and working in the town itself. It’s about paying it forward and giving other artists the opportunity that I was given.” Also on permanent exhibition is the Bombay Beach Opera House, conceived by Ashkenazy as a performance space for classical opera and ballet. Ashkenazy invited San Francisco Ballet principal dancer Maria Kochetkova to grace the stage. She agreed upon one condition—that she chose the artist to design the space. by James Ostrer The result is a surreal sky blue building with an interior covered in thousands of flip-flops, the brainchild of British artist James Ostrer, who has returned annually to create new work for the space. The latest iteration includes several of Ostrer’s sculptural, multimedia, and photographic works. “I was breaking up with my life partner, immersed in my political art and not at all interested in helping making a backdrop for rich people to party in-front of,” says Ostrer. The opera house is flanked by the Bombay Beach Botanical Gardens, featuring a large-scale skeletal flower sculptural work by artist Yassi Mazandi. by Randy Polumbo Visitors to Bombay Beach who spend a little time exploring the town will discover many other treasures, including Randy Polumbo’s “Lodestar,” Kenny Scharf ‘s “Bombay Boom—The Toy House,” many beachfront sculptural installations and the Bombay Beach Estates—an ironic take on a gated community twisted into a contemporary art park. Conceived and curated by Ashkenazy, the Estates include two museums, several gallery spaces, and many sculptural installations. by Moral Turgeman The Natural History Museum, located within the Bombay Beach Estates, features an artistic display of crystals, rare earth minerals, and dinosaur fossils arranged into an artistic display known as “DeXtinction” by NYC artist Carrie Schmidt. Neighboring interventions include Museum Number Two—“The World’s Shittiest Museum” by artist Moral Turgeman, “Happy Gallery” by LA-based artist Theodore Boyer, and “Naked Revelations”—a web-like display of undergarments and hand-written secrets collected by artist Moranne Layani and displayed in an all-black exhibition space. “Year after year I drop everything to return to the edge of the civilization. Why? Well, this town exists as a platform where creation is truly boundless,” says Israeli artist Moral Turgeman, who has been creating work in Bombay Beach since 2016. “I feel proud to be a part of a collective with a mission to facilitate this cultural movement,” she continues. “This year, I transitioned my interventions from temporary to permanent.” Museum #2 is open to the public 24/7, and K-BAD 880FM, (the world’s smallest radio station) pops up from time to time for those curious enough to tune in. by Olivia Steele Olivia Steele ‘s neon piece “Save Me” illuminates the Bombay Beach Estates with a blood red glow. She has been creating work in the town every year since 2016 and believes the Biennale could help save the sea. “The production and installation of this piece hope to bring light to the cause as it gains urgency. The beauty of the Biennale is how the arts can affect meaningful change and jolt people out of complacency. ‘Save Me’ serves as both a celebration of—and a poignant call to action for—the forgotten paradise and the tragic ecological situation,” says Steele. by Boris Chouvellon Adjacent to the Bombay Beach Estates, a sculpture garden, viewing platform, several gallery spaces, a polaroid museum, and artist residency program known as The Bombay Beach Institute of Particle Physics, Metaphysics, and International Relations anchors the corner of the town. The space is the brainchild of biennale co-founder and filmmaker Tao Ruspoli, who splits his time between Joshua Tree and Bombay Beach. The space is alive with green grass, animals and artists who take up residence for months or weeks at a time. Ruspoli leads the Academic Conference at the annual Biennale, which is programmed with lectures by illustrious philosophy professors such as Mark Wrathall, Christopher Ryan, Geoff Dyer and Sara Rubin. The more we can embrace and foster these paradoxes and contradictions, the better Ruspoli says, “I’ve always been attracted to the contractions that manifest in this place: It’s both ugly and beautiful, natural and unnatural (while the sea was formed by accident, it’s now an essential habitat for millions of fish and birds that depend on it), impoverished, yet rich with history and ongoing narratives of all kinds. Bombay Beach, when we started coming here, was both abandoned and full of the most colorful and eccentric characters. The list goes on, but my sense is the more we can embrace and foster these paradoxes and contradictions, the better. Hence the opera, the ballet, the academic conference, the formal gardens, the absurdly long names, the annual biannual, etc… All this helps provide fertile ground for artists and thinkers, who get to contemplate and delight in how different what they experience in Bombay Beach is from the otherwise mundane and homogenized and ultimately much more desolate landscape one finds in places like suburban America.” by Adam Anderson Hidden away on the opposite corner of town, R.I.C.O. (The Research Institute for Contemporary Outlaws) has transformed two abandoned trailers into an exhibition titled, “The Fallen World.” The gallery and screening room offer an inside look at the rise of outlaw motorcycle clubs, the meaning of a misunderstood past, manhood, narrative, violence, aging, love and mid-20th century America. The exhibit showcases rare artifacts, film, and photography. by Josephine Wister Faur Now in its fifth year, The Bombay Beach Biennale has evolved from “Art Moment” to “Art Movement.” What was originally conceived as an annual event has transitioned into a year-round presence. Artists are buying homes, taking up residence, and revitalizing the town by transforming the abandoned buildings, vacant lots, and decaying shoreline into a living, breathing creative community. The full and part-time resident artists work with Bombay Beach locals to build and maintain artwork, activating the town with a constant flow of creation. The group has also undertaken a number of civil-service projects, including a trash and recycling program (the town was without any municipal waste collection), solar-powered street lighting, and a free meal program offered by the local community center.","An ""art moment"" turned ""art movement"" in the Southern California Desert A small art movement is gaining momentum in Bombay Beach, just 40 miles from the Palm Springs area.

Associated Press,"Federal authorities have awarded a $145 million contract to a Texas company to build six miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said Friday that SLSCO will begin construction of an 18-foot reinforced concrete levee wall in February in the agency's McAllen Station region. The company also will increase the height of existing fences. It will be the first section of President Donald Trump's border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, which is considered the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The government recently completed construction of a two-mile, 30-foot tall section of fencing along the border in California. Trump has promised that the number of military troops deployed to the border could reach 15,000 roughly double the number the Pentagon said it currently plans for a mission whose dimensions are shifting daily. As far as the caravan is concerned, our military is out, Trump said. We have about 5,800. Well go up to anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border. Trump last week told ABC News, We have to have a wall of people. His comments were the latest twist in a story that has pushed the Pentagon unhappily into the political space, prompting questions about whether Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was allowing the military to be leveraged as a political stunt. We dont do stunts, Mattis said Wednesday. Trump rejected the idea he was fear mongering or using the issue for political purposes, but his escalating rhetoric in the waning days of the campaign season calls that denial into question. Trump has railed against illegal immigration, including several caravans of migrants from Central America slowly moving on foot toward the U.S. border. The caravan of an estimated 4,000 people is still nearly 1,000 miles from the border. Several smaller groups, estimated at a combined 1,200 people, are farther away.

STACEY PLAISANCE / AP,"(GULFPORT, Miss.) — Boaters evacuated to safe harbors, and motorists fled barrier islands Tuesday as the Gulf Coast hustled to get ready for Tropical Storm Gordon, which was on track to hit Mississippi as a Category 1 hurricane sometime after nightfall. People rushed to fill sandbags while red no-swimming flags flew along the shore where waves were kicked up. Some schools called off classes, and homeowners worried that their yards could soon be submerged under seawater. Pensacola Water Safety Capt. Jake Wilson told local television station WEAR that the wind was generating a lateral current “where it’s just going to push you down the beach.” A hurricane warning was in effect for the entire Mississippi and Alabama coasts. The National Hurricane Center predicted a “life-threatening” storm surge of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters) along parts of the central Gulf Coast. Flooding was also a risk. As much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday as the tropical weather moves inland toward Arkansas. By late Tuesday morning, the storm was centered 145 miles (235 kilometers) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, with top sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph), forecasters said. It was moving relatively quickly, at about 15 mph (25 kph). A storm surge warning was issued for an area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama. The region could see rising waters of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters). “The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,” the hurricane center said. Governors in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana all declared states of emergency, allowing them to quickly mobilize state resources and National Guard troops to help during and after the storm. Gordon became a tropical storm Monday near the Florida Keys, so residents and businesses rushed preparations Tuesday, taking in patio furniture, filling and placing sandbags and making sure they had bottled water and other supplies. On some of the barrier islands, mayors warned that only hours remained before their links to the mainland could be severed by rising water or debris. The storm appeared to be coming toward Dauphin Island, Alabama, closer to low tide around 7 p.m. Tuesday. Police planned to monitor the only highway to the mainland. “When you get the higher waves, water starts splashing across. Sometimes it starts pushing not only water across but debris, logs and things of that nature, which makes it very treacherous to get across,” Mayor Jeff Collier said. Grand Isle Mayor David Campardelle called for a voluntary evacuation of his barrier island in Louisiana, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of New Orleans. Ongoing construction on Highway 1, the lone road that connects Grand Isle to the rest of the state, could cause problems for people evacuating. “If you leave, you have to leave before the road floods,” Landry said. Gordon was poised for only a glancing blow to New Orleans, where Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the city has “the pumps and the power” needed to protect residents. Authorities issued a voluntary evacuation order for areas outside the city’s levee protection system, including the Venetian Isles, Lake Saint Catherine and Irish Bayou communities. Cantrell urged residents within the levee protection area to stock up on supplies and shelter in place.

BECK / AP,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. In Freemont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River. And in Mills County, Iowa, authorities ordered people in some rural areas to evacuate after the Missouri River overtopped levees.
The flooding followed days of snow and rain — record-setting, in some places — that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilke’s death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Freemont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
“There is no way out of here unless you’ve got a helicopter — or a boat,” the Rev. Mike Bitter, pastor of Christian Church of Waterloo, told the Omaha World-Herald.
Officials in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska were urging people not to drive unless necessary. In Iowa, a section of northbound Interstate 29 that runs parallel to the Missouri River was closed due to flooding. Authorities were rerouting motorists at Kansas City, Missouri, using a detour that took people almost 140 miles (225 kilometers) out of the way.
Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Service’s Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
“What we’re having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event that’s going to happen in early April,” he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.
Freeport resident Mary Martin told the (Freeport) Journal-Standard that she went to the store to get milk and bread when she saw floodwaters were rising Friday.
“Within an hour of going to the store, I could not get back in. That’s how fast the water was coming up,” Martin said.

John Wildermuth,"It was her first morning event, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein already was running late. She was going to a South Bay wildlife refuge to give a speech that was billed as nonpolitical, but nothing an officeholder does in an election year is nonpolitical. So it was no surprise that Feinstein, who is being challenged from the left in November by a fellow Democrat, state Sen. Kevin de León, went straight to the pitch that has kept her in the Senate since 1992. The $177 million federal grant she pushed through for a 4-mile-long levee and wetlands restoration project at the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge in Alviso came after more than 20 years of work and bipartisan negotiations, she said. “We can get all people together, Republicans and Democrats, to work across the aisle for something we believe in,” Feinstein told the crowd. But it’s a different political world than it was in the 1990s. With Donald Trump in the White House, Feinstein’s kind of deal making isn’t just out of favor — many Democrats view it as collaborating with the enemy. In today’s California, a kind word for Trump or almost any other Republican can be taken as evidence of a Democratic candidate’s unfitness for office. Feinstein learned that last year when a crowd in San Francisco booed her for saying that if Trump could “learn and change,” there was the possibility that he “can be a good president.” Her suggestion that people “have to have some patience” with the Trump administration contributed to the uproar. Those statements, de León has said, persuaded him to jump into the Senate race. “In your state Senate, Democrats act like Democrats,” de León told delegates at the state Democratic Party convention a few months later. “We demand passion, not patience.” The contrast between an understated old-school politician like Feinstein and the new breed of Democrat was on display during the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearing for Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, federal appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Feinstein’s California counterpart, Sen. Kamala Harris, got a tip that Kavanaugh had been talking with lawyers at a Trump-linked law firm about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Harris didn’t have enough to go public with the details, but that didn’t keep her from using her question time to grill Kavanaugh — who denied he’d had any such talks. But when Feinstein received her own tip — a letter that alleged Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault a girl while they were both in high school, according to the New York Times — she said nothing at the hearing and refused to publicly discuss its contents when word of it leaked out last week. A spokesman said she wanted to go public, but that the alleged victim insisted on keeping the information private. Feinstein gave the letter to the FBI on Wednesday. De León echoed the reaction of many progressives to Feinstein’s overall questioning, saying she had “pantomimed her way through (the) hearing without a single question about the content of Kavanaugh’s character.” For Feinstein, her handling of the letter was a matter of passing up a chance to score political points, even against a nominee she opposes. Confrontation isn’t her style. She’s given up hope that Trump will be a good president, she said, but he and the Republicans are still a fact of life. “I don’t agree with Donald Trump, I didn’t vote for Donald Trump, I don’t support Donald Trump,” Feinstein said. “He is not my person of choice for the presidency.... But he still signs or vetoes bills.” With Republicans in control of the Senate, the only way to get anything done is to work with the other party, Feinstein added. “I have a bill that says (undocumented immigrant) children cannot be separated from their parents and every Democrat is on it, but that’s not enough, obviously,” she said. “So I’ve been trying to negotiate with (GOP Sen. Ted) Cruz to see if we can come up with a bill that we can both agree to.” From the day the former San Francisco mayor was first elected to the Senate, that call for bipartisan engagement has been Feinstein’s signature. When she pushed the California Desert Protection Act through the Senate in 1994, she did it by dealing with Republican concerns about private property and existing commercial uses on land that would be designated as wilderness. Most Republicans had opposed the bill, which had been introduced years before by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. “But Sen. Feinstein showed a willingness to solve problems rather than trumpet the issue,” said then-Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. In 2008, Feinstein and then-Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions collaborated on a law that cracked down on online pharmacies that sold controlled substances without prescriptions. In 2006, she worked with then-Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo., on a bill restricting the sale of ingredients needed to cook methamphetamine. In 2003, she and then-Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, helped persuade President George W. Bush to create the nationwide Amber Alert network for abducted children. “I have to work with the other party when the other party is in control,” Feinstein said. But even she admits that the Senate, and national politics in general, have become far more partisan. When Feinstein took up her landmark bill to ban the sale of assault weapons in 1994, the Democrats were in charge of the Senate. But Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP leader, called for a decision on the bill. “Dole stood up and said, ‘This is a big bill. This is an important bill. It deserves to be debated on the floor of the Senate,’” Feinstein recalled. The ban passed both houses of Congress but expired in 2004. In the current environment in the Senate, a bill that controversial would have no hope. On virtually every major legislation, “you have to get 60 votes to bring it to the floor or 60 votes to close debate and 60 votes to pass it,” Feinstein said. “So it essentially changes a majority vote to a supermajority.... It makes it very hard (for the minority) to pass anything.” Feinstein admits that the hard partisan turn is a new experience for her. “One thing I’ve never been is a name-caller,” she said. “And if what people want is their senator shouting epithets, I’m not the one. And it’s not going to accomplish anything.” Before the Kavanaugh hearing, Feinstein fought to have Republicans release millions of pages of documents related to the years the nominee spent as a White House aide to Bush. When the time came for public testimony, however, Feinstein’s questions were pointed but polite. She focused on issues such as his stands on abortion rights and gun control, mostly avoiding the harsh attacks that came from other Democrats. When Feinstein apologized to Kavanaugh for protesters’ disruptions of the hearing, de León and other progressives argued that was proof she was the wrong person to represent California in the Trump era. Feinstein shouldn’t be respecting “country club rules,” de León said. “We should be praising the protesters and standing outside with them, not apologizing for their actions.” Feinstein’s moderate instincts were reinforced by her early days in San Francisco politics. She “was the least political elected official I have worked with,” said Jim Lazarus, a senior vice president of the city’s Chamber of Commerce who was Feinstein’s deputy mayor. “Some of this may have come from the nonpartisan nature of local government until the early 1990s. Political parties couldn’t endorse during her years running for supervisor and mayor.” That also meant she didn’t owe anything to Democratic Party leaders and activists, as they discovered when Feinstein ran for governor in 1990. An early underdog in the primary campaign against state Attorney General John Van de Kamp, Feinstein drew boos when she went to the state Democratic Party convention and talked about her support for the death penalty. But Feinstein’s campaign had a film crew at the convention, shooting her speech and the angry reaction of the crowd. She quickly put up a TV spot touting herself as the only Democratic candidate in favor of the death penalty. She beat Van de Kamp in the primary, only to lose the general election to Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. She has moved leftward during her years in office. In particular, the tough-on-crime persona has mellowed. She no longer favors the death penalty and has dropped her opposition to legalization of recreational marijuana use. “I don’t want to not grow, I don’t want to not learn,” she told reporters in May. “The world changes and views change and we change.” Feinstein hasn’t flipped on all the hot-button issues. She remains an opponent of single-payer health care, arguing that it’s hard to see where the money would come from. Instead, she said, “I’ve supported a public option of insurance to compete with the private sector. I support lowering the age of access to Medicare to 55.” Feinstein also pushes back against progressive Democrats’ call for Trump’s impeachment, which de León supports. “What has to happen is an election,” Feinstein said. “And that’s how people are replaced, in an election.” She added, “If you want to be a senator just to vote on impeachment, that’s not a good reason to be a United States senator.” But many Democratic activists are moving away from her. In a harsh rebuke to Feinstein, the state Democratic Party’s 330-member executive board overwhelmingly endorsed de León in July. Feinstein’s allies blamed that on the takeover of the party’s internal apparatus by pro-Bernie Sanders progressives and said it wasn’t representative of rank-and-file Democrats’ sentiments. But those progressives, impatient with Feinstein’s collegial and compromise-friendly Senate style, may also be her party’s future. There probably aren’t enough of them yet to blunt her re-election chances. She easily won the June primary, even beating de León in the legislative district he represents in Los Angeles. “Having de León run to the left and seeking progressive support is the perfect strategy for Feinstein,” said Darry Sragow, a former Democratic strategist who now publishes the California Target Book, which focuses on state political races. “There are far more people to Feinstein’s right than there are to her left.” A bigger challenge to Feinstein could be her age. At 85, she is already the oldest member of the Senate. While de León and other opponents are careful not to raise the age issue directly, there are regular wink-and-a-nod calls for “new blood” and “a new generation of leadership.” Feinstein said she spent a lot of time thinking before she decided to run for re-election, looking at “whether I wanted to do it, whether I felt I could continue to do it for a length of time. All the signs were ‘yes’ on both.” She said she doesn’t let concerns about her age bother her. “My health is good,” she said. “I don’t think age is chronological. I think age is mental and it’s physical.” In her view, the years she has spent in office, the work she’s done and the contacts she’s made are reason enough to vote for her. Before making her speech at the South Bay wildlife refuge, Feinstein played the politician and spent her first few minutes greeting old friends, people she had worked with for more than two decades to get the project moving. “You’ve been great,” she said to one. “It’s been so many years,” Feinstein told another. Her ability to cobble together bipartisan alliances and get things done is what people should focus on in November, she said after the talk. “I’m not one who beats people up,” Feinstein said. “I just want people to understand how much I care about this state and doing the right thing, the positive thing on behalf of the people who live here.” John Wildermuth is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Maya Rhodan,"It is still dark out when Border Patrol agent Herman Rivera’s radio crackles to life. His fellow agents, posted nearby on levee roads above the Rio Grande, report movement along the border with Mexico in the dim predawn. As the first rays of sunlight creep across the horizon, the team bursts into action, charging down into the scrub, dodging bushes and ducking under low-hanging branches in pursuit of migrants. Helicopter blades whomp overhead. “I’ve got one over here,” an agent yells from a field where stalks of sugarcane tower over his head. “I’ve got two over here,” screams another. They emerge a beat later with a line of men in handcuffs. Elsewhere, agents discover four more migrants, three from China and one from Guatemala, hiding in thick underbrush. But not all of those who come across the border with Mexico run or hide. Hours later, as the sun reaches its midday peak, Rivera stands overlooking the river, watching as two men climb into an inflatable raft and paddle toward the U.S. shore. He doesn’t call for backup–there will be no need to chase these two. They approach Rivera’s truck, smiling broadly. They are a father and son, both named Fredy, they explain. They’ve been traveling for 13 days from Nicaragua and say they can’t go back.

Nate Patrin,"Fifty years ago this week, Led Zeppelin released their self-titled debut album, and — well, it’s Led Zeppelin, you know the deal. Revolutionized hard rock, brought it into the arenas, reinvented ’60s psychedelia as ’70s heavy metal, so on, so forth. I figure most of us have opinions on the Zep and what it means to Get The Led Out; mine is that I still like revisiting their stuff even if I memorized almost all of it in high school, that “In the Evening” might actually be their best song, and that they were a gateway for me into even wilder, more genre-bending, somehow heavier stuff, which I’d owe ‘em for even if I “outgrew” them. (I haven’t.)
But you’re reading a Breaks With Tradition column, so let’s cut to the chase: John Henry goddamned Bonham. Over 400 songs have sampled Led Zeppelin, and Bonzo’s the main reason why. As their drummer, his backbone was what was worth really zooming in and focusing on once all Jimmy Page’s guitar maelstroms had finished wowing you. And every aspiring young stoner, used LP hoarder, Cool-Older-Sibling-haver, child to a Weed Dad, ironic-appreciator-turned-grudging-enthusiast, and Rolling Stone subscriber between 1971 and infinity found that out in its purest form when the band’s untitled fourth album — AKA Led Zeppelin IV, ZoSo, the runes album, and “the song’s called ‘Four Sticks’ but that old guy on the cover’s carrying at least 10 of them” — hit its last track. 
“When the Levee Breaks” has been sampled over 100 times — not quite “Funky Drummer” turf, but a lot — and it might have a higher batting average of great tracks than anything I’ve covered to date. There are only so many slots to fill in this column, so I’d be remiss not to mention, for instance, Coldcut’s “Beats &amp; Pieces,” Dr. Dre’s “Lyrical Gangbang,” Enigma’s “Return To Innocence,” Massive Attack’s “Man Next Door,” Eminem’s “Kim,” Tomoyasu Hotei’s “Battle Without Honor Or Humanity,” and Beyoncé’s “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” but that still leaves us with a lot to cover.
The Original: Led Zeppelin, “When the Levee Breaks” (from Led Zeppelin IV, Atlantic, 1971)
So: ever heard the original early take of this song? It’s weird. All the parts are there, more or less, but besides the fact that Robert Plant’s vocal isn’t really there yet, the thing that throws me off is the mix. The bass is noticeably higher up in there, but the drums are just … drums, and not the striding march of a giant made of storm clouds and limestone. This is why there’s such a thing as a second draft. Besides some additional studio trickery that’d do a young King Tubby proud (backwards echo on the harmonica, tempo-shifting individual tracks, that absolutely batshit back-and-forth panning of everything but Plant’s voice at the end), they really nailed down the colossus-scale sound of it all when engineer Andy Johns got himself a bright idea.
While the rest of the band was out getting lit, Johns dragged Bonham’s Ludwig bass drum into the lobby of haggard stone house/recording studio Headley Grange. He hung a pair of microphones from the stairs, used a high-end if temperamental Italian delay unit (the Binson Echorec, which you can see David Gilmour futzing with in Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii), and wrangled that famous beat out of a combination of the gigantic stairwell’s acoustics, the Echorec’s effects, and Bonzo’s own groove. People have tried tweaking it and manipulating it ever since — one YouTube blasphemer actually reengineered it to sound more like the Physical Graffiti sessions, which loses just enough oomph to feel disorienting — but once beatmakers got ahold of it, it proved far more versatile than any beat that iconic deserves to be.
The First Sample: Beastie Boys, “Rhymin &amp; Stealin” (from Licensed To Ill, Def Jam, 1986)
Before we get to the whole unholy punk/rap/stoner rock trinity that kicked off the first beat on the Beastie Boys’ debut album, let’s talk about the lyrics: They’re fucking stupid. I mean this with both criticism and affection, the former aimed at the gratuitous and since-rescinded gay-bashing language, and the latter pointed squarely at how far the Beasties’ pirate-hijinks theme goes off the rails. Mutiny On The Bounty and “16 men on a dead man’s chest” and deep-cut references to the Sex Pistols’ horny-on-the-high-seas “Friggin’ In The Riggin'”? Sure, go for it. Murdering food spokespersons (“Pistol is loaded/ And I shot Betty Crocker/ Delivered Colonel Sanders down to Davy Jones’ Locker”)? Shit, I’d watch those dopey Johnny Depp movies if I got a promise that’d happen. Also: “ALI BABA AND THE 40 THIEVES” over and over and over.
But that beat, holy hell. Adam Horovitz recalls its origin in Beastie Boys Book, after stopping in at Adam Yauch’s apartment: 
I get there and Yauch has a tape deck up on the counter in the kitchen. Not a cassette deck, but a quarter-inch reel-to-reel tape deck. I didn’t even know he had one. He’d pulled the tape out of the machine and wound it around a mic stand and a wooden chair close to the reel-to-reel … He had the intro drumbeat to Led Zeppelin’s “When The Levee Breaks” going around and around his kitchen. The sound and the visual were so magical to me. It was like he was on some Doug Henning shit. He said that he recorded the intro part of the record onto the tape, and then edited just that intro part, and wanted it to keep going around and around like what a DJ would do with breakbeats … He told me that he’d heard about Hendrix and Sly Stone doing tape loops and he wanted to try it.
It’s pretty straightforward as drum loops go, and nowhere near as elastic and funky as what the Bomb Squad would do with similar tape-manipulating means a year later, but damn if it still doesn’t sound 50 stories tall. All that was left was to re-record the guitar riff from Black Sabbath’s “Sweet Leaf” over it, and the rest was obnoxious, amazing, fried-chicken-magnate-gangplank-walking history. (BONUS TRIVIA POSTSCRIPT: Paul’s Boutique cut “High Plains Drifter” references “Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap” — that’s the brand of beer whose three-ring logo bears a certain inverted resemblance to the rune symbol on John Bonham’s kick drum.)
The Early Sample: Saint Etienne, “Only Love Can Break Your Heart” (12″, Heavenly, 1990; also released on Foxbase Alpha, 1991)
For the most part, “When The Levee Breaks” was and always has been the kind of break you use if you want subwoofers to crack concrete and your rhythms to act like blunt-force clobbering. Have you ever tried to dance to that break? It’s a motherfucker of a head-nodder, but it doesn’t make your hips do much. That’s why Saint Etienne dropping it in their debut single and Neil Young cover is a slick move in an already paradigm-flipping cover: if they can make a song that elegiac and vulnerable and wide-open-spaced into something you can uprock to, pretty much anything is possible. Bonzo doesn’t show up until around the bridge halfway through, at which point you get an easy lesson in how ramping up the tempo is just about enough to turn one of his more lead-weighted impact-first grooves into Jabo Starks.
The Breakthrough Sample: Björk, “Army Of Me” (from Post, One Little Indian, 1995)
Of course, this is a famous and straightforward usage of the loop, I thought when I put this list together, but wouldn’t you know it: I had to go and listen to it again, and remembered it’s something else entirely. When Björk and Graham Massey came together to assemble this track, they actually gave that break a bit of additional pressure and drive by cutting it in half, boom bap without the follow-up boom ba ba bap. It’s not the most complicated decision to make behind the boards, but it adds just that additional frisson and momentum to the track that its hyperventilating synths complete magnificently. It’s that riff that actually completes the dynamics of tension and release that the beat used to have before it was amputated.
The Weirdo Sample: Russell Velázquez, “Pokémon World” (single, Koch Records, 2000)
I’m too young to be peak Gen X because I don’t actually remember the ’70s, but I’m too old to be a millennial because I don’t give a fuck about Pokémon and never have. But generations are bullshit, so hey. Anyhow, I picked this track for the Weirdo slot for a distinct reason, and not just to see if I can anger as many people as possible with an admission of disinterest in a piece of Compulsory Entertainment. I have to give this track the nod because its “Levee” break is so staggeringly obvious (even modestly sped-up to decade-late New Jack Swing tempo) that there has to be at least a 50/50 chance that some random person who is currently in their twenties will have heard this long before they heard anything by Led Zeppelin, and when they did somehow hear “When The Levee Breaks” for the first time later on, they lost their fucking mind.
The Recent Sample: Homeboy Sandman, “Consumption” (from Veins, Stones Throw, 2017)
Homeboy Sandman is the best MC that never gets talked about because people are too busy debating whether SoundCloud rap is any good or not, so any opportunity to give him his due is an opportunity I’m gonna take. He’s got kind of an East Coast Madlib stop-start flow on this track, which is enough to juke you timing-wise but doesn’t fight the beat enough to be jarring. Props to Sam “BPAD” Borrello of Philadelphia’s Ill Doots for supplying the beat — a slick blend of that Bonham boom-bap and a lighter Fender Rhodes countermeasure of a melody — though I gotta wonder (and hope): Does Stones Throw have Led Zeppelin Sample Clearance Money? It sure went to better use than in Vinyl, at least.","Fifty years ago this week, Led Zeppelin released their self-titled debut album, and -- well, it's Led Zeppelin, you know the deal.

Ken Miller/AP,"(OKLAHOMA CITY) — At least two people are dead as a strong storm system that included possible tornadoes roared eastward through the central United States, leaving demolished homes, damaged vehicles and uprooted trees in its wake. A man in northeast Arkansas and a woman in south central Kentucky both were killed as the storm that also included strong winds, hail and heavy rain that triggered flooding muscled its way through the area, according to authorities. In northeast Arkansas, an 83-year-old man was killed after high winds toppled a trailer home. Clay County Sheriff Terry Miller told KAIT-TV that Albert Foster died Saturday night after the home was blown into a pond. About 50 miles away, the weather service said the roof was blown off a hotel in Osceola, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) north of Memphis, Tennessee. In rural, south central Kentucky, 79-year-old Dallas Jane Combs died after a suspected tornado hit her Adairville home Saturday evening, Logan County Sheriff’s Department told television station WKRN. Sheriff officials said Combs was inside the home when it collapsed on her. Combs was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities say Combs’ husband was outside the house when the unconfirmed tornado hit and he sustained minor injuries. Storm-related damage also was reported in Middle Tennessee, where Fox17 in Nashville reported extensive damage to homes and vehicles. Fox17 says at least a dozen homes were damaged in one Montgomery County subdivision. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens signed an executive order earlier Saturday declaring a state of emergency ahead of the anticipated storms and flooding in parts of southern Missouri. The order activates the resources of the Missouri National Guard and ensures state resources are available in the event of weather damage. A levee breach along the Kankakee River in northwestern Indiana had local officials urging about 30 homeowners to evacuate. Keener Township Volunteer Fire Chief Randy Woods said the breach was relatively minor when it was discovered about 3 p.m. Friday near Demotte, about 50 miles southeast of Chicago. Local residents tried to sandbag the breach “to get it under control, but it just got bigger and bigger,” he said. Local firefighters were called to help them, but eventually everyone had to pull out for their own safety. No injuries were reported. The weather service said record flooding was occurring along the Kankakee following several days of heavy rains and snowmelt that sent streams out of their banks from the Ohio River to Michigan and Wisconsin. Flood watches and warnings spanned multiple states Sunday morning, from Missouri to central Pennsylvania, while a wind advisory remained in effect for nearly all of Lower Michigan.","The storm system demolished homes, damaged vehicles and uprooted trees",2018-02-25T15:28:30Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",At Least 2 Dead as Severe Weather Moves Through Central U.S.,http://time.com/5174552/midwest-storm-deaths/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/midwest-floods-mailbox.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nichola Groom,"(Reuters) - In 2006, a year after hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the U.S. government struck a deal to give states in the region a growing share of offshore drilling revenues to finance projects protecting them from future monster storms. 
But revenues have fallen short of forecasts by half, leaving Louisiana with a gap in financing for a $50 billion plan for projects to raise levees, build flood gates, widen evacuation routes and protect its eroding coastline. 
The shortfall, which federal officials blame on low oil prices, has forced the state to put off critical projects as Louisiana’s congressional delegation pushes for another increase in its share of federal oil revenues. 
The predicament shows how states hosting offshore drilling can get burned by the industry’s boom-and-bust cycles, providing a cautionary tale for other states as the Trump administration proposes to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans. 
Louisiana’s underfinanced coastal projects also highlight the hefty cost of adapting to rising sea levels in a changing climate a problem scientists blame on consumption of fossil fuels. Several coastal states including Florida, Massachusetts, California, and Washington have urged the administration to leave them out of its drilling plans, arguing the environmental costs outweigh the promised jobs and income. 
The stakes are particularly high for Louisiana, which has lost about 2,000 square miles of land over the last century because of Mississippi River levees that block silt from reaching its swamps, the oil industry’s carving of canals through the marshes, and sea level rise from climate change. 
But other states and nations should take notice of Louisiana’s ordeal, said U.S. Representative Garret Graves, a Republican who managed the state’s coastal restoration efforts before joining Congress in 2014. 
“What in Louisiana is a $50 or $70 billion problem, you are talking hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars around the United States and around the world,” he said. 
FAULTY PROJECTIONS 
President George W. Bush signed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) into law in December of 2006, providing storm-battered Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama a 37.5 percent share of federal oil-and-gas royalties from offshore drilling. 
Previously, Gulf Coast states got 27 percent of revenues from federal leases within three miles of their seaward boundaries. 
The changes followed national outrage over the administration’s botched emergency response to catastrophic flooding from the systematic failure of the federally constructed levee system in New Orleans. 
Six months earlier, the chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted the agency had “missed something” in engineering the system, which collapsed at water levels lower than they were designed to withstand. 
For the first ten years, the changes applied to only a fraction of offshore leases. But after that, in larger payouts starting last year, it applied to all offshore leases off the coasts of these states. 
In 2013, the Department of Interior told Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that, under the second phase, they would have at least $375 million to split between them annually through 2055. 
But when the states’ first payment came in late last year, the payout totaled $188 million. 
“That has a huge impact on our planning efforts,” said Chip Kline, chair of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which oversees its 50-year, $50 billion coastal restoration plan. 
Another GOMESA recipient, Alabama, has also felt the pinch. Its Republican governor, Kay Ivey, wrote a letter to then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in March 2018 urging him to support states seeking more offshore revenues. 
“Expanded and enhanced revenue sharing will allow states to more properly address the coastal impacts of offshore production,” she wrote. 
An official for the Texas General Land Office said the lower payouts had not impacted its programs because it had budgeted conservatively. Officials in Mississippi did not respond to requests for comment. 
Department of Interior officials said the shortfall was due to a sharp drop in oil prices since 2013. It would not provide the underlying oil price or production estimates it used in its 2013 projections, saying they were supplied by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and were confidential. 
OMB did not respond to a Reuters request for the data. 
In an emailed statement, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said the bureau no longer provides long-term projections for state revenue from the program. 
OUTSIZED IMPACT 
The shortfall had an outsized impact on Louisiana, which receives almost half the GOMESA program’s revenues because of its geographic proximity to the largest number of offshore wells. It received $82 million in its first phase-two payout, compared to the $177 million it had been counting on. 
Among the shortfall’s biggest impacts, Kline said, would be a delay in completing the state’s massive “Morganza to the Gulf” hurricane protection project, a system of levees and floodgates to protect 150,000 coastal residents of Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes from a so-called 100-year storm, defined as having a 1 percent chance of hitting in any given year. 
Lafourche parish is a major seafood and oil industry hub that includes Port Fourchon, the land base for offshore oil and gas services companies. Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes could each lose about 40 percent of their land area in the next 50 years in the absence of effective coastal protection measures, according to state research. 
The Morganza project has been in the works for more than a decade and is expected to cost about $2 billion. Local communities have already agreed to tax increases twice to help fund the unfinished project. 
“We’ve been piecemealing this,” said Reggie Dupre, executive director of the Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District. 
The funding gap also forced state officials to cancel a plan to funnel 10 percent of offshore oil revenue to help finance road improvements along hurricane evacuation routes. 
St. Bernard Parish, which was devastated by flooding after Hurricane Katrina, has its own $1 billion coastal plan, with $600 million in projects ready to move forward. 
It received $781,000 from the 2018 payments, according to John Lane, coastal manager for the parish. 
“There just isn’t enough money coming in,” Lane said. 
LEGISLATIVE PUSH 
While Louisiana officials piece together funding for their projects from other sources, its legislators in Congress are fighting for changes to GOMESA, including increasing the percentage diverted to states from 37.5 percent to 50 percent. 
One such bill, sponsored by Congressman Graves, passed a vote in the House Committee on Natural Resources late last year, before the new Congress was seated.

But the idea faces resistance from those who believe the revenues should be used on national instead of state priorities. Both President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama’s administrations had proposed budgets eliminating or reducing GOMESA payments to finance federal programs instead, before being pushed back by Congress. 
Graves says increasing the revenue share would be a smart move for an administration promoting more offshore drilling. 
“Are you really going to treat (host states) poorly and not reward them, or not keep them happy and healthy so they can continue being productive?” Graves said.

Rebecca Hersher,"Mike Stone, left, and Andy Sherman in the pumping station for Hannibal, Mo., during a flood in 1993. The city has since constructed a flood wall, and flood managers have built up levees to protect against flooding. But scientists warn those structures are making flooding worse. Cliff Schiappa/AP Floods on the Mississippi River are getting more frequent and more severe. But scientists warn that the infrastructure meant to protect towns and farms against flood waters is making the problem worse. A series of analyses have helped confirm what engineers have posited for more than a century: that earthen levees built along the river are increasing flood risk for everyone, and especially hurting those who live across from them. ""When a new or larger levee is built there is often hew and cry, and if there isn't, there should be,"" says Nicholas Pinter, a geologist and the associate director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis. ""What you're doing in many cases is taking a flood plain out there — it can be 5 [or] 6 miles wide — and you're forcing the water that would otherwise spread across that area to go through a narrow passageway."" As the passageway gets narrower, the water flows faster and higher, The resulting floods are more severe than they would have been without the levees, which then drives people to build more levees, driving a ""hydrologic spiral"" of flooding, levees, more flooding and higher levees. Levee hazards are not a new idea. In 1852 an engineer named Charles Ellet Jr. wrote a report for the federal government in which he warned that confining the Mississippi River to a narrow channel caused the water to ""rise higher and flow faster."" But despite 19th century warnings, levees quickly became the go-to solution for controlling the river. After the great flood of 1927, Congress required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a massive system of levees and dams on the Lower Mississippi. A study published earlier this year attempted to quantify the effect of that infrastructure on flooding. The authors examined river-adjacent sediment and tree rings going back 500 years, and found that floods have become significantly more severe and frequent in the last 150 years. Increased precipitation from climate change, combined with the effects of levees and dams, have ""elevated the current flood hazard to levels that are unprecedented within the past five centuries,"" the authors write. But the hydrologic spiral is a powerful thing. Doubling down on levees Faced with major floods every other year along some stretches of the Upper Mississippi, which has historically had fewer levees than the lower part of the river, many floodplain managers have built up levees and flood walls, even though doing so will only make the problem worse in the long-term. An investigation by ProPublica and The Alton Telegraph found drainage districts in Missouri and Illinois are lobbying to reduce federal flood regulation, paving the way for more and higher levees in communities that want them. A model released earlier this year by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers showed that a handful of drainage districts north of St. Louis aren't waiting for permission; they have already raised their levees above the level authorized by the Corps. The largest of them, the Sny Island Levee Drainage District in Illinois, raised its levees in response to a flood in 2008, which was the second largest flood ever recorded on the Upper Mississippi. ""In a flood fight, you raise your levees at least two feet higher than the forecast crest, and we did that,"" explains the drainage district superintendent, Mike Reed. Crews push extra sand onto Mississippi River levees in the Sny drainage district in Illinois during a flood in June 2008. M. Spencer Green/AP After the water receded, the district decided to leave the extra sand where it was to protect against the next flood, even though that violated federal height regulations. In 2015, the Army Corps announced it would withhold future federal funds for maintaining the overbuilt levees. Reed says the drainage district assesses about $2 million each year from local land owners to pay for the levee system, and that the investment has paid off. ""We have calculated that since 2001, almost $1 billion in damages has been prevented by our levee system, just in the Sny,"" says Reed. ""So, it works. It's difficult, it's hard work, it's tough, and it's 24/7. But that's what you have to do."" But multiple studies show overbuilt levees are increasing flood risk for people on both sides of the river. An analysis released earlier this year found the Sny levees have increased the height of the river during floods, pushing water into towns and farms across the river, as Eli Chen of St. Louis Public Radio has reported. 'They're sending the water our way' ""They're sending the water our way, and there's nothing we can do about it,"" says Al Murry, the emergency manager for Pike County, Mo. The county has been hit with multiple so-called 100-year floods in the last decade, destroying crops on Murry's side of the river while the other side stayed dry. ""You know, every year you just spend enormous amounts of money. It makes a mess out of a lot of property. A lot of crops are going wasted,"" he says. Murry, who is a former fire fighter, says he thinks the Sny levees are indicative of short-term thinking and poor risk assessment. ""People are greedy. That's a lot of what's going on on this river right now. It's not good for anyone."" Indeed, people who study the river say levees can also increase long-term flood risk for the farmers who pay to be protected by them. ""Just because you live behind a great, big, strong levee does not mean that there's no chance of getting flooded,"" explains Pinter. ""There are two types of levees: those that have failed and those that will fail."" When tall levees fail, the people who live and work behind them are less likely to be carrying adequate flood insurance. That's because when levees are high enough to protect against floods with a one percent chance of occurring in any given year, the federal government no longer requires homeowners living behind them to carry flood insurance. A sign in a field near Winfield, Mo., during a Mississippi River flood in 2008. The area suffered a similarly serious flood in 1993. The frequency of severity of flooding up and down the river have increased due to climate change and river control structures such as levees. Tom Gannam/AP Risk is similarly obscured in the crop insurance market. Farmers behind the Sny levees are paying half as much to insure fields along the Mississippi River as their neighbors across the river are, explains crop insurance salesman Matt Jones. ""It's based on flood risk, and the area behind the levee is considered lower risk,"" he says. Since crop insurance is a federally subsidized program, if the levee-protected fields are ever inundated, much of the cost would be born by taxpayers. ""When they do have a catastrophic flood, it's going to be a big loss,"" says Murry. ""It's going to be huge. It's going to affect the cost of living. And everybody's going to pay for it."" Reed insists the Sny's risk assessment is sound. ""In an excess of 100 years we've had one levee breach,"" he says. He doesn't agree with data that shows levees increase flood risk. ""A model is a theory. What actually is happening, to me, is more important that what a theory says."" Reed say people feel safe behind his district's levees, at least relatively so. But he admits, ""Mother Nature is a tough thing to predict.""","For more than 150 years, scientists have known that levees increase flood risk on the Mississippi River. That hasn't stopped local officials from building up levees in response to more severe floods.",2018-05-21T15:15:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Levees Make Mississippi River Floods Worse, But We Keep Building Them",https://www.npr.org/2018/05/21/610945127/levees-make-mississippi-river-floods-worse-but-we-keep-building-them,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/17/ap_930714069_wide-2cc80a62f899692b73232a33b514d4224850a591.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Travis Fedschun,"At least three people are dead as a storm system roars eastward across the central U.S., spawning possible tornadoes and flooding and leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin said late Saturday two people died in the western part of state due to ""severe weather events"" as the storm that also included strong winds, hail and heavy rain slammed the region. ""Please take weather watches/warnings seriously, and stay safe,"" Bevin said on Twitter. In rural, south central Kentucky, 79-year-old Dallas Jane Combs died after a suspected tornado hit her Adairville home Saturday evening, Logan County Sheriff's Department told television station WKRN. Sheriff officials said Combs was inside the home when it collapsed on her. Combs was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities say Combs' husband was outside the house when the unconfirmed tornado hit and he sustained minor injuries. In northeast Arkansas, an 83-year-old man was killed after high winds toppled a trailer home. Clay County Sheriff Terry Miller said in a Facebook post that Albert Foster died Saturday night after the home was blown into a pond in Knobel. Storm-related damage also was reported in Middle Tennessee, where FOX17 in Nashville reported extensive damage to homes and vehicles. FOX17 said at least a dozen homes were damaged in one Montgomery County subdivision. FOX NEWS WEATHER CENTER The storms were caused by a system associated with a cold front moving east, which caused flood watches and warnings to be issued across multiple states as of Sunday morning while a wind advisory remained in effect for nearly all of Lower Michigan. Heavy rain also spread into the Northeast, which caused greater flooding fears.

Katie Reilly,"Severe flooding in the Midwest caused by heavy rain and snowmelt has damaged hundreds of homes and left at least three people dead, as water covered farm land and an Air Force base along the Missouri River.
About 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas were compromised, contributing to the flooding, the Associated Press reported. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts described it as “the most devastating flooding we’ve probably ever had in our state’s history.”
Three people from Nebraska were killed in incidents involving rising waters, and two men from Nebraska have been missing since Thursday, according to the AP.
“The majority of the levee system along the Missouri River, south of Omaha, continues to deteriorate and is compromised,” Col. John Hudson, Omaha District Commander for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said in a statement Sunday. “The bulk of the levees remain overtopped or breached.
“The duration of flood water impacts is still unknown at this time. I want to encourage residents to continue to monitor the situation and keep in close contact with their local and state emergency management organizations to stay updated on any evacuation plans and emergency conditions,” he said.
The National Weather Service said “major to historic river flooding is forecast to persist for portions of the Missouri and Mississippi River Basins as snowmelt continues over areas that received heavy rainfall last week.”
Parts of Illinois and North Dakota are also bracing for major flooding in coming days.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to travel to Nebraska on Tuesday to survey the flood damage with the governors of Nebraska and Iowa, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a tweet.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","Officials in eastern Nebraska are still evacuating communities around rivers that are spilling their banks in the wake of heavy rains and massive snow melt.
 Time, Time
A ""bomb cyclone"" storm that bloated rivers as it roared through much of the Midwest combined with spring snowmelt Sunday to drive some Midwest rivers to record levels and force evacuation of hundreds of homes.
And some areas must brace for more rain Tuesday, forecasters said. 
Tuesday's storm won't match last week's ""bomb cyclone"" that triggered heavy snow, howling winds and several tornadoes, AccuWeather Meteorologist Jim Andrews said. But he said there is the potential for up to another inch of rain on areas that have no place to put the water.
""That could trigger new or aggravate problems if that rain targets the areas hit hardest by the flooding,"" he said.
The governors of Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin have declared states of emergency. Roads and highways were closed. Amtrak said some trains in the region were delayed and other canceled.
The Missouri River between Omaha and Kansas City could remain at or near record levels through most of this week as runoff from flooded streams and rivers flows downstream, AccuWeather said.

In Nebraska, Offutt Air Force Base was under siege from water. Base officials finally called off a furious sandbagging effort, saying the water was rising too fast to be stopped.
Much of the base, home to almost 9,000 service members, was underwater Sunday. It was open to essential personnel only.
""We have about 2 feet of water in the Bennie Davis Maintenance Facility,"" 55th Wing Commander Col. Michael Manion said. ""All streets south and east of the Field House are impassible.""
Interstate 29 was shut down from Omaha to Rockport, Missouri. Last week, Columbus, Nebraska, farmer James Wilke, 50, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to rescue a stranded motorists.
""All evacuation notices, suggested and mandatory, are strongly encouraged,"" the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. ""By ignoring evacuation recommendations, extraction requests made later may be delayed.""
Fast moving water was approaching the town of Thurman, IA. This is likely the result of levee breeches in the area. Evacuation operations were beginning for the town. #iawx
— NWS Omaha (@NWSOmaha) March 17, 2019
More than 2,000 Iowans have fled their homes since heavy rains triggered flooding last week. The Missouri River in Fremont County, Iowa, rose two feet above its previous record level on Sunday. Authorities ordered evacuation of the town of Thurman's more than 200 residents.
""Fast moving water was approaching the town of Thurman,"" the National Weather Service warned Sunday. ""This is likely the result of levee breaches in the area. Evacuation operations were beginning.""
County Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius said the swift current added to the danger.
This wasnt a gradual rise, Crecelius said. Its flowing fast and its open country theres nothing there to slow it down.
Aleido Rojas Galan, 55, died after he and two other men tried to drive around a ""road closed"" barricade, Fremont County Sheriff Kevin Aistrope said Saturday. All three escaped the vehicle, and Galan was found clinging to a tree in the water. 
Galan was flown to a Nebraska where he died. The other men were treated for their injuries.
Parts of Missouri, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin were also facing flooding. Several Wisconsin communities have been evacuated since Friday night.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday afternoon that Donald Trump plans sign a federal government spending package that reflects compromises over his US-Mexico border wall, while also declaring a national state of emergency, which Trump intends to use to obtain more money for The Wall.Shortly after, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed this.""I just had an opportunity to speak with President Trump and hes prepared to sign the bill,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. ""He will also be signing a national emergency declaration at the same time.""
After the Senate votes, the House is also expected to pass the spending package.
This came after Trump said earlier in the day that he was still reviewing the bill. In the morning, Republican senators had said that they ""pray"" Trump signs it into law, averting another government shutdown on Friday.
The Senate is expected to act first on the 1,159-page bill, which was released just after midnight. The House will likely vote later in the evening, ahead of the Friday night deadline to prevent another partial government shutdown.
Trump has said he is not ""happy"" with the measure, though he has been expected to sign it. ""Reviewing the funding bill with my team at the @WhiteHouse!"" he tweeted Thursday afternoon, ahead of the Senate vote.
The bill would provide $1.375 billion for 55 miles of pedestrian and levee fencing in the Rio Grande Valley, significantly less than Trump's $5.7 billion request. It also prohibits the use of a concrete wall or other Trump prototypes and specifies that only ""existing technologies"" for fencing and barriers can be used.",The only national emergency in America is Trump.,2019-02-14T20:30:02Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Boingboing.net'}",Trump to declare national state of emergency and sign spending bill to avert Shutdown 2.0,https://boingboing.net/2019/02/14/mitch-mcconnell-says-trump-to.html,https://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/trump.jpeg,,Boingboing.net,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Winkie Visser,"Name: Annelies, Hans, their son Scott and Harry the dog Location: Amsterdam, the Netherlands Size: 1,507 square feet Years lived in: 7 years, owned Born and bred on a houseboat, Annelies has lived on the water practically her whole life. She and her husband Hans had a brief stint of living in a conventional house, but after a year and a half living on land, a great opportunity popped up that they couldn't resist: a mooring spot became available a stone's throw away from where Annelies spent her childhood. Eager to build their own house, the couple jumped at this unique chance. The location is fantastic — since the water is right behind a levee it's very quiet, and yet it's merely a 10-minute bike ride to the center of Amsterdam. The two-story house was built on a concrete hull, which is typical for these type of houseboats. Often, this hull will become the home's basement (in this case it indeed serves as the family's storage space). But though it may be called a house boat, there's no engine and it's not meant to be mobile. Actually, it's very much a regular house; the biggest difference is that it's right on the water. However, that distinction really does set it apart. There's something soothing and even magical about living on water. Passersby are a wide variety of boats as well as ducks, swans and other birds. Each year during spring, the latter will be tugging along their cute young'uns. With its huge windows the home has an abundance of light. A super high ceiling and a white palette make the living room feel especially spacious. Annelies' love for soft colors is expressed in the fun accessories and furniture pieces. With so many great designs out there, she finds it a bit of a challenge to keep their home decor collection at bay — though their home never looks cluttered. Annelies finds it important to keep the colors and style in balance, not just in one room but throughout the entire home. To achieve this, she advises: ""Try to be consistent in colors and materials. When it comes to accessorizing, it will look better if you group your items instead of a haphazard placement."" Annelies has been sharing photos of their home on Instagram for a while now, but this outlet wasn't enough to express her love for interior and styling. On top of that, ever since Scott arrived, she's also become preoccupied with cool kids' items. This all led to Annelies starting a blog of her own. Initially, the focus was on interiors and kids, but it has since become more expansive and evolved into her personal space where she shares everything that makes her happy. It's bright and colorful and fun, much like their home! Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Scandinavian. A clean/white basis with touches of (pastel) colors. Inspiration: Dutch and Scandinavian design in general. No particular designers or brands. Favorite Element: The high ceiling and large windows in our living room. Biggest Challenge: Keeping all the colors in balance. This also extends to the look and feel of the different rooms. I don't want the living room to have a completely different style from the bedrooms upstairs. What Friends Say: They love the feel (and tidiness) of our home Biggest Embarrassment: Still have to fix the cabinet doors of our white credenza (see below) Proudest DIY: Our latest DIY is the lamp above our dining table. I think it's the best one we did so far! I love how the solid construction complements the soft colors of the cords and sockets. A very easy DIY is the shelf behind our dining table. We only bought the shelf brackets and let the guy in the lumberyard make us a shelf out of plywood underlayment, so we only had to place it in the brackets. We wanted a big white credenza covering most of our wall in the living room. However, we couldn't find one we liked or was within our budget after building the houseboat. So we made one ourselves. Because we aren't the best DIY-ers the cabinet doors look a bit messy. The DIY left in our home is the large ""plywood underlayment plaque"" on the wall in our living room/Scott's play corner. We also had a DIY table, but it has moved to the garden. Biggest Indulgence: I have to slow myself down every now and then when it comes to buying new accessories for our home. When I see a beautiful design in one of my favorite colors I just have to have it. But this does mean something else in our home has to move…so our basement is packed with pretty things I can't say goodbye to, but aren't using anymore. Best Advice: Let an interior grow. Don't buy it all at once.

AP,"TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) Migrants approaching the U.S. border from Mexico were enveloped with tear gas Sunday after a few tried to breach the fence separating the two countries. U.S. agents shot the gas, according to an Associated Press reporter on the scene. Children were screaming and coughing in the mayhem. Honduran migrant Ana Zuniga, 23, said she saw migrants open a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the Mexican side of a levee, at which point U.S. agents fired tear gas at them. We ran, but when you run the gas asphyxiates you more, she told the AP while cradling her 3-year-old daughter Valery in her arms. Mexicos Milenio TV also showed images of several migrants at the border trying to jump over the fence. A few yards away on the U.S. side, shoppers streamed in and out of an outlet mall. U.S. Border Patrol helicopters flew overhead, while U.S. agents held vigil on foot beyond the wire fence in California. The Border Patrol office in San Diego said via Twitter that pedestrian crossings have been suspended at the San Ysidro port of entry at both the East and West facilities. All northbound and southbound traffic was halted. Earlier Sunday, some Central American migrants, pushed past a blockade of Mexican police standing guard near the international border crossing. More than 5,000 migrants have been camped in and around a sports complex in Tijuana after making their way through Mexico in recent weeks via caravan. Many hope to apply for asylum in the U.S., but agents at the San Ysidro entry point are processing fewer than 100 asylum petitions a day. Some of the migrants who went forward Sunday called on each other to remain peaceful. They appeared to easily pass through the Mexican police blockade without using violence. A second line of Mexican police carrying plastic riot shields stood guard outside a Mexican customs and immigration plaza, where the migrants were headed. That line of police installed tall steel panels behind them outside the Chaparral crossing on the Mexican side of the border, which completely blocked incoming traffic lanes to Mexico. Irineo Mujica, who has accompanied the migrants for weeks as part of the aid group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, said the aim of Sundays march toward the U.S. border was to make the migrants plight more visible to the governments of Mexico and the U.S. We cant have all these people here, Mujica told The Associated Press. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum on Friday declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million, which he says is struggling to accommodate the crush of migrants.","Over 5,000 members of a migrant caravan on its way to the U.S. have been camped in Tijuana, Mexico, in recent weeks.",2018-11-25T21:46:26Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",U.S. Border Patrol Launches Tear Gas At Migrants Over Attempt To Breach Fence,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/migrant-caravan-tear-gas_us_5bfb11ace4b0771fb6ba24a5,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bfb130a3c00008f040ebcb6.jpeg?ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emily Shapiro,"Hurricane Florence is expected pummel more than just the coastline. The storm is predicted to bring heavy, possibly catastrophic, flooding to inland parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and other surrounding states. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Coastal North Carolina and far northeastern South Carolina may see up to 40 inches of rain in some places, and the rest of North and South Carolina as well as southwest Virginia, could see up to 24 inches, the National Hurricane Center said.

Map shows the areas at risk of flash flooding as Hurricane Florence heads towards the east coast of the U.S., Sept. 13, 2018. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has advice on how to stay safe in areas experiencing inland flooding. Flood safety tips: -- Never drive through flooded roads. You might not be able to tell if the road is damaged under the water's surface. -- If you live near a river, dam or levee, remember that dams and levees can fail when stressed by heavy rain. -- Plan and practice an evacuation route. Residents evacuate from coastal areas near Wallace, N.C., Sept. 11, 2018. -- Elevate electrical panels, sockets, wiring and appliances. -- Install a water alarm to alert you if water is building up in your basement. -- Clear debris from your gutters. -- Make an emergency kit with food, water and first aid supplies in case you need to leave quickly. People and pets evacuate ahead of the forecasted landfall of Hurricane Florence and seek shelter at Burgaw Middle School in Burgaw, N.C., on Sept. 2018. -- Make copies of important documents.

"Associated Press, Meg Kinnard and Jeffrey Collins, Associated Press","Last Slide Next Slide A submerged truck sits in floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in Nichols, S.C., Friday, Sept. 21, 2018. Virtually the entire town is flooded and inaccessible except by boat. (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) GALIVANTS FERRY, S.C. – With muddy river water still washing over entire communities on Friday, eight days after Hurricane Florence slammed into land with nearly 3 feet of rain, new evacuation orders forced residents to flee to higher ground amid a sprawling disaster that’s beginning to feel like it will never end. At least 42 people have died, included an elderly man whose body was found in a pickup truck that had been submerged in South Carolina, and hundreds were forced from their homes as rivers kept swelling higher and higher. Leaders in the Carolinas warned residents not to get complacent as it became plain that additional horrors lie ahead before things get much better. “Although the winds are gone and the rain is not falling, the water is still there and the worst is still to come,” said South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. Speaking in Las Vegas, President Donald Trump said South Carolina is in for a “tough one” as flood waters continue to rise. “They got hit, but the big hit comes days later and it will be the biggest they’ve ever had,” said Trump, who visited North and South Carolina this week. More: President Trump to N.C. resident: 'At least you got a nice boat out of the deal' More: 'God's not going to take me out,' says woman, trapped in the dark for 3 days after Hurricane Florence While most peoples’ lights are back on in the Carolinas and Virginia and trucks are picking up mountains of storm debris in many areas, water draining toward the sea from inland areas is sending rivers over their banks across a wide region. Rescuers wearing night-vision googles used helicopters, boats and big-wheeled military vehicles overnight to evacuate about 100 people from a southeastern North Carolina county where high water breached a levee and flooded a town. And in South Carolina, emergency managers ordered about 500 people to flee homes along the Lynches River. The National Weather Service said the river could reach record flood levels late Saturday or early Sunday. Shelters are open. In tiny Galivants Ferry, Audra Mauer said she lost her home two years ago when Hurricane Matthew hit and she’s losing it again to Florence. No improvements were made to the area after Matthew, she said, and a frustrated Mauer has no faith any will happen now. “They didn’t clean the ditches,” she said. “Same levee. Same dams. What have we been doing for two years? … Where did the money go to fix everything, to make the power lines stronger and to replace the poles?” About 25 miles (40 kilometers) nearer to the South Carolina coast, Kevin Tovornik was tearing soggy carpet out of the house he has owned for 20 years in Conway, where the Waccamaw River was still rising. Bridges are starting to close because of flooding, he said, and friends were struck in traffic for four hours trying to get through the town of 23,000 people. “This is ridiculous. This is the worst I’ve ever seen, and that includes hurricane evacuations,” Tovornik said. Roads also were a major problem in Wilmington, a city of 120,000 people still mostly cut off from the rest of North Carolina. A photograph posted by the state transportation agency showed flowing water and buckled asphalt on a highway that had been one of the few passable routes into the city, where officials have distributed food and water to residents. Along the Cape Fear River, David and Benetta White and their four children were given short notice to evacuate overnight when floodwaters came rushing on to their property. By the time they got loaded into their van, water was waist-high and they had to slog through a foul-smelling soup to get to a neighbor’s pickup. “We almost lost our lives, I’m here to tell you we did,” said White, whose family previously evacuated last Thursday as Florence approached as a hurricane from the Atlantic. The South Carolina governor estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion. In a letter he said the flooding will be the worst disaster in the state’s modern history. McMaster asked congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he knows the damage in his state will add up to billions of dollars, but said with the effects on the storm still being felt, there was no way to make a more accurate estimate. As environmental worries mount, Duke Energy said a dam containing a large lake at Wilmington power plant had been breached by floodwaters from Florence, and it was possible that coal ash from an adjacent dump was flowing into the Cape Fear River. Paige Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, said the company did not believe the breach at the L.V. Sutton Power Station posed a significant threat for increased flooding to nearby communities because the river is already running high. Something else could be a problem, though. The National Hurricane Center said it was monitoring four areas in the Atlantic for signs of a new tropical weather threat. One was off the coast of the Carolinas with a chance of drifting toward land. Greg Lovell has called his Hampstead, North Carolina, neighborhood home for 15 years, but only while battling floodwaters after Hurricane Florence has he met other members of his community facing the same struggles.

Brian Barrett,"The modern web contains no shortage of horrors, from ubiquitous ad trackers to all-consuming platforms to YouTube comments, generally. Unfortunately, there's no panacea for what ails this internet we've built. But anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one that's been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It's time to head back to RSS. For many of you, that means finding a replacement for Digg Reader, which went the way of the ghost this month. Or maybe you haven't used RSS since five years ago, when Google Reader, the beloved firehose of news headlines got the axe. For others, it means figuring out what the heck an RSS feed is in the first place—we'll get to that in just a minute. And some of you have already moved on to the next article in your Feedly queue. No matter what your current disposition, though, in this age of algorithmic overreach there's something deeply satisfying about finding stories beyond what your loudest Twitter follows shared, or that Facebook's News Feed optimized into your life. And lots of tools that can get you there. Cue RSS RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and it was first stitched into the tapestry of the open web around the turn of the millennium. Its aim is straightforward: to make it easy to track updates to the content of a given website in a standardized format. In practice, and for your purposes, that means it can give you a comprehensive, regularly updated look at all of the content your favorite sites publish throughout the day. Think of it as the ultimate aggregator; every morsel from every source you care about, fed directly to you. Or, more commonly, fed to you through an intermediary known as an RSS feed reader, software that helps you wrangle all of those disparate headlines into something remotely manageable. 'We're trying to keep things as they were.' Ben Wolf, The Old Reader The difference between getting news from an RSS reader and getting it from Facebook or Twitter or Nuzzel or Apple News is a bit like the difference between a Vegas buffet and an a la carte menu. In either case, you decide what you actually want to consume. But the buffet gives you a whole world of options you otherwise might never have seen. ""There are multiple approaches to connecting to news. Social felt pretty interesting at first, but when you mix social and algorithmic, you can easily get into these noise bubbles, or areas where you don't necessarily feel 100 percent in control of the algorithm,"" says Edwin Khodabakchian, cofounder and CEO of popular RSS reader Feedly. ""A tool like Feedly gives you a more transparent and controllable way to connect to the information you need."" With 14 million users, Feedly is the largest RSS reader on the market. And it's easy to see why; it's as feature-full as one could hope for, and has been around since 2008. (It also inherited a sizeable chunk of Google Reader's jilted audience.) It's far from your only option, though. All RSS readers function within the same basic outline. You tell them what RSS feeds you'd like to follow— The New York Times, say, or WIRED—and they collect every new headline those sites churn out, offering anything from a snippet of information to the full story, depending on how much the publisher allows. Each puts a slightly different spin on the process from there. Feedly, for instance, has for the last two years gravitated toward being a tool for research rather than passive entertainment. That's partly in response to platforms eating the open web. ""If you go after entertainment, you're not competing against other reader news tools. You're really competing with Instagram and other things people do to kill time,"" says Khodabakchian. ""On the other hand, if you think of this as an intelligence tool, or research assistant, we see a huge and increasing demand for that."" Still, Feedly has plenty to offer casual users. It has a clean user interface, and the free version of its service lets you follow 100 sources, categorized into up to three feeds—think News, Sports, Humor, or wherever your interests lie. It also shows how popular each story is, both on Feedly and across various social networks, to give you a sense of what people are reading without letting that information dictate what you see. Paid accounts—of which Feedly has about 100,000—get you more feeds and integrations, faster updates, and better tools for teams. For more of a throwback feel, you might try The Old Reader, which strips down the RSS reader experience while still emphasizing a social component. ""In terms of evolution, we're coming from a different perspective,"" says Ben Wolf, whose Levee Labs acquired The Old Reader in 2013. ""We're trying to keep things as they were."" For the million or so Old Reader users, that means not many bells and whistles. Even the mechanism to add new feeds feels just a touch more onerous than you'll find elsewhere. But once you do get properly organized, it's a fast and light experience, and if you can convince some friends to join, its social features will help you cut through the clutter. Most of all, there's not much to get in the way of the headlines, which is what you came for in the first place. Power users, meanwhile, might try Inoreader, which offers for free many of the features—unlimited feeds and tags, and some key integrations—Feedly reserves for paid accounts. ""I would say that at the moment Feedly is ahead of us in terms of mass appeal design look and UX, which is something we will try to tackle with our upcoming redesign,"" says Victor Stankov, Inoreader's business development manager. ""Hardcore nerds love us way more than Feedly."" And those are just three options of many. The point being: In 2018, it's easy to find an RSS reader out there that suits your needs. Which, in hindsight, is no small miracle. Throwback Five years ago, when Wolf took over The Old Reader, he offered a prescient insight : ""How long will it be before your Facebook stream is so full of promoted content, bizarre algorithmic decisions, and tracking cookie based shopping cart reminders that you won't be getting any valuable information,"" Wolf wrote. ""For as little as $60, a business can promote a page to Facebook users. It won't be long before your news feed is worthless."" Which, well, here we are. Not only that, but two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media, according to a recent Pew Research Center study, leaving traditional sources behind. 'RSS readers have not only survived in the era of social media, but are driving more and more attention back to themselves.' Victor Stankov, Inoreader The platformization of the web has claimed many victims, RSS readers included. Google Reader's 2013 demise was a major blow; the company offed it in favor of ""products to address each user's interest with the right information at the right time via the most appropriate means,"" as it Google executive Richard Gingras put it at the time. In other words, letting Google Now decide what you want. And the popular Digg Reader, which was born in response to that shuttering, closed its doors this week after a nearly four-year run. Despite those setbacks, though, RSS has persisted. ""I can't really explain it, I would have thought given all the abuse it's taken over the years that it would be stumbling a lot worse,"" says programmer Dave Winer, who helped create RSS. It owes that resilience in part thanks to social media burnout. Stankov says search traffic to Inoreader has nearly doubled since 2015, all organically. ""RSS readers have not only survived in the era of social media, but are driving more and more attention back to themselves, as people are realizing the pitfalls"" of relying too much on Facebook and others, Stankov says. RSS readers obviously have their own shortcomings as well. The firehose approach can easily overwhelm, especially when multiple outlets all publish the same news at the same time. There are various solutions to this; Stankov points to filtering tools that help you skip the things you don't care about, while Wolf says The Old Reader has experimented with tools to help highlight just one story when there are dozens of near-identicals. Different publishers also offer RSS feeds of varyingly helpful degrees. The New York Times and The Ringer, for instance, offer granular choices to help focus on the topics you care about, while others offer either only one big jumble or oddly sparse updates. Sites that publish infrequently can easily get lost in the mix. And multimedia elements sometimes don't cross the transom; FiveThirtyEight recently ran a fun, interactive trade war game that RSS couldn't parse. The readers all have settings to help cope with these issues to varying degrees, where possible; it's just a matter of how many hours you want to spend shaping your RSS bonsai. ""Social media has mass appeal because it is simple to understand and use, with little to no challenges involved for the user,"" says Stankov. ""RSS is whole different game, where the main goal is for the end user to research and find valuable information sources, as well as periodically clean up the news feed from irrelevant noise."" (Those who want a truly passive experience outside of Facebook and Twitter might look instead to aggregators like Apple News or Flipboard, or even Texture, which for $10 a month gives you full issues of dozens of magazine titles to flip through.) Even with minimal tweaking, though, returning to RSS this week offered up a few fun surprises I never would have seen otherwise: the Yankees getting in trouble for player beer-foam art; an American contending for the world chess championship; the latest on Ben Affleck's hilariously oversized back tattoo.

RSS Evolution While RSS readers offer a sanctuary from the algorithmic approach, they're also not opposed to using algorithms of their own, as they continue to evolve and regain relevance. That's not quite the conflict it might seem. ""Machines can have a big role in helping understand the information, so algorithms can be very useful, but for that they have to be transparent and the user has to feel in control,"" says Khodabakchian. ""What's missing today with the black-box algorithms is where they look over your shoulder, and don't trust you to be able to tell what's right."" With its focus on professional users, Feedly hopes AI can better connect users with niche experts. Wolf, too, touts AI as a way to better flag standout stories. ""I think algorithms are great,"" Wolf says. ""I think the problem is when the algorithms are run by advertising companies."" And despite Digg Reader's demise, new RSS tools continue to come online. Even Winer has re-entered the fray, this week introducing feedbase, a database of feeds that makes it easy to see what others subscribe to, ideally prompting discovery and an even more open approach. ""I thought it might be a good time to try to add an important feature to RSS that was always part of the vision, dynamic subscription lists,"" Winer says. Still, the lasting appeal of RSS remains the parts that haven't changed: the unfiltered view of the open web, and the chance to make your own decisions about what you find there. ""The most amazing thing to me about RSS is that no one really went away from it,"" says Wolf. ""It still exists. Somehow through all of this.

"Lisa Song, Patrick Michels, Al Shaw","Just after Christmas 2015, police showed up at the Starling Community Trailer Court in Arnold, Missouri, and told residents to get out. There was no time to stack sandbags, no time to pack. The big one was coming. The mobile home park backed onto a rising creek, where the oldest residents were closest to the threat. Sarah Quinn raced to help her grandmother and great-grandparents get to safety. They narrowly escaped the rushing Meramec River, which snakes around Arnold and other St. Louis suburbs on its way to meet the Mississippi. About 12 miles upstream, the Meramec climbed the steep banks of the city of Fenton and flowed across a road into the Riverside Golf Club, where Walt Wolfner was busy carting furniture and computers out of his clubhouse. He knew, because the course had flooded so often lately, that he and 20 workers would need two weeks to mop up the damage. Thirty miles farther up the Meramec, the river was creeping up on the town of Pacific, too. Devin Brundick and Felicia Ammann, a young couple who owned a small green bungalow beside the river, hurried to load their belongings into a friend’s truck. By the time the river crested, Wolfner’s clubhouse was under 11 feet of water, Brundick and Ammann’s bungalow was uninhabitable, and Quinn’s grandmother lost everything. “Her sofa, her chair, her deep freeze, washer, dryer, bed, mattress, all of it,” Quinn said. “All of her books that she’s collected over the years... nothing could be saved.” They were the lucky ones. The flood killed at least 20 people in the Midwest and broke records along the Meramec. It was a once-in-a-generation flood — or so they thought, until it happened again 16 months later. Only one city escaped the destruction. Valley Park, just upstream of Fenton, stayed dry during both floods, safe behind a ring of dirt and concrete — a $50 million levee designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. “It’s been wonderful,” said Valley Park resident Ryan McDougell. “The engineers that came in here and put the levee in, they did a great job. It sucks for the folks down below, because, I mean, this is going to happen every year.” When rivers flood now in the United States, the first towns to get hit are the unprotected ones right by the river. The last to go, if they flood at all, are the privileged few behind strong levees. While levees mostly are associated with large, low-lying cities such as New Orleans, a majority of the nation’s Corps-managed levees protect much smaller communities, rural farm towns and suburbs such as Valley Park. But why Valley Park? It wasn’t the biggest city or largest employer along the Meramec. Its neighboring towns all had homes and industry in harm’s way, too. But after almost a century of planning to protect all these communities, the federal government built a single 3-mile levee, shielding the low-lying area of just one town. Exploring why that happened offers a window into the nation’s flawed approach to controlling rivers, in which — an investigation by ProPublica and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found — life-and-death decisions are dictated less by sound science than by economics, politics and luck. Levees have been the nation’s most common method of flood control for much of U.S. history, despite a major drawback: Levees protect the land immediately behind them, but can make flooding worse for people nearby by cutting off a river’s ability to spread over the floodplain — the flat, low-lying land beside the river channel. This is a basic matter of physics and something the Corps has known since at least 1852, when a report it commissioned demonstrated that as levees confine a river to a narrower channel, they force water to flow higher and faster. A levee such as the one at Valley Park, on just one side of the Meramec, creates a traffic-jam effect that forces water higher on the opposite bank and upstream. Twenty-five years ago, before it built the Valley Park levee, the Corps predicted that saving the city would cause just a few extra inches of flooding in areas close by. But it reached that conclusion based on outdated models, without factoring in wild cards such as additional development and climate change that often exacerbate flooding. After building the levee, the Corps never measured its actual impact. Residents in Arnold, Fenton and Pacific weren’t just frustrated that they suffered repeated floods while Valley Park stayed dry. They blamed the levee for making the flooding worse. Their accusations echo claims from residents near other levees: A 2011 flood along Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River raised suspicions that a levee had pushed water into unprotected communities. In Louisiana, engineering consultants projected that a proposed levee extension would raise flooding by about an inch, but local reporters uncovered another study that predicted up to 8 inches — a finding that prompted a lawsuit. And a recent paper found levees have aggravated major floods on the Lower Mississippi River. People across the Meramec basin can only watch and wonder. Sitting in his new clubhouse, which he’s rebuilt twice since 2016, Wolfner peers out at the river and stews about the unfairness of it all. Besides the levee, what does Valley Park have that Fenton doesn’t? The Corps “could have bought out everybody in that area for that kind of money and never built the levee and not hurt all these people, not hurt guys like me,” he said. “Let the water go where it’s supposed to go.” “Seldom economically justified” The Army Corps of Engineers has a huge, complex job — reducing flood risk across the nation’s rivers and coasts and a requirement to do it in a way that benefits the country economically. To prioritize its resources, the Corps uses cost-benefit calculations. In practice, those formulas determine who gets flooded and who gets saved. They’re intended to bring some dispassionate reason to a contentious process. But the calculations favor highly valued property over less affluent communities. And the Corps has favored levee-building over nonstructural fixes such as buying out homes to create space for the river to spread out during a flood — practices that many experts say are more effective in the long run, but which the Corps concluded were “ seldom economically justified.” The Corps has used some version of these formulas along the Meramec since at least 1929, when it decided a reservoir held behind a dam was the best solution for controlling the wild, free-flowing river. Unlike a levee, which could push water into nearby towns, a reservoir would act as a valve, releasing water from the dam during droughts and storing extra water during floods. The plan might have eliminated flooding for everyone along 33 miles of the Lower Meramec, from the mouth of the river to the city of Eureka, 12 miles upstream of Valley Park. But for decades, the Corps’ math said the land that would be protected wasn’t valuable enough to justify the cost of building a dam. By the 1960s, the area’s population had grown large enough for the Corps to reconsider the reservoir. But by then, the plan had attracted opposition from special interests, including business owners around a nearby lake who didn’t want to compete for tourists and environmentalists who believed rivers ought to flow freely. Jimmy Carter campaigned for the presidency with a promise to block big, wasteful federal water projects. The Meramec dam was among the targets of a 1977 “ hit list ” he released as president. The fate of the reservoir was put to a rare public referendum among voters in St. Louis and a dozen counties along the Meramec in 1978. The Corps already had bought thousands of acres and started building a visitor center when the vote showed that nearly two-thirds opposed the project. Congress formally deauthorized the reservoir in 1981. The following year, the Meramec unleashed one of its worst floods on record, rising so suddenly that first responders rescued residents in the dark as the river inundated Valley Park. The flooding killed six people and caused more than $100 million in damage. In the small community of Times Beach, residents cleared out, abandoning that land to the river. At the time, Walt Wolfner was in high school and already the manager of his father’s golf course in Fenton. With the course submerged, Wolfner’s father began a tradition that Wolfner continues today: jotting down the height of the Meramec from nearby stream gauges along with its impact on the course. He logged the river’s height in Valley Park at 39.73 feet. Beside it, he wrote, “5 1/2 [feet] water in clubhouse.” The Corps had orders from Congress to solve the flooding on the Meramec, along with a budget of $20 million, or about $54 million in 2018 dollars. The fix had to be economically sound, Congress said, and it could not include “any dams or reservoirs.” In a report released in 1987, the Corps outlined plans to protect more than a dozen communities with levees and other solutions — and then discarded all but a few of those plans because their costs outweighed the projected benefits. The 6-mile riverfront of Fenton was among the places the Corps decided a levee would be too expensive. In Arnold, the Corps considered buying out low-lying houses and trailer homes — including in the Starling Community Trailer Court, where Sarah Quinn’s grandmother was flooded out in 2015. This proposal also failed the test. The city of 19,000 was the largest in the area and vulnerable on two fronts, from floods rushing down the Meramec and from high water backing up from the Mississippi. The Corps calculated that it could buy out the riskiest homes for $5 million. But the properties weren’t worth enough to justify that, the agency decided. The process is “always driven by property values, for better or worse,” said Leonard Shabman, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution, who studies federal cost-benefit formulas. “The analyses that get done may favor those with higher incomes.” Valley Park had hundreds of homes and valuable public services — its police station, fire station, city hall and schools — in the lowest part of the floodplain. The Corps figured it would be worth protecting them all with an $11.8 million levee. The Corps recommended two solutions in addition to the levee: a buyout for a low-lying mobile home park in Eureka and an improved flood warning system across the region. But these were stymied by a new law, backed by environmentalists and the Reagan administration, which added another condition: The Corps had to find a local funding partner for these projects. Only city leaders in Valley Park were willing to pay their share, $3.7 million, to clinch the deal to put a levee between the Meramec and their city of 3,200 people. Over the years, the $11.8 million price tag, which the Corps had so carefully figured into its cost-benefit calculations, began to climb. A Corps spokeswoman cited multiple reasons, including cleanup of contaminated soil found during construction and lawsuits from landowners in the levee’s path who didn’t want to sell their property to make room. In 2000, Congress passed a bill that funded the levee at $35 million. In 2003, federal lawmakers upped the funding to $50 million. Valley Park was on the hook for a quarter of the cost as it grew. Still, its support did not waver. The city issued a series of bonds and diverted tax revenue to pay for the levee, at one point prompting a lawsuit from its school district over lost tax money. The final price for the city was just over $13 million — more than the entire project was supposed to cost. The Corps’ original reservoir solution for the Meramec would have protected more than a dozen communities. The estimated cost of that dam in 1929 was $6.6 million, an amount equivalent to roughly $70 million by the time Valley Park got its $50 million levee. Instead, the Corps had its hands tied so tightly over the decades that all it could build was a single levee, benefiting one small city. “It’s not going to affect anything” From Valley Park, the levee’s slope resembles the inside of a grassy bowl, around 20 feet tall. Water caught behind the levee is guided out of the city by a system of drain pipes. Steel gates let traffic in and out through several road and railroad crossings. When the Meramec begins to rise, the gates close and seal off Valley Park from the wall of water. When the levee was designed in 1993, the Corps’ hydraulic modeling software demonstrated it would increase flooding upstream by less than 5 inches during a 100-year flood (a flood that has a 1 percent chance of occurring each year) and only within a few miles of Valley Park — not far enough to reach Eureka or Pacific. It had put the average yearly cost of flooding created by the levee at $7,200 in 1987, or $16,000 in 2018 dollars. “The Army Corps of Engineers, before they built the levee, they were having meetings and telling everybody, ‘No, no, this levee’s not going to hurt anything. It’s not going to affect anything,’” Walt Wolfner said. “And they basically, in our minds, lied to us.” In reality, the Corps could not say with certainty that the levee wouldn’t contribute to additional flooding in the future, because its calculations left out how key variables could change over time. The first of those factors is development. The Corps built the levee tall enough to protect against a 100-year flood, a height that offered an additional perk: Valley Park residents no longer had to buy costly federal flood insurance. With a levee to protect the city, the Corps calculated that rising land values in Valley Park and administrative savings in the flood insurance program would create nearly $100,000 in annual benefits, about $225,000 today. That number helped bolster the case for the levee in the Corps’ cost-benefit analysis. But even though the Corps anticipated that the levee would prompt growth in the area worth $15 million per year, it didn’t expect the flood damage to grow, too. Valley Park’s population has more than doubled since the 1980s, to 6,900. And between 1980 and 2010, the combined population of Arnold, Fenton, Valley Park, Eureka and Pacific increased nearly 50 percent. Tim Engelmeyer, Valley Park’s city attorney, said critics in the region are unduly fixated on the levee, but any Meramec community that allowed development since 1993 has “brought some of this on themselves.” Since 1993, growth in the floodplain includes extensions of several Fenton subdivisions and hundreds of new residential lots scattered across unincorporated St. Louis County between Pacific and Arnold, an analysis of county tax parcel data and Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance maps shows. By taking up space that would otherwise hold water during a flood, new buildings inside the floodplain drive the river higher. For people living nearby, those extra inches of water can mean the difference between soggy front yards and replacing the furniture, carpet and walls in the first floors of their homes. “You put a stone into a bucket of water, it’s going to raise the level of water,” said Devin Brundick, the owner of that little green house in Pacific. Now, every time he drives past new construction sites in the floodplain, he envisions the river near his home rising another fraction of an inch. “The real estate’s cheap because it’s in a floodplain,” he said, and local governments like the tax revenue from new development. “So far, no one’s been held accountable.” Development outside the floodplain, on higher ground, worsens flooding in a different way. As the suburbs sprawl across open land, soil that might have absorbed rainfall is paved over, sending water rushing faster toward the river and creating more frequent floods. Some of this is driven by Valley Park subdivisions built after 1993, near two small creeks that funnel runoff straight into the Meramec. Phillip Eydmann, a retired engineer with the Corps who helped design the Valley Park levee, said conditions along the river have changed since 1993. “We are encroaching on the rivers more and more and increasing the runoff,” he said. “Those (flood) heights are probably going to go up.” The second variable is climate change. It was a fairly new concept for federal policymakers in the early 1990s, but by the time the levee was complete, scientists were highly confident that human-driven climate change would affect rainfall all over the country. There’s now a consensus that rainstorms across the Midwest are intensifying, dumping more water into the Upper Mississippi basin. Researchers and regulators generally calculate future flood patterns based on a river’s past behavior. But climate change makes everything more unpredictable. The Corps now considers climate change in some of its flood planning, but an Obama-era executive order that might have strengthened its approach was rescinded last year by President Donald Trump. The Corps never updated its 1993 calculations or checked them for accuracy — not when the levee was finished in 2005, nor when the levee held back its first big flood in 2008 or after the larger, more recent floods. The Corps used widely available modeling software of the early 1990s. The technology’s ability to accurately model how rivers behave has significantly improved since then. John Boeckmann, an engineer for the Corps’ St. Louis District and chief of its hydrologic engineering section, said he still stands by the Corps’ 1993 calculations. Any flooding coming from the levee is localized and “is not affecting other communities upstream,” he said. “We’re confident what was done then is sound science and good engineering.” When ProPublica and Reveal asked the Corps whether it ever checks its predictions of levee-induced flooding against more recent data, a spokesman from agency headquarters in Washington said the “verification process that you describe is not a practice that (the Corps) uses.” As a result, levees that are meant to last for decades, even a century, are built based on maps and modeling technology from another era. “Thanks for the water, Valley Park” The Valley Park levee met its first test when floods tore through the Midwest in spring 2008. One bar owner told reporters that she was so confident in the new levee that she hadn’t bothered to pick up her computer off the floor. “It’s a 100-year event, and it’s a 100-year levee,” Army Corps of Engineers Col. Lewis Setliff declared. “It got tested, and it passed.” But upstream in Pacific, the mood was grim. More than 200 buildings flooded. Then-Mayor Herbert Adams urged federal officials to provide a levee or some other protection for communities along the Meramec. And at least one resident wasted no time assigning blame. A hand-lettered sign outside a flooded home read, “Thanks for the water, Valley Park.” The record floods in 2015 and 2017 only fed the suspicions in neighboring towns. Was the levee to blame? The Corps defended its work with a fact sheet citing its calculations from 1993, but no new data. “The levee does not increase flood heights anywhere downstream of Valley Park,” the agency declared. In fact, the Corps isn’t sure of the levee’s effect. John Boeckmann, the Corps engineer, said development in the area makes it hard to assess. “It’s really hard to isolate the effects of a single item,” he said. “So much has changed.” Checking the agency’s estimates against the levee’s actual impact would require additional funding from Congress, likely hundreds of thousands of dollars for a detailed model. And there’s a question of fairness, Boeckmann said: If one community got a special study, every other flooded town near a levee would want one, too. The St. Louis District alone has more than 70 levees, so the costs soon would add up to millions of dollars. Jonathan Remo, a professor at Southern Illinois University who’s spent his career studying Midwestern floods, said the Corps has no incentive to verify whether its original flooding predictions still hold. Scientifically speaking, it’s a good idea to check those numbers, given how modeling software and local conditions have changed since 1993, he said. Such a study could even help the Corps make better predictions. But there are built-in disincentives for the Corps to prove its own work was wrong, Remo said. If the Corps found that the water levels have risen more than it estimated, it wouldn’t just make the agency look bad, he said. It could expose the agency to litigation. Anne Jefferson, a geology professor at Kent State University, said it all comes down to funding priorities. “There’s a lot of money to build things,” she said, but “nobody wants to put up the money to watch and see what happens” afterward. “It’s really about what we want to spend money on as a nation.” Researchers say this is a common problem in science and engineering. Whether it’s verifying levee models or doing long-term monitoring in ecological restoration, funding for initial projects dwarfs what’s available for follow-up research. The federal government has the tools to get a much better picture of how levees worsen flooding, for a fraction of the cost of a comprehensive model. The U.S. Geological Survey, a scientific agency that monitors natural hazards, operates stream gauges that measure the flow of water in rivers. In 2011, two scientists used stream gauges next to or directly upstream of levees to examine water heights during floods, as well as flow rates — the amount of water rushing past the gauge each second. The higher the flow rate, the larger the flood. The scientists studied 13 levees in the Midwest, compiling these two measurements before and after the levees were built. They wanted to see whether floods with similar flow rates produced different flood heights before and after levee construction. They found that in all 13 cases, for floods of the same flow rate, water heights post-levee were higher than pre-levee — in one instance by more than 5 feet. Co-author Nicholas Pinter, an earth science professor at the University of California, Davis, said the study used real-world data to show what actually happened during floods, instead of relying on a model of what “should” happen. Scientists say stream gauges near every levee could serve as a warning system, indicating which levees worsen flooding and delivering a reality check on the Corps’ design predictions. But the Geological Survey and other agencies have struggled to maintain their network of gauges. Due to tight budgets, the Geological Survey said only 73 percent of the gauges it considers essential for monitoring rivers are operational today. And because they are designed to track flooding, not the effects of levees, many gauges are far from levees, and some don’t track flow rates at all, making them useless for these calculations. Bob Criss, an earth science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, tried to do a stream gauge analysis for Valley Park, but the limitations of the gauges led him astray. He co-wrote a paper on the 2015 flood and called it a “ man-made disaster.” It blamed the levee and other upstream development for raising water levels at Eureka a foot higher than they should have been. What Criss didn’t realize — and what ProPublica and Reveal have only recently discovered — is that the underlying data was flawed because the Geological Survey had moved the stream gauge several months before the flood, without flagging the change in the data. Correcting that data made the extra height disappear. Whatever the impact from the Valley Park levee and nearby development, it wasn’t great enough to reach the Eureka gauge. It’s also impossible to use gauges to measure flooding from the Valley Park levee, because the gauge next to the levee measures only water heights. The Geological Survey acknowledged this shortcoming to reporters after the 2008 flood. In 2015, the river at Valley Park rose higher than it had in 1982 — but without knowing the flow rate, it’s impossible to tell whether the extra height was the natural result of a bigger flood or whether the levee and new development were partially responsible for pushing the water higher. A Geological Survey spokeswoman said the agency could improve the Valley Park gauge to collect flow rates, but it would require extra measurements and calculations with “a much higher cost.” There’s also been some debate about whether the levee was built too high, which would contribute to additional flooding. Six months after the Criss paper, a separate report found that the levee must have been higher than its authorized height, because at the 100-year-flood level, it would have been submerged in 2015, which would have lowered the water level in nearby towns. The report was funded by the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, which had hired a local engineering firm to measure the height of the levee at several locations. Remo, the Southern Illinois professor, said it’s hard to prove the levee was built too high because the Corps gives itself a lot of leeway on this front. When the agency designed the levee, it modeled the size of the 100-year flood at Valley Park and found the baseline levee height needed to hold back that flood. Then the Corps added an extra 3 feet to the levee design for safety and up to 4 feet more to account for how the levee might settle over time. That meant the levee was built up to 7 feet higher than the elevation of the 100-year flood. For Valley Park, the added height makes it virtually certain that the city will be protected from a major flood, even if its flow rate is larger than what the Corps calculated in 1993. On the flip side, every extra inch of the levee above the baseline height increases the possibility of passing more damage on to Valley Park’s neighbors. Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said Valley Park should shoulder more of the responsibility for making sure its levee doesn’t harm its neighbors. Most federal levees are maintained by local levee districts, and it’s up to them to ensure the structure stays up to date with changing flood patterns and regulations. But few local governments have the expertise or funding to check the Corps’ calculations. And just like the Army Corps, they have little incentive to do anything that might indicate their levees are piling extra harm onto surrounding communities. Tim Engelmeyer, the Valley Park city attorney, said it’s unrealistic to expect a “little town of 7,000” to handle a complex modeling update. U.S. Geological Survey scientists also have proposed a sophisticated computer model that would do what the Corps says it cannot: conclusively demonstrate the levee’s impact on the region. The model, said Geological Survey hydrologist Paul Rydlund Jr., would consider the Meramec Valley as it looked in the 1930s, then slowly add in the development over time: bridges, neighborhoods, the levee. Rydlund said he hopes such a study could help people on the river understand its changing behavior. So far, the Geological Survey has raised $50,000 of the $365,000 it needs to build the model. Lately, the agency has been asking local officials to help. “You’re on your own” The 2015 and 2017 floods were a clear reminder that, after almost a century of work by the Army Corps, most communities on the Meramec remain exposed to flooding. With $350,000 from Congress, the Corps has commenced another study of the same volatile river. The agency partnered with local governments, including Pacific, Arnold and Fenton; federal and state agencies; and other organizations to produce a report it calls a “blueprint” for reducing flood risk. Hal Graef, a project manager for the Corps’ St. Louis District, said it will focus on nonstructural solutions such as buyouts and raising home foundations. John Boeckmann, the Corps engineer, said the initiative is not about the Valley Park levee. A fact sheet from the agency attributes flooding to “increased frequency of heavy rainfall and severe storms, geology, topography, development, storm water runoff, and loss of wetlands and open space.” Part of the effort involved public meetings and surveys asking for feedback. Officials had received 38 responses as of late June. Some urged limits on floodplain development or blamed the levee for aggravating flooding. Others wanted more levees along the Meramec. One respondent, who seemed aware of previous plans to build a reservoir, wrote: “Stop building all levees anywhere on the Meramec River. Stop all development in the Meramec floodway or floodplain. Build a dam in the Upper Meramec.” The final report is due in November 2019. After that, it will be up to the communities to follow the recommendations. Graef said the report will list potential funding sources. The Corps will not have authority to force anyone to adopt the ideas, nor will there necessarily be guaranteed funding for them. The agency already is stretched thin. Only about 2 percent of the Corps’ authorized construction projects get funded each year. And although the Corps is building far fewer levees than it did in the mid-1900s, the agency is on the hook for an aging network that costs billions to maintain and keeps getting hit by natural disasters. There is no indication it will get more support under the Trump administration. Small-government advocates long have called for removing civil works from the Corps, and in June, the administration released a plan that would do just that: Strip the Corps of its flood control responsibilities and reassign the job to the Department of Transportation and Department of the Interior. A shift like that would add a new layer of uncertainty to the Corps’ future. Flood victims around Valley Park don’t have the luxury of waiting for a government fix. Last year, Walt Wolfner tore down the half-century-old clubhouse that took on 11 feet of water in the 2015 flood. In its footprint, he built a new one, accessible by stairs and an elevator, 14 feet above the ground. “You’re on your own,” Wolfner said. “It’s every man for himself.” Sarah Quinn moved away from Arnold after the 2017 flood, but she often visits her grandmother at the Starling Community Trailer Court. “Anytime we’re together in the car driving over the bridge, I see her peering over the river,” Quinn said. “If it rains too much, she’ll go back into the woods and check the creek. She will not admit that she’s nervous, but she does not want to go through it again. I don’t think anybody would.” Four months after the 2015 flood, Devin Brundick and Felicia Ammann set about elevating their home in Pacific. They had an 8-foot concrete foundation poured, then had a crane pick up their little green house and set it on top. It was another year before they could move back in. Brundick is a carpenter, and when he has time at home, he works on finishing repairs. “We’ve got a slop sink in our kitchen and I got a bunch of wire shelving for storage space, so that’s pretty rough,” Brundick said. “Most people, I don’t think, would feel like they’re actually in a house. We just call it glamping.” The way this area has flooded since they bought the house, Brundick and Ammann doubt they’ll make money selling the home the way they’d planned — even from its new perch. Their corner of town is full of signs of how other people are making their own plans to weather the future: old homes parked high up on fresh concrete foundations and others sitting low to the ground, newly abandoned.

Matt Fuller,"WASHINGTON ― Six months late and about 17 hours after they first introduced the bill, House lawmakers on Thursday approved a 2,232-page spending bill that will fund the federal government until October and prevent an imminent shutdown. The massive omnibus spending deal was the culmination of months of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. Congress has passed five continuing resolutions since September to extend government operations and allow lawmakers more time to negotiate this deal. The House passed the bill 256-167, with 144 Republicans and 112 Democrats voting yes, and 91 Republicans and 76 Democrats voting no. Under a previous agreement to lift spending caps, the $1.3 trillion deal increases defense spending by $80 billion and non-defense spending by $63 billion for this fiscal year. The military gets a 2.4 percent pay raise, while civilian personnel get a 1.9 percent bump. President Donald Trump gets some $1.6 billion for border security measures, although not necessarily for the “wall” he has long promised. Instead, the bill provides $251 million for secondary fencing, $445 million for levee fencing, $196 million for “primary pedestrian fencing” and $445 million for the replacement of existing fencing, a ccording to The Washington Post. The legislation specifically prohibits Trump from making any of the wall prototypes designed last year. The bill provides funding for a number of infrastructure projects ― including the New York-New Jersey Gateway program, a rail project for the New York City area. Trump fought hard not to simply fund that project, believing he could negotiate money for his wall with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in exchange for Gateway spending. But ultimately the New York-area lawmakers who wanted the project won. The legislation also includes the so-called Fix NICS measure, which tightens up the system for reporting criminal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. And the bill corrects a “grain glitch” in the GOP tax law that gave farmer-owned cooperatives a significant tax benefit over other agricultural corporations. In exchange for that adjustment, Democrats got an expansion of a low-income housing credit. The process that produced the spending bill was the exact sort of backroom dealing that Trump railed against in his election. Key lawmakers kept details of the legislation private for months, and then they sprung the text of the measure on other members a little after 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Shortly before 1 p.m. Thursday, the House was voting on the legislation, meaning it was impossible for any of those other lawmakers to have read the bill in its entirety before the vote. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he tried to stay up all night to read the bill. “As fast as I was reading it, there’s no way they read it,” Meadows said, noting that he reached the 700s pages of the 2,232-page bill. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) also made a theatrical show of the bill, holding up the massive stack of pages and saying he was waiting for “the tea party who harangued me and my party” about reading the bill. “Is there no shame?” Hoyer asked. “Is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed?” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused her GOP colleagues of attempting to speed through the process and get out of town before the big march for gun control in Washington on Saturday. Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), another Freedom Caucus member, also criticized the process, claiming that congressional leaders had planned a two-week recess just before this vote so they could pressure other lawmakers into supporting the bill. “It’s why I’m leaving Congress,” Labrador said, who is instead running for governor of Idaho. “These people have no shame. And they’ll say whatever to get elected. But I think the American people deserve better than this.”",Lawmakers only got the full text of the massive bill a little after 8 p.m. on Wednesday.,2018-03-22T17:05:59Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}","House Passes 2,232-Page Spending Bill To Avoid Another Government Shutdown",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-passes-omnibus-spending-bill_us_5ab3d43ce4b0decad047c736,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab3d4c21f00002d0016b2b3.jpeg?cache=SpiWFivzop&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suzanne LaBarre,"The Netherlands is a common case study– and top exporter –of coastal resiliency. And for good reason: Catastrophic floods have threatened the country for centuries, a technical and social challenge that the Dutch have learned to live with over the years. In the flood-prone city of Nijmegen–one of the country’s oldest towns sited along the Waal River–water levels can rise more than 12 feet in a span of 5 to 12 days each year, according to Michel Schreinemachers, a partner at NEXT Architects. That variance is what inspired the firm, in collaboration with H+N+S Landscape Architects, to design the Zalige footbridge with a subversive and dynamic presence. [Photo: Jan Daanen/courtesy NEXT Architects] Originally commissioned as part of Room for the River, a nationwide, government-sponsored series of infrastructure projects designed to better accommodate flooding, NEXT was tasked with creating a bypass off the northern bank of the Waal that would access a new recreational island within an urban river park. The program, budget, and site were all set in stone–but rather than devising a way to forgo the city’s floodplain, the architects built the walkway to coexist directly within it. “Bridges are part of the broader landscape or urban fabric. They connect to the different issues that are at play in a given location,” says Schreinemachers, who specializes in infrastructure and also designed the Lucky Knot bridge in Changsha, China. “In the case of the Zalige bridge, it is about our relation to water.” When the water level rises, the bridge’s concrete-block pavers become partially submerged, making the walk across a bit like a game of hopscotch. It’s a playful design crafted for user experience, in which the visitor is made to pause, note, and even appreciate the water level. “It was important to design something that would strengthen people’s experience of the environment in a positive way,” adds the architect, particularly for the residents of Nijmegen, which evacuated a quarter of a million people in the wake of a flood in January 1995. The Zalige, which has been open since March 2016, faced its biggest test last week. As the city anticipated its highest water level in 15 years, the bridge’s fully submerged blocks became a point of excitement and conversation among locals. “Hundreds of people came out to see and walk over the stepping stones. People are eager to use the bridge,” says Schreinemachers–apparently, even when instructed not to. “Due to the high water, authorities had closed off the area with a fence and a sign of no entry. People just made their way past it on their own risk because they really wanted to experience the landscape and the high water from the bridge. We succeeded in making something that really speaks to people’s imagination.” The project is yet another case study demonstrating how the Dutch have learned to adapt and live with water, emphasizing public engagement in the process. Along the 85-year-old Afsluitdijk levee, which stretches 20 miles along the Dutch coastline, creatives are using its current renovation as an opportunity to present a public showcase of artworks that frame the structure as a “smart landscape.” “Living with water is not seen as a struggle with nature anymore,” says Schreinemachers. “The idea that keeping water out is the only thing we need to do is losing ground in favor of an approach whereby the water is welcomed, brought in, and given more space.”",The Zalige Bridge by NEXT Architects plays with the notion of walking on water–a practical idea in the age of climate change.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","The album cover for 'The Chronic' by Dr. Dre. (Photo: NONE) Twenty-five years ago, hip hop changed forever. After a surly split from Compton rap group N.W.A and Ruthless Records, Dr. Dre released his solo debut The Chronic on Dec. 15, 1992. In sheer numbers alone, the album was a phenomenon: winning one Grammy Award, spawning three top-40 singles and peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, where it spent eight months in the chart's top 10. Since then, its imprint on modern MCs has become undeniable: Kanye West himself said in Rolling Stone that it's ""the hip-hop equivalent to Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life. It’s the benchmark you measure your album against if you’re serious.” Kendrick Lamar, too, told Complex it was the first rap album growing up he remembers ""playing in the house from top to bottom,"" and later gushed to Variety that lead single Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang contains the greatest single verse of all time. So why have fans and artists alike continued coming back to The Chronic ? In short, it's an album that solidified Dre's place as one of rap's master storytellers, while also moving the needle forward for West Coast hip hop. Much of gangsta rap until that time was characterized by abrasive, rock-inspired beats, echoing the frequently violent lyrics they accompanied. But with The Chronic, Dr. Dre helped popularize the subgenre known as G-funk — rapping over slower, bass- and synth-laden grooves, and favoring live instruments over samples. And the samples he did use reflected a more soulful sensibility: incorporating the bluesy opening drums of Led Zeppelin's When the Levee Breaks into Lyrical Gangbang, and James Brown's Funky Drummer in Let Me Ride. With that, verses also took on a more laid-back, lyrical cadence that came to define commercial West Coast hip hop. That's no more evident than on hypnotic party anthem Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang featuring Snoop Dogg, who appeared on 11 of the album's 16 tracks, and quickly established himself as rap's weed-smoking poster child. ( The Chronic, after all, is named for high-grade marijuana and pays homage to Zig Zag rolling papers with its cover.) In addition to Snoop, the album introduced hip-hop fans to Dre's deep bench of collaborators including Nate Dogg, Warren G, RBX and Lady of Rage — the latter of whom appeared on the record's most admittedly tasteless skit, The Doctor's Office, in which Dre feigns having sex with a ""patient."" The misogyny of this and B****** Ain't S*** are particularly uncomfortable to revisit in 2017, given the current outcry against sexual harassment and the rapper's public admission of beating women as a young man. But other The Chronic cuts like Little Ghetto Boy and The Day the N***** Took Over should be applauded for their searing commentary on poverty, police brutality and being black in America — a torch he carried from his F*** Tha Police days with N.W.A, and no doubt helped to inspire the scores of socially conscious rappers in present-day hip hop. Dre went on to release two more albums — 1991's 2001 and 2015's Compton — and exert his influence behind the scenes. As a formidable producer and label head of both Death Row Records and Aftermath Entertainment he's groomed talent such as Eminem, Tupac Shakur and 50 Cent. And more recently with Jimmy Iovine, he co-founded headphone giant Beats Electronics and struck a multi-billion dollar deal to sell it to Apple. But his greatest contribution to music will always be The Chronic, which still feels as vital and revolutionary as it did a half century ago.

Tristan Greene,"Robots are going to take your job and there’s nothing you can do about it. You need look no further than the trucking industry to find the writing on the wall, but what do we do when robots are better at the jobs we need? One solution is to give them the work and us the paychecks. A universal basic income (UBI), wherein government provides a monthly stipend so citizens can afford a home and basic necessities, is something experts believe would directly address the issue of unemployment and poverty, and possibly even eliminate hundreds of other welfare programs. It may also be the only real solution to the impending automation bonanza. There are, of course, detractors. AI expert Steve Fuller last month told Futurism : Universal basic income, at the end of the day, is an idea that made sense in an older era, one where we imagined a strong state that would actually take control of the population and feel responsible for it, as a result of increasing productivity and so forth. Yet experiments going on in Canada and Finland with UBI actually seem to be paying off, so what gives? According to Fuller the problem is, giving people money when they lose jobs won’t fix the issue, it’s a temporary solution and we need permanent ones. Sounds fair, and he even has some ideas on how to accomplish this end: We could hold Google and Facebook and all those big multinationals accountable; we could make sure that people, like those who are currently ‘voluntarily’ contributing their data to pump up companies’ profits, are given something that is adequate to support their livelihoods in exchange. It’s an interesting idea, but difficult to imagine it’s implementation. If the government isn’t assigning a specific stipend value, we’ll have to be compensated individually by companies. One way to do this, is by emulating the old coal mining company scrip scams of early last century. Employees working for companies would be paid in currency only redeemable at the company store. This basically created a system where a company could tax its own workers for profit. Google, for example, could use a system like that and say “opt-in for $10 worth of Google Play music for free,” if they wanted to. Which doesn’t help pay the bills when machines replace you at work, but at least you’ll be able to voice search for your favorite songs. Another idea is to charge companies an automation tax, but again there’s concerns as to how this would be implemented. What if your startup plans to launch without employees, using automation for tasks traditionally done by humans? What if your company automated before the automation tax? A solution that combines government oversight with a tax on AI companies — a UBI funded by the dividends of our data — may be the best option. To be blunt: we should make Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other such AI companies pay for it with a simple data tax. In the US we could levee a specific percentage of all advertising revenue leveraged from data extracted by algorithms, for example, to fund programs that provide a stipend for displaced workers or simply for the impoverished. Let’s be clear here: the vast majority of us haven’t the slightest clue as to the sheer jaw-dropping amount of data these companies already have on us. The reason Google and Facebook can get away with it is because we’re all willing to consider our data an even trade for the ability to use Search and Messenger for free. It’s not an even trade though, you need only view those companies’ value on the stock market to understand that. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are all on the short list of companies which will likely hit a trillion dollar valuation, and each that does will do so on the back of AI technology. Those outfits can afford to help subsidize the unemployment they’ll share the responsibility for causing.","Robots are going to take your job and there’s nothing you can do about it.

PHOENIX President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he will return to the U.S.-Mexico border in three weeks to tout the construction of his promised border wall, his signature campaign promise. 
Details about the trip his fifth to the southwestern U.S. border as president are still unclear.
Trump offered little other information when he made the announcement during a briefing about drug trafficking at the border.
""We're going to have a news conference at the border over the next three weeks,"" Trump said. ""We're going to do it in areas where we're building large stretches of wall."" 
The White House declined to release any additional details, although there are only a few areas along the U.S.-Mexico border with ongoing or upcoming construction projects in the next few weeks to replace or build new physical barriers.
Those locations, according to the projects that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has announced so far, are: San Diego, where CBP is replacing 14 miles of secondary fencing; the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where crews are clearing land for the first of 14 miles of new levee walls; and in Yuma, where construction is slated to begin in April to replace 14 miles of fencing.
Trump's most recent visit to the border was on Feb. 11, when he held his first re-election rally in El Paso, Texas. He was there for just a few hours and did not tour any of the border-enforcement facilities, although the location of his rally was within view of the border fence separating El Paso from Ciudad Juarez.
But his most high-profile visit was to San Diego on March 13, 2018, to tour eight border-wall prototypes, which have since been demolished.
Trump previously had visited the Rio Grande Valley on Jan. 10, where he met with troops deployed to the border, and a military base in Yuma on Aug. 22, 2017, on his way to Phoenix.
During the short portion of Wednesday's drug-trafficking briefing that was made public, Trump talked about the danger that drugs coming over the border especially hard drugs like fentanyl posed for Americans.
That's one of his main justifications for declaring a national emergency on Feb. 15 in order to free up $8 billion for the construction of a border wall, which he again claimed would help stem the flow of drugs.
As he has in the past, Trump once again contradicted his own administration's statistics and analysis showing that the vast majority of hard drugs are smuggled and caught at the ports of entry, which would not be impacted by the wall construction.
""We have tremendous amounts of technology going into the ports of entry, where a lot of the drugs come in,"" Trump said. ""But I think it's highly overrated.
""I think much of the drugs, the big loads of drugs and certainly the human traffickers go, not through the ports of entry, they go to the open areas where they don't have walls,"" he added, although he offered no evidence to back those claims.
Eight prototypes of Donald Trump's border wall between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico were demolished Wednesday. A large hydraulic jackhammer pounded the concrete and steel panels until the slabs fell into small clouds of dust. (Feb 26)

Trump also touted the investment of millions of dollars in technology at the ports of entry, which he said would stop drug trafficking. However, Customs and Border Protection has routinely pointed out the ever-changing methods smugglers try to get drugs through the border crossings.
On Jan. 26, customs officers working at the Mariposa commercial crossing in Nogales discovered 254 pounds of fentanyl hidden in a shipment of cucumbers. That's the largest fentanyl seizure ever made at any port or border crossing. 
Customs officers used an X-ray machine to detect hidden compartments in the floor of the tractor-trailer; a canine officer then detected the odor of the drugs inside.
Trump said that investments in technology at the ports of entry would only work if they are complemented with the construction of his long-promised border wall.
He added that later this week, his administration would announce another major contract for the construction of additional physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Since the start of Trump's presidency, construction crews have completed the replacement of more than 26 miles of border fencing in three separate projects totaling $113 million.
Two others projects are currently ongoing, including the start of construction for new levee-wall fencing in areas that previously didn't have any. Work is also slated to begin on three additional projects in the coming months.

Nicole Gallucci,"In the emotional days following the November 2016 election that put President Donald Trump in power, no one had any idea they might find a shred of solace in words scribbled on a mundane office supply. But underground, in the depths of a New York City subway station, a powerfully expressive initiative fueled by thousands of Post-it Notes was underway. In the weeks that followed, thousands of people in search of catharsis paused their commutes to write down rejuvenating messages of hope, solidarity, and reassurance and stick them to the walls for all to read. Soon a colorful mosaic of an estimated 50,000 Post-its, now known as the Subway Therapy project, spanned the walls of Manhattan's Union Square station. It was a simple act during an especially dark time, but the colorful collection of Post-its helped the country's outlook seem a little bit brighter. SEE ALSO: NYC's 'Subway Therapy' wall is transformed into a brilliant interactive holiday card For nearly 40 years, Post-its have been a go-to resource for annotating documents, writing to-do lists, and leaving reminders. But somewhere along the line people around the world realized just how multi-functional the sticky squares could be. Image: Vanessa Carvalho/Brazil Photo Press/LatinContent/Getty Images In pop culture, Post-its have been used for infamous break ups and vow writing, and in the real world, people use them to pull pranks, make grand romantic gestures, create art, and even mourn lost icons like Apple's Steve Jobs. In the past few years, sticky notes have also been used to aid in something far more impactful: peaceful protest. The power of post-election Post-its I first spotted the Subway Therapy Wall on Thursday, Nov. 10, my first day back in the Union Square station since the Nov. 8 election. Happening upon the words of complete strangers simple messages like, ""Your emotions are valid,"" and ""We need each other,"" was a reminder that goodness still existed. And after talking to others who contributed to or encountered the wall, it's clear I wasn't alone. ""I was in a state of shock,"" said 23-year-old Chelsea from Yakima, Washington (who preferred not to share her last name,) recalling how she felt in the days after the election. ""It felt as if the floor had been pulled from underneath me like I was going through the five stages of grief simultaneously."" ""I could write anything I wanted and not have to worry about feeling alone."" In an attempt to do something productive with her negative feelings, Chelsea traveled New York City for the first time. ""I actually stumbled upon the wall without even knowing it existed,"" she said. ""That moment when I looked up from what I was doing and I saw that wall filled with those colorful bits of paper was indescribable. It was as if I could see the strings connecting everybody in their need for change. It was a therapy session that was free and I could write anything I wanted and not have to worry about feeling alone."" The 14th street subway has a thing called subway therapy and u express yourself on a post it note and put it on the wall. It was incredible. pic.twitter.com/3k3NRpTdDq chelsea lately (@chelsea_rane) December 5, 2016 Chelsea read as many notes as she could, absorbed the messages, and says she finally felt like things might be alright. ""Those pieces of paper were tiny messages to us as humans that we can be change. If we try hard enough."" ""To see it manifested in one place was viscerally powerful."" ""It was a coming together of strangers across the country who wanted to make a simple statement that this is wrong and not normal, and we don't need to accept it,"" Sarah Flourance, a 31-year-old from Alexandria, Virginia said. Flourance, who traveled to New York to visit a friend after the election in hopes that it would lift her mood, said she spoke with a few strangers at the wall, some of whom were in tears. ""Right after the election, the isolation is what got to me and a lot of other people,"" she said. She felt the display helped ease her feelings of hopelessness. Kevin Nadal, psychologist and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center at City University of New York says he also contributed a Post-it to the wall. He wrote a message of solidarity to ""the most marginalized populations whose rights would be threatened"" by Trump's rise to the presidency, and said the expansive unity of strangers helped restore hope for him. ""I wanted people to know they weren't alone,"" Nadal said. ""I definitely felt scared, betrayed, and angry. The Post-it wall was validating."" And while he knew others in New York City would share his post-election sentiments, Nadal said seeing seeing all those emotions ""manifested in one place was viscerally powerful."" So why Post-its? In early 2016, well before the November election, ""Subway Therapy"" creator Matthew ""Levee"" Chavez set up a table, two chairs, and a sign that read ""Secret Keeper"" in a New York City subway station. His setup included a blank book in the hope that passerby might decide to unload some internal stress by writing their secrets down on paper. Despite this, he often found that people preferred face-to-face conversations. ""For the next eight months or so, I had individual conversations with people that would stop by to sit and talk...About whatever they wanted to talk about."" After the election, he said things changed. Matthew Chavez near his public art project: ""Subway Therapy."" Image: Volkan Furuncu/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Chavez says he believes that ""during crisis, writing can be a more effective and accessible form of expression than conversation."" It's what inspired him to bring sticky notes and writing materials into the subway that November. The Post-its helped him reach a wider audience, since several people could write their thoughts down simultaneously, rather than waiting to chat with him one-on-one. ""The wall took a form that was fun, beautiful, and expressive,"" Chavez recalled. ""In mass, sticky notes are incredibly inviting and they definitely helped people to open up."" A history of Post-it protests Though it's been nearly two years since Chavez's Subway Therapy project, many of the notes have since been archived online and in several books, and memories of the wall remain for those who contributed or passed by. Though Chavez helped create one of the most memorable Post-it Note protests in recent history, his was far from the first. In 2011, Wisconsin residents used the tactic when they protested policies by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that would weaken in-state unions. In addition to months of marches and other organizing efforts, protesters left hundreds of Post-it Notes at the Wisconsin State Capitol entrance in an attempt to share their concerns. Despite the protests, Walker's proposal ended up passing. Post-it Notes on state capitol in protest of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's budget repair bill. Image: Allen Fredrickson/Icon SMI/Corbis via Getty Images Later that year, Post-its made their way to London to serve as a beacon of light in the wake of a divisive act of violence. In August 2011, riots broke out across London in protest of a deadly police shooting that killed local resident Mark Duggan. In Peckham, London, thousands of community members responded to the tragedy with a "" Love Wall "" covered in notes with messages of hope and unity. The sentiment was so powerful that it spread to walls in Manchester and in other areas of London. A wall covered in Post-it Notes supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Image: Thomas Campean/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The people of Hong Kong also used Post-it Notes to show support for the pro-democracy movement of 2014, when many called for the resignation of leader Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. During what's since come to be known as the "" Umbrella Revolution,"" activists and protesters wrote words of encouragement and their reasons for demonstrating on Post-its, creating a colorful display outside government offices. People in Sydney even covered the walls of Australia's Hong Kong House in solidarity. The benefits of sticky note self-expression While expressing oneself via Post-it Note has shown to be a therapeutic and unifying response to large-scale events, these notes can also provide comfort to individuals on a day-to-day basis. ""Self-affirmations are really helpful in helping to negate any harmful self-doubts or cognitive distortions,"" Nadal said, explaining that writing positive, reassuring messages on Post-it Notes ""can help in increasing one's self esteem and decreasing any cognitive distortions.""

JIM SALTER / AP,"(ST. LOUIS) — Residents in parts of southwestern Iowa were forced out of their homes Sunday as a torrent of Missouri River water flowed over and through levees.
Heavy rainfall and snowmelt forced river levels across several Midwestern states to dangerous levels. At least two deaths were blamed on flooding, and two other men have been missing for days. While river levels on Sunday were starting to level off in Nebraska, other residents in Iowa, Kansas and Missouri were bracing for worse flooding to come.
The Missouri River reached 30.2 feet (9.2 meters) Sunday in Fremont County, Iowa, in the state’s far southwestern corner, 2 feet (0.6 meter) above the record set in 2011. People in the towns of Bartlett and Thurman were being evacuated as levees were breached and overtopped.
County Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius said it wasn’t just the amount of the water, it was the swiftness of the current that created a danger.
“This wasn’t a gradual rise,” Crecelius said. “It’s flowing fast and it’s open country — there’s nothing there to slow it down.”
Thurman has about 200 residents. About 50 people live in Bartlett.
Lucinda Parker of Iowa Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management said nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated at eight Iowa locations since flooding began late last week. Most were staying with friends or family. Seven shelters set up for flood victims held just a couple dozen people Saturday night.
Hundreds of people remained out of their homes in Nebraska, but rivers there were starting to recede. The National Weather Service said the Elkhorn River remained at major flood stage but was dropping. It was expected to dip back below flood stage by Tuesday. U.S. 30 reopened near Arlington on Saturday.
The flooding is blamed on at least two deaths. Aleido Rojas Galan, 52, of Norfolk, Nebraska, was swept away in floodwaters Friday night in southwestern Iowa, when the vehicle he was in went around a barricade. Two others in the vehicle survived — one by clining to a tree. On Thursday, James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to try and reach stranded motorists.
Two men remain missing. A Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away. Water also swept away a man after a dam collapse.
In St. Joseph, Missouri, home to 76,000 people, volunteers were helping to fill sandbags to help secure a levee protecting an industrial area. Calls were out for even more volunteers in hopes of filling 150,000 sandbags by Tuesday, when the Missouri River is expected to climb to 27 feet — 10 feet above technical flood stage.
The rising Mississippi River also was creating concern. The Mississippi was already at major flood level along the Iowa-Illinois border, closing roads and highways and swamping thousands of acres of farmland. Moderate Mississippi River flooding was expected at several Missouri cities, including St. Louis.
Flooding has also been reported in Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

TUCSON, Ariz.  The new year will bring the first new U.S.-Mexico border barriers to be built under President Donald Trump's administration.
The administration has so far announced eight projects to build new fence or replace existing barriers. Three of the projects have been completed; two are underway. Three others will begin during 2019's first half, including areas of south Texas that previously had no barriers.
More new fencing could soon follow.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has received more than $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 for border infrastructure. That money is paying for the eight scheduled projects, and a few more that have not been announced yet. Homeland Security officials said more contracts will be awarded in coming weeks.
In late December, officials unveiled how additional money they've requested from Congress for border security would be spent. Those plans include more than 100 miles of completely new barriers, mostly along south Texas.

Here are the locations of the two projects expected to be finished in 2019 and the three construction projects slated to begin in 2019:
Rio Grande Valley, Texas
In February, crews will begin building 14 miles of levee walls just south of McAllen, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley the busiest point for illegal entries along the southwest border.
Customs and Border Protection awarded two contracts worth a total of $312 million to SLSCO Ltd. of Galveston, Texas, to build the barriers.

The new barriers will be built on top of existing levees north of the Rio Grande, which tends to flood with seasonal rains. The barriers consist of the solid concrete levees built to their existing height, with 18-foot-tall bollard-style fencing at the top. The barriers will be built in six segments along the Rio Grande, Customs and Border Protection said. 
East of these levee walls, a San Antonio-based company is installing at least seven gates along sections of the border fence north of the river that were built during the last decade. 
That work is the first phase of a project to install 35 border gates.
The gates, besides stemming the flow of people and narcotics, are intended to give landowners access to their lands south of the barriers, as well as the Rio Grande to irrigate their fields.
Yuma and Lukeville, Arizona
In April, construction will resume along the Arizona-Mexico border as crews begin replacing 32 miles of existing primary fencing in the southwestern part of the state.
Twenty-seven of those miles are in Yuma; 5 miles are in Lukeville. 
Customs and Border Protection awarded a contract worth $172 million to Barnard Construction Co. of Bozeman, Montana. It will work to replace 14 miles of aging, Vietnam-era landing mat fencing east of the San Luis port of entry.

Crews will remove the 18-foot-tall landing mats and install bollard-style fencing that's 30 feet tall. 
Customs and Border Protection said it also plans to replace an additional 11.5 miles of landing-mat fencing east of that area, along with a 1.5 mile stretch of mesh-style fencing near the Colorado River. But the agency has not said when construction will begin.

Both Lukeville and Yuma have seen large groups of migrant families, some numbering as many as 150, crossing the border illegally in the last year and voluntarily turning themselves over to agents.
El Centro and San Diego, California
In July, construction crews will begin to replace 15 miles of primary fencing along the California-Mexico border. Eleven of those miles are in Calexico, 3 are in Tecate, and 1 mile is near Andrade, across the California-Arizona line from Yuma.
Customs and Border Protection awarded a contract worth $156 million to SLSCO of Galveston for the project. In its announcement, the agency said it also had awarded the company an additional $131 million contract to replace 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego.
All four segments will employ the 30-foot bollard-style fencing.

Dec. 13: Trump administration says 'walls work.' Here's what a full view of the border shows
The San Diego-Tijuana border area has received attention in recent months as thousands of migrants traveling in caravans arrived there, hoping to seek asylum. 
But with waits of up to six weeks to present their claims at the port of entry, many asylum seekers, and migrants with no plans to seek asylum, have been breaching the border illegally. 
""Given the high-density population in San Diego-Tijuana urban area, the stronger infrastructure is critically important,"" Customs and Border Protection said in its announcement.
Completed projects
The three replacement projects that have been completed are in Calexico, California, El Paso, Texas, and Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
Work crews finished 2.25 miles of 30-foot-tall bollards in Calexico in October, the first project completed under the Trump administration. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited the site a few days later.
During her visit, the agency welded a plaque to the fence to mark ""the completion of the first section of President Donald Trump's border wall,"" even though it was a replacement project.

A few weeks later, Customs and Border Protection completed the replacement of four miles of bollard style fencing near the Chihuahuita neighborhood in downtown El Paso. Unlike Calexico, CBP officials there did not mark the project's conclusion. 
In November, crews finished 20 miles of vehicle fencing with 18- to 30-foot bollards in Santa Teresa, west of metropolitan El Paso. 
Customs and Border Protection spent about $113 million to complete the three projects.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Mayor Rick Eberlin of Grafton, Ill., knows that by the end of this week he will probably be in another fight with the Mississippi River.
But sandbags and flood walls are not in his arsenal.
The city of 640 people just below the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers will allow floodwaters to sweep across its low-lying areas, enveloping roads, parks, docks and a strip of scruffy riverside lots where no one has lived since the Great Flood of 1993.
“We don’t use walls or sandbags. There’s nothing to protect,” Eberlin said Friday afternoon. “What we do is pray that it doesn’t get as high as the forecast. Then we cope with it.”
But don’t mistake Eberlin’s resignation as surrender.
Grafton has been through 18 high-water events since 1993, and Eberlin, a farmer, has learned a few things about negotiating with the Mississippi River. One is to let flood tides go where they want to go.
Eberlin is one of a growing number of Mississippi River mayors who are rethinking what it means to live next to a river whose floods seem less predictable than ever—when spring rains become bomb cyclones and six weeks of gradual winter snowmelt can be compressed into two weeks of sheet-flow flooding across frozen ground.
“What used to be a high-water event every two, three, five years, now it seems we’re getting it every year, sometimes twice a year,” Eberlin said. “I know we’ve got a different weather pattern, and the events are getting more fierce.”
Towns like Grafton have little choice but to take adaptation to the next level.
Rather than simply pulling back from the river’s edge, communities are looking at landscape-scale flood control measures that are also environmentally restorative. Towns are constructing—or rather, allowing nature to reconstruct—marsh and wetland areas that were once the targets of dredges.
When Grafton built a new riverside marina in 2006, it placed tons of dredge material into a river shallow to help establish what is now a functioning wetland that traps sediment; slows water; and provides habit for fish, waterfowl and small mammals.
It also helps reduce flood damage downriver, where communities south of St. Louis have witnessed some of the worst floods on record over the past decade. The events have fueled debate over the role that levees and flood walls have in worsening flood conditions for downstream neighbors (Climatewire, Aug. 8, 2018).
Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the St. Louis-based Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, said mayors along the entire 2,300-mile length of the river are beginning to see the picture.
“We’re more conscious of these things,” he said. “Our mayors are really beginning to focus on not just managing water in their town, but managing on a corridor scale. It’s not easy and it’s not cheap, but it makes a hell of a lot more sense, and it saves the taxpayer a lot of money.”
Davenport, Iowa, located a few hundred miles upriver from Grafton, has been an exemplar of landscape-level flood protection.
The city of 102,000 is home to the largest urban wetland on the Upper Mississippi River. Known as the Nahant Marsh, the 305-acre preserve was for decades a hunting and skeet-shooting club. When the club closed in 1995, the marsh was so polluted with spent lead that more waterfowl were dying of toxic exposure than gunshot.
EPA declared the Nahant Marsh a Superfund site in the late 1990s. After the removal and cleaning of about 60,000 cubic yards of toxic soil, the site was handed back to the city. It’s managed today as an education center, providing residents with rare access to seasonally wet bottomland forest, marshland and open water habitat.
But the Nahant Marsh’s greatest community benefit is its ability to act as a massive urban floodwater sponge, catching and filtering up to 2 billion gallons of water during peak flows on the Mississippi.
Brian Ritter, executive director of the nonprofit organization that manages the marsh, said the city of Davenport has long viewed flooding as part of its natural heritage and has adapted accordingly.
Like Grafton, Davenport has no levee or flood wall. Its roughly 9-mile riverfront, including its signature park, is designed to be submerged in floodwaters for weeks at a time.
Former Davenport Mayor Pat Gibbs, who was criticized in the mid-1990s for refusing to build a flood wall along the waterfront, told the Quad-City Times last June that he has no regrets about the decision, even as Davenport’s across-the-river neighbor, Rock Island, Ill., stands by its decision to build one in the 1970s.
“I still believe you give to the Mississippi what belongs to it,” Gibbs told the newspaper. “If the water wants to come in, it’ll come in no matter what you build.”
But as flood frequency and intensity has risen over the last 25 years, the Nahant Marsh has become a community asset in ways few people considered before the Great Flood of 1993.
“We’re flooding right now,” Ritter said last week. “The river went up last week, and the forecast says it will go up again in early April. Our soils are completely saturated, so the marsh is doing exactly what it’s supposed to do.”
Like Eberlin in Grafton, Ritter has kept tabs on high-water events in Davenport over the last two decades. He is convinced climate change is leading to more extreme precipitation and more floods.
“This is our 21st flood that we’re experiencing since the year 2000,” he said. “Historically on this stretch of the river, it was one or two floods per decade.”
“I mean, you know, climate change and land use—it’s the double whammy,” he added. “At one time we had this wonderful prairie sponge all through the Midwest that would soak up the rain and snowmelt. Now we have to build the sponge.”
Even the Army Corps of Engineers, which has invested billions of dollars to line the Mississippi River with levees and flood walls over the last century, has begun to see the benefits of reconnecting the river to its natural floodplain.
In 2017, the Army Corps worked with Iowa, county officials and the Green Island Levee District to buy out privately owned farm tracts along the Maquoketa River, a Mississippi River tributary south of Dubuque, that saw frequent severe flooding.
After high water breeched a 1940s-era levee on the Maquoketa in 2010, the Army Corps opted not to patch the holes but instead offer it to the state as an extension of the 4,000-acre Green Island Wildlife Management Area, one of the state’s most important flood backwaters and wildlife sanctuaries.
Calls to the Army Corps’ Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, based in Rock Island, were not returned Friday.
Ross Baxter, land projects director for the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, said at the time that returning the affected areas to a natural state avoided future infrastructure expenses while better protecting other surrounding farmland from floods.
“Ultimately it made more financial sense to buy, protect and restore the land than fix the levee and continue to farm the flood-prone land,” Baxter said.
Nathan Woiwode, North America climate adaptation project manager for the Nature Conservancy, said the organization has observed a significant uptick in nature-based flood protection measures in the Mississippi River Basin, especially in states like Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.
“These states are taking very intentional looks at how they’ve done floodplain management in the past,” Woiwode said. “It’s not purely about flood protection. It’s also about protecting agricultural interests and creating community assets.”
Woiwode also pointed to the recently launched “Engineering With Nature,” an Army Corps initiative that aims to incorporate natural solutions to water management. The agency in January published an atlas detailing 56 projects that apply nature-based approaches to challenges around river management and flood control.
“It’s about understanding that the things we used to be able to rely upon, like how the water moves through a river system, it’s all changing,” he said. “It’s about recognizing that we need to start planning for a very different future.”

AP,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) A white man who spewed racial epithets before and after a shotgun attack on three black men amid the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in federal prison.
Roland Bourgeois Jr., 56, sat quietly in a wheelchair as U.S. District Judge Mary Ann Vial Lemmon announced the sentence. He had pleaded guilty to two federal criminal counts in October, ending a years-long legal fight that was delayed numerous times amid questions about his mental and physical health. His sentencing resolved the last of the high-profile legal cases arising from violence that erupted at times in the city following the Aug. 29, 2005 storm.
The shooting happened roughly three days after Katrina hit the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast. Power was out, levee failures had flooded most of New Orleans and emergency resources were strained.
Bourgeois fired a shotgun at three black men who were trying to evacuate the area, wounding one seriously. Prosecutors said that he and others had discussed shooting black people and defending the Algiers Point neighborhood of New Orleans from outsiders after the storm. Before and after the shooting, his conversations were punctuated with racial epithets. And, his original indictment said, he told one African-American neighborhood resident: Anything coming up this street darker than a brown paper bag is getting shot.
Bourgeois was indicted in 2010.
Defense attorney Valerie Welz Jusselin argued for a sentence of five years in court Thursday. She noted Bourgeois frail health. And she said the confusion and fear that was rampant in the city contributed to his behavior. She said even trained police officers mistakenly believed that martial law was in effect and that they had license to shoot at will at suspected looters.
Federal prosecutor Mary Hahn dismissed that characterization of the circumstances. The men who were shot including one who was seriously wounded were headed for a ferry, hoping to evacuate the city, not looters. She also noted evidence of Bourgeois hate-filled statements and his waving around of a bloody cap belonging to one of the victims as though it were a trophy.
This was a premeditated attempt to kill, Hahn said.
Bourgeois was freed on bond at one point after his indictment but was jailed in August 2017 for a bond violation. Documents show that, at the time he was arrested for violating conditions of his release, U.S. Marshals recovered 10 rifles and seven handguns from the residence where he was living.
A trial was avoided last October when Bourgeois pleaded guilty to interference with rights and use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, according to a plea agreement. That agreement said his prison sentence would be at least five years and at most 10 years.
In addition to the Bourgeois matter, other cases arising from post-Katrina violence included the deadly shooting by police officers of unarmed civilians at the Danziger bridge in the days after the storm a case that led to eventual guilty pleas from several officers during a long and complicated court case.
In an unrelated post-Katrina case, five other officers were tried on charges related to the death of 31-year-old Henry Glover, who was fatally shot outside a strip mall before his body was burned. The officer who burned the body was the only one who stood convicted when the case was over. The officer who fatally shot Glover was convicted of manslaughter but was later acquitted by another jury after an appeals court awarded him a new trial.","Bourgeois, a white man, used racial epithets before and after the shooting.",2019-02-15T13:45:29Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Roland Bourgeois Jr. Gets 10-Year Sentence In Post-Katrina Shooting Of Black Men,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roland-bourgeois-hurricane-katrina-shooting_n_5c66bf08e4b05c889d1e4f33,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c66c24c360000790f6af9ef.jpeg?ops=1910_1000,,Huffpost.com,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise."" For the near future, the heavy rain has ended across central Iowa, according to Kelsey Angle, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines. Between 3 to 8 inches of rain fell rapidly across the Des Moines metro Saturday, contributing to ""catastrophic flooding,"" Angle said. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street recorded the highest crest on record just over 19 feet, Angle said. Take a look from above as water spills over the banks of Walnut Creek in Windsor Heights. Rodney White and Michael Zamora, The Register The Saylorville Lake reservoir is forecast to crest at about 888 feet by next weekend — a depth that is above the lip of the concrete emergency spillway, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday. On Sunday, 20,500 cubic square feet was flowing out. ""We are not anticipating a flood release that is uncontrolled out of Saylorville,"" said Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie. Much of the Des Moines area got 6 to 7 inches of rain in less than three hours Saturday, and the flash flooding resulted in one death, rescues of people stranded in their vehicles, apartment evacuations and a house explosion in Urbandale. At least 100 people have been displaced, according to the American Red Cross. As of 9 a.m. on Sunday, the Saylorville Lake reservoir stands at 878.39 feet, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. It increased over 2 feet in the last 24 hours. Saylorville Lake reached 866.6 feet above sea level Tuesday afternoon, an increase of more than 15 feet in just five days. The top of the dam's spillway is at 884 feet; that figure can be increased to 890 feet with the use of pneumatic crest gates. When in use, the inflatable pneumatic crest gate pushes water back from the lake's spillway dam and allows engineers to keep channeling it through the dam's main gates. This helps control erosion on the spillway. Last Slide Next Slide Saylorville Lake hit a historic high level on July 11, 1993, when it crested at 892 feet above sea level. On June 12, 2008, the lake level rose to 891 feet above sea level. The most heavily damaged areas in the Des Moines area are along Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek in the metro, said A.J. Mumm, Polk County Emergency Management Director. The worst flooding damages are along the Fourmile Creek from East Douglas Avenue all the way to Pleasant Hill, until it meets the Des Moines River. Damage is along Walnut Creek through Urbandale, Clive, Windsor Heights and Des Moines. Walnut Creek flooded at record levels during Saturday's deluge. A little east of Clive, the creek at 63rd Street in Des Moines set a record when it crested at 11:45 p.m. at 19.08 feet. The previous high was 18.7 in 2015. ""We've seen truly historic crests on both of the waterways,"" Mumm said. Fleur Drive in Des Moines appears to be safe as of Sunday morning, but residents in the eastern side of town should use caution near the Fourmile Creek area, where numerous buildings were evacuated Sunday because of record flooding, said Chad Christensen, Des Moines Public Works flood systems engineer. How to deal with a flooded home: The latest forecast from the National Weather Service in Des Moines shows the Raccoon River cresting at 16.5 feet near Fleur Drive — just on the brink of when water comes on to the road. If no additional rain hits the metro, the road will not have to close, Christensen said. Public works is focusing its attention along the Fourmile Creek area, which was hit with 6 to 10 inches of rain along its base, Christensen said. Drivers are advised to stay away. Road damage has been reported along Second Avenue, where water peeled and displaced the asphalt. Birdland Drive and Prospect Road are also closed. The city closed the gate that’s a part of the Birdland levee across from Saylor Road as a precaution. It’s been all-hands-on-deck in the public works department as crews survey and fix damages since 8 p.m. Saturday, Christensen told the Register.

Dave Johnson,"Are you happy with the sound quality of your music streaming app? You might not think much about it. But audiophiles are always on the hunt for better sound quality, and a new streaming service has debuted, offering to deliver it. Qobuz, new to the US, supports much higher audio quality - according to the company, as much as 29 times better than Spotify. 
 High resolution audio is nothing new. In the last decade, formats like DVD-Audio and SACD have promised sound quality far surpassing anything on CD, but they largely failed because they were inconvenient compared to CD playing. A few years ago, musician Neil Young tried again with Pono, a combination music player and music service, but not enough people wanted to lock themselves into a special music player, regardless of the superior sound quality it offered. 
 Qobuz is different, though - it delivers (depending upon the track), high quality MP3s, CD-quality music, and 24-bit lossless tracks just as conveniently as Spotify and Tidal deliver their respective sounds. 
 So we put all three streaming services to the test to see if there was any noticeable advantage to using Qobuz. 
Spotify
 You already know Spotify, which has been around since 2008. You can use the free, ad-supported version to listen to the roughly 30 million tracks, even if you don't pony up $10 per month for Spotify Premium. Spotify Free lets you listen at 160 kbps, but Premium adds the option to play music at 320 kbps, which is the highest quality level that MP3s can be encoded at. 
Spotify is the most popular streaming music service, thanks in part to the fact that you can listen for free.
 Dave Johnson 
Tidal
 Tidal is a newer streaming service, launched in 2014 by the Norwegian company Aspiro and ""re-launched"" by Jay-Z in 2015. There's no free-play version of Tidal, but in addition to the standard $10/month subscription, there's also a $20 per month premium service that includes access to some FLAC-format lossless tracks. 
Tidal offers higher quality tracks than Spotify, but to get those, you need to pay twice as much as you would for Spotify Premium.
 Dave Johnson 
Qobuz
 The new kid on the block, Qobuz has some catching up to do. The service costs a premium, literally: access to everything including the high-res content (FLAC 24-Bit up to 192 KHz) starts at $24.99 per month (CD-quality only is $20 per month, and MP3-only is $10 per month). And while the company claims to have about 40 million CD-quality tracks and a couple of million hi-res songs, the library sometimes feels barren when searching for popular artists. 
 While preparing to compare the audio quality of the three services, we had to veto a few songs because they weren't yet available on Qobuz. If you're a fan of indie music, be especially wary. Searches for alt rock bands like Throwing Muses and Downpilot turn up few-to-no tracks. 
Qobuz boasts the best quality tracks and a large library, but we sometimes couldnt find the tracks we wanted to hear. And the top subscription level is quite pricey.
 Dave Johnson 
Qobuz definitely sounds better than Spotify on most songs
 It's one thing for Qobuz to say it's 29 times better than Spotify - but can you really hear the difference? 
 To find out, we tested 10 songs that spanned a range of musical styles. Two test subjects (myself, and fellow tech journalist John Lyon) got to hear each song once - the highest-quality versions of Spotify, Tidal, and Qobuz - through a pair of high-quality headphones without knowing which version was which. 
 The result? Qobuz noticeably outperformed the others as we picked Qobuz as our favorite in ""blind"" testing a surprising 75% of the time. 
 I'll be honest: I didn't expect Qobuz to fare that well. Not because I didn't trust that its audio was high quality, but because I didn't think it would matter very much. I suspected that Spotify and Tidal sound ""good enough,"" and it would be hard to really hear the difference. And while there's some truth to that, Qobuz really did pop. 
 Listening to Leonard Bernstein's performance of ""The Death of Ase,"" John heard the Qobuz version immediately after Tidal and exclaimed, ""Wow, that was a much more interesting song than it seemed the first time!"" About Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks,"" I observed that the song opened up with a much wider soundstage than either Tidal or Spotify, making the reverberating drums all the more impressive. BRMC's ""Beat the Devil's Tattoo"" features percussive finger-snaps in the background; John marveled that unlike the others, Qobuz's version was ""super-clean. The snaps actually sounded fleshy."" 
 But we're not sure Qobuz is worth the money 
 Qobuz didn't win first place for every song, however, and Spotify and Tidal jockeyed for first and second place from song to song. (A few times, like in the Beach Boy's remastered mono version of ""God Only Knows,"" Spotify actually took the top spot over Qobuz, which John described as ""blasting me unpleasantly in the forehead."") 
 What's the lesson? Yes, Qobuz does generally deliver better sound, and if that's your priority, this is the service for you. 
 But it's a closer race than Qobuz's ""29 times better than Spotify"" claim might suggest. Really hearing - and appreciating - the difference between Qobuz and the competition requires active listening, and that's not how we usually consume music. When I let Qobuz fade into the background, it became easy to miss the nuances that make it special. I suspect that might be why Qobuz fell out of first place a few times; the differences in quality were sometimes subtle, and it was easy to lose track of why one track excelled over another. 
 If you aren't the sort of listener who pays complete attention to your music, then the decision to subscribe might come down to other factors, like cost, the variety of the music catalog, or whether it contains your favorite artists.","For music lovers, sound quality is one of the most important things a streaming service can offer.

https://www.facebook.com/zezimak,"Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west. Floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and could spur life-threatening landslides as the storm’s remnants move west. The storm has been linked to several deaths, according to authorities. Follow the storm’s projected path here and read the latest forecasts here. Key updates: Death toll rises to 17 | Flash floods in Mecklenburg County 1:01 a.m.: ‘It don’t look good’ – North Carolina county orders mandatory evacuation in preparation for potential dam breach Hoke County (N.C.) officials announced on late Sunday night a mandatory evacuation for people living near McLaughlin Lake due to a concern that a dam could be breached as heavy rains continue to fall on the area. Hoke County is located about 25 miles west of Fayetteville, N.C. “It is seriously damaged and we’re just getting prepared for the worst,” Scott Locklear of Hoke County’s Office of Emergency Management told The Washington Post. “It don’t look good,” Locklear said, adding that water is already coming over the dam. According to the county’s announcement, both the Coast Guard and units from Fort Bragg are on the scene to assist with evacuations. The National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., also issued an update at 11:30 p.m. Sunday on the status of six rivers in North Carolina. Officials said two of these rivers, Little River and Rocky River, are in “major flood,” meaning there is “extensive inundation of structures and roads” in certain areas along the waterways. River Flood Warnings as of 1130 PM (1/3)... Neuse River at: Goldsboro – Currently in Moderate Flood and rising Smithfield – Currently in Moderate Flood and nearing crest Clayton – Recently fell Below Flood Stage and falling pic.twitter.com/wRknhAgh6p — NWS Raleigh (@NWSRaleigh) September 17, 2018 — Allyson Chiu 11:59 p.m.: As heavy rains continue, multiple flash flood and tornado warnings issued The storm is expected to continue producing “widespread heavy rains over much of North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina,” the National Hurricane Center announced Sunday at 11 p.m. An additional two to five inches of rain is predicted to fall on parts of the Carolinas, the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New England. Some areas could receive as much as eight inches. The center reported that as of Sunday night, Florence had dumped a total of 40 inches of rain in southern North Carolina and 20 inches in northern South Carolina. Due to the unceasing rain, officials warn that “flash flooding and catastrophic/historic river flooding” is still a concern for “large portions of the Carolinas.” The warnings also extend to the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, and there is a risk of landslides in affected areas. Throughout Sunday evening, multiple flash flood warnings were issued for North Carolina and southwest Virginia, the National Weather Service tweeted. Many of these warnings are in place until Monday morning. Tornado warnings were also issued for several cities in North Carolina. Parts of North Carolina and South Carolina were also put on a tornado watch until 5 a.m. Monday. A couple tornadoes remain possible in the area through Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is moving north at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. — Allyson Chiu 7:27 p.m.: Storm death toll rises to 17 Officials in Gaston County, N.C., said a 3-month-old was killed Sunday when a tree fell through the family’s single-wide mobile home. The infant and the mother were taken to a hospital, where the baby died, said Maj. Jamie McConnell with Gaston County EMS. At least 11 people have died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and six in South Carolina. — Katie Zezima 6:42 p.m.: At least 16 people have died in the storm At least 16 deaths are now attributed to the storm. A woman in Lexington County, S.C., lost control of her car, hit a tree and was ejected from the vehicle, according to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. At least six people have now died in South Carolina. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at least 10 people have died in that state. — Katie Zezima 6:10 p.m.: ‘Looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte’ The National Weather Service declared a rare flash flood emergency for parts of Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, because streams and creeks were running unusually high, in some locations reaching record levels. Tim Habershaw and his roommate, Zachary Finley, walked in their Carolina Panthers jerseys down Central Avenue in Charlote to view swollen Briar Creek, a normally placid brook that had turned into a torrent. “I drove by earlier on my way home from work, and I was like, ‘Whoa, looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte,’ ” said Habershaw, 51, a restaurant server who lives two miles away with Finley, 25, a line cook. “I went home and took a nap, and when I woke up, I told [Finley], ‘We’ve got to go see this.’ ” About 3,000 miles’ worth of creeks, the vast majority little more than unnamed trickles, crisscross Mecklenburg County in a vast lacework that flows to larger rivers and, eventually, to the Atlantic Ocean. Charlotte’s rolling topography tends to funnel floodwaters into low areas that usually correspond to creek beds. Habershaw has lived in Charlotte for 30 years and said he had never seen Briar Creek as high as it was Sunday afternoon. “It’s kind of scary,” he said, “but beautiful.” The heaviest rain fell in southeastern Mecklenburg County. Some places received 10 inches of rain this weekend. — Greg Lacour 5:30 p.m.: Hundreds of dialysis patients rescued from their homes Late Sunday afternoon, Tom Cotter, North Carolina team leader for the relief group Americares, was waiting in the parking lot of a shelter in Wilson, N.C., for the arrival of 105 dialysis patients who were on their way by bus after having been rescued from their flooded homes in Jacksonville, N.C., 90 miles to the south. Many of them had been rescued by boats from their homes, and some had not received treatment for as many as five days. Cotter had brought health screening devices, essential medicine, adult diapers, cleaning supplies and more. A dialysis center across the street will deliver care. “This is very much an ongoing disaster,” Cotter said. “People are still coming into these shelters.” — Steven Mufson 4:27 p.m.: Warily watching the rivers in South Carolina Renee Matthews has been walking to Lynches River at least once every day, checking how far it has risen. Two days ago, the river that surrounds her family’s property in rural Florence County, S.C., was dry and barely rose past her nephew’s knee. By Sunday, the river bank was nowhere to be seen. The boat landing that leads to the bank was buried in debris, and the four-foot concrete barrier next to it was nearly submerged. “It’s probably come up two to three feet,” she said, aiming her phone to take a picture. “You could walk right there two days ago. You could walk all around that tree two days ago,” she said, pointing at a submerged tree. And the deluge of rain has barely started. Flooding happens every few years in this wooded riverfront neighborhood of mobile homes and big houses, some of which were built several feet above the ground. “The water goes all the way to the top of that house,” Matthews said, pointing at an empty vacation home that stands at least six feet from the wet, grassy land. There has been no flooding yet in the county that shares a name with the storm. But officials are monitoring the Lynches River and other bodies of water inland as rain continues and rainfall from the north flows downstream, said Dusty Owens, director of the county’s emergency management division. Here in Florence County, several bodies of water – the Great Pee Dee River to the east, Lynches River to the south, and Black Creek to the north, are all expected to rise. Lynches River, for example, has risen by more than five feet since Friday. The Great Pee Dee could rise to 27 feet by Thursday, surpassing the flood stage by eight feet. “Next week, it’ll be our problem,” Matthews, 48, said. “This river’s going to keep rising.” — Kristine Phillips 3:47 p.m.: At least 15 people dead due to the storm At least 15 people have now died as a result of tropical depression Florence, which slammed into the Carolinas as a hurricane on Friday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said five people were killed in the storm: Amber Dawn Lee of Union County; Mark Carter King and Deborah Collins Ryan, who lost their lives in a generator-related incident on Saturday; Michael D. Prince, who died this morning when he lost control of his car in Georgetown County; and Jeffrey B. Youngren, who died Sunday morning in Kershaw County after driving into a support beam. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said 10 people in the state have died due to the storm. — Felicia Sonmez 3:17 p.m.: An aging levee system holds, while a temporary barrier weakens As the swollen Lumber River in Lumberton, N.C., rose ever higher in Sunday’s pouring rain, the aging levee system in Robeson County held strong, said county spokeswoman Emily Jones. But a temporary sandbag barrier built by volunteers and National Guardsmen amid pouring rain this week had been “compromised” by the rising water levels, Jones said. Water had broken through that section of the river, which passed by railway tracks on the west side of town, during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, flooding businesses and homes. Sebastian Milton, a volunteer with the Cajun Navy who came to Lumberton from Covington, La., to help with rescue operations, said it’s a matter of time before the levee fails as well. [ Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters ] “That’s a man-made structure,” he said, “it can’t keep holding back the river.” Milton and fellow volunteers were posted on a bridge overlooking the Lumber River and a flooded section of Interstate 95 on Sunday afternoon. Their boats at the ready, they waited in pouring rain for the next emergency call to come in. “There’s still people out there,” Milton said, gesturing toward the expanse of dark water and trees that hid flooded homes. — Sarah Kaplan 2:49 p.m.: In Pembroke, N.C., ‘We’re having problems already.’ In Pembroke, N.C., emergency officials conducted about 120 evacuations and 20 rescues – complicated procedures like pulling people out of submerged cars – since the storm began. Charles Gregory Cummings, the town’s mayor, said officials had been working all week to make sure that the most vulnerable people in the community were safe from the storm. Police officers gave homeless citizens rides to the local shelters and conducted daily drives through public housing complexes, using a bullhorn to inform people about the coming deluge. Pamphlets were posted at every mobile home park bearing information about the forecast and where to seek shelter. Officers checked in daily at a local senior home to make sure their generators were working and they had enough food. On a drive through town to examine flooding “trouble spots,” Police Chief Ed Locklear noted that most of the public housing in Pembroke is located in the low-lying north side of town. There, canals and underground systems that drain water into the nearby swamp are easily overwhelmed by downpours. Several officials said that these canals were still clogged with downed trees and debris from Hurricane Matthew – the town hadn’t had the resources to fix the problem earlier, and only just received recovery funding from the federal government. Now Locklear cruised past a street to one of those housing complexes; it was submerged beneath what looked like a foot of muddy brown water. Sandbags rested against the homes’ front doors. “These are places that always flood,” Locklear said. “And you can see we’re having problems already.” — Sarah Kaplan 2:34 p.m.: Trump monitoring ‘the preparedness and response efforts’ The White House, in a statement, said President Trump is monitoring the storm and its effects: “Today, President Trump continues to monitor the preparedness and response efforts for Hurricane Florence. He was briefed again this afternoon by Sec. Nielsen, Admiral Schultz and Administrator Long. Yesterday, he spoke with Mayor Brenda Bethune of Myrtle Beach, SC and Mayor Dana Outlaw of New Bern, N.C. They discussed the rescue and response efforts in those communities and the President offered the full support of Federal government. Mayor Outlaw thanked President Trump for immediately authorizing the emergency declaration.” 2:31 p.m.: Mandatory evacuations in Fayetteville City officials in Fayetteville, N.C., said at an emergency meeting of the city council on Sunday that the Cape Fear River is expected to crest at 62 feet on Tuesday and recede sometime after 8 p.m. Friday. The river is already above flood stage, and there continues to be flash flooding and critical river flooding in the area, they said. Officials have been notifying residents that there is a mandatory evacuation order for those living within one mile of the Cape Fear and Little rivers. For other neighborhoods there is a voluntary evacuation order. There is also a curfew in effect until further notice. Thirteen roads in the city are closed so far due to high water or flooding, 50 to 60 traffic lights are out, and the city is closely monitoring the levels of nearby dams. Currently there are fewer than 10,000 people without power. Officials also said they have been pushing back against rumors that the city’s water supply is going to be shut off later Sunday afternoon; there are no plans for water to be shut off, they said. One official said that 160 people were transported from a nursing home to shelters last night. The city is working with EMS and others to provide transport to people in wheelchairs and those who need help getting out of bed. Officials are also working to open up more shelters for as many as 7,500 people who may be displaced. — Felicia Sonmez 1:46 p.m.: The storm is spawning an array of safety and environmental hazards Federal officials described an array of life-safety and environmental hazards spawned by Hurricane Florence in a Sunday afternoon teleconference. Among them: The floodwaters are potentially contaminated and could present a health hazard. “If you can avoid contact with floodwaters, do so,” said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. He said there are an estimated 3,300 “hog ponds” in North Carolina that hold manure. There is concern that heavy rainfall could cause them to overflow and send hog manure into waterways. Officials so far are “fairly confident” that farmers prepared adequately in advance of the storm to prevent the ponds from overtopping, Cheatham said. “But we’re not out of the woods yet.” Cheatham said that, at last count, there had been 28 boil-water orders issued by local water systems. Meanwhile there has been a significant spill of coal ash from a storage pond at a closed Duke Energy plant near Wilmington, N.C. Cheatham said 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash spilled into a ditch after floodwaters eroded a portion of the pond wall. That ditch leads to a cooling pond that has an outflow into the Cape Fear River, but he said there’s no evidence so far that the coal ash has reached that cooling pond. Duke Energy said in a statement Saturday that the company “does not believe this incident poses a risk to public health or the environment.” Federal officials are urging evacuees to stay where they are and not attempt to return home. “Don’t feel a need to rush home to file a claim” said National Flood Insurance Program chief executive David Maurstad. Coast Guard Adm. Meredith Austin said three major ports in the Carolinas remained closed, including the Cape Fear port near Wilmington. That closure is significant because the Cape Fear water utility has put out an urgent plea for fuel. “Cape Fear is the number one priority of getting a port open,” she said. “We are aware of the need to get fuel into the port.” FEMA associate administrator Jeff Byard provided the big picture: “This is a long event. We are definitely likely to have isolated communities.” — Joel Achenbach 1 p.m.: ‘This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now.’ North Carolina officials said floodwaters continue to rage and residents across nearly the entire state are in danger from torrential rainfall, rising rivers, floodwaters and, in the mountains, mudslides. “This storm has never been more dangerous than it has right now,” in many areas of the state, Gov. Roy Cooper (D), said at a midday news conference. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be on alert for sudden flooding.” Cooper said numerous rivers throughout the state – including the Cape Fear, Lumber, Neuse – are still rising and not expected to crest until later Sunday or Monday. The storm has dumped nearly two feet of rain in many places, and some places are being pummeled with to three inches of rain an hour. Flooding is getting worse in parts of the state, including Pollocksville, Lumberton, Kinston and Goldsboro. The danger is growing in North Carolina’s western mountains, where rains could lead to dangerous mudslides. Officials urged North Carolinians to stay off the roads. Many are closed; at least 171 primary roads are closed throughout the state, including portions of Interstates 95 and 40. People are urged not to drive east of Interstates 73/74 or U.S. Route 64 South. Many secondary roads are closed because of flooding. Cooper estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people have evacuated certain areas, a figure that will rise with expected mandatory evacuations in some places as rivers rise. About 15,000 people are staying in about 150 shelters across the state, he said. Four medical shelters are open in North Carolina, serving at least 170 patients. More than 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters, Cooper said. At least 700,000 people remain without power and residents should expect to be without for days because so many roads are impassible. “People need to understand that some areas are likely to be without power for a while,” Cooper said. The governor said food, water and high-water vehicles are being delivered to hard-hit areas. The Coast Guard has rescued at least 50 people via helicopter. — Katie Zezima","Washington Post Florence dumps torrential rain, raises floodwaters across the Carolinas Washington Post Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west.

"Thomas Frank, E&E News","The $14 billion network of levees and floodwalls that was built to protect greater New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina was a seemingly invincible bulwark against flooding.
But now, 11 months after the Army Corps of Engineers completed one of the largest public works projects in world history, the agency says the system will stop providing adequate protection in as little as four years because of rising sea levels and shrinking levees.
The growing vulnerability of the New Orleans area is forcing the Army Corps to begin assessing repair work, including raising hundreds of miles of levees and floodwalls that form a meandering earth and concrete fortress around the city and its adjacent suburbs.
“These systems that maybe were protecting us before are no longer going to be able to protect us without adjustments,” said Emily Vuxton, policy director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, an environmental group. She said repair costs could be “hundreds of millions” of dollars, with 75% paid by federal taxpayers.
“I think this work is necessary. We have to protect the population of New Orleans,” Vuxton said.
The protection system was built over a decade and finished last May when the Army Corps completed a final component that involves pumps.
The agency’s projection that the system will “no longer provide [required] risk reduction as early as 2023” illustrates the rapidly changing conditions being experienced both globally as sea levels rise faster than expected and locally as erosion wipes out protective barrier islands and marshlands in southeastern Louisiana.
Of primary concern are the earthen levees that form the backbone of the 350-mile maze of protection that includes concrete floodwalls, pump stations and gated structures, Army Corps spokesman Matthew Roe said.
The levees are losing height as they start to settle—a natural phenomenon that is exacerbated by the soft soils in southern Louisiana. Some floodwalls are built into the levees.
But “the global incidence of sea level rise” also is contributing to the inadequacy of the levees, the Army Corps said in the April 2 Federal Register notice announcing that it is studying system improvements.
“It’s happening a little bit faster than our projections in 2007,” Roe said.
Numerous studies in recent years have warned of New Orleans’ unusual vulnerability to sea-level rise. The National Academy of Sciences projected in 2016 that New Orleans could be one of the hardest-hit cities in the world along with Manila, Philippines; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Bangkok.
“The public may feel complacent. The [protective] system was built, and they think it’s done. They look at that levee as a static monolith,” said John Lopez, director of the coastal and community program for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, an environmental group. “But the crisis never really was over. We improved the system, but we have always been under threat.”
Sea-level rise raises questions about whether the protective system—known officially as the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System—should be built to a higher standard.
When Congress approved funding after Katrina, it required the system to protect against a so-called 100-year flood, which has a 1% likelihood of occurring in any year.
“We should be looking at higher than a 100-year standard, but not through levees alone,” Lopez said, calling for Congress to pay for natural barriers that build up coastal buffers. “We need a higher standard, but it should never be a single-type solution because we’ve seen that doesn’t work.”
As the Army Corps studies reinforcing the system, it will model the effect of roughly 150 storms ranging from a small tropical depression to a mammoth 500-year storm that has only a 0.2% chance of occurring each year, said Roe, the agency spokesman. A first draft of a report is scheduled to be done by December, after which the Army Corps will accept public comments.
Reinforcing the levees—a process known misleadingly as “lifting""—involves scraping off the top layer of grass and a fabric mattress and piling on additional earth before restoring the surface layer. It is unclear how much earth will need to be added to the levees, which stand as high as 35 feet.
But the Army Corps said in its Federal Register notice that “absent future levee lifts to offset consolidation, settlement, subsidence, and sea level rise, risk to life and property in the Greater New Orleans area will progressively increase.”

"Daniel Cusick, Chelsea Harvey, E&E News","Low-lying communities from Minnesota to Missouri are bracing for what could be the Mississippi Basin’s worst flooding since 1993 as temperatures rise and rainstorms continue to track over areas with deep winter snowpack.
The weekend brought some of the worst flooding in decades to towns along the Missouri River and its tributaries in Nebraska and Iowa, killing two and forcing evacuations from communities south of Omaha, Neb.
By yesterday, the focus was shifting south and east toward Kansas City and then to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers north of St. Louis.
“We’re expecting some considerable impacts over the next few weeks,” said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative based in St. Louis. “This is going to test the limits of some of our member cities.”
Col. Doug Guttormsen, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City District, cautioned residents along the lower Missouri to be “very mindful of high water” and prepare to quickly evacuate if ordered by state and local emergency managers.
The Army Corps was also working with local levee districts on sandbagging and other temporary flood control measures along the river as far east as Alton, Ill. Officials reported at least nine levee breaches along the Missouri south of the Platte River and four breaches of nonfederal levees closer to Kansas City.
The National Weather Service said it expected the Missouri to crest later this week in St. Joseph, Mo., at the third-highest level ever recorded.
Hundreds of homes were flooded in Nebraska and Iowa as of yesterday afternoon, and many thousands of acres of corn and soybean fields are inundated with water, according to local media reports.
Much of the weekend flooding was attributed to the recent “bomb cyclone” that brought late-season snow, rain and hurricane-force winds to the Great Plains and Midwest. But weather experts say a second wave could come this week as 50-plus-degree temperatures extend into Minnesota and Wisconsin, melting what remains of the region’s record February snowfall.
NOAA reported earlier this month that the winter of 2018-19 was the wettest on record, and it was accompanied by marked swings in temperature.
Spring thaw and snowmelt are routine in the northern half of the country. But experts say the current flood crisis is exacerbated by several conditions occurring at once. Heavy rain is falling onto a dense layer of snow atop frozen ground. With little or no soil absorption, the water is forced to run off into streams and rivers.
Scientists say such events may become a greater concern with climate change, as rising average temperatures mean precipitation may fall more variably—as both rain or snow—over the northern half of the country. Climate projections also suggest that heavy precipitation events will become more severe in many places.
The 2014 installment of the National Climate Assessment cites the northern Great Plains as one region expected to see an increase in winter precipitation in the future. It notes that “increased snowfall, rapid spring warming, and intense rainfall can combine to produce devastating floods.”
Some scientists have suggested that climate change may affect major atmospheric circulation systems in ways that could affect weather patterns and severity. For example, some believe the jet stream is becoming prone to wider up-and-down fluctuations in its flow over time—and that these atmospheric changes may be linked to rapid warming in the Arctic.
A wavier jet stream could also cause an increase in severe weather events, like the bomb cyclone, or cause severe weather to linger in one place for longer periods, potentially causing more damage. Such ideas, though, remain a point of debate among climate scientists.
What is not debatable is the amount of water flowing south from the nation’s snow-covered regions into the middle of the country, where the Missouri, Ohio and other smaller river basins meet an already swollen Mississippi River.
While dozens of cities, large and small, face higher flood risk this spring along the Mississippi, Wellenkamp said the basin’s mayors have worked individually and collectively to better prepare for floods and to adapt to climate change risks. For instance, Dubuque, Iowa, and Grafton, Ill., have taken steps to restore large wetland areas in their cities’ floodplains to allow the river more room to swell during flood tides.
Mayors have also improved flood response coordination so that upstream communities don’t worsen conditions for cities downstream.
“Mayors up north are not dumping snow into the river the way they used to,” Wellenkamp said. “They are placing it outside the watershed.”
River communities have also become more engaged in relocating residents out of floodplains where they face much higher risks to life and property.
“After 1993, we started moving people out, and we’re still doing that today,” Wellenkamp said. “It’s very expensive, but the cost of rebuilding flooded homes is much higher.”

By JIM SALTER Associated Press,"Even as floodwaters receded in hard-hit places in in the Midwest, experts warned Saturday that with plenty of snow still left to melt in northern states, the relief may only be temporary.
Rainfall and some snowmelt spurred flooding in recent weeks that's blamed in three deaths so far, with two men in Nebraska missing for more than a week. Thousands were forced from their homes in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, as water broke through or poured over levees in the region. The damage is estimated at $3 billion, and that figure is expected to rise.
As temperatures start to warm, snowmelt in the Dakotas and Minnesota will escalate, sending more water down the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and their tributaries.
Lt. Col. James Startzell, deputy commander of the Corps of Engineers' Omaha, Nebraska, district, said even warmer temperatures are possible into next week. He urged those living near rivers to keep a wary eye on them.
Bill Brinton, emergency management director for hard-hit Buchanan County, Missouri, which includes St. Joseph's 76,000 residents, said he expects more flooding this spring. Buchanan and its neighboring counties have been ravaged by this round of flooding.
""There's a sense from the National Weather Service that we should expect it to continue to happen into May,"" Brinton said. ""With our levee breaches in Atchison and Holt and Buchanan counties, it's kind of scary really.""
A precautionary evacuation involving hundreds of homes in the St. Joseph area was lifted as the Missouri River began a swift decline after coming just inches short of the 1993 record. St. Joseph was largely spared, but Brinton said 250 homes were flooded in the southern part of Buchanan County. It wasn't clear when residents would be able to get back.
When they do, officials say they need to be careful. Contaminants that escaped from flooded farm fields, industrial operations and sewage plants are part of the murky water now saturating homes.
In Fremont County, Iowa, homes remain underwater, so it will be some time before residents can return, said county Supervisor Randy Hickey.
""We don't want them in that water, anyway,"" Hickey said.
The water itself isn't the only concern. Experts warn that sharp objects broken glass, pieces of metal, pointy sticks and rocks could lurk in muddy debris. Downed or broken power lines also may pose electrocution hazards.
Another risk is posed by river wildlife. Brinton said two people in Buchanan County were bitten by snakes after returning home following flooding in 2011.
The Missouri River had yet to crest further downstream in Missouri, and while flooding impact in those areas was expected to be far less severe, there was some concern about drinking water in Kansas City, Missouri.
The utility KC Water said the flood resulted in the failure to meet standards for the treatment of the parasite cryptosporidium. KC Water says the concern isn't enough to issue a boil order, but people with extreme health conditions were advised as a precaution.
Concern was rising on the Mississippi River, too. Major flooding was reported at several spots north of the Iowa-Missouri line. St. Louis and other Missouri cities were seeing mostly moderate flooding.
Even the lower Mississippi River was impacted. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday rescued two boaters from a disabled vessel near New Orleans. Coast Guard officials said the flooding means more debris in the river, and the currents can pull a boat into danger.","With plenty of snow still left to melt to the north, the threat isn't over.",2019-03-23T18:15:14Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Experts warn Midwest flood risk may persist for months,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/experts-warn-midwest-flood-risk-persist-months-61892826,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_e3229acde8f94fbab1979e52d57619dc_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More Specs Less Specs © Qingshan Wu “River Viewing Service Station” is a service station at Lujiazui northern riverside section on the eastern bank of the Project on “Connecting Both Sides of Huangpu River of Shanghai”, providing citizens with rest spaces and public toilets. The station is within a narrow levee-shaped green field defined by riverside running path and inner riding path. It is an extension of the access of an existing underground garage staircase. The site is more than two meters above the city roads with the northern riverside slightly higher than the southern side. In the neighborhood there are many old trees, forming a small forest. © Qingshan Wu In order to balance an extremely short project schedule of only one month and our unremitting pursuit for quality and space experience and to give consideration to problems such as space constraint and control of garage roof structural weight, we adopted the steel and wood hybrid system mainly composed of laminated wood to make a rapid construction possible. With a high prefabricated rate, the site is basically adopting dry construction, which has little impact on the environment. Backed by a succession of skyscrapers in Lujiazui and separated by Huangpu River from Old Bund and North Bund, this site is a key public space in central Shanghai. This small station has provided us with opportunities to explore the relationship between architectures and sceneries that have exceeded its own dimension. We hope that this station can intensify its own features while serving the citizens in an easily approachable atmosphere so that the architectures can become a scenery amplifier. The name of “River Viewing Service Station” has highlighted the double appeals of the service station. © Qingshan Wu The station can be divided into two sections: The eastern part is a relatively closed public toilet while the western section is an L-shaped lounge combined with garage staircase. The northern and western sides facing the Bund are both full-height glazing and rest platforms. On the northern river-viewing platform is provided with benches along the station´s external wall, where visitors can take fitness break. Between these two parts there is a roofed vestibule cutting through the architecture, which connects the riding path in relatively low south with the river-viewing platform in relatively high north. The square planar contour of the station is in sharp contrast to the relatively complicated half-spiral straight line curved surface single-direction purline roofing structure made of copper imitated Al-Mg-Mn Alloy Sheeting. © Qingshan Wu Section © Qingshan Wu Viewed from the riverside, the station resembles a large pavilion with far-extending eaves and a lithe crimped roof, which is slightly elevated from the site. The umbrella-shaped radial purlines under the counter-slope eaves in the north have become a visual focus. The purlines converge to form a natural triangular skylight, one half in the lounge and the other half above the vestibule, illuminating the dark roof recesses and strengthening the space depths. © Qingshan Wu Viewed from the riding path in the south, the station roof is divided into two halves respectively in the east and west, which have different heights but both tilt inward. Especially, the roof at the corner of western-section stair case in the center has been depressed almost to the lowest point of visual horizon and the copper imitated plates roofing has extended to western section´s southern façade. This specially depressed dimension and the continuity between roof and façade have strengthened the entering sense of the side back to the river, guiding visitors from the central vestibule to the river scene. © Qingshan Wu Ascending step by step from the riding path through the narrow and low-rise vestibule, the roof will gradually rise with your body movement, the dense tree crowns originally at the end of the vestibule will also raise in your field of vision, breaking through the high and spacious eaves in the north. Standing on the open and clear river-viewing platform and viewing through the trunks at the bottom, you can see the glistening river surface is stretching horizontally, constituting a flowing scene with figures walking or running along the riverside. © Qingshan Wu © Qingshan Wu The benches on both sides of the vestibule will attract people to sit idly and appreciate the river scene leisurely. At this moment, you can only see the glistening river surface and feel a special tranquility when the city at the other side of the river is concealed by the trees.

Jeffrey Collins / AP,"GEORGETOWN, S.C. — The last community in the way of Hurricane Florence’s floodwaters as they slowly flow to the sea got some good news Wednesday — the predictions aren’t as dire as they once were. Officials originally expected flooding in the worst areas of Georgetown County to be from 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters). But the latest forecast lowered that estimate to 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters), according to the county’s Facebook page. Twelve days after the once-fierce hurricane arrived on the coast, and more than a week after it blew north and dissipated, rivers swollen by its relentless rains are still flooding homes and businesses in their paths as they make their way to the sea. The death toll from the storm is still adding up. North Carolina officials blamed the death of a 67-year-old man who fractured his neck cleaning up storm debris Sept. 18 in Craven County on the storm. Florence has killed at least 47 people — 36 in North Carolina; nine in South Carolina; and two in Virginia. The newest predictions from South Carolina officials moved back the peak of the flooding from Thursday to Friday in Georgetown County, where the most swollen waterways — the Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers — meet three other rivers on their way to the Atlantic Ocean. The forecasts could change again, officials warned, and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster joined the call for residents to not let their guard down. “We ae still in full battle mode in Georgetown County,” McMaster said at a Wednesday news conference. The slow-moving disaster has allowed forecasters to pinpoint exactly who will flood. There have been few rescues or surprises in South Carolina — just black, reeking water slowly seeping in and even more slowly receding. “It’s kind of playing out exactly like we forecast,” said Conway Fire Chief Le Hendrick, who sent firefighters to houses that had never flooded more than a week ago to warn them water was coming. Those same homes were flooded when firefighters surveyed them Monday and Tuesday. There appeared to be good news in Conway too. The Waccamaw River, which flows through the city of 23,000, has spent nearly a day at just over 21.1 feet (6.4 meters), some 6 inches (15 centimeters) under the predicted crest. That could avert potential environmental and transportation problems. The river water was still just inches below a coal ash pond at a closed power plant in Conway, according to the state-owned utility Santee Cooper. The floodwater from the river also had not made it over a temporary barrier hastily built on U.S. Highway 501, the main link to Myrtle Beach. Water is touching the barrier of sand and plastic called the Lifeline, but is still well below the top of it, according to the state Department of Transportation. In North Carolina, residents in Lumberton sued CSX Corp. saying the railroad company refused to give permission to build a temporary sandbag berm under a bridge until an emergency order from the governor at the last minute. The lawsuit said the underpass also created a gap in a levee that made flooding worse during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and cited a report in May where the state called for a floodgate. CSX issued a statement that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation, but noted the “extraordinary storm” devastated Lumberton and other communities with its flooding. Also in Robeson County, Sheriff Kenneth Sealey said his deputies with help from National Guard high-clearance trucks rescued 400 animals — which included dogs, cats, horses, peacocks, chickens, quail and potbellied pig — stranded on a rooftop by floodwaters in the Orrum community. About 300 more animals were found dead on the property over the weekend, Sealey said. Authorities were meeting with prosecutors Wednesday to see if the people responsible for the animals should face charges. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan Drew, Gary D. Robertson and Alex Derosier in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.","GEORGETOWN, S.C. — The last community in the way of Hurricane Florence’s floodwaters as they slowly flow to the sea got some good news Wednesday — the predictions aren’t as dire as they once were.

Zoë Schlanger,"The US government shutdown may not have secured funding for the border wall president Trump wanted, but last years budget did include $1.6 billion for the construction of 33 miles-worth of barrier, a section of which is about to be erected in Texas. And that section is slated to go right through the refuge lands of the National Butterfly Center.
Federal officials say they plan to start construction of the wall on federally-owned land nearby, but US Customs and Border Protection maps reviewed by the Associated Press show that the planned wall would cut through the butterfly center, a nearby state park, and a century-old Catholic chapel next to the river, the AP writes.
One hydraulic excavator has already been pre-positioned on land owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a US Customs and Border Protection official wrote in an email to Quartz on Wednesday (Feb. 6). Construction will begin there in mid-February, the official wrote.
On Feb. 3, the National Butterfly Center posted a photo to Facebook of a construction vehicle parked on land immediately east of us. The wall is slated to be built on a levee on the Rio Grande, which sits partly on the Butterfly Centers private property, according to the post. An officer from the Mission, Texas police departmenttold center staff that effective Monday morning, the part of the Butterfly Centers land near the levee is all government land.
Federal law permits the Department of Homeland Security to bypass environmental regulations. It also allows the federal government to seize private land under eminent domaina power that allows the government to take private property for public use. Land seizures for the wall are already in process along the Texas border, but it may prove a quagmire for the federal government. Lawsuits brought by landowners are already piling up, and could take years to resolve. In Texas, eminent domain lawsuits more than a decade old are still pending, from the last time the federal government tried to seize land for border security purposes under the George W. Bush administration.
The Butterfly Center launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay for a legal fight against the seizure, and has raised nearly $44,000 as of this writing.
Its 100-acre refuge is made up of parcels of land purchased by the nonprofit to create a corridor for endangered species. Those 100 acres lie adjacent to the US-Mexico border in the city of Mission, in Hidalgo County, which sits in the southern reaches of Texas about 100 miles east of the Gulf coast. Mission is across the Rio Grande from Reynosa, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The wall is slated to be built on a levee on the Rio Grande, but its footprintwhich extends beyond the wall itself will reportedly seal off 70 of the Butterfly Centers 100 acres. The plan that weve seen calls for 18 feet of concrete and 18 feet of steel bollards, with a 150-foot paved enforcement zone for cameras, sensors, lighting and Border Patrol traffic, Luciano Guerra, who works for the National Butterfly Center, wrote in the Washington Post in December.
The detriment to wildlife in the area will be significant, as Guerra wrote:
On the south side of the barrier, flooding will worsen. On the north side, animals (including threatened species like the Texas tortoise and the Texas horned lizard) will be cut off from ranging beyond the wall for feeding and breeding. Flood lighting will disrupt the usual patterns of nocturnal species. We dread the destruction that will come when the bulldozers arrive, which could be as early as February. That loud, heavy machinery will cause irreparable damage to the habitat weve worked so hard to restore.
The enforcement zone around the wall could also destroy sacred tribal sites, including gravesites of tribal ancestors at the Eli Jackson Cemetery in San Juan, Texas, according to the San Antonio Express-News.
The Border Protection official declined to answer whether the construction would, as reported, cut off 70 of the Butterfly Centers 100 acres, writing only that construction would be on the existing IBWC [International Boundary and Water Commission] levee.
On Monday, a group of about 35 members of local Native American tribes protested on the levee where the wall is planned to be built, the Express-News reported. Juan Mancias, tribal chair of Carrizo Comecrudo tribe of Texas, led the protest with an eagle feather staff in hand. I didnt expect it this soon, Mancias told the Express-News.","The US government shutdown may not have secured funding for the border wall president Trump wanted, but last year’s budget did include $1.6 billion for…",2019-02-07T18:12:39Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Qz.com'}",The US-Mexico border wall is planned to go straight through a butterfly sanctuary,https://qz.com/1544568/the-us-mexico-border-wall-is-planned-to-go-straight-through-a-butterfly-sanctuary/,https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/National-Butterfly-Center-land-seized-for-border-wall-construction-in-Texas-e1549492274407.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400,,Qz.com,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many communities in the U.S. with a heavy German and Russian presence, like North and South Dakota, enjoy kuchen throughout the year. Grandma’s Kuchen in Ashley, North Dakota, makes 18 different kuchen flavors, from classic cottage cheese to different varieties of chocolate. I have not eaten all 18 flavors but I can attest that the flavors I have eaten were excellent. What makes Grandma's Kuchen so unique is that it is a small business turning out what may be the best tasting kuchen anywhere using only six conventional ovens found in most kitchens across the U.S. A team of three full-time and two part-time associates bake 2,000 kuchen weekly.

"AP, AP","Cleveland Cavaliers guard Jordan Clarkson (8) makes a pass in front of Indiana Pacers center Domantas Sabonis (11) during the second half of Game 4 of an NBA basketball first-round playoff series in Indianapolis, Sunday, April 22, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Photo: The Associated Press) MILWAUKEE (AP) — Thon Maker is having his biggest games at the biggest time of the year. Not bad for a bench guy and someone who, as recently as last week, was a roster afterthought. Maker had never blocked five shots in any NBA game before this postseason began — and now he's blocked that many in each of the last two playoff contests for the Milwaukee Bucks. There's an old coaching adage that tells players to stay ready, because they never know when their chance to make an impact has arrived. Maker is proving that axiom to be correct. ""Just trying to be there for my teammates, playing aggressive,"" said Maker, the Bucks' backup center. ""It's the playoffs. These are the moments everybody plays for. You've got to find a way to win, you've got to find a way to impact the game. I try to do that every single time."" Maker is almost an out-of-nowhere story for the Bucks, who've pulled even with the Boston Celtics four games into their Eastern Conference first-round series in large part because of a defensive resurgence by the bench. His offense has helped, too: Maker scored 14 points in a Game 3 victory, his highest total since a 16-point effort on New Year's Day. There have been some big games from reserve players in these playoffs already: Miami has gotten games of 28 and 25 points from Dwyane Wade and a 26-point effort from Kelly Olynyk, Philadelphia has seen Marco Belinelli reach 21 points twice so far, and Boston saw Greg Monroe get a double-double against the Bucks in only 23 minutes. Backups can find themselves in the spotlight quickly if they get hot. ""When we step on the floor, we need to be assertive with what we do,"" Bucks coach Joe Prunty said. ""We can't be a step behind."" Even the greatest players need help. LeBron James said everyone on the Cavaliers' roster — himself included — needed to play better after falling behind Indiana 2-1 in their series. So in Game 4, James was great with 32 points, and Jordan Clarkson had 12 of the bench's 32 points to help Cleveland tie the series. ""I'm supposed to come and give a spark off the bench,"" said Clarkson, who scored just two points in Game 3. ""That's what I'm supposed to do, change the game in that way."" Toronto had one of the top bench units in the NBA during the regular season, ranking fifth in the league with a combined 41.8 scoring average. But in the East's No. 1 seed's first-round series, the Raptors' reserve scoring down to 34.5 points. They're tied at 2 in the series with the eighth-seeded Washington Wizards, whose bench scoring is up in the series by about the same margin to 34.3 points. The Wizards were just 16th in bench scoring this season. A big reason for Toronto's problems has been the absence of backup point guard Fred VanVleet, who has an injured right shoulder and played just three minutes so far, sitting out three of the four games entirely. Raptors coach Dwane Casey blamed his team's high turnover totals — 37 over Games 3 and 4, both losses — in large part on his reserves, who he also thought were not as productive with the ball as they could have been. ""The second unit turned down some shots that they normally take,"" Casey said. ""I thought that group started the turnovers. The levee broke on those guys. I've got to do a better job of putting them in the right situation where they don't turn it over."" The Wizards tinkered with their rotations to try to keep the Raptors' reserves in check. ""Our bench has done a good job and we've kind of tried to change things up and throw maybe a starter or two with our bench,"" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. As for the Celtics, they're back in Boston to get ready to host the Bucks on Tuesday night for Game 5. Their frontcourt reserves of Monroe and Marcus Morris were dominant in the series' second game last week, when it looked as if Boston might pull off a sweep. Milwaukee's reserves have pushed back with active, physical play — matching Boston's intensity. ""As soon as (we) see that,"" Maker said, ""we start to get aggressive as well on the defensive end."" ___ AP Sports Writers Howard Fendrich and Michael Marot contributed to this story. ___ For more AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Walter Isaacson,"When I was in my late teens, I worked some summers and weekends as a longshoreman on the docks and derrick barges of the New Orleans riverfront. The pay was great, and the work, though hot, was not as hard as people thought. From that experience, I developed a sense of romance about the Mississippi River. Like Huck Finn, I came to associate it with freedom and frontiers and race and card players and lighting out for the territory. I once tried to write a novel about it, which was truly bad and still sits in a bottom drawer of my desk. During my last year as the editor of this magazine, in 2000, I indulged this romance by taking a group of writers and editors on a two-week boat trip down the river from Missouri to the Louisiana swamps to produce a special issue on what we called “the river of dreams.” One of the main things we saw was how communities all along the river–from Hannibal to St. Louis to Memphis to Natchez to New Orleans–were drawing on this romance to attract tourism. In an age of big-box stores and Amazon, with manufacturing in decline, the river towns of the South were exposing every brick of every warehouse and building to create quaint shopping and entertaining experiences. In New Orleans, the Esplanade Avenue wharf where I once worked as a kid is being converted into a music and performance venue to draw visitors from nearby Frenchman Street and the French Quarter. The levee walk in front of Jackson Square, where I proposed to my wife, has just been upgraded into a magical promenade. And in the newly gentrified Bywater and Marigny neighborhoods, rotting docks have given way to Crescent Park, a ribbon of gardens and bike paths and art installations and performance spaces. Now that I have moved back to New Orleans, I have become less mesmerized by the romance of the river and more respectful of its gritty reality and the economy it supports. Earlier this summer, I took a boat ride to look at the facilities of the Port of New Orleans. We embarked at a spot that embodied the tourist elements of the riverfront, next to the sprawling convention center where the Essence Festival was in full swing and a warehouse that now houses a float-filled attraction called Mardi Gras World. But within minutes we were exploring the container terminals and break-bulk facilities that make the combined ports of New Orleans and South Louisiana, the latter of which boasts the largest in the U.S. in terms of tonnage. Huge amounts of the nation’s grain goes through these ports, as does most imported steel, coffee and rubber and exported poultry, plastic resin and petrochemical products. There’s something noble about the economy of the port, especially in an era when good-paying middle- and working-class jobs are in decline. Unlike tourism and hospitality, which create many jobs but most at comparatively lower wages, the average salary of the workers in port jobs is $63,000, or 35% higher than the average for other local jobs. In addition to decreasing income disparities, jobs at the port and elsewhere on the Mississippi River tend to decrease racial inequalities, something that Huck and Jim on their raft would have appreciated. Even in the early 1970s, when I worked on the river, there was a rule of the local longshoremen unions and stevedoring companies: all crews formed each morning, whether they were working the docks or barges or tugboats, would have an equal number of black and white members. It spread to other sectors. The doctors and dentists who served the longshoremen health plans, for example, had to take both black and white patients. It led my grandfather to partner in his practice with Dr. Andrew Young Sr., whose son became the noted civil rights leader. The commerce and constantly flowing mix of people help create a worldliness and an appreciation for diversity that is sometimes lacking in more inland and insular towns. The foods have more ingredients, the music has more influences, and the accents have more inflections, especially if you’re within a horn blast of the Port of New Orleans. In a world that is becoming less comfortable with diversity, it would be nice if everyone could spend some time at a big river port. We devote a lot of energy, especially in places like New Orleans, thinking of ways to increase tourism. That’s fine. But we also need to focus on nurturing and improving our port. Like other ports, it suffers from our national inattention to critical infrastructure. The money spent on seemingly mundane things like new cranes and terminals will generate jobs in local port-related industries and also enhance distribution for the agricultural and industrial products from the 40% of America whose shipping needs are served by the Mississippi. At the end of my boat ride past the port facilities, I saw the work that is being done to divert some of the river sediment so it can help restore the disappearing marshes and wetlands of the Gulf of Mexico. That, too, is necessary to protect the commerce and shipping needs of the nation. Both the commerce carried by the river and the nutrients it brings to our coast reminded me of an analogy that was at the heart of both the art and the engineering of Leonardo da Vinci. He said the body of the earth was like the body of a human, with the rivers serving as the arteries that bring nourishment to us and the earth around us. That is why so many of his paintings, culminating with the Mona Lisa, show a river coming from the ancient mountains in the background and seeming to flow into the body and arteries of his human subject. “I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river is a strong brown god,” the St. Louis native T.S. Eliot wrote. As he tells us in The Dry Salvages, we should not merely romanticize the Mississippi. We should also respect it.

Elizabeth Kolbert, in her article about rising sea levels, ascribes much of Louisianas disappearing coastline to the levee system (Under Water, April 1st). The levees are indeed a significant cause of the problem, but they arent the only one. Scientists employed by oil and gas companies have conceded that their industry is responsible for at least thirty-six per cent of the land loss. River dams are also a problem: on the Missouri, which empties into the Mississippi, just six dams retain roughly a hundred million tons of sedimenta quarter of the entire sediment load that the Mississippi once carried to the Gulf. At the mouth of the Mississippi, two-mile-long shipping-channel jetties divert a substantial amount of sediment into deep water, where it cant contribute to building land. These and other engineering interventions have catastrophically disrupted the coastal ecosystem, destroying communities, industries, and lives.

Wellness Culture
There are many reasons to be skeptical of Outdoor Voices, the faddish clothing brand that Jia Tolentino writes about in her recent piece on athleisure, and its C.E.O.s commitment to the health of its customers (Athleisure Time, March 18th). Chief among these is the fact that a significant amount of the brands clothing is made of plastic. Only a few weeks ago, The New Yorker ran a piece by Carolyn Kormann about the worlds growing addiction to plastic, which is severely degrading the ocean environment. A 2017 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated that thirty-five per cent of microplastics entering the ocean comes from synthetic textiles. As Kormann explains, scientists around the world are gravely concerned about these microplastics, which take decades to break down and are becoming increasingly present in our food cycle. Customers of clothing companies like Outdoor Voices should realize that they arent just wearing plasticeventually, they might be eating it, too.
Henry Seth Resnik

After spending time with the staff and the C.E.O. of Outdoor Voices, Tolentino observes that she has never been less able to distinguish what was good from what was profitable, or my life from my work. The concept of wellness promoted by Outdoor Voices and many other companies depends on the blurring of another distinction: between virtue and health. These brands encourage customers who have the time and the money to get fit to feel superior about their ability to do so. Going to a Pilates class or drinking an expensive juice isnt a moral act; its just another form of consumption.
Becca Schonberg
Oakland, Calif.
Tolentino includes the clothing brand Nasty Gal in her list of companies that, like Outdoor Voices, are highly visible, female-centered, life-style-adjacent, digital-savvy millennial brands built around a charismatic founder and her story. Its true that when Sophia Amoruso founded Nasty Girl, in 2006, her personality was central to the branding of the company. Initially, this seemed like a successful formula. But by 2015 Amoruso had resigned as C.E.O., and by 2017 the company had declared bankruptcy, after spending heavily on advertising that failed to build a long-term customer base. The brand was bought by an online fashion retailer. Entrepreneurs seeking to emulate the early success of companies like Nasty Gal would do well to consider the whole story.

Melissa del Bosque,"The first new segment of border wall to be constructed under President Trump will bisect a butterfly conservation center, a historic church, and a state park along the Texas border. The construction is set to begin in February. In March, Congress appropriated $1.6 billion to build Trumps border wall his signature campaign issue. But Congress earmarked most of the funding to reinforce or replace already existing segments of border fencing. The southern border already has nearly 700 miles of border fencing and barriers built in the last decade. In October, Trump had a gold plaque attached to a two-mile stretch of border fence in Calexico, California, with his name on it to commemorate the first new stretch of Trumps wall. But the fence was a replacement for an older fence built in the 1990s. The recently announced 6 miles will be the first new segment of border wall built in a new location by the Trump administration. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced the new border wall last Friday four days before the midterm elections in a press release. But CBP did not say where the new wall would be located, only that it would be in Hidalgo County, Texas. Several calls and emails to CBP to confirm the location went unreturned. But Steve Lightfoot, a spokesperson for Texas Parks and Wildlife, confirmed today that Trumps new segment of border wall would be built through Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park and surrounding areas in Mission, Texas. The park will more than likely close after the wall is constructed, since the land was deeded in a family trust to be expressly used as public parkland. The border wall will also run through national wildlife refuge land and through the nonprofit National Butterfly Center, also in Mission. The center is home to at least 100 species of butterfly, and serves as critical habitat for the migration of the threatened Monarch butterfly and endangered species including the ocelot and jaguarundi. Marianna Treviño Wright, director of the center, said that CBP has been deliberately secretive about where new segments of wall will be built because the majority of residents there do not want it. Theres been no public meetings, no outreach and no effort to reach out to Spanish-speaking residents, she said. Marianna Treviño Wright, director of the National Butterfly Center, looks over a government map where CBP has said it will build President Trumps border wall in Texas. Photo: Verónica G. Cárdenas for The Intercept In August 2017, more than 1,000 people walked several miles from the Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Mission to the historic La Lomita Chapel a 120-year-old mission chapel also in the border walls path to protest construction of the wall. This August another protest with several hundred people was held at the National Butterfly Center, which has become the de facto headquarters for border wall resistance in the area. I feared that wed be the first to get the wall, Treviño Wright said. The bulldozers could be rolling in here as early as February. In the summer of 2017, she discovered private contractors with chainsaws destroying critical habitat at the center, to make way for the wall. In December 2017, the center filed suit against the federal government, citing unlawful incursion and deprivation of due process as well as violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal protection laws. But under the Secure Fence Act passed in 2006, the Department of Homeland Security can waive hundreds of federal laws to build the wall. And Treviño Wright thinks that the Department of Homeland Security will file a quick take condemnation. Under eminent domain the federal government can literally seize the land and do whatever they like before anything is negotiated or adjudicated, she said. Because of the expansive Rio Grande floodplain, the border wall is being built as far as a mile from the river, which serves as the international boundary with Mexico. This means that the wall would bisect the butterfly center, leaving 70 acres between the wall and the river, with the visitors center on the north side. It will also more than likely destroy La Lomita Chapel, built in 1899, because CBP also wants to create a 150-foot enforcement zone south of the wall, which will include an all weather road, camera towers, and other surveillance. Father Roy Snipes, a popular Catholic priest who holds services at La Lomita Chapel, has led several protests against the wall. If they put a wall on the levee, our chapel will be on the other side of it, he said. Snipes said CBP, which is in charge of the wall construction, has told them very little about its plans for the historic church. Its like what you hear out of the White House. Nobody knows anything. According to the CBP press release, the new structure will be a pedestrian, levee wall, which means that an existing earthen levee that is used for flood control more than a mile from the Rio Grande will be replaced with concrete and topped with a steel bollard wall. Some levee border wall, built nearly a decade ago, already exists in Hidalgo County and ranges from 18 to 30 feet high. Treviño Wright said CBP has deliberately kept border communities in the dark. And that theres been a lot of confusion about when and where the border wall will be built. Ive heard many landowners in the area say we need to stop Trumps border wall from being funded, she said. Theyre not even aware its already been funded. And guess what? Theyre building it here.","Trump’s new segment of border wall will be built through Bentsen Rio Grande Valley State Park, in Mission, Texas, up to a mile from the Rio Grande.

(Photo: DAVID GOLDMAN, AP) The relentless pounding from Florence, downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical depression but still a troublemaker, has submerged large portions of the Carolinas, killed at least 17 people and left 575,000 households and businesses without power. The worst may still be ahead. Dams and levees in areas pelted by Florence since Thursday were showing signs of distress as rivers overran their banks and authorities warned of more flooding to come. Landslides have become a concern as well — especially in North Carolina’s western mountains. Tens of thousands faced mandatory evacuation orders from communities along the state’s steadily rising rivers — with the Cape Fear, Little, Lumber, Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers all projected to overrun their banks. The slow-moving storm, located about 45 miles north of Greenville, South Carolina, at 11 p.m. EDT Sunday, was expected to dump 40 inches of rain on North Carolina before it heads north on Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said. “Flooding and catastrophic/historic river flooding will continue over a significant portion of the Carolinas,’’ the center said. Last Slide Next Slide Emergency personnel have performed more than 900 water rescues in North Carolina, according to the governor’s office, and hundreds more are awaiting help.Efforts to rescue them were complicated by the closure of roads, including parts of interstates 95 and 40. “The risk to life is rising with the angry waters,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be alert for sudden flooding.” A dam failure in Hoke County, North Carolina, west of Fayetteville, prompted officials to evacuate areas downstream and raised the specter of further such failures. In Rowan County, north of Charlotte, a flash flood warning was issued Sunday night over concerns about the Lake Corriher levee, which had a partial breach. In New Bern, North Carolina, the mayor said Florence had damaged 4,200 homes and more than 300 commercial buildings in his city, forcing 1,200 residents into shelters. Those reports came amid news that a 3-month-old baby had died after a tree fell on a mobile home, part of another grim, soggy day as the Carolinas continued to take the brunt of the storm. Eleven fatalities have been reported in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. Among the confirmed deaths: a man who drowned when a pickup truck flipped into a drainage ditch, a couple who died of carbon monoxide poisoning running a generator indoors, a woman whose vehicle hit a tree branch, a pickup truck driver who died after the vehicle struck a bridge support and another pickup driver who lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree.

Henry McMaster told reporters it would be days until the cresting of rivers in the most worrisome area, along the state’s border with North Carolina. Officials have been warning for days that flooding could be disastrous in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin, into which several swollen rivers that originate in North Carolina flow. Florence’s heavy rains have sent water levels rising so high that they have submerged instruments used by the federal government to monitor river levels in North Carolina, causing at least two of them to stop working. Both had been set higher than 20 feet, well above the heights floodwaters were expected to reach. The hurricane center said Florence may dump up to eight more inches of rain in some areas before heading north and dropping another 2-5 inches of rain to the mid-Atlantic states and southern New England.

"by Al Shaw, Lisa Song, Katie Campbell and Ranjani Chakraborty","Levees — massive earthen or concrete structures that keep rivers confined to their channels — tame the flow of rivers and make life possible for the millions of people who live behind them. But they come with often-unexamined risks, as they can make floods worse for the communities across the river or upstream from them. Related story: Flood Thy Neighbor: Who stays dry and who decides? This is well-known to scientists and supported by basic physics, but we wanted to see it for ourselves. So, instead of waiting for a huge flood, we built our own. ProPublica and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting hired engineers at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis to build a physical model of four levee scenarios to see how levee height and placement choices can put surrounding communities on the floodplain — the low-lying land near river channels — at greater risk of flooding. The St. Anthony Falls Laboratory was built into the banks of the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis in 1938. Since then researchers there have used it to study rivers, constructing large, elaborate physical models that make use of the Mississippi itself. One of the SAFL engineers, Robert Gabrielson, built a working model of a river in a 10-foot by 13-foot box with an artificial turf floodplain and a miniature river channel running down the center. He made the levees out of PVC trim — flexible, plastic strips — and piped actual Mississippi River water through the channel, along with a steady supply of sediment. He adjusted the water’s flow rate to simulate normal river conditions as well as floods. The lab is equipped with sophisticated scanners that record high-resolution elevation and water surface data. We added tiny wooden houses to represent communities on the floodplain. Though the model isn't to scale, nor a scientific study, it effectively simulates the basic physics of the conditions facing many of the people who live near the nation's 100,000 miles of levees. The four river scenarios we modeled were: no levees; two levees of the same height on both sides; a higher levee on one side than the other; and a single ""setback"" levee, built further back, which preserves some of the natural floodplain. For each scenario, we gradually increased the flow rate of the water running through the channel — from 50 gallons per minute to almost 200 gallons per minute in some scenarios. Use the buttons below to see what happens as the flow increases. Use buttons above to adjust water flow rate through the channel Swipe to explore levee scenarios No Levees When a free-flowing river floods, water jumps the river's banks and flows onto the floodplain. Equal-Height Levees When rivers have similar terrain on both sides, equal-height levees keep both banks dry. Unequal-Height Levees When one levee is taller than the other, or when people overbuild their levees, the extra height — ¼-inch in our model — is enough to shift some large floods to the other side of the river. See it yourself by turning up the flow rate of the water to 140 gallons per minute. Setback Levees Setback levees are built further back, allowing part of the natural floodplain to flood. This lowers water heights while still protecting areas behind the levees, and pushes less water upstream. Setback levees are common in the Netherlands but still rare in the U.S. Just like in the real world, when we added levees to the model, water ran faster and higher when trapped between levees. When people on one side of the river raise their levees, they can push a wall of water onto their neighbors across the river. The people with the lower levee often have no recourse but to try to build up their own defenses. What Happens in the Real World The model we built in Minnesota showed a few simple examples of what could happen when people live near levees. But what do the effects look like in the real world? Two university researchers did a study of the effects of levees in 2011. Reuben Heine of Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, and Nicholas Pinter at the University of California-Davis looked at 13 levees in Illinois and Iowa. Every levee they studied increased flooding across the river or upstream—sometimes by up to five feet. Heine and Pinter proved what many scientists consider to be basic physics: during a flood, extra water always has to go somewhere. If a river has levees on only one side, some water is pushed across the river, flooding unprotected areas even more. But if a river has levees on both sides, the water between the levees piles up. In both cases, the water backs up, adding extra risk to nearby unprotected land upstream of the levee. Scientists consider it a given that levees make flooding worse. It’s mentioned in Earth Science 101 textbooks, said Anne Jefferson, a geology professor at Kent State University. “It’s not terribly difficult to work out what happens when you’re squeezing things along a nozzle.” Fredrik Huthoff, an engineering consultant in the Netherlands who specializes in flooding and river science, compared this to a traffic jam: River water backs up behind the bottleneck caused by the levees. A Watery Traffic Jam A 2011 study of levee systems in Iowa and Illinois found three broad patterns in how levees affect flood levels. Upstream from levees, water levels rise, sometimes sharply, while downstream, heights drop slightly. heine-diagram-equal A Upstream of Levee Because levees constrain rivers, water heights upstream of levees rise higher than they would without levees. One engineer compared it to a traffic jam. B Alongside the Levee When the river floods, water heights alongside levees are pushed even higher than those upstream. C Downstream of Levee Downstream of a levee, water heights are a little lower because the water moves faster after being squeezed through levees. Source: Heine/Pinter, 2011 Heine and Pinter only looked at 13 levees because there isn’t enough good data. Heine told us that although they started with 203 possible sites to study, they had to throw out nearly all of them because the government-funded stream gauges necessary to study levees weren't collecting enough data, or weren't in place before the levees were built, or weren't in the right place in the river relative to levees. Still, in the 13 cases that were usable, the pattern was clear. After Levees Were Built, Floods Got Worse on the Wabash River Near Mt. Carmel, Illinois Source: US Geological Survey. Note: Water height is measured in feet from the gauge elevation. To rule out other reasons why water levels might rise — such as a landslide or extra sediment that might have raised the bottom of the river channel — Heine and Pinter also looked at gauge data from when the river is flowing, but not flooding. In these cases, they found no differences in pre- and post-levee water levels. Jonathan Remo, a Southern Illinois University professor who studies flooding in the Midwest, told us he wasn't surprised by Heine and Pinter's study, since it confirms what's been shown through computer modeling, and echoes decades of research on how levees and other engineering projects have aggravated flooding, particularly along the Mississippi River. Among the most striking examples Heine and Pinter found was in the gauge data near Mt. Carmel, a southern Illinois town just across the Wabash River from Indiana. The Army Corps built levees on both sides of the river near the town in the late 1960s. Heine and Pinter found that the two levees constricted the Wabash floodplain and forced water levels nearly three feet higher than they would have been for a minor flood, the kind of flood that has a 10 percent chance of occurring in a given year. Most of that water was pushed upstream of the pinch point into the area where the Wabash meets the White River nearby. We asked Heine to map out roughly what that 10 percent chance flood would look like near Mt. Carmel before and after the levee: Case Study Wabash River at Mt. Carmel, Ill. Mt. Carmel is a town in southern Illinois on the Wabash River, where it meets the White River in Indiana. It serves as a good case study for how levees work because it has a long record of continuous USGS stream gauge data, and not much else has been built in the floodplain besides a pair of levees, making it easier to isolate the effects levees have on flood levels. Here's what a flood with a 10 percent chance of happening each year would have looked like before the Army Corps built levees in the mid-1960s. Water would have spread out into the area now occupied by the cooling pond for Duke Energy's power plant and other low-lying areas on both the Illinois and Indiana sides of the river. After levees were built, they cut off most of the Wabash River's ability to reach the floodplain below the intersection with the White River, and water heights rose. In the same flood, water heights would be about three feet higher, and parts of Gibson and Knox counties would be flooded.

SAFL staff collected and processed high resolution topography and water surface elevation data from the model for ProPublica and Reveal. Heine and Pinter’s original paper found the levee raised flood levels by more than seven feet, but a review of the Wabash River stream gauge’s history, prompted by ProPublica and Reveal, confirmed the maximum change is closer to five feet. To create pre- and post-levee inundation layers on the Wabash River, Heine applied USGS stream gauge data to USGS high resolution lidar elevation data.

Elizabeth Zwirz,"A $145 million construction project was awarded Wednesday to build roughly six miles of border wall in Texas, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced on Friday. The agency, in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers, gave the multimillion-dollar job in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector to SLSCO, CBP said in a news release. Work on the project, also known by CBP as RGV-03, is expected to kick off in February, the agency said. Among the anticipated work is the building and set up “of tactical infrastructure,” which includes “a reinforced concrete levee wall to the height of the existing levee, 18 feet tall steel bollards installed on top of the concrete wall, and vegetation removal along a 150 foot enforcement zone throughout the approximately six miles of levee wall system,” the news release said. The area will also be equipped with detection technology and video surveillance, the agency said. The Rio Grande Valley Sector has “high illegal cross border activity,” according to CBP. “Once constructed, this levee wall system will serve as a persistent impediment to transnational criminal organizations, while still allowing river access for property owners, other federal/state/local officials, local emergency responders, and USBP,” the agency said. “CBP continues to implement President Trump’s Executive Order 13767 -- also known as Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements -- and continues to take steps to expeditiously plan, design, and construct a physical wall using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border,” the agency continued. The announcement from the CBP comes as a caravan of Central American migrants makes its way toward the U.S.-Mexico border, and as Trump has unveiled plans to deploy troops at the southern border.

Associated Press,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Floodwaters are receding across most of the hard-hit Midwest, but there could be new problems if the forecast for significant rain later this week holds up. Already the flooding along the Missouri River and its tributaries has caused at least $3 billion damage and forced thousands from their homes as floodwaters penetrated or flowed over several hundred miles of levees.
The flooding is blamed in three confirmed deaths, and two Nebraska men have been missing for more than a week.
Extensive damage
The flooding has taken a heavy toll on agriculture in the region, inundating tens of thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock. Thousands of people have been forced from their homes in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, and some have yet to return to assess the damage. Residents of Kansas City, Missouri, are being asked to conserve water while KC Water treats murky water caused by filtration issues. Flooding has closed about 140 roads in Missouri, even as water levels begin falling along much of the Missouri River.
Officials in those three states plan to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine if any changes need to be made to the system of levees that is supposed to protect towns and cities from swollen rivers.
Yet more flood damage is possible as spring rains arrive and more snow in northern states melts and flows into rivers.
“We’re not done yet and I think that’s the other thing that we want to make sure folks are watching very closely,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said.
Lingering problems
Flooding continues to cause problems along several major rivers in the eastern Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota.
The National Weather Service says there’s a 10 percent chance the Red River will approach the 2009 record of 41 feet (12.5 meters) in Fargo, North Dakota, and neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota.
Both cities have implemented significant flood-fighting measures in the last decade, including home buyouts and levees that could be tested this year. But both cities have still declared emergencies and are launching sandbag-filling efforts — 1 million sandbags in Fargo and 150,000 in Moorhead.
Spring flooding also is a concern in southern Minnesota. Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and U.S. Rep. Angie Craig were among the public officials who joined Hastings residents to fill thousands of sandbags over the weekend. The Mississippi River at Hastings is forecast to rise to major flood stage this week.
In eastern South Dakota, major flooding is expected along the James and the Big Sioux rivers in the next couple of weeks, though record crests are not anticipated, according to Mike Gillispie, National Weather Service hydrologist in Sioux Falls.
“Sioux Falls itself should be in pretty good shape,” he said. “Just upstream (on the Big Sioux), though, Baltic, Dell Rapids, Trent, some of those smaller communities up through that stretch of river, there are significant impacts up there. Roads in the cities are being flooded, maybe even houses.”
Forecast fears
The weather service predicts eastern Nebraska and western Iowa could receive 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of rain from Wednesday to Friday. That much rain would certainly send river levels higher, creating problems for homes behind levees that were weakened in the initial flooding.
The forecast may be revised as the storm gets closer. Meteorologist Bryon Miller said the good news is that the river crests following this week’s forecast storm will likely be lower than during recent floods.
“It doesn’t look like it will be anywhere near the crests we saw at the height of this,” said Miller, from the NWS office in Valley, Nebraska.
A combination of heavy rains and rapid snowmelt atop ground that was already saturated and in some places still frozen sent the Missouri River and other rivers over the top earlier this month.
Flood flow
This week’s storm system could also bring rain to the Mississippi River basin and exacerbate problems there.
But so far most of the flooding along the Mississippi hasn’t created major issues, National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Hladik said.
“The current levels are somewhat routine along the Mississippi,” Hladik said.
The Mississippi is expected to crest sometime in April, depending on the timing of spring rains and snowmelt. The river will be susceptible to flooding over the next month, Hladik said.
The Mississippi River is expected to keep rising in the Minnesota capital of St. Paul this week after reaching major flood stage Monday morning. About half a dozen roads in the city are closed, as well as several parks and boat launches. City leaders have started building a temporary levee in the Lowertown area of St. Paul.

"by Lisa Song, ProPublica, Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, and Alex Heeb, The Telegraph of Alton, Illinois","Nearly a year after record Midwestern floods killed at least five people and caused $1.7 billion in damage, a secretive lobbying effort funded by Illinois and Missouri drainage districts is underway to roll back flood regulations, documents show. The effort targets the authority of the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the nation’s federal levees — large hills that are typically built or strengthened by the Corps and are subject to its rules, but are managed by local drainage districts. Any time a district wants to permanently raise the height of a levee for more protection, it has to seek approval from the Corps, which considers whether a request would be “injurious to the public interest” before issuing a Section 408 permit. The process is intended to prevent “levee wars,” in which communities race to build ever-higher levees at the expense of their neighbors. Levees constrict rivers, narrowing them and blocking off the floodplains that allow the water to spread out. This bottleneck effect ensures that towns with lower levees are more likely to flood. But since mid-2016, lobbyists and attorneys working for a group called the 408 Coalition have spent at least $230,000 in taxpayer money to weaken the Army Corps’ authority to limit levee heights and influence the agency’s funding, according to thousands of pages of coalition documents and correspondence obtained by the Telegraph of Alton, Illinois. See the Map An analysis of the records by the Telegraph, ProPublica and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting shows coalition members held dozens of meetings with top Army Corps officials and congressional staffers between October 2016 and last fall. Aided by lobbyists and lawyers at the Missouri-based law firm Husch Blackwell, the coalition provided Congress members with white papers on their legislative goals and drafted text for pending bills. The records reflect that the coalition’s most prominent backer is the Sny Island Levee Drainage District, which manages a 54-mile levee system along the Mississippi River in west-central Illinois. The Sny has long flouted the Corps’ restrictions on levee height. It pushed up its levees a decade ago without federal permission, and since then, residents across the river in Pike County, Missouri, have blamed the higher barriers for worsening floods that inundated farms and closed businesses in the riverfront towns of Clarksville and Louisiana. A new analysis of Corps data shows that, by protecting itself, the Sny district has increased flooding upstream and in Pike County. “In my estimation, every day [the Sny is] in violation of the law,” said Pike County emergency management director Al Murry. “And there’s nothing being done.” The Corps responded to the Sny’s disregard for its rules in 2015, disqualifying the district from a Corps-funded levee repair program. The 408 Coalition appears to have been spearheaded by Sny officials with the goal of rallying at least 11 levee and flood control districts in the Midwest and South to fight what they see as federal overreach. So far, records show, the coalition has taken credit for preventing legislative action that would have expanded the Corps’ authority over levees. The effort’s ambitions are far larger, however — and perhaps achievable with help from a sympathetic White House, which included a proposal giving local levee managers an easy path to taking levees out of Corps jurisdiction in its larger infrastructure plan. The 408 Coalition’s ultimate goal, the documents show, is nothing short of a “ permanent solution ” under which the Corps no longer has a role in limiting the heights of levees managed by local officials. “We had a lot of traction in fact on 408,” Husch Blackwell attorney David Human wrote to a coalition member in March 2017 after a trip to Washington. “We heard from a senior official from Corps Headquarters that ‘408 is on a death spiral.’ We can only hope.” It’s impossible to tell from federal lobbying disclosures who is part of the 408 Coalition. The group operates with little public disclosure. It has no website, nor has it publicized its campaign. When the Telegraph reporter made a public records request to the coalition, he was told they didn’t have to grant it, because the group exists in name only and doesn’t keep records. All that was apparent by the fall of 2017 was that the group had hired a litigation and business law firm, Husch Blackwell, that specializes in levees and flood protection, and was paying it for lobbying related to Section 408 permitting. It was only when the reporter guessed that the Sny might be involved, and filed a request to the government levee district for documents including invoices and emails, that a picture began to emerge. Requests sent to additional levee districts, including those mentioned in the Sny’s correspondence, revealed a list of 11 local government agencies that took part in coalition activities. The documents suggest another 12 levee districts could belong to the coalition. Husch Blackwell attorneys declined to identify them. Around the time the reporter began making records requests, descriptions of work on the coalition’s invoices became terse. Entries that had previously contained long narratives about coalition lobbying trips now used vague phrases such as “ Work on permit issues.” On top of the $230,000 reported to Congress, invoices from individual districts show an additional $98,000 paid to the firm for work on lobbying-related business. Get ProPublica’s Major Investigations by Email Husch Blackwell declined to discuss the coalition’s goals and actions. But the documents give a window into the coalition’s strategy, activities and claimed successes. The group’s main argument is that because Section 408 was written in 1899, when the Corps wasn’t responsible for flood control, the Corps has no authority to use 408 permits when levees are already managed by local districts. Instead, the coalition wants the Corps to use a 1944 statute written for flood control — one that doesn’t mention “the public interest.” The 1899 statute specifically mentions levees, and an Army Corps spokesman said there’s “no evidence that Congress ever intended the law to be narrowly applied.” Husch Blackwell attorney Karin Jacoby outlined an initial strategy for the coalition in July 2016: the law firm would arrange meetings with Corps leadership and seek to influence the Water Resources Development Act of 2016, a biennial bill from Congress that sets Army Corps priorities and policies. Jacoby estimated it would take about 300 hours and cost $100,000. “It is doubtful that a smaller effort could be as impactful as need be,” she wrote. By August, the firm was recruiting levee districts, explaining that the coalition — and not its member districts — would be listed as a client in lobbying disclosure forms. The coalition considered two amendments to the water resources bill particularly troublesome, because they included language that Jacoby believed could strengthen the Corps’ power over levees. Neither made it into the final law, and, in a February 2017 email to coalition members, Jacoby declared their work a success in preserving “the status quo.” One of those amendments came from a Louisiana Republican, Rep. Garret Graves, a second-term congressman who previously led post-Katrina levee building efforts in his home state. He’s been a critic of the Corps, saying its bureaucracy has created dangerous delays for communities waiting on critical flood control projects. In an interview, Graves wouldn’t credit the coalition with single-handedly influencing the bill, but he praised its work. “The 408 Coalition is attacking a real injustice,” he said. “They do have a strong voice. They’re well organized. There’s a lot of merit to their concerns, and they’ve brought forth some good solutions.” Graves agrees with the coalition that the Corps “invented this interpretation” of Section 408; he sees promise in finding creative ways to fund levee improvements that simply cut that agency out of the process. Read the Story The coalition signaled its admiration for Graves’ work in September 2017 by inviting its members to a fundraiser for the congressman at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington. The group also distributed its talking points to two White House infrastructure experts last March, about a year before the Trump administration released the infrastructure plan that proposed simplifying the process for taking levees out of the federal system. One of the experts, D.J. Gribbin, is a top White House infrastructure advisor. Gribbin said the idea wasn’t inspired by the coalition, but by a desire to give communities more flexibility to manage their infrastructure. “Nothing in this document is designed to impair public safety,” and it’s up to Congress to hash out the details, Gribbin said. According to federal lobbying disclosures, the 408 Coalition officially disbanded at the end of 2017. However, around that time, several coalition members including the Sny signed on for Husch Blackwell lobbying services under their own names. The biggest contributor to the coalition, the Sny, appears to have paid about $165,000 between November 2016 and September 2017 — about 8 percent of the Sny’s annual budget — under an existing legal services agreement with Husch. One commissioner for the Sny, Russell Koeller, was surprised to learn from reporters how much had been spent. “It shocked me when I read that because I just did not think it was that high,” Koeller said. In a later email, Koeller said the district hadn’t spent all that money challenging the Corps’ 408 authority. “Much of our effort with government officials concerns other items,” including federal flood insurance, environmental regulations and local dams, he wrote. Koeller said he was confident the Sny was getting good value for its money. “That’s the kind of a firm that you need to go to, and that doesn’t come cheap,” he said. “They’re expensive people. And these complex issues take a huge amount of time and research. You can’t just call them up on the phone and get an opinion. It doesn’t work like that.” Sny levee representatives say they are victims of regulatory overreach. “Our primary concern with Section 408,” Koeller explained in an email, “is the completely incorrect interpretation of a very old navigation regulation that for over 100 years never, ever applied to levee height and in fact was illegally applied retroactively to us and other levee districts … of course we are trying to correct this!” Scott Whitney, a flood risk manager at the Corps’ Rock Island, Illinois office, said he’s sympathetic to the challenge of navigating state and federal regulations, but that’s no excuse for non-compliance. The Corps’ levee safety program has gotten more stringent since Hurricane Katrina, “for good reason,” he said. As for the work ahead for officials who participated in the coalition, Husch Blackwell attorney Jacoby told one levee official in July 2017 that the group would focus on the next version of the Water Resources Development Act. Lawmakers have begun hearings but have yet to file that bill, which could change how the Corps enforces limits on local levee districts.","by Lisa Song, ProPublica, Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, and Alex Heeb, The Telegraph of Alton, Illinois Nearly a year after record Midwestern floods killed at least five people and caused $1.7 billion in damage, a secret…",2018-03-30T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Propublica.org'}",Inside a Secretive Lobbying Effort to Deregulate Federal Levees,https://www.propublica.org/article/deregulate-federal-levees-section-408-permit-secretive-lobbying-effort,https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20180330-levees-sidebar-1200x630.jpg?1522400442,,Propublica.org,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent survey of the levees in the Army Corps of Engineers' Rock Island District showed that, if all the levees up and down the river were built to authorized heights, there would be widespread inundation in a flood like the one that devastated the Midwest in 1993. But an analysis of data from the Corps found that a handful of levee districts have raised levees above those heights without getting the necessary permits. The analysis showed that these districts would stay dry in a flood of that size, saving some of them from more than 16 feet of water. That extra water would be pushed onto towns along the river that have no levees, and other levee districts that have followed the rules by keeping their levees at authorized heights. 0 2 feet of extra flooding The Army Corps and state officials have struggled to enforce regulations on levee raising. Levees in at least one of the districts have been overbuilt for 10 years. Do you think you've experienced flooding because of a nearby levee?

"by Al Shaw and Lisa Song, ProPublica, and Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting","By Al Shaw and Lisa Song, ProPublica, and Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, September 6, 2018 When the worst flood in nearly a century hit Cairo, Illinois, in 2011, the Army Corps of Engineers waited for several critical days before following an emergency plan designed to save the impoverished, majority-black city of 2,800 people. A reconstruction by ProPublica and Reveal based on reports of how that week unfolded shows delays and indecision that cost millions in avoidable damage. | Related Story → This 130,000-acre patch of farmland in Missouri is the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. In 1928, Congress authorized using this land as an emergency-release valve for the Mississippi River — to save the Illinois city of Cairo during a bad flood, the Corps can blow up the levee protecting the floodway to intentionally flood the land. The Corps' guidelines allow the floodway to be opened when the Ohio River reaches 58 feet on the Cairo gauge (an instrument that measures water height), and if the Lower Mississippi levee system is at risk of failure. Ohio River Gauge at Cairo In 2011, the Corps considered using the floodway for the first time in 74 years. April 28, 2011 Months of heavy rain and snowmelt lead to record flooding in the Mississippi River basin. On April 28, the Ohio River surpasses 58 feet, and water, bubbling up from beneath Cairo's levee system, is already threatening to destroy the city's defenses. That day, a Corps official tells Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, the agency leader in charge of floodway decisions, to load the explosives and prepare to blow up the levee as soon as possible. Walsh follows another official’s advice and decides to wait. April 30, 2011 Two days later, another Corps official advises Walsh to make serious preparations to blow up the levee, but again, Walsh declines, believing they have more time. He compromises and takes preliminary steps. Meanwhile, as more water leaks into the city, the mayor of Cairo orders a mandatory evacuation. May 1, 2011 At 10 a.m. Walsh is advised one more time to prepare the levee with explosives. Walsh hesitates, thinking he might not need to activate the floodway, then reverses his decision, giving the order five hours later. But thunderstorms and lightning further delay the process by half a day. May 2, 2011 — Morning A levee about 15 miles upstream of Cairo collapses and floods several small communities. May 2, 2011 — Afternoon At 4:30 p.m., Walsh tells Missouri’s governor the Corps will open the floodway that night, but crews need all day to finish preparations. At 10 p.m., the river reaches 61.72 feet, an all-time record, just before they explode the levee. Experts say the Corps’ delay in opening the floodway caused millions in avoidable damage in the Cairo area. Walsh left the Corps in 2013. Through a spokesperson at his current employer, a consulting firm, he said he no longer represents the Corps and directed questions to the agency.

(Photo: Brian Powers, Rodney White/The Register) Buy Photo For a few minutes Saturday night, sweaty Des Moines-area residents savored the sudden temperature drop that provided a respite to the day's nearly unbearable heat and humidity. Their enjoyment was short-lived. In a flash, the skies burst, deluging parts of Polk County with nearly 9 inches of rain in less than four hours. The flooding resulted in the death of 66-year-old Larry Cotlar, who got out of a stalled van and was swept away by the fast-moving water. Emmert: Larry Cotlar was a Des Moines radio icon who had a story for every occasion More: Outpouring of grief after Des Moines broadcaster Larry Cotlar dies in flash flood Peterson: Drake Bulldogs radio personality Larry Cotlar 'almost too nice for sports radio' The wash of water caused widespread chaos: A duplex exploded in Urbandale ; flooding displaced dozens of people, including patients in hospice care; businesses were inundated with water ; and first-responders were scurrying throughout the night rescuing people stranded in vehicles and flooded buildings. “The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise,” Des Moines police spokesman Paul Parizek said during a Sunday news conference. The onslaught resulted in “catastrophic flooding” throughout Polk County, said Kelsey Angle, a National Weather Service meteorologist. Areas near Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek sustained the most damage, said A.J. Mumm, director of Polk County Emergency Management. Both creeks set record-high crests. Last Slide Next Slide What's next for the Des Moines area Saylorville Lake is expected to crest at about 888 feet by the end of the week, Mumm said — about 4 feet below record levels. The reservoir, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is about 11 miles north of Des Moines and was built to provide flood protection to the capital city. Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie on Sunday said he didn’t anticipate that water released from Saylorville will cause problems for cities downstream. “But that is all contingent on the weather,” he said. In 2008, Des Moines and other parts of Iowa experienced historic flooding caused by melting from the winter’s heavy snowfall and above average rainfall that began Memorial Day weekend. The weather prompted flooding and levee breaches in Des Moines. Since then, more than $20 million has been spent rebuilding the levees, and millions more have been spent buying properties, tearing down buildings and relocating residents. “I was thinking what could have been if those houses and people hadn’t been removed from those floodways,” Mumm said. More: Speed of rain, heavy amounts 'caught us by surprise,' police say Sudden cooling brings a torrent By Sunday afternoon, about 100 people had taken shelter at Hoyt Middle School because of flooding in or around their residences. Polk County officials, however, could not immediately say how many people were displaced by the flooding. Also unavailable is a monetary amount of the damage done by Saturday night’s storm. Rain began falling on the western edge of the Des Moines-metro area between 4 and 5 p.m., when the temperature was still 90 degrees, said Brooke Hagenhoff, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The temperature had dropped slightly by 7 p.m., to 88 degrees. By 7:54 p.m., it was 77. “That’s when the heavier precipitation began,” Hagenhoff said. Rainfall amounts ranged from 2.1 inches at the Des Moines International Airport to 8.7 inches in Ankeny, Hagenhoff said. Urbandale received 7.6 inches; Altoona, 6.5 inches and the weather service’s Johnston office, 3.8 inches. The rain came quick, and in bucket fulls. “These long lines of storms had pockets of heavier rainfall embedded in it,” Hagenhoff said. “These types of high-end events are rare but not completely unheard of.” Storm sewers were inundated, causing water to back up onto streets and turning some residents’ yards into ponds.

The van’s occupants got out of the stalled vehicle and one man — sports radio personality Larry Cotlar — was swept away by floodwaters. His body was found around 12:30 a.m. Sunday, several blocks from the van. The heavy rain prompted record flood levels at two metro area creeks. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street crested at 19.1 feet, slightly higher than the previous record of 18.7 feet. Fourmile Creek at Easton Boulevard crested at 17.5 feet, more than a foot above the previous record of 16.1 feet set on Aug. 11, 2010. “It’s a little scary to think that we hit high-water marks last night in one downpour,” Cownie said.

Water rushed into ground-floor units, ruining residents’ belongings. “I lost everything,” said Ellen James, 58, who spent the night at Hoyt Middle School. “It’s horrible.” Vehicles in the apartment’s parking lot were also damaged.

(Photo: Brian Powers/The Register) In Clive, dozens of residences and businesses were damaged by flood and storm waters. Roads near Walnut Creek were closed and residences and businesses evacuated. Most were allowed to return by midday Sunday. At University Photo, at 78th Street and University Boulevard, the water “filled up like a bathtub,” business owner Sheri Bever said. It came too fast to save the business’ expensive photo printers and equipment, she said. “The choices are: Stand here and bawl, or (say) 'Hey, this is life,'” Bever said. “We’re alive.” In Urbandale, a duplex exploded after a breached gas line was ignited by an unknown source. No one was injured because flood waters had driven out the structure's occupants, two of whom escaped their basement after it quickly filled with water. Last Slide Next Slide In Ankeny, the city’s main water tower on Ash Drive drained in a matter of minutes on Saturday night after a major water main break. City officials issued a boil order for water around 2 a.m. By 4 a.m., the order was lifted except for an area near the break. City employees were still working to fix the break at midday Sunday, but water service was normal for the rest of the city. The weather forecast calls for mostly dry weather in the coming days, which allow for clean-up to continue. “We have a lot of work ahead of us,” Mumm said.

"Lisa Song, ProPublica, Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, and Al Shaw, ProPublica","Just after Christmas 2015, police showed up at the Starling Community Trailer Court in Arnold, Missouri, and told residents to get out. There was no time to stack sandbags, no time to pack. The big one was coming. The mobile home park backed onto a rising creek, where the oldest residents were closest to the threat. Sarah Quinn raced to help her grandmother and great-grandparents get to safety. They narrowly escaped the rushing Meramec River, which snakes around Arnold and other St. Louis suburbs on its way to meet the Mississippi. About 12 miles upstream, the Meramec climbed the steep banks of the city of Fenton and flowed across a road into the Riverside Golf Club, where Walt Wolfner was busy carting furniture and computers out of his clubhouse. He knew, because the course had flooded so often lately, that he and 20 workers would need two weeks to mop up the damage. Thirty miles farther up the Meramec, the river was creeping up on the town of Pacific, too. Devin Brundick and Felicia Ammann, a young couple who owned a small green bungalow beside the river, hurried to load their belongings into a friend’s truck. By the time the river crested, Wolfner’s clubhouse was under 11 feet of water, Brundick and Ammann’s bungalow was uninhabitable, and Quinn’s grandmother lost everything. “Her sofa, her chair, her deep freeze, washer, dryer, bed, mattress, all of it,” Quinn said. “All of her books that she’s collected over the years … nothing could be saved.” They were the lucky ones. The flood killed at least 20 people in the Midwest and broke records along the Meramec. It was a once-in-a-generation flood — or so they thought, until it happened again 16 months later. Only one city escaped the destruction. Valley Park, just upstream of Fenton, stayed dry during both floods, safe behind a ring of dirt and concrete — a $50 million levee designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. “It’s been wonderful,” said Valley Park resident Ryan McDougell. “The engineers that came in here and put the levee in, they did a great job. It sucks for the folks down below, because, I mean, this is going to happen every year.” See the App When rivers flood now in the United States, the first towns to get hit are the unprotected ones right by the river. The last to go, if they flood at all, are the privileged few behind strong levees. While levees mostly are associated with large, low-lying cities such as New Orleans, a majority of the nation’s Corps-managed levees protect much smaller communities, rural farm towns and suburbs such as Valley Park. But why Valley Park? It wasn’t the biggest city or largest employer along the Meramec. Its neighboring towns all had homes and industry in harm’s way, too. But after almost a century of planning to protect all these communities, the federal government built a single 3-mile levee, shielding the low-lying area of just one town. Exploring why that happened offers a window into the nation’s flawed approach to controlling rivers, in which — an investigation by ProPublica and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found — life-and-death decisions are dictated less by sound science than by economics, politics and luck. Levees have been the nation’s most common method of flood control for much of U.S. history, despite a major drawback: Levees protect the land immediately behind them, but can make flooding worse for people nearby by cutting off a river’s ability to spread over the floodplain — the flat, low-lying land beside the river channel. This is a basic matter of physics and something the Corps has known since at least 1852, when a report it commissioned demonstrated that as levees confine a river to a narrower channel, they force water to flow higher and faster. A levee such as the one at Valley Park, on just one side of the Meramec, creates a traffic-jam effect that forces water higher on the opposite bank and upstream. Twenty-five years ago, before it built the Valley Park levee, the Corps predicted that saving the city would cause just a few extra inches of flooding in areas close by. But it reached that conclusion based on outdated models, without factoring in wild cards such as additional development and climate change that often exacerbate flooding. After building the levee, the Corps never measured its actual impact. Residents in Arnold, Fenton and Pacific weren’t just frustrated that they suffered repeated floods while Valley Park stayed dry. They blamed the levee for making the flooding worse. Their accusations echo claims from residents near other levees: A 2011 flood along Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River raised suspicions that a levee had pushed water into unprotected communities. In Louisiana, engineering consultants projected that a proposed levee extension would raise flooding by about an inch, but local reporters uncovered another study that predicted up to 8 inches — a finding that prompted a lawsuit. And a recent paper found levees have aggravated major floods on the Lower Mississippi River. People across the Meramec basin can only watch and wonder. Sitting in his new clubhouse, which he’s rebuilt twice since 2016, Wolfner peers out at the river and stews about the unfairness of it all. Besides the levee, what does Valley Park have that Fenton doesn’t? The Corps “could have bought out everybody in that area for that kind of money and never built the levee and not hurt all these people, not hurt guys like me,” he said. “Let the water go where it’s supposed to go.” “Seldom Economically Justified” The Army Corps of Engineers has a huge, complex job — reducing flood risk across the nation’s rivers and coasts and a requirement to do it in a way that benefits the country economically. To prioritize its resources, the Corps uses cost-benefit calculations. In practice, those formulas determine who gets flooded and who gets saved. They’re intended to bring some dispassionate reason to a contentious process. But the calculations favor highly valued property over less affluent communities. And the Corps has favored levee-building over nonstructural fixes such as buying out homes to create space for the river to spread out during a flood — practices that many experts say are more effective in the long run, but which the Corps concluded were “ seldom economically justified.” Katherine Poppen, left, waves to fellow boaters on the Meramec River in Valley Park, Missouri. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) The Corps has used some version of these formulas along the Meramec since at least 1929, when it decided a reservoir held behind a dam was the best solution for controlling the wild, free-flowing river. Unlike a levee, which could push water into nearby towns, a reservoir would act as a valve, releasing water from the dam during droughts and storing extra water during floods. The plan might have eliminated flooding for everyone along 33 miles of the Lower Meramec, from the mouth of the river to the city of Eureka, 12 miles upstream of Valley Park. But for decades, the Corps’ math said the land that would be protected wasn’t valuable enough to justify the cost of building a dam. By the 1960s, the area’s population had grown large enough for the Corps to reconsider the reservoir. But by then, the plan had attracted opposition from special interests, including business owners around a nearby lake who didn’t want to compete for tourists and environmentalists who believed rivers ought to flow freely. Jimmy Carter campaigned for the presidency with a promise to block big, wasteful federal water projects. The Meramec dam was among the targets of a 1977 “ hit list ” he released as president. The fate of the reservoir was put to a rare public referendum among voters in St. Louis and a dozen counties along the Meramec in 1978. The Corps already had bought thousands of acres and started building a visitor center when the vote showed that nearly two-thirds opposed the project. Congress formally deauthorized the reservoir in 1981. The following year, the Meramec unleashed one of its worst floods on record, rising so suddenly that first responders rescued residents in the dark as the river inundated Valley Park. The flooding killed six people and caused more than $100 million in damage. In the small community of Times Beach, residents cleared out, abandoning that land to the river. At the time, Walt Wolfner was in high school and already the manager of his father’s golf course in Fenton. With the course submerged, Wolfner’s father began a tradition that Wolfner continues today: jotting down the height of the Meramec from nearby stream gauges along with its impact on the course. He logged the river’s height in Valley Park at 39.73 feet. Beside it, he wrote, “5 1/2 [feet] water in clubhouse.” Walt Wolfner, the owner of Riverside Golf Club in Fenton, Missouri, keeps a log of flood data from a stream gauge. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) The Corps had orders from Congress to solve the flooding on the Meramec, along with a budget of $20 million, or about $54 million in 2018 dollars. The fix had to be economically sound, Congress said, and it could not include “any dams or reservoirs.” In a report released in 1987, the Corps outlined plans to protect more than a dozen communities with levees and other solutions — and then discarded all but a few of those plans because their costs outweighed the projected benefits. The 6-mile riverfront of Fenton was among the places the Corps decided a levee would be too expensive. Wolfner rebuilt his clubhouse last year, elevating it 14 feet off the ground to protect from future floods. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) In Arnold, the Corps considered buying out low-lying houses and trailer homes — including in the Starling Community Trailer Court, where Sarah Quinn’s grandmother was flooded out in 2015. This proposal also failed the test. The city of 19,000 was the largest in the area and vulnerable on two fronts, from floods rushing down the Meramec and from high water backing up from the Mississippi. The Corps calculated that it could buy out the riskiest homes for $5 million. But the properties weren’t worth enough to justify that, the agency decided. The process is “always driven by property values, for better or worse,” said Leonard Shabman, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution, who studies federal cost-benefit formulas. “The analyses that get done may favor those with higher incomes.” Valley Park had hundreds of homes and valuable public services — its police station, fire station, city hall and schools — in the lowest part of the floodplain. The Corps figured it would be worth protecting them all with an $11.8 million levee. The Corps recommended two solutions in addition to the levee: a buyout for a low-lying mobile home park in Eureka and an improved flood warning system across the region. But these were stymied by a new law, backed by environmentalists and the Reagan administration, which added another condition: The Corps had to find a local funding partner for these projects. Only city leaders in Valley Park were willing to pay their share, $3.7 million, to clinch the deal to put a levee between the Meramec and their city of 3,200 people. Source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Census Bureau; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Agriculture Over the years, the $11.8 million price tag, which the Corps had so carefully figured into its cost-benefit calculations, began to climb. A Corps spokeswoman cited multiple reasons, including cleanup of contaminated soil found during construction and lawsuits from landowners in the levee’s path who didn’t want to sell their property to make room. In 2000, Congress passed a bill that funded the levee at $35 million. In 2003, federal lawmakers upped the funding to $50 million. Valley Park was on the hook for a quarter of the cost as it grew. Still, its support did not waver. The city issued a series of bonds and diverted tax revenue to pay for the levee, at one point prompting a lawsuit from its school district over lost tax money. The final price for the city was just over $13 million — more than the entire project was supposed to cost. The Corps’ original reservoir solution for the Meramec would have protected more than a dozen communities. The estimated cost of that dam in 1929 was $6.6 million, an amount equivalent to roughly $70 million by the time Valley Park got its $50 million levee. Instead, the Corps had its hands tied so tightly over the decades that all it could build was a single levee, benefiting one small city. “It’s Not Going to Affect Anything” From Valley Park, the levee’s slope resembles the inside of a grassy bowl, around 20 feet tall. Water caught behind the levee is guided out of the city by a system of drain pipes. Steel gates let traffic in and out through several road and railroad crossings. When the Meramec begins to rise, the gates close and seal off Valley Park from the wall of water. When the levee was designed in 1993, the Corps’ hydraulic modeling software demonstrated it would increase flooding upstream by less than 5 inches during a 100-year flood (a flood that has a 1 percent chance of occurring each year) and only within a few miles of Valley Park — not far enough to reach Eureka or Pacific. It had put the average yearly cost of flooding created by the levee at $7,200 in 1987, or $16,000 in 2018 dollars. The top of a flood gate and a levee in Valley Park. The $50 million levee designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was finished in 2005. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) “The Army Corps of Engineers, before they built the levee, they were having meetings and telling everybody, ‘No, no, this levee’s not going to hurt anything. It’s not going to affect anything,’” Walt Wolfner said. “And they basically, in our minds, lied to us.” In reality, the Corps could not say with certainty that the levee wouldn’t contribute to additional flooding in the future, because its calculations left out how key variables could change over time. The first of those factors is development. The Corps built the levee tall enough to protect against a 100-year flood, a height that offered an additional perk: Valley Park residents no longer had to buy costly federal flood insurance. With a levee to protect the city, the Corps calculated that rising land values in Valley Park and administrative savings in the flood insurance program would create nearly $100,000 in annual benefits, about $225,000 today. That number helped bolster the case for the levee in the Corps’ cost-benefit analysis. But even though the Corps anticipated that the levee would prompt growth in the area worth $15 million per year, it didn’t expect the flood damage to grow, too. Valley Park’s population has more than doubled since the 1980s, to 6,900. And between 1980 and 2010, the combined population of Arnold, Fenton, Valley Park, Eureka and Pacific increased nearly 50 percent. Tim Engelmeyer, Valley Park’s city attorney, said critics in the region are unduly fixated on the levee, but any Meramec community that allowed development since 1993 has “brought some of this on themselves.” Since 1993, growth in the floodplain includes extensions of several Fenton subdivisions and hundreds of new residential lots scattered across unincorporated St. Louis County between Pacific and Arnold, an analysis of county tax parcel data and Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance maps shows. Top: The Valley Park levee, left, shields the town from the river. Bottom: Mirasol, a residential subdivision, and the Meramec River, top, in Eureka, Missouri. When the river flooded in 2015 and 2017, floodwaters trapped some residents. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) By taking up space that would otherwise hold water during a flood, new buildings inside the floodplain drive the river higher. For people living nearby, those extra inches of water can mean the difference between soggy front yards and replacing the furniture, carpet and walls in the first floors of their homes. “You put a stone into a bucket of water, it’s going to raise the level of water,” said Devin Brundick, the owner of that little green house in Pacific. Now, every time he drives past new construction sites in the floodplain, he envisions the river near his home rising another fraction of an inch. “The real estate’s cheap because it’s in a floodplain,” he said, and local governments like the tax revenue from new development. “So far, no one’s been held accountable.” Development outside the floodplain, on higher ground, worsens flooding in a different way. As the suburbs sprawl across open land, soil that might have absorbed rainfall is paved over, sending water rushing faster toward the river and creating more frequent floods. Some of this is driven by Valley Park subdivisions built after 1993, near two small creeks that funnel runoff straight into the Meramec.

(Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) Phillip Eydmann, a retired engineer with the Corps who helped design the Valley Park levee, said conditions along the river have changed since 1993. “We are encroaching on the rivers more and more and increasing the runoff,” he said. “Those (flood) heights are probably going to go up.” The second variable is climate change. It was a fairly new concept for federal policymakers in the early 1990s, but by the time the levee was complete, scientists were highly confident that human-driven climate change would affect rainfall all over the country. There’s now a consensus that rainstorms across the Midwest are intensifying, dumping more water into the Upper Mississippi basin. Researchers and regulators generally calculate future flood patterns based on a river’s past behavior. But climate change makes everything more unpredictable. The Corps now considers climate change in some of its flood planning, but an Obama-era executive order that might have strengthened its approach was rescinded last year by President Donald Trump. The Corps never updated its 1993 calculations or checked them for accuracy — not when the levee was finished in 2005, nor when the levee held back its first big flood in 2008 or after the larger, more recent floods. The Corps used widely available modeling software of the early 1990s. The technology’s ability to accurately model how rivers behave has significantly improved since then. John Boeckmann, an engineer for the Corps’ St. Louis District and chief of its hydrologic engineering section, said he still stands by the Corps’ 1993 calculations. Any flooding coming from the levee is localized and “is not affecting other communities upstream,” he said. “We’re confident what was done then is sound science and good engineering.” When ProPublica and Reveal asked the Corps whether it ever checks its predictions of levee-induced flooding against more recent data, a spokesman from agency headquarters in Washington said the “verification process that you describe is not a practice that (the Corps) uses.” As a result, levees that are meant to last for decades, even a century, are built based on maps and modeling technology from another era. Ammann and Brundick work in their yard. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) “Thanks for the Water, Valley Park” The Valley Park levee met its first test when floods tore through the Midwest in spring 2008. One bar owner told reporters that she was so confident in the new levee that she hadn’t bothered to pick up her computer off the floor. “It’s a 100-year event, and it’s a 100-year levee,” Army Corps of Engineers Col. Lewis Setliff declared. “It got tested, and it passed.” But upstream in Pacific, the mood was grim. More than 200 buildings flooded. Then-Mayor Herbert Adams urged federal officials to provide a levee or some other protection for communities along the Meramec. And at least one resident wasted no time assigning blame. A hand-lettered sign outside a flooded home read, “Thanks for the water, Valley Park.” The record floods in 2015 and 2017 only fed the suspicions in neighboring towns. Was the levee to blame? The Corps defended its work with a fact sheet citing its calculations from 1993, but no new data. “The levee does not increase flood heights anywhere downstream of Valley Park,” the agency declared. In fact, the Corps isn’t sure of the levee’s effect. John Boeckmann, the Corps engineer, said development in the area makes it hard to assess. “It’s really hard to isolate the effects of a single item,” he said. “So much has changed.” Checking the agency’s estimates against the levee’s actual impact would require additional funding from Congress, likely hundreds of thousands of dollars for a detailed model. And there’s a question of fairness, Boeckmann said: If one community got a special study, every other flooded town near a levee would want one, too. The St. Louis District alone has more than 70 levees, so the costs soon would add up to millions of dollars. Jonathan Remo, a professor at Southern Illinois University who’s spent his career studying Midwestern floods, said the Corps has no incentive to verify whether its original flooding predictions still hold. Scientifically speaking, it’s a good idea to check those numbers, given how modeling software and local conditions have changed since 1993, he said. Such a study could even help the Corps make better predictions. But there are built-in disincentives for the Corps to prove its own work was wrong, Remo said. If the Corps found that the water levels have risen more than it estimated, it wouldn’t just make the agency look bad, he said. It could expose the agency to litigation. Anne Jefferson, a geology professor at Kent State University, said it all comes down to funding priorities. “There’s a lot of money to build things,” she said, but “nobody wants to put up the money to watch and see what happens” afterward. “It’s really about what we want to spend money on as a nation.” Researchers say this is a common problem in science and engineering. Whether it’s verifying levee models or doing long-term monitoring in ecological restoration, funding for initial projects dwarfs what’s available for follow-up research. The federal government has the tools to get a much better picture of how levees worsen flooding, for a fraction of the cost of a comprehensive model. The U.S. Geological Survey, a scientific agency that monitors natural hazards, operates stream gauges that measure the flow of water in rivers. In 2011, two scientists used stream gauges next to or directly upstream of levees to examine water heights during floods, as well as flow rates — the amount of water rushing past the gauge each second. The higher the flow rate, the larger the flood. A stream gauge near the Meramec River in Valley Park. The gauge collects data on the height of the river, both during floods and under normal river conditions. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) The scientists studied 13 levees in the Midwest, compiling these two measurements before and after the levees were built. They wanted to see whether floods with similar flow rates produced different flood heights before and after levee construction. They found that in all 13 cases, for floods of the same flow rate, water heights post-levee were higher than pre-levee — in one instance by more than 5 feet. Co-author Nicholas Pinter, an earth science professor at the University of California, Davis, said the study used real-world data to show what actually happened during floods, instead of relying on a model of what “should” happen. Scientists say stream gauges near every levee could serve as a warning system, indicating which levees worsen flooding and delivering a reality check on the Corps’ design predictions. But the Geological Survey and other agencies have struggled to maintain their network of gauges. Due to tight budgets, the Geological Survey said only 73 percent of the gauges it considers essential for monitoring rivers are operational today. And because they are designed to track flooding, not the effects of levees, many gauges are far from levees, and some don’t track flow rates at all, making them useless for these calculations. Bob Criss, an earth science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, tried to do a stream gauge analysis for Valley Park, but the limitations of the gauges led him astray. He co-wrote a paper on the 2015 flood and called it a “ man-made disaster.” It blamed the levee and other upstream development for raising water levels at Eureka a foot higher than they should have been. What Criss didn’t realize — and what ProPublica and Reveal have only recently discovered — is that the underlying data was flawed because the Geological Survey had moved the stream gauge several months before the flood, without flagging the change in the data. Correcting that data made the extra height disappear. Whatever the impact from the Valley Park levee and nearby development, it wasn’t great enough to reach the Eureka gauge. It’s also impossible to use gauges to measure flooding from the Valley Park levee, because the gauge next to the levee measures only water heights. The Geological Survey acknowledged this shortcoming to reporters after the 2008 flood. In 2015, the river at Valley Park rose higher than it had in 1982 — but without knowing the flow rate, it’s impossible to tell whether the extra height was the natural result of a bigger flood or whether the levee and new development were partially responsible for pushing the water higher. A Geological Survey spokeswoman said the agency could improve the Valley Park gauge to collect flow rates, but it would require extra measurements and calculations with “a much higher cost.” Source: United States Geological Survey; Missouri Spatial Data Information Service; United States Department of Agriculture. Note: The approximate height of the 2015 record flood at Valley Park was 44 feet. Data used to show this flood is from a USGS model. There’s also been some debate about whether the levee was built too high, which would contribute to additional flooding. Six months after the Criss paper, a separate report found that the levee must have been higher than its authorized height, because at the 100-year-flood level, it would have been submerged in 2015, which would have lowered the water level in nearby towns. The report was funded by the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, which had hired a local engineering firm to measure the height of the levee at several locations. Remo, the Southern Illinois professor, said it’s hard to prove the levee was built too high because the Corps gives itself a lot of leeway on this front. When the agency designed the levee, it modeled the size of the 100-year flood at Valley Park and found the baseline levee height needed to hold back that flood. Then the Corps added an extra 3 feet to the levee design for safety and up to 4 feet more to account for how the levee might settle over time. That meant the levee was built up to 7 feet higher than the elevation of the 100-year flood. For Valley Park, the added height makes it virtually certain that the city will be protected from a major flood, even if its flow rate is larger than what the Corps calculated in 1993. On the flip side, every extra inch of the levee above the baseline height increases the possibility of passing more damage on to Valley Park’s neighbors. Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said Valley Park should shoulder more of the responsibility for making sure its levee doesn’t harm its neighbors. Most federal levees are maintained by local levee districts, and it’s up to them to ensure the structure stays up to date with changing flood patterns and regulations. But few local governments have the expertise or funding to check the Corps’ calculations. And just like the Army Corps, they have little incentive to do anything that might indicate their levees are piling extra harm onto surrounding communities. A cyclist bikes along a trail on top of the Valley Park levee. (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) Tim Engelmeyer, the Valley Park city attorney, said it’s unrealistic to expect a “little town of 7,000” to handle a complex modeling update. U.S. Geological Survey scientists also have proposed a sophisticated computer model that would do what the Corps says it cannot: conclusively demonstrate the levee’s impact on the region. The model, said Geological Survey hydrologist Paul Rydlund Jr., would consider the Meramec Valley as it looked in the 1930s, then slowly add in the development over time: bridges, neighborhoods, the levee. Rydlund said he hopes such a study could help people on the river understand its changing behavior. So far, the Geological Survey has raised $50,000 of the $365,000 it needs to build the model. Lately, the agency has been asking local officials to help. “You’re on Your Own” The 2015 and 2017 floods were a clear reminder that, after almost a century of work by the Army Corps, most communities on the Meramec remain exposed to flooding. With $350,000 from Congress, the Corps has commenced another study of the same volatile river. The agency partnered with local governments, including Pacific, Arnold and Fenton; federal and state agencies; and other organizations to produce a report it calls a “blueprint” for reducing flood risk. Hal Graef, a project manager for the Corps’ St. Louis District, said it will focus on nonstructural solutions such as buyouts and raising home foundations. John Boeckmann, the Corps engineer, said the initiative is not about the Valley Park levee. A fact sheet from the agency attributes flooding to “increased frequency of heavy rainfall and severe storms, geology, topography, development, storm water runoff, and loss of wetlands and open space.” Part of the effort involved public meetings and surveys asking for feedback. Officials had received 38 responses as of late June. Some urged limits on floodplain development or blamed the levee for aggravating flooding. Others wanted more levees along the Meramec. One respondent, who seemed aware of previous plans to build a reservoir, wrote: “Stop building all levees anywhere on the Meramec River. Stop all development in the Meramec floodway or floodplain. Build a dam in the Upper Meramec.” The final report is due in November 2019. After that, it will be up to the communities to follow the recommendations. Graef said the report will list potential funding sources. The Corps will not have authority to force anyone to adopt the ideas, nor will there necessarily be guaranteed funding for them. The agency already is stretched thin. Only about 2 percent of the Corps’ authorized construction projects get funded each year. And although the Corps is building far fewer levees than it did in the mid-1900s, the agency is on the hook for an aging network that costs billions to maintain and keeps getting hit by natural disasters. There is no indication it will get more support under the Trump administration. Small-government advocates long have called for removing civil works from the Corps, and in June, the administration released a plan that would do just that: Strip the Corps of its flood control responsibilities and reassign the job to the Department of Transportation and Department of the Interior. A shift like that would add a new layer of uncertainty to the Corps’ future. Flood victims around Valley Park don’t have the luxury of waiting for a government fix.

(Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) Last year, Walt Wolfner tore down the half-century-old clubhouse that took on 11 feet of water in the 2015 flood.

’re together in the car driving over the bridge, I see her peering over the river,” Quinn said. “If it rains too much, she’ll go back into the woods and check the creek. She will not admit that she’s nervous, but she does not want to go through it again. I don’t think anybody would.” Four months after the 2015 flood, Devin Brundick and Felicia Ammann set about elevating their home in Pacific. They had an 8-foot concrete foundation poured, then had a crane pick up their little green house and set it on top. It was another year before they could move back in. Brundick is a carpenter, and when he has time at home, he works on finishing repairs. “We’ve got a slop sink in our kitchen and I got a bunch of wire shelving for storage space, so that’s pretty rough,” Brundick said. “Most people, I don’t think, would feel like they’re actually in a house. We just call it glamping.” The way this area has flooded since they bought the house, Brundick and Ammann doubt they’ll make money selling the home the way they’d planned — even from its new perch.

Several major online tech platforms remove Alex Jones and his Infowars content from their sites; a tragedy on Bangladeshi roads sparks massive protests. Jonesing for a platform Ben Jackson/Getty Images for SiriusXM YouTube, Facebook, Spotify, and Apple have decided to remove content associated with far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website, Infowars, from their platforms on Sunday and Monday. All say that Jones has violated their policies banning hate speech. [ CNN / Charles Riley ] Apple, which removed Jones’s content from iTunes on Sunday night, was the first major platform to issue a ban. Within hours, the “dominoes began to fall” as the other platforms followed suit. [ Vox / Aja Romano ] Every company has said, in some way or another, that they do not “tolerate hate speech” that “attacks or dehumanizes others.” But it’s unclear what prompted this sudden desire to ban Jones given that his hateful rhetoric has persisted for years. [ AP / Barbara Ortutay ] The wave began when Spotify, YouTube, and Facebook removed selected content last week. This series of new bans is the most severe action any platform has taken against Jones and hate speech in general.

ugc,"The area once known as Gumbo Flats, now referred to as “The Valley” by locals, is home to fine dining, outlet stores, fall pumpkin patches, and a little grove of stalwart pecan trees that have survived the Great Flood and other tests of time. The first tree (the monarch tree) was planted more than a century ago, and the three younger ones around it sprouted from its nuts. In 1993, when the Midwest was devastated by the Great Flooding of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, Chesterfield’s 100-year levee couldn’t withstand the raging waters. Like in many rural towns and cities, the backwaters seeped in, filling the valley with as much as 15 feet of floodwater that destroyed the area’s farmland and existing businesses. The businesses may have fallen, but miraculously, the pecan grove did not. While the city was rebuilding the area, these trees became protected by a new 500-year levee and a monarch tree ordinance that prevents commercial development of the land they occupy. To further protect and celebrate the longevity of the four trees, a half-acre park was built around them, giving both passersby and nearby retail workers a place to come rest. In 2016, when the park was dedicated, a fifth tree was planted. For now, the future looks bright for this sturdy cluster of trees. Missouri pecan trees tend to thrive in the nutrient-rich, bottomland “gumbo” soil that this area provides. The largest tree has a trunk circumference of about 14 feet and stands around 70 feet tall. Healthy pecan trees can grow to 100-150 feet tall and yield nuts for up to 225 years. As such, this tiny park could be offering a nutty snack and a spot of shade for possibly hundreds of years! Julie Sesti, a local artist, was commissioned to sculpt a life-sized bronze tribute to the Bayer and Brasher families who once farmed here, and who planted the original tree in the 1890s.","The area once known as Gumbo Flats, now referred to as “The Valley” by locals, is home to fine dining, outlet stores, fall pumpkin patches, and a little grove of stalwart pecan trees that have survived the Great Flood and other tests of time.

UPDATE, 3:40 p.m.: While Hamburg, Iowa, residents tried to shore up parts of their town with sandbags, swelling Missouri River waters topped a levee to the west of town shortly after 3 p.m. Sunday.
* * *
UPDATE, 3:35 p.m.: Boyd County, Nebraska, which was considered part of South Dakota before 1895, might feel that way again after flooding closed the three main bridges across the Niobrara River to the rest of Nebraska.
Bridges south of Butte and Spencer are closed, and the so-called Mormon bridge in Niobrara washed away.
Maybe theyll adopt us, Kyle Krotter, a member of the Spencer Village Board, said of South Dakota.
One man is missing and presumed dead. He lived in a home just below the 91-year-old Spencer Dam, which collapsed Thursday morning, sweeping away the home, a straw-bale tavern and a bait shop.
On Sunday, Krotter and others were working to collect bottled water for residents of the Spencer and Lynch areas. The water main that supplied those areas, located below the Niobrara, was snapped.
More than 60 families were displaced by flooding from the Ponca Creek in Lynch. Deliveries of food and other goods are now diverting through South Dakota to the area.

UPDATE, 2:43 p.m.: Chunks of ice up to 2 feet thick acted like bulldozers in the floodwaters at Niobrara, Nebraska, battering down walls and crumpling metal Quonset huts like cellophane.
Its total devastation. The ice just destroyed everything, said Laura Sucha, as she surveyed whats left of the Country Cafe, a popular eatery shes owned since 2015.
A local gas station, storage complex and state roads garage were among the buildings wrecked in the ice, which left piles 6- to 10-feet high in places around the town, located where the Niobrara River flows into the Missouri River.
The bridge between the town and Niobrara State Park was blown out, and the city is working to restore drinking water to local residents.
About 35 miles upstream is Spencer Dam, which collapsed Thursday morning, sending a wall of ice and water toward Niobrara.
It just looked like the end of the world coming, said Mayor Jody Stark. He said it may be two weeks before the drinking water system is repaired, recharged and disinfected.

UPDATE, 1:45 p.m.: Volunteers and donations are still needed.
On Sunday, Omaha metro area residents were streaming into a donation center to drop off items for flood victims. The Salvation Army has set up the collection and distribution center at the old Canfield's sporting goods store near 84th Street and West Center Road. The center will be open until 7 p.m. Sunday. The schedule for Monday hasn't been set. The agency is suggesting donations of flood cleanup and flood relief items such as shovels, masks, disinfectant, tarps, bottled water and sports drinks. Volunteers are still needed at sites throughout the recovery effort. To sign up, call 402-898-6050 or visit registertoring.com.

UPDATE, 12:45 p.m.: The Omaha metro area's drinking water remains drinkable, Metropolitan Utilities District reiterated Sunday in a statement. The utility takes water from the Missouri River and from aquifers in the Platte River valley. Both rivers are flooding. In the statement, MUD said its water, which is tested daily, continues to meet all state and federal standards.
Rumors have been swirling about the utility's water and the utility has been issuing statements in an effort to tamp those down.
Omaha, Bellevue, Bennington, Carter Lake, La Vista, Ralston, Waterloo and Fort Calhoun get their water from MUD's treatment plants. The Papio-Missouri Natural Resources District is the conduit for the water going to Fort Calhoun.

UPDATE, 11:50 a.m.: A Nebraska National Guard convoy loaded with food and other supplies from Lincoln is expected to arrive Sunday in Fremont between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.
Mayor Scott Getzschman said the convoy will distribute the supplies to the city's five active shelters. The trucks will roll into town on U.S. Highway 275, which is open now to emergency vehicles only, he said.
""We've stabilized the situation short term, and we are planning for the beginning of the week,"" Getzschman said. ""The teamwork and collaboration of the people of Fremont has been an amazing sight.""
Getzschman said the city's shelters have been home to about 450 people during the day, swelling to 800 or 900 at night.

UPDATE, 11:15 a.m.; By late Saturday on Fremont ""island,"" you couldnt get bottled water.
Walmart had sold out of all but the kiddie and electric toothbrushes. By 10 p.m., there were only two pairs of rubber boots mens, both size 10 on the shelves. No bananas on the shelves, either.
Hy-Vee still seemed like a horn of plenty, though it, too, had run out of individually bottled water. Worries that Fremonts municipal water supply would be compromised by the flood had caused a rush. It's fine so far. Both Hy-Vee and Walmart still had ways to fill up water jugs.
Want five gallons? the Walmart greeter asked.

UPDATE, 11:10 a.m.: Saunders County authorities continued a mandatory evacuation Sunday of residents in several lake communities after a levee along the Platte River was breached Saturday.
The levee is about a quarter-mile north of County Road F, said Terry Miller, director of Saunders County emergency management. The breach resulted in flooding of the rural area south of County Road F to Camp Ashland Road and as far west as Nebraska Highway 66, he said.
Communities affected included Big Sandy Lake, Lake Allure, Thomas Lakes and Sandy Pointe Lake.

UPDATE. 10:30 a.m.: Columbus is no longer an island, but it may be a peninsula, said Mayor Jim Bulkley.
A circuitous route is needed to go south from the Platte County city, Bulkley said. Motorists aiming for Omaha today must go north on U.S. Highway 81 and then west on Nebraska 91.
Vehicles can start heading south at Albion on state or county roads. Motorists will eventually reach Interstate 80 just east of Grand Island.
""It's about a three-hour route for a trip that usually takes an hour,"" Bulkley said. ""You can also go north to Norfolk, but I'm still not sure how you get down to Omaha by going east.""
Bulkley said stores in Columbus have been receiving groceries, gas and other supplies via roundabout routes into town since Friday.
""We've been blessed with how we've come through this (flood),"" Bulkley said. ""I know a lot of people have been hurt but it could've been worse.""
When floodwaters do recede, Bulkley said, motorists need to wait for roads to be cleared by the state's Roads Department before using them. Floodwaters have caused damage to roads and bridges that could make them unsafe, he said.
""The Loup River bridge needs to be assessed by the state,"" Bulkley said. ""We're hoping they can make that assessment today.""

UPDATE, 8:45 a.m.: The Elkhorn River has crested at all points in eastern Nebraska, the National Weather Service said Sunday.
The river remains at major flood levels but is expected to be back below its flood stage of 14 feet by Tuesday. The river crested at 24.63 feet Saturday and was down to 22.17 feet near Waterloo at 6:15 a.m. Sunday, according to the weather service.
Washington County Sheriff Mike Robinson said deputies reported that the Elkhorn River was receding near Arlington. U.S. Highway 30 reopened on Saturday, and water is in the process of receding from Nebraska Highway 91.
""We want to remind (motorists) not to go around barricades,"" Robinson said. ""They are still subject to arrest and citations if they do.""

UPDATE, 8:20 a.m.: Plattsmouth residents are being urged to conserve tap water, the city's administrator said Sunday.
The city's water treatment and wastewater treatment plants are shut down due to flooding. The city is getting about two-thirds of its daily water from a connection to Cass County Rural Water, Plattsmouth City Administrator Erv Portis said.
""We need to get out the message that even though we have that connection, and thank goodness for Cass County Rural Water, people need to conserve water,"" Portis said. ""People need to find a way to figure out how to use about two-thirds of the water they normally use. This is critical.""
One bit of news that might be temporary: The Missouri River has dropped about a foot Sunday morning, Portis said.
""We don't know if that's due to the - break (at Thurman, Iowa) or not,"" Portis said. ""The (Army) Corps of Engineers gauge shows 39 feet and we had 40.5 feet (Saturday).""

UPDATE, 7:55 a.m.: Offutt Air Force Base announced that only mission-essential personnel should report. The base's clinic, child development center, commissary and gym will keep normal hours. The StratCom gate is closed. The Bellevue gate is opening full-time. The chapels protestant service is canceled. Veterinarian services are not available today.

UPDATE, 6:13 a.m.: Fast-moving water was approaching the town of Thurman, Iowa, early Sunday, the National weather Service in Omaha said.
""This is likely the result of levee breeches in the area,"" according to a weather service statement. ""Evacuation operations were beginning for the town.""
At 5:30 a.m., the weather service said many rivers were still experiencing minor to major flooding. While smaller streams are falling, larger main-stem rivers will be above flood for days.
The weather service advised heeding all road closures and evacuation orders.","Gavins Point releases to drop; water tops Missouri River levee near Hamburg Norfolk Daily News Midwest bracing for more 'unprecedented' flooding that has shattered record-high river levels Fox News Historic flooding kills three, forces hundreds from homes acr…",2019-03-17T23:56:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Norfolkdailynews.com'}",Gavins Point releases to drop; water tops Missouri River levee near Hamburg - Norfolk Daily News,http://norfolkdailynews.com/news/gavins-point-releases-to-drop-water-tops-missouri-river-levee/article_5320d22a-4910-11e9-9af6-5b596c2c4028.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/b0/cb0885ee-4910-11e9-8498-a3a1bba44c10/5c8edfe98f0bd.image.jpg?resize=620%2C465,,Norfolkdailynews.com,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by T. Christian Miller, ProPublica, and Kiah Collier, The Texas Tribune","This story was co-published with The Texas Tribune. A judge has dismissed a number of charges filed by a South Texas county against a former official accused of fraud in the construction of a $232 million border fence funded by the Department of Homeland Security. The ruling prompted Hidalgo County on Monday to withdraw all remaining legal actions against Godfrey Garza Jr., the former chief of its drainage district, who oversaw a project to improve the county’s levee system and build a fence to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Judge Martin Chiuminatto of state district court in Hidalgo County told lawyers for the county and Garza that the evidence presented to support the county’s allegations of fraud was not strong enough to send to a jury, according to a transcript of the hearing late last month. Chiuminatto also dismissed charges against Garza’s wife, children and their companies. “I’ve wrestled to find enough smoke to suggest that there’s a fire someplace,” Chiuminatto said in granting dismissal of the charges. Godfrey Garza Jr. (The Monitor) Garza’s attorney said the county had forced his client to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend himself against “meritless allegations.” Garza “remains upset that he had to go through something like this, but he’s happy this part is over,” said Ethan Shaw, an Austin attorney. County officials said they planned to appeal the judge’s dismissal. They also said they withdrew accusations of bribery and racketeering in order to protect their legal options. The county could file a lawsuit in federal court to pursue its case against Garza. “[T]here is a significant amount of evidence establishing wrongdoing against the defendants,” said County Judge Ramon Garcia, the county’s top elected official, in a statement. “The court’s rulings are erroneous and they will be appealed.” The county filed its lawsuit last year, accusing Garza of overcharging on the contract to build the levee fence and of sending work to Valley Data Collection Specialists, a company owned by his sons and later his wife. Garza defended himself by noting that county elected officials, who also serve as the board for the drainage district, had approved all spending and contracts involved with the levee fence. The county’s allegations centered on 22 miles of combined levee-fence built in Hidalgo County with local and federal funds some 10 years ago — a precursor to President Donald Trump’s planned border wall. Homeland Security funneled $174 million to the county for the project, while promising to exercise “substantial federal involvement” to make sure the money was spent well. But an investigation by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found that Homeland Security rushed to build the project and paid little attention to how the county spent the money — some of which flowed to Garza and a company he owned. Read the Story Garza, the longtime general manager of the drainage district, had persuaded county elected officials to let him resign his post, then hire him back the same day as a contractor to oversee the district. In 2007, Garza signed a contract with the county which paid his company, Integ Inc., 1.5 percent of every dollar spent on the levee-fence project. Garza and his firm made $3.7 million from the deal. Federal law generally prohibits such contracts. The investigation also revealed that construction firms hired by the county to build the levee-fence subcontracted work to a firm owned by Garza’s sons and later his wife. U.S. law normally forbids such conflicts of interest. Valley Data Collection Specialists received at least $1.6 million worth of contracts. Among the firms that hired Valley Data was Dannenbaum Engineering, a Texas corporate powerhouse with deep ties to Texas’ Republican establishment. Dannenbaum’s offices were raided by the FBI in April. It’s unclear if the agency is investigating the levee-fence project.","by T.

Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency Thursday following flooding that left several people stranded and continues to cause damage and strain levees in several Midwest states.
Parson’s action will allow state agencies to work directly with local officials responding to flooding. Parson, along with the state’s Emergency Management Agency director and other officials, plan to meet with local leaders and survey damage Thursday.
“The rising floodwaters are affecting more Missouri communities and farms, closing more roads and threatening levees, water treatment plants and other critical infrastructure,” Parson said in a statement. “We will continue to work closely with our local partners to assess needs and provide resources to help as Missourians continue this flood fight and as we work to assist one another.”
The Missouri River has swelled following heavy rains and snowmelt earlier this month. The flooding has claimed three lives, damaged thousands of homes and busted about 20 levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri.
President Donald Trump on Thursday also approved Nebraska’s request for federal disaster assistance, which provides federal aid to supplement state, local and tribal recovery efforts. It also opens the door to grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help affected residents.
Missouri’s emergency declaration comes after state water patrol troopers worked into the night Wednesday, pulling four people from homes and three others from a boat that ran out of gas around the small town of Craig. People stacked sandbags at a nearby water treatment plant in Forest City on Thursday, while another levee breach across the river from Atchison, Kansas, threatened two towns where most residents had already left.
The flooding in Craig began after yet another levee breach, and several homes were inundated with water. A local ethanol plant was also shut down amid the flooding.
Scientists say climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme weather such as storms, floods, droughts and fires, but without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to the changing climate.
The US Army Corps of Engineers said water was also flowing over several other levees, including one near Missouri’s Bean Lake.

Deb Hooper, who lives near the lake, told KMBC-TV that she has been packing for a week and even removed the water heater, but she hopes to hold out.
“Last night, they came and told us it was, like, 2 inches (5 centimeters) below the levee,” she said, adding that she was warned to leave but declined. “I’m, like, ‘No, there ain’t no water yet.”’
In southwest Iowa, barriers protecting about 2,300 people and thousands of acres of farmland simply weren’t high enough to withstand the river, said Pat Sheldon, president of the Benton-Washington Levee District.
Sheldon told television station KNCY on Wednesday that the river levee “performed brilliantly for what it was designed to do, but it just sent more water at us than we had height.” He said it took $150 million to repair his district’s levees after flooding in 2011, but he estimates it could cost $500 million to do so after this year’s disaster.
In Missouri, the river was expected to crest Friday in St. Joseph at the third-highest flood level on record. Water was filling a casino parking lot in the city, though only about half a dozen homes in the city aren’t protected by a federal levee. Military planes were evacuated last week from nearby Rosecrans Air National Guard base.

The flooding has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating tens of thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock.
Nebraska’s governor said his state has suffered nearly $1.4 billion in estimated losses and damage, including $840 million in crop and cattle losses. A damage estimate Thursday from the state’s emergency management agency that compiled figures from county emergency managers put the damage at more than $640 million.
Members of the Nebraska Army National Guard used a helicopter Wednesday to drop 10 round hay bales to stranded cattle in various spots near Richland, which is about 80 miles west of Omaha.
Governor Pete Ricketts also estimated that more than 2,000 homes and 341 businesses have been damaged or destroyed in Nebraska alone.","The Missouri River has swelled following heavy rains and snowmelt earlier this month.

And for decades, those samples were basically useless to investigators, who ran into the same wall that has frustrated police since the invention of DNA forensics: A genetic fingerprint is not much good unless you know whom it belongs to. Whoever the killer was, he apparently was not one of the millions of convicts, offenders and arrestees in the FBI's national DNA database. The genetic samples from all those crime scenes identified the Golden State Killer merely as a big flashing question mark. Until this week -- when police announced that they had broken through the wall and identified Joseph James DeAngelo as the Golden State Killer suspect using an ingenious technique that thrills law enforcement officials and disturbs privacy advocates: They tracked their suspect through his family tree. Police said they checked the crime scene DNA against one of the genealogy sites that have lately become popular -- databases filled with the profiles of people who have volunteered their genetic codes in the hope of discovering their relatives and ancestors. GEDmatch, a free service, confirmed that police used it to identify DeAngelo. The suspected Golden State Killer was not in this database, either, but it didn't matter. A distant relative of his was, police say, and that person's DNA partially matched evidence related to the serial killer. Instantly, the pool of suspects shrank from millions of people down to a single family. Detectives then used traditional investigative techniques to narrow the family members down to one suspect: DeAngelo, 72, a former police officer who lived within a few miles of many of the attacks. If DeAngelo is indeed one of the most notorious serial killers in U.S. history, then his arrest Tuesday is a milestone in the short history of familial DNA searches -- a technique that is still on the fringe of forensic science and that some people think ought to stay there, lest it turn us all into potential informants. Others, however, hope it could lead to a world where no criminal ever feels safe, lest some distant cousin's DNA one day lead police to his door. Police began exploring DNA fingerprinting in 1985, a year before the Golden State Killer raped and bludgeoned his last known victim. It was used to help convict Florida rapist Tommie Lee Andrews two years later, Time magazine reported -- then a string of other criminals, until it became commonplace for police to obtain DNA samples from suspects to use as evidence in court. The FBI created a database of DNA profiles in the 1990s, and police lined up to check their evidence samples against it, hoping that their suspect might be an ex-convict, or already imprisoned, or otherwise in the system. The method even allowed police to solve cold cases, some of them investigated long before DNA testing existed. But the database was little help if the person tied to the DNA wasn't already in it. One of the first cases in which a family member's genes led police to a suspect was in Britain. The 1988 mutilation and murder of Lynette White on Valentine's Day was one of the country's most notorious unsolved cases, the BBC reported. Three men had been wrongly imprisoned for the crime. A massive police hunt had failed to turn up the real killer. But in the early 2000s, police found a new DNA sample at the crime scene ""under layers of paint on a skirting board,"" the BBC reported. The sample didn't match any profile in Britain's national database, but it partially matched with a 14-year-old boy whose DNA was on file after an altercation with police. The boy had been born after the murder, obviously, but he unwittingly led police to his uncle, who promptly confessed to the killing. Police in Los Angeles had a similar stroke of luck in 2010 when the DNA of the ""Grim Sleeper,"" a serial killer who had eluded capture for decades, partially matched to a man in the prison system. That man turned out to be the killer's son, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Grim Sleeper was identified as Lonnie David Franklin Jr. and sentenced to death. These cases, however, still relied on DNA obtained by police or through court orders -- if not from the suspect himself, then from a family member. It's only in the past few years, as millions of people have submitted DNA samples to ancestry websites, that police have used familial DNA searches in ways that read like science fiction. Take the case of the ""Canal Killer,"" a double slaying in Phoenix, Arizona, that had gone unsolved since the early 1990s. The suspect's DNA was on file but matched no one in the FBI database. Then in late 2014, the Arizona Republic wrote, police met a genealogist at a conference and told her about the case. Investigators eventually sent the genealogist, who did not live in the state, a profile of the Canal Killer's DNA sequence. Two months later, the newspaper wrote, the genealogist emailed police the suspect's likely last name -- Miller. This was not some psychic intuition, the Republic reported, but the result of searches the genealogist ran on Family Tree DNA and Ancestry.com, two of the most popular databases. That family name led police within weeks to suspect Bryan Patrick Miller. They secretly collected his DNA -- possibly from a discarded bottle or trash, the Republic wrote -- and arrested him, alleging that he had the same genetic fingerprint as the Canal Killer. On the more dystopian side of the spectrum, Wired reported on a filmmaker named Michael Usry who was accused of a 1996 murder in Idaho Falls nearly 20 years after the fact -- coincidentally the same month that Phoenix police got their break in the Canal Killer investigation. Usry, a teenager at the time of the killing, was picked up in December 2014 by police at his doorstep in New Orleans, Wired wrote. He was interrogated by an FBI agent and spent a month under suspicion -- all because the killer's genetic code was similar to his father's, whose DNA sample had been obtained by Ancestry.com. But unlike Miller and DeAngelo, Usry's DNA test ruled him out as a suspect. His father was one of many false positives that plague familial DNA testing, Wired wrote. ""He seemed like a really good candidate,"" an Idaho Falls police sergeant told the New Orleans Advocate after Usry was cleared. ""But we've had that happen before."" Familial DNA searches, in fact, had an 83 percent failure rate in a 2014 British study, Wired wrote. This is part of the reason that many warn against the practice, even as law enforcement agencies master its uses. ""The technique is arousing fierce objections from privacy advocates, who maintain that it turns family members into genetic informants without their knowledge or consent,"" Ellen Nakashima wrote in The Washington Post in 2008, long before the popularity of genealogy sites exploded. Since then, Wired reported, Maryland and the District of Columbia have banned familial DNA searches, while the method is regulated in several other states, including California, where police used it to track down the Golden State Killer suspect. ""You allow that low-quality potential evidence to start being searched in these unregulated databases,"" Stephen Mercer, a former public defender who helped pass the ban on familial search in Maryland, told The Post. ""You're casting a wide net of suspicion over many, many people."" The use of genetic websites in the hunt for the Golden State Killer also led investigators to the wrong man last year, according to court records obtained Friday by the Associated Press. The daughter of a 73-year-old Oregon City man said authorities took swabs for DNA from her father in a nursing home without notifying her. Aware that their millions of customers don't necessarily want to inform on their relatives, some genealogy companies actively resist handing over data to police, STAT wrote this week. 23andMe, one of the earliest and most popular DNA search companies, has refused all law enforcement requests, the outlet wrote. So has Ancestry -- at least since 2014, when police used its database to erroneously accuse Usry of the 1996 Idaho Falls murder. California investigators did not use either of those sites to find the family of the Golden State Killer suspect. Rather, they reportedly ran their old evidence through GEDmatch, a relatively small, free service that allows users to upload and analyze their DNA sequences. ""We understand that the GEDmatch database was used to help identify the [suspected] Golden State Killer,"" the company said in a statement. ""Although we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch's policy to inform users that the database could be used for other uses."" It's precisely those other uses that now, after the sensational break in a 40-year-old serial killer case, excite and alarm so many people. ""I think it's revolutionary,"" Richard Shelby, a former Sacramento County Sheriff's Department detective who hunted the Golden State Killer in the 1970s, told The Post after this week's arrest. ""If criminals out there know they can be tracked down this way, they are going to have to try to not leave their DNA at the scene, and that's nearly impossible,"" he said. ""It's one of the best crime-fighting tools to come in a long, long time."" Justin Jouvenal, Drew Harwell and Tom Jackman contributed to this report.

"Nsikan Akpan, PBS NewsHour","Late Saturday, Kilauea’s lava oozed into the Pacific Ocean for the first time since the volcano began erupting on May 4. The resulting cloud prompted the U.S. Geological Survey to issue a warning for “laze,” better known as “lava haze”—the dense white plume created when the molten rock meets water. This violent collision emits a mixture of glass shards and a corrosive substance on par with battery acid, to the peril of anyone downwind. As bad as it sounds, this poisonous haze may not be the most dangerous part of lava sliding into the ocean. The PBS NewsHour spoke with a pair of scientists about the hazards that Kilauea might pose before it finishes erupting. Glass cement for your lungs If you could stare into the milky plume of Kilauea’s laze, you would see lava cooling very quickly into clear glass. “When you pick up a chunk of lava in Hawaii, it has this almost iridescent glassy sheen to it because it’s cooled into a volcanic glass. There are no crystals in it,” said Erik Klemetti, a volcanologist at Denison University in Ohio. But the combination of hot rock and water also produces steam, which has enough force to instantly shatter the lava-based glass into miniscule shards. Klemetti said people see these glass shards all the time, even if they don’t realize it—the shards are the main component of volcanic ash. They’re smaller than grains of sand, he said, but if you look at them under a microscope, their edges are shaped into cusps or crescents. This cuspate ash, as it’s called, is hazardous to humans in two ways. “One is that you’ll end up cutting the inside of your lungs,” Klemetti said. The second: “If you breathe enough of it, then it forms like a cement in your lungs as well because it’s mixing with all the moisture.” That’s why so many people die of asphyxiation in giant eruptions of ash, such as with Mount St. Helens in 1980. These glass shards can also pile up near the coastline, posing a risk to wildlife and beach walkers, but they tend to settle out quickly, Klemetti said. Kilauea’s chlorine gas The laze’s second aerial threat comes in the form of a mist made of hydrochloric acid. “The lava is so hot that it is boiling the ocean water completely dry,” said Michael Poland, a geophysicist with USGS. “So even the solids in ocean water like salt—sodium chloride—are incorporated into the chemistry of the plume.” Some of this airborne table salt reacts chemically with hydrogen in the water vapor, creating the hydrochloric acid. This acid mist can cause irritation and burning, particularly to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. But it and the glass shards are only dangerous if you’re standing or sailing in the immediate vicinity. Rushing rivers of lava The ongoing eruption has created nearly two dozen fissures, and Poland said it’s unclear how many of the resulting lava flows might enter the ocean. The lava flows reshape the land, creating an array of channels. Some lava follows the same path, while others “may butt up against the existing flows and be diverted into new ocean entries,” Poland said. One thing is clear: Kilauea’s lava is moving swiftly. “We’re seeing these fast-moving ‘pahoehoe’ flows.” Klemetti said. “They look like rivers—they’re moving that fast.” Klemetti speculates this speed might mean the lava is hotter than normal. So even though the lava is the consistency of honey, it’s less sticky than usual because of the extra heat. “As the lava flows, the edges cool and start to build up — like a levee or wall on on each side. They eventually develop a channel as the walls get taller,” Klemetti said. “Channels that are forming can help sort of insulate the lava flows and keep them hotter for longer so they can travel further down down slope.” Kilauea’s false benches It’s official: Hawaii is growing because lava seeping into the ocean is adding new land mass to the Big Island. But you should hold off on buying this land for beachfront property. One collapse of a lava bench in 2016 created such a big explosion of ash and steam that it could be seen from space. Both Klemetti and Poland warned of so-called “lava benches” or “lava deltas” — places along the coast where the lava cools and builds outward. The lava benches are made of splotchy rock with a foundation comprised of sand. Their cooled rocky surface may not burn your feet, but they have a tendency to collapse. Many people have been killed this way, Poland said. “They were they were caught up in the collapse and swept out to sea,” Poland said. “Or when the collapse happened, it exposed a tremendous amount of hot rocks to the ocean all at once—that generated small explosions of rock.” One collapse of a lava bench in 2016 created such a big explosion of ash and steam that it could be seen from space. The collapses can also create large waves and threaten nearby boats. Over the weeked, Hawaii officials reported the first injury due to the eruption, a broken leg caused by flying lava spatter. The good news: At this point, we’ve pretty much seen Kilauea’s full hand of hazards, Poland said, listing the lava entry into the ocean and other risks, like volcanic fog (“vogs”) of sulphuric acid, fast-moving lava and spattering gas emissions. “We’re seeing nearly all of the hazards that Kilauea can generate right now with the exception of really large explosive eruptions from the summit,” Poland said. “We know that Kilauea can experience cycles of explosive eruptions—really large magmatic explosive eruptions. But we’re not really in a situation like that right now.” This article is reprinted with permission from PBS NewsHour.

Rod Dreher,"The New York Times Magazine devoted its issue yesterday to “Love City: 24 Hours of Romance, Lust and Heartache in New York”. John Podhoretz, an Ur-New Yorker, commented: Interesting that the “24 Hours of Love” issue of the NYTMagazine begins in at a sex party followed by a strip club. I know it’s 12 am and all but if this is what we are to understand Love is in 2018 we may not have to wonder at the suicide spike that has us all freaked out. — John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) June 9, 2018 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The Times Magazine Love issue brings to us the sweet story of Hanna, a teenage daughter of a lady rabbi in Brooklyn, and her Beaux. No, I don’t mean the men competing for her heart. I mean Beaux ( née Sophie), her lesbian lover. And there’s Harry, Hanna’s male lover. They are a throuple, our Hanna, Harry, and Beaux. The Times contributor Elizabeth Weil writes about them as if they were enchanted. We join them as Harry and Hanna leave synagogue services: Two by two may have worked for Noah’s animals in the (heteronormative!) Bible, but these are people — specific, glorious, teenage people — and their hearts are much bigger than anyone could imagine. As congregants spilled into the temple foyer and wished one another “Shabbat shalom,” Beaux, Hanna’s girlfriend, appeared — her face tough, tender, searching, critical, defended and vulnerable all at once. She wore boots, baggy jeans, shark-tooth earrings and a silk camisole, and her head was shaved. Take that, Biblical heteronormativity! It seems that Hanna is a dingbat who twirls through life like a Malick heroine: Hanna floated between Beaux and Harry. She’s the quietest of the bunch, and her heart seems almost miraculously whole and unbroken, like a cake hot from the oven before the surface cools, contracts and cracks. This is perhaps a result of the fact that Hanna is a person who falls in love with one thing and then falls in love with another thing and then, instead of letting go of the first, just adds on. She loved all the Harry Potter books, and then she loved all the Percy Jackson books, and she still rereads them both. Same with watching “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Doctor Who.” And so it was with Harry and Beaux. A few months before she started dating Harry, Hanna spoke with Beaux in the front doorway of her house. “I have something to say,” Hanna told her. “I like you.” “I like you, too,” Beaux said, “but let’s not date!” Beaux soon changed her mind. To deal with the situation, she wrote a slam poem titled “The 21st Century Version of Asking for Their Parent’s Blessing” and performed it on video for Harry. “Dear Mr. Harry,” it started: I am in love with your girlfriend. Now, I know how this sounds but you’ve done it too and you know how she is and you’ve seen the way I look at her. She is important to me. She is the caveat in every suicide note The random smile in the middle of math class. Harry handled Beaux’s request extremely well. He was a mensch already and had been friends with Hanna in ninth grade, when she talked about almost nothing but her love for Beaux. He did not want to be the kind of boyfriend who kept his girlfriend from chasing her bliss. Harry is a gamma-male who is being cuckolded, but being woke, doesn’t mind. At this point, you may ask yourself: what kind of parents want their teenagers involved in a polyamorous bisexual threesome? And, as these three are minors: what kind of parents give permission for The New York Times Magazine to profile their relationship? Welcome to 2018. More: Beaux has a theory: San Francisco is the capital of white gay men. New York City is the center of queer youth. “When you are queer, that becomes like a huge part of who you are,” Hanna told me, “because you just start to be like, Damn, I’m so gay, constantly.” You’re sitting watching “Castle,” and Stana Katic comes on-screen, and you’re like, Damn, I’m really gay! Or you see something cute, like even that hetero couple in “The End of the F***ing World,” and you find yourself thinking, That’s so gay!, because the word “gay” is cross-wired in your brain with exuberant/life-affirming/hot/cute. You go to the ice cream truck, and you ask your friend what kind of sprinkles you should get, and she says, “You have to get rainbow ones because you’re queer.” You don’t need to push the boundaries or make up some whole new type of identity from scratch, but you do need to represent. A few years ago, Beaux and Hanna started poking around Tumblr, trying to name, with precision, their feelings and experiences. At first, Hanna said, “I was like, I think I’m bi, and then I learned the word ‘pansexual’ and was like, I think that describes me better.” Beaux goes with “queer,” partly to avoid the implication in the word “bi” that you’re a double agent and need to make up your mind. At school she hangs out with her gang of lesbians. “There’s a lesbian and a straight girl living inside me!” she says. “I’m the straightest one and the gayest one there, and that’s been my experience my entire life. It’s not like I’m.5 gay and.5 straight. It’s like I have two full sexualities.” But the city is not all one big sparkly unicorn of love. Hanna and Beaux are lucky, they know that. They know that if your parents are part of what they call “the Park Slope white-parent community” (not limited to Park Slope proper), your parents can’t be homophobic, or if they are they have to be hermits. White, liberal parents have to be O.K. if a kid comes out. When Hanna first told her mom she was bi, her mom said: “I think I might be bi, too, but it doesn’t matter because I’m married to your father! If I had the freedoms you have in high school, things might have been different.” Her mom is a rabbi. Mom the Latent Bisexual Rabbi who allows her daughter’s gay lover to spend the night with the daughter upstairs (there’s a photo of them kissing in bed, and another photo of them washing up after they spent the night together). I said they were a “throuple,” though they really aren’t. Turns out Beaux doesn’t want to kiss Harry. But that’s cool too: People often say to Beaux, Hanna and Harry: Isn’t this three-way relationship difficult? Aren’t you consumed by jealousy? Their honest, heartfelt answer is no. “Wow, I like you, and I like you, and I don’t feel tense about that!” — that’s their basic feeling. Beaux is O.K. with Hanna’s dating Harry, and Hanna is O.K. with Beaux’s dating whomever she wants (at the moment, she has such a huge crush on a girl from school that she bought a pair of shoes like the ones this girl wears, just to impress her), because they get to have each other, too. Read the whole thing. It’s at this point that some liberals realize that what looks like dreamy progress in Park Slope strikes many of those outside its borders as the kind of decadence from which they wish to protect their children. So they say, “Hey, you’re trying to make the mores of a very liberal place out to be exemplary of the rest of America! That’s wrong! You’re trying to panic people!” By now, you readers should be onto this strategy. You should be savvy enough to recognize that what is observed sympathetically in a place like the most important newspaper in America — the one read by the people who make movies and television — will eventually be mainstreamed through the mass media. In 1995, a movie called Kids, about semi-feral New York teenagers who drifted through life smoking dope, skateboarding, and having sex, was so controversial it almost didn’t get distribution (who distributed it? Harvey Weinstein!). In 2018, The New York Times Magazine writes a romantic piece about a teenage threesome, which features a photograph of the lesbian couple in this ménage washing up after having spent the night together … and it’s no longer edgy, as it was in Kids, but now it’s bourgeois and mainstream. Hey, Hanna’s a rabbi’s daughter, and the rabbi tells her daughter that she too would be interested in bonking women, but she’s married to dad, so … but good luck, honey! You girls have fun up there! I’d bet you a thousand dollars that producers are on the phone this morning with Hanna and Beaux and Harry, trying to buy rights to their story. And that it will be on Netflix, or Amazon, within a couple of years. So, who is the “René” of the headline? It’s René Girard, the late French cultural critic and the father of mimetic theory. Here is a very simple, four-minute introduction to his theory: In a nutshell, Girard said that we want the things we want after seeing other people want them. Desiring to eat is not a “want,” but a “need.” But what we desire to eat — that’s a “want,” and it’s socially conditioned. The idea is not so much that we want what others have, but rather than we want what we see others wanting. Hanna is a flibbertigibbet who desires indiscriminately, and who is embedded in a culture that certifies those desires. Beaux’s desire, and Harry’s desire, is more restricted, but they all seem to agree that within their city’s youth culture, there are no boundaries on sexual desire and gender expression. The story also indicates that outside of liberal circles, parents may not accept what the kids desire, but that is simply something that has to be dealt with. Reading that part of the story, I couldn’t help thinking about last week’s conversation with a liberal friend who teaches school in a small Southern town in the middle of nowhere, and who told me that the kids in their school are way, way more liberal on sex and sexuality than their clueless parents think. I keep hearing this in dribs and drabs from pastors and teachers who read this blog. Culture is all national now. One Evangelical pastor here in Louisiana stopped me to tell me about how this is totally mainstream in his small town on the bayou, and that many older people in the town are trying to pretend that it’s not real because they don’t have the slightest idea how to deal with it. Point is, young people today experience mimetic desire in relation to the popular culture to which they are exposed. Celebrating stories like the Park Slope Teen Lovers moves the Overton window — that is, the range of ideas acceptable in public discourse — towards greater permissivism, and the mimesis function creates within young people the desire to give freer rein to their sexual impulses, however anarchic. It is now acceptable in public discourse to celebrate a bisexual teenage ménage à trois as just one more way people love each other. If you are a conservative who thinks this is going to stay in Park Slope, or in Manhattan, I’m sorry, you’re an idiot. Where is this going to go? What is it going to mean for us as a society, a culture, a civilization? We are rushing so fast to tear down enthusiastically boundaries that were erected time out of mind. We have created a culture — economic, moral, religious, etc. — in which individual desire is formless, directionless, and its own justification. Ever heard of Harvard sociologist Carle C. Zimmerman’s 1947 book Family and Civilization ? Zimmerman was not a religious man, but he saw as far back as the early postwar era that civilizations that do not have strong families and family systems cannot survive. In this book, which entails a historical analysis of Greek and Roman civilizations, as well as the evolving family systems in the medieval West, up to the present times, Zimmerman diagnoses the West as entering a period of family collapse. Mind you, this was in 1947, a time most of us think of as a Golden Age. In this excerpt, Zimmerman speaks of the coming dissolution of marriage and family. Remember, he speaks not as a moralist, but as a sociologist of the family. He writes that family structure and meaning is almost entirely determined by “external causation — by the dominant fashion or cultural coloration of a given time. Since that is sensate, to use Sorokin’s terminology, marriage must go on to sensate levels of experience. And since the limited, purely sensate conception of familism and love is antithetical to almost any family life at all, marriage must go. Zimmerman’s point is that you cannot have a society in which people are driven primarily by their untrained, unrestrained desire. Families don’t just happen. They are constructed. What’s happening now reminds me of what happened in the Mississippi River trading port called Bayou Sara, in the early 20th century. The town, which is just down the hill from the bluff on which my hometown, St. Francisville, was built, existed because it could afford a strong levee to keep out the river in flood. The boll weevil plague hit the cotton planters hard economically, and their economic losses made it difficult to keep the levee strong. In 1912, the levee burst, wiping out the town. What had been a bustling trade center became a ghost town. Today, there’s nothing but willows there. When I was a child a half century ago, you could still see the faint outlines of the town’s streets, but today, even those scars have disappeared. Anyway, Zimmerman writes, about the family’s disintegration in the face of the evaporation of religious and moral prohibitions: If there is any possible power that can stop this movement, it must be found in the exterior environment of the society. It will consist chiefly of antagonistic forces arising from the decay of previous social conditions. This decay can be temporary, like the panic of the 1930s or the civil wars preceding Augustus, or more permanent, as in the Dark Ages after the decline of the Roman Empire. Conditions arise in which it is difficult for even the civilized domestic institution of the family to survive. The the family system changes and in time (at least in the past) recovers some of tis familism. But it was a rough and brutal road leading from Rome to the Renaissance. Zimmerman wrote that history shows that once the familistic system (that is, a society based on the family) dissolves, there’s no easy way to get it back. The Church of the so-called Dark Ages undertook strong measures to reconstitute it. Interestingly, Zimmerman says the church fathers in the West decided that they’d be better off trying to Christianize barbarians, with their strong clan systems, than in trying to rehabilitate dissolute Romans. More: The result demonstrates that when the family is completely atomized, familistic reform seemingly must come from extrafamilistic forces in the culture. Men do not seem to turn back willingly toward the familism necessary to preserve the social system. That is a point with which the “liberal” antifamilists do not seem to reckon. None are so blind as those who will not see. Indeed. The idea is not that your daughter is going to carry on with a girl and a guy simultaneously (though she might). The idea — or at least the main idea I want to get across — is that a world in which that is normal is a world in which it will be far more difficult to form strong families.We are living through the dissolution of a civilization. The levee is not going to hold. If you are any kind of religious or social conservative, especially if you are a parent of children, you and your neighbors had better start building the arks.","A teen throuple, mimesis, and the breaking of the levee",2018-06-11T18:48:54Z,"{'id': 'the-american-conservative', 'name': 'The American Conservative'}","Harry, Hanna, Beaux — And René",http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/harry-hanna-beaux-and-rene/,http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-11-at-12.34.38-PM-1024x488.png,the-american-conservative,The American Conservative,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Associated Press, Christopher Sherman, Associated Press","Several busloads of mostly Central American migrants traveling in a caravan arrived to Tijuana, Mexico. USA TODAY The view of tear gas that U.S. border police used to prevent groups of people from crossing El Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana on Sunday. (Photo: David Guzmán/EPA-EFE via AP) TIJUANA, Mexico Hundreds of migrants approaching the U.S. border from Mexico were enveloped with tear gas Sunday after several tried to make it past fencing and wire separating the two countries. Earlier in the morning, a group of Central Americans staged a peaceful march to appeal for the U.S. to speed up the asylum claims process, but their demonstration devolved as they neared the crossing with the U.S. and some saw an opportunity to breach the border. U.S. agents shot several rounds of gas, according to an Associated Press reporter on the scene, after migrants attempted to penetrate several points along the border. Migrants sought to squeeze through gaps in wire, climb over fences and peel back metal sheeting to enter. More: Incoming Mexican government says there is no 'Remain in Mexico' deal on migrants More: Why Central Americans are fleeing their countries in migrant caravans Children screamed and coughed in the mayhem of the tear gas. Fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, not attempting to enter the U.S. Yards away on the U.S. side, shoppers streamed in and out of an outlet mall. Honduran Ana Zuniga, 23, said she saw other migrants open a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the Mexican side of a levee, at which point U.S. agents fired tear gas at them. We ran, but when you run the gas asphyxiates you more, she told the AP while cradling her 3-year-old daughter Valery in her arms. U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopters flew overhead, while U.S. agents held vigil on foot beyond the wire fence in California. The pedestrian crossings at the San Ysidro port of entry, closed earlier in the day, were reopened about 3:45 p.m. PST, the Border Patrol office in San Diego said via Twitter. In a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen called the San Ysidro closure a matter of ""public safety,"" blaming migrants who ""sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them."" Last Slide Next Slide ""As I have continually stated, DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons. We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nations sovereignty,"" Nielsen said. Earlier Sunday, the group of several hundred migrants pushed past a blockade of Mexican police who were standing guard near the international border crossing. They appeared to easily pass through without using violence, and some of the migrants called on each other to remain peaceful. They carried hand-painted American and Honduran flags while chanting: We are not criminals! We are international workers! Migrants were asked by police to turn back toward Mexico. Around 5,000 migrants have been camped in and around a sports complex in Tijuana after making their way through Mexico in recent weeks via caravan. Many hope to apply for asylum in the U.S., but agents at the San Ysidro entry point are processing fewer than 100 asylum petitions a day. Irineo Mujica, who has accompanied the migrants for weeks as part of the aid group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, said the aim of Sundays march toward the U.S. border was to make the migrants plight more visible to the governments of Mexico and the U.S. We cant have all these people here, Mujica told The Associated Press. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum on Friday declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million, which he says is struggling to accommodate the crush of migrants. U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter Sunday to express his displeasure with the caravans in Mexico. Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer), he wrote. Mexicos Interior Ministry said Sunday the country has sent 11,000 Central Americans back to their countries of origin since Oct. 19. It said that 1,906 of them were members of the recent caravans. Mexico is on track to send a total of around 100,000 Central Americans back home by the end of this year.

Alex Fischer,"More News Headlines WINONA, Min. (WKBT) - The renovated Levee Park was the site of the first ever Winona Holiday Market on Saturday and Sunday. Organizers say hundreds of people came to buy goods from more than 20 vendors. Most of the vendors were local, but some, such as a seller of hand-made bows and arrows, came in from the Twin Cities. The market came together in only six weeks after Alison Betting, the owner of a baking business calledTiny Spoons, came to the city with the idea. ""These events are the things that start the business. We've got venders here [that] try out things before they get a storefront and develop... footprints in the community.""

Colleen Long and Elliot Spagat / AP,"(SAN DIEGO) — President Donald Trump is strongly defending the U.S. use of tear gas at the Mexican border to repel a crowd of migrants that included angry rock-throwers but also barefoot, crying children. Critics denounced the border agents’ action as overkill, but Trump kept to a hard line. “They were being rushed by some very tough people and they used tear gas,” Trump said Monday of the previous day’s encounter. “Here’s the bottom line: Nobody is coming into our country unless they come in legally.” The showdown at the San Diego-Tijuana border crossing has thrown into sharp relief two competing narratives about the caravan of migrants hoping to apply for asylum but stuck on the Mexican sider. Trump portrays them as a threat to U.S. national security, intent on exploiting America’s asylum law, but others insist he is exaggerating to stoke fears and achieve his political goals. The sheer size of the caravan makes it unusual. “I think it’s so unprecedented that everyone is hanging their own fears and political agendas on the caravan,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies immigration. “You can call it scary, you can call it hopeful, you can call it a sign of human misery. You can hang whatever angle you want to on it.” Trump rails against migrant caravans as dangerous groups of mostly single men. That view featured heavily in his speeches during the midterm election campaign when several were hundreds of miles away, traveling on foot. Officials have said some 500 members are criminals, but haven’t backed that up with details on why they think so. On Monday, Trump tweeted the caravan at the border included “stone cold criminals.” Mario Figueroa — Tijuana’s social services department director who is overseeing operations at the sports complex where most of the migrants in the caravan are staying — said as of Friday that of the 4,938 staying there, 933 were women, 889 were children and 3,105 were men, which includes fathers traveling with families along with single men. The U.S. military said Monday that about 300 troops who had been deployed in south Texas and Arizona as part of a border security mission have been moved to California for similar work. The military’s role is limited largely to erecting barriers along the border and providing transportation and logistical support to Customs and Border Protection. Democratic lawmakers and immigrant rights groups blasted the border agents’ Sunday tactics. “These children are barefoot. In diapers. Choking on tear gas,” California Governor-elect Gavin Newsom tweeted. “Women and children who left their lives behind — seeking peace and asylum — were met with violence and fear. That’s not my America.” But U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the administration’s concerns about the caravan “were borne out and on fully display” Sunday. McAleenan said hundreds — perhaps more than 1,000 — people attempted to rush vehicle lanes at the San Ysidro crossing. Mexican authorities estimated the crowd at 500. The chaos followed what began as a peaceful march to appeal for the U.S. to speed processing of asylum claims. After being stopped by Mexican authorities, the migrants split into groups. On the west side of the crossing, some tried to get through razor-wire fencing in a concrete levee that separates the two countries. On the east side, some pulled back a panel of fencing made of Army surplus steel landing mats to create an opening of about 4 feet, through which a group of more than 30 people crossed, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Others made it over a steel fence farther east. McAleenan said four agents were struck with rocks but were not injured because they were wearing protective gear. Border Protection agents launched pepper spray balls in addition to tear gas in what officials said were on-the-spot decisions made by agents. U.S. troops deployed to the border on Trump’s orders were not involved in the operation. “The agents on scene, in their professional judgment, made the decision to address those assaults using less lethal devices,” McAleenan told reporters. The scene was reminiscent of the 1980s and early 1990s when large groups of migrants rushed vehicle lanes at San Ysidro and overwhelmed Border Patrol agents in nearby streets and fields. U.S. authorities made 69 arrests on Sunday. Mexican authorities said 39 people were arrested in Mexico. The incident left many migrants feeling they had lost whatever possibility they might have had for making asylum cases. Isauro Mejia, 46, of Cortes, Honduras, looked for a cup of coffee Monday morning after spending Sunday caught up in the clash. “The way things went yesterday … I think there is no chance,” he said. Mexico’s Interior Ministry said in a statement it would immediately deport those people arrested on its side and would reinforce security. Border Patrol agents have discretion on how to deploy less-than-lethal force. It must be both “objectively reasonable and necessary in order to carry out law enforcement duties” — and used when other techniques are not sufficient to control disorderly or violent subjects. Last week Trump gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis explicit authority to use military troops to protect Customs and Border Protection agents on the border, with lethal force if necessary. Mattis also was empowered to temporarily detain illegal migrants in the event of violence against the border patrol. Mattis told reporters this did not change the military’s mission in any way, and that he would use the new authorities only in response to a request by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He said there had been no such request yet. With the caravan as a backdrop, Trump has used national security powers to circumvent longstanding immigration law to deny asylum to anyone caught crossing the border illegally. However, a court has put those regulations on hold after civil liberties groups sued. On Thanksgiving Day, the president warned of “bedlam, chaos, injury and death” if the courts block his efforts to harden immigration rules. But it’s also possible that Sunday’s clash was borne of increasing desperation caused by the hardening of the policies, said Rachel Schmidtke, program associate for migration at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Mexico Institute. “This situation is now escalating to the point of a self-fulfilling prophesy,” she said. “The more you squeeze the more it artificially creates something that didn’t exist, but now is starting to become a crisis.” Contact us at editors@time.com.",President Donald Trump is defending the use of tear gas at the Mexican border to repel a crowd of migrants that included children,2018-11-27T01:26:37Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",President Trump Strongly Defends Use of Tear Gas Against Migrants Trying to Cross the Mexican Border,http://time.com/5464165/donald-trump-defends-tear-gas-migrant-caravan/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gettyimages-1072667260.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dana Hunter,"A long, long time ago in a city far, far away, I learned something rather astonishing about the city of New Orleans. I mean, it's probably not astonishing to most people, but to a girl who grew up at a minimum elevation of 7,500 feet, finding out that a good half of a major American city hangs out below freaking sea level was jarring as heck. I had no idea how things had gotten that way, or why we'd want to build in such a place. I wish teenage me had been able to read "" How Humans Sunk New Orleans,"" which does an absolutely marvelous job explaining how a town that started above the sea eventually became a booming city that sunk below it. Understanding how these features rose, and why they later sank, entails going back to the end of the Ice Age, when melting glaciers sent sediment-laden runoff down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Starting around 7,200 years ago, the river’s mouth began pressing seaward, dumping sediments faster than currents and tides could sweep them away. The mud accumulated, and lower Louisiana gradually emerged from the Gulf shore. Areas closest to the river and its branches rose the highest in elevation, because they got the most doses of the coarsest sediment. Areas farther from the river got just enough silt and clay particles to rise only slightly above the sea, becoming swamps. Areas farthest out received scanty deposition of the finest particles amid brackish tides, becoming grassy wetlands or saline marsh. The entire delta, under natural conditions, lay above sea level, ranging from a few inches along the coastal fringe to over a dozen feet high at the crest of the Mississippi River’s natural levee. Nature built lower Louisiana above sea level, albeit barely—and mutably. The story spans thousands of years and thousands of enterprising humans, determined to make nature bend to their will. Eventually, they figured out how a combination of devices like walls, levees, pumps, and canals could dry out the land and give them more room to build. And they discovered that nature is not so easily controlled. We're an ingenious species, but we can't see all of the consequences of our innovations. Even when we do see, sometimes we have little choice. We built a major American city in a horribly fragile area, and now we find ourselves unable to abandon it. We grabbed the Mississippi by the delta, and now we're not sure if it's going to hurt more to hold on or let go. It's not just New Orleans: it's the entire delta we've remade. I had little grasp on that feat until I read John McPhee's essay on it a few years ago. Listen to what the river was, and what it built, before we came to restrain it: The Mississippi River, with its sand and silt, has created most of Louisiana, and it could not have done so by remaining in one channel. If it had, southern Louisiana would be a long narrow peninsula reaching into the Gulf of Mexico. Southern Louisiana exists in its present form because the Mississippi River has jumped here and there within an arc about two hundred miles wide, like a pianist playing with one hand—frequently and radically changing course, surging over the left or the right bank to go off in utterly new directions. Always it is the river’s purpose to get to the Gulf by the shortest and steepest gradient. As the mouth advances southward and the river lengthens, the gradient declines, the current slows, and sediment builds up the bed. Eventually, it builds up so much that the river spills to one side. Major shifts of that nature have tended to occur roughly once a millennium. The Mississippi’s main channel of three thousand years ago is now the quiet water of Bayou Teche, which mimics the shape of the Mississippi. Along Bayou Teche, on the high ground of ancient natural levees, are Jeanerette, Breaux Bridge, Broussard, Olivier—arcuate strings of Cajun towns. Eight hundred years before the birth of Christ, the channel was captured from the east. It shifted abruptly and flowed in that direction for about a thousand years. In the second century a.d., it was captured again, and taken south, by the now unprepossessing Bayou Lafourche, which, by the year 1000, was losing its hegemony to the river’s present course, through the region that would be known as Plaquemines. By the nineteen-fifties, the Mississippi River had advanced so far past New Orleans and out into the Gulf that it was about to shift again, and its offspring Atchafalaya was ready to receive it. By the route of the Atchafalaya, the distance across the delta plain was a hundred and forty-five miles—well under half the length of the route of the master stream. For the Mississippi to make such a change was completely natural, but in the interval since the last shift Europeans had settled beside the river, a nation had developed, and the nation could not afford nature. The engineering feats it took to bring that river to heel, and keep it there, were mind-boggling. These two essays together will help you see New Orleans in a way you may never have considered. Even if you already know the story, these are two brilliantly-written pieces that will reward every minute you spend with them. The feats that built New Orleans were impressive, but it's time to change perspective. We can't wrestle nature and win forever. To survive the coming centuries, we'll need to find ways to accommodate those forces. We'll have to rethink our relationship entirely.",Human reactions to the forces of nature have made New Orleans one of the most unnatural cities in the world.

"by Kiah Collier, The Texas Tribune, and T. Christian Miller, ProPublica","This story was co-published with The Texas Tribune. The kickback scheme was allegedly hashed out over weeknight drinks at a steakhouse in a border county in south Texas. Amid surf and turf and expensive scotch, a Hidalgo County official said he would meet with contractors in the clubby confines of the restaurant in a strip mall in McAllen. There, Godfrey Garza Jr., director of the county’s drainage district, cajoled company executives to hire a firm owned by his family in exchange for a cut of lucrative construction contracts, according to new documents filed in state district court in Hidalgo County. The target of the plan: a $232 million project funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the county to build a border fence and rehabilitate aging dirt levees along the Rio Grande. The previously unreported details of Garza’s alleged scheme emerged last week in an ongoing lawsuit in which the county has sued companies owned by Garza, his wife and their two sons for fraud during the construction of the combined levee-fence. The new filings also implicate one of Texas’ most powerful engineering firms, Dannenbaum Engineering, as a participant in the scheme. “[T]he deeper we look into this case the more troubling facts we discover,” said Michael J. Blanchard, the county’s lawyer. “As evidence develops, it is increasingly clear that the wrongdoing in this case rose beyond the level of simple fraud.” Get ProPublica’s Major Investigations by Email Garza has denied any wrongdoing and has countersued the county. A spokesman for Dannenbaum repeated the company’s insistence that any claims of misconduct were false. The new allegations come a month after an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica revealed that Homeland Security poured more than $174 million into the project while largely ignoring safeguards to protect taxpayer funds. The levee-fence in Hidalgo County was erected as part of a race to build 654 miles of barriers between the U.S. and Mexico a decade ago. Today, of course, President Donald Trump is pushing to spend billions of dollars to build a more imposing and lengthy border barrier across much of the entire U.S./Mexico border, an aim he is likely to spell out again in Tuesday night’s State of the Union address. To speed construction, the agency issued a grant to the county that called for “substantial federal involvement” in the project. But the investigation found that agency officials did not know Garza’s family were hired as subcontractors on the project. The agency also failed to act aggressively after a whistleblower came forward to report concerns over Garza’s employment contract with the county, which called for him to receive 1.5 percent of any money spent to build the levee-fence project. Godfrey Garza Jr. is the target of an ongoing lawsuit brought by Hidalgo County detailing a kickback scheme. (The Monitor) Garza and his company, Integ, earned $3.7 million as a result of the contract, while his children’s firm, Valley Data Collection Specialists, received at least $1.6 million in subcontracts, court records show. Federal law generally bans entering into contracts with commissions and prohibits potential conflicts of interest. The broad outlines of the claims against Garza and his family were made last year in a lawsuit by the county to recover public funds. The latest complaint adds new details by portraying Garza as the mastermind of a scheme in which Dannenbaum, the project manager, and other contractors knowingly participated. It says the Garzas and Dannenbaum demonstrated “a pattern of racketeering activity,” describing payments Dannenbaum made to Valley Data as “bribes.” It also alleges that Valley Data didn’t do much, if any, work on the project but instead served as “a kickback vehicle and money laundering machine.” The lawsuit also claims that Garza didn’t do the construction work for which he made his multimillion-dollar commission. The filing is based in part on a deposition given last week by Garza in which he described regular informal meetings with county contractors and elected officials at the McAllen steakhouse. It also follows a recent deposition by Louis H. Jones, the head of Dannenbaum’s South Texas operations, in which he invoked his right to avoid self-incrimination in response to more than 100 questions from county lawyers about Garza and the levee-fence project. Jones told county lawyers that he is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation, “the breadth of which is uncertain.” The agency conducted a sweeping raid last April of Dannenbaum offices across the state, including in McAllen, but it is unclear whether the levee-fence project is a subject of that investigation. Garza’s attorney did not respond to request for comment on the county’s newest set of allegations. Garza has previously maintained that Hidalgo County commissioners approved the hiring of all contractors and subcontractors. Garza’s countersuit alleges he is owed $84,000 in back pay. Bill Miller, a spokesman for Dannenbaum, noted that the company, while named in the lawsuit, is not a defendant. “Any accusations of wrongdoing by Dannenbaum Engineering are false,” he said. Neither the original lawsuit nor the most recent filing detail the value of the contracts Dannenbaum and the other firms got. The attorney for Garza’s family’s company, Valley Data, did not return calls for comment. Valley Data was owned by Garza’s sons until ownership passed to his wife, Annie Garza, in 2012. A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security agency which oversaw construction on the border fence, declined comment on the litigation. The new accusations, which cite reporting by the Texas Tribune and ProPublica, raise additional questions about Homeland Security’s oversight even as top lawmakers in Congress have recently touted the Hidalgo County project as a model for new border wall construction. As drainage district director, Garza wielded considerable influence over the selection of contractors to build the fence. During one-on-one meetings at Lansky &amp; Brats Restaurant, now defunct, Garza asked Dannenbaum and other project contractors to direct subcontracts to Valley Data, an amended complaint alleges. Valley Data, which had only a handful of employees, received money for surveying and mapping but did little actual work, according to the filings. In a deposition, Garza acknowledged the meetings but portrayed them as routine interactions in the tightly knit world of politicians and builders in the Rio Grande Valley. He noted that elected county officials also frequented the restaurant, a popular watering hole. “It was not an official meeting or anything. It was just getting together, shoot the breeze, and talk about what was going on,” Garza said his deposition. “I would classify them more as 20 percent business and 80 percent social.” A county bureaucrat who was earning $71,715 per year in 2000, Garza resigned and negotiated a contract with the county in 2007 to earn a commission on construction projects as the border fence project was being discussed in Washington, D.C. His salary more than doubled in a matter of years. In his deposition, Garza acknowledged that he owns a 400-acre ranch and a beach house, went on a fishing trip to Cabo San Lucas with a project contractor and earned as much as $700,000 as general manager of another county agency while still heading the drainage district. The county’s lawsuit, he said, has been “a very tragic experience” for him and his family. He said he has had to spend more than $500,000 in attorney’s fees and filed an affidavit saying he has lost more than $1 million in business. Read Our Investigation “The rush to build the fence turned into a gold rush for Godfrey Garza, Jr.,” according to the newly amended complaint filed by Hidalgo County in state court last week. The dueling lawsuits over what happened in Hidalgo County come as Congress debates the merits of building a much more formidable and lengthy border wall in an effort to stem illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The second highest ranking GOP member of the Senate recently cited the Hidalgo County levee-wall project as a possible model for building the border wall that Trump made central to his campaign. Homeland Security has announced its intention to return to Hidalgo County to build a new border wall — possibly on top of existing levees At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this month, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas praised the Hidalgo County levee-wall as a “win-win.” It was unclear whether he was aware the county was suing Garza for fraud. His office did not return repeated requests for comment. “The only way that we can protect the border is by working with state and local officials as well as landowners in the private sector,” Cornyn said at the hearing. The levee-wall “provided that levee improvement, but also provided a wall in critical areas that the border patrol said they needed in order to slow down the flow of illegal immigration and drug trafficking and the like.” Other representatives have expressed concern about federal spending on the levee-wall project. U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a longtime member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said she was “surprised and appalled” to learn about the potential misspending of taxpayer dollars on the project. She said committee members asked the department at the time for reports on how exactly money was being spent on the border fence but it never provided anything to them. That needs to happen before Congress even considers funding more of a border barrier, she said. “The president indicated he has contractors standing by, ready to spend money, and we don’t even have an accounting of how money was spent before or how much was spent or whether the money was spent efficiently,” she said. “And, frankly, I think that that should be a nonstarter for any wall funding now.”","by Kiah Collier, The Texas Tribune, and T.

Sean O'Neal,"Watch This offers movie recommendations inspired by new releases or premieres, or occasionally our own inscrutable whims. Singling out just one John Mahoney performance feels a little reductive. Mahoney, who died yesterday at the age of 77, was a member of that rare stratum of actor who elevates every single thing they’re in, whether it’s as Ione Skye’s deeply flawed, yet completely relatable father in Say Anything; or as an old-school aluminum salesman in Tin Men; or the sunny morning show host who belittles Winona Ryder in Reality Bites; or a lecherous professor who charms Olympia Dukakis in Moonstruck ; or hell, even playing Paul Newman opposite Ben Stiller in a silly SNL parody of The Color Of Money. Mahoney’s obits almost uniformly identified him as “the dad from Frasier,” and there’s definitely no shame in that. Martin Crane is one of the great, archetypal characters of sitcom Valhalla, and Mahoney was so convincing as a blue-collar, ex- Seattle cop that you’d never know he was actually bred in Blackpool, England. Even still, Mahoney’s résumé ran far deeper than that, filled with appearances that he disappeared into just as remarkably—which unfortunately doesn’t make for a tidy headline. Singling out just one great performance in the Coens’ Barton Fink feels similarly diminishing. The 1991 movie is wall-to-peeling-wall with memorable turns in even the smallest of roles. Judy Davis’ wry, steely assistant, Audrey. Michael Lerne r’s blustering studio mogul. Tony Shalhoub’s acridly cynical producer. Even Richard Portnow and Christopher Murney as Hollywood’s most defiantly unimpressed detectives. It’s the kind of film where not a single line or moment goes to waste. But even there, John Mahoney stands out. His is one of the all-time great supporting actor turns, delivered for a filmmaking team that specializes in them. As the politically minded, pretentious playwright lured to L.A. to draft a wrestling picture, Barton Fink ( John Turturro ) is understood to be a stand-in for Clifford Odets—his origin story, at least. Unlike Barton, Odets didn’t mind Hollywood so much, working both in and out of the studio system and, most importantly, actually getting movies made. Whatever distaste or skepticism Odets might have held for showbiz was mostly purged in noirs like The Big Knife and Sweet Smell Of Success. And while Odets had a similar verve for “common man” vernacular that bore absolutely no resemblance to how real people talked, loved to expound at length on the philosophy of writing, and worked in a neurotic and ritualistic manner, by all accounts he never fell prey to crippling writers’ block nor serial-killing psychopaths. There’s a similarly loose resemblance between Mahoney’s character, a floridly boozy Southern author named W.P. Mayhew, and William Faulkner. Ethan Coen has acknowledged that discovering Faulkner had once worked on a wrestling picture starring Wallace Beery ( Whaddaya need, a road map? ) gave the brothers their way in on Barton Fink —the concept of an eminently serious author debasing themselves in order to, as Mayhew puts it to Barton, “make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick.” Like Faulkner, Mayhew is also a heavy drinker—Barton first discovers him puking in the bathroom—and he speaks in a casually baroque prose filled with references to the Bible and antebellum spirituals. Yet Cohen has also taken pains to say such similarities are “superficial.” Faulkner, like Odets, had his own reservations about the movie business, and he also expressed that contempt a bit more directly—and he had relatively less success in squaring them. At the same time, Faulkner also wrote dozens of short stories, along with some of his best novels, during and after his Hollywood tenure. Mayhew, by contrast, is an august failure—a genteel mess, a drunk with dignity. Mahoney imbues Mayhew with courtly grace through the smallest of gestures; during his prolific vomiting in the bathroom stall, Mayhew kneels on a silk pocket square, which he then tucks back into his suit with a practiced flourish. “Sorry about the odor,” he says to Barton, with a warm conviviality. As he takes in Barton’s subsequent gushing over his novels, Mahoney gives Mayhew a tight smile that conveys both his inurement to fanboys and the slightest hint of shame at his own lapsed greatness. Mayhew is charming and wittily composed in the way that every boozehound fancies themselves. He even makes his alcoholism sound noble: “I’m buildin’ a levee,” he tells Barton later. “Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin’ up a levee to keep that ragin’ river of manure from lappin’ at my door.” Mayhew somehow maintains that nobility even when he’s completely shitfaced. The punchline to Barton and Mayhew’s bathroom encounter, during which Mayhew invites him to come by his office later, is a smash cut to Mayhew bellowing inside his bungalow, with Mahoney giving Mayhew’s drunk voice a wounded and desperate tenor. In their rescheduled conference over a picnic, where the two discuss their differing approaches to writing—Mayhew, a beatific smile on his face, asks, “Ain’t writing peace?” while Barton contends it comes from “a great inner pain”—Mahoney gives his line a wistfulness that implicitly telegraphs just how far from that peace he is. He then drunkenly stumbles off with a droll suggestion of suicide, lashing out at Audrey while barking another purplish epigram—“The truth, my honey, is a tart that does not bear scrutiny!”—that’s just so much poetic nonsense. It’s all funny and pitiable, loathsome yet sad, and it lends some credence to Audrey’s tearful insistence that she really just feels sorry for him. “Empathy requires understanding,” she tells Barton as Mayhew wanders off howling “ Old Black Joe.” Mahoney plays all these conflicting tones beautifully, giving us a complete portrait—over just a couple of scenes and a few short minutes of screen time—of an arrogant asshole who’s shitty to women and probably a teensy bit racist, yet whom you’d still love to get a drink with. Like so many of the film’s borderline-cartoons, it’s a character that could have easily lapsed into Foster Brooks-meets-Foghorn Leghorn caricature—the sozzled, tormented genius spouting “mammies” and “sirruhs”—but Mahoney’s performance gives Mayhew both empathy and understanding, turning him into a symbol of talent rotting at the bottom of a rocks glass. It’s brief, yet enough to elevate him to the top tier of the Coens’ impressive stable of scene-stealers. (Mahoney would work with them only once more, as Jennifer Jason Leigh’s similarly archetypal newspaper editor in The Hudsucker Proxy, which seems like a shame.) And it’s a testament to how a character actor of Mahoney’s caliber can turn even a small part into something that lingers as long as an 11-season run on a hit TV show. Availability: Barton Fink is available on DVD through Netflix and to stream on Amazon. It may also be found in your local video store or library.","Watch This offers movie recommendations inspired by new releases or premieres, or occasionally our own inscrutable whims.

"by Kiah Collier, The Texas Tribune, and T. Christian Miller, ProPublica","E dinburg, Texas — A decade ago, Congress gave officials at the Department of Homeland Security a year to build 60 miles of fence in the Rio Grande Valley to protect the Texas-Mexico border. They faced determined resistance. Political leaders denounced the border fence as wasteful and ineffective. Landowners refused to sell their property for its construction. Environmentalists argued it would slice up habitat for endangered species in one of the most biodiverse regions in the country. The officials found a savior in a politically savvy bureaucrat named Godfrey Garza Jr. A shrewd county insider, Garza ran an obscure agency that had plans to repair 22 miles of crumbling dirt levees running along the Rio Grande, the riverine border between Texas and Mexico. Garza helped negotiate a deal: If Homeland Security would pay to fix the levees, the feds could build their fence on top of them. Read Part 1 of ‘The Taking’ The federal government’s boldest land grab in a generation produced the first border wall — and a trail of abuse, mistakes and unfairness. Read the story. Get More of ‘The Taking’ Sign up to get ProPublica’s major investigations delivered to your inbox. For Homeland Security, it was simple, one-stop shopping — no protests, no environmental hurdles, no need to buy land. Over the next several years, the federal government poured more than $174 million into the bank accounts of the Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 to build a fortified levee. The result was unique among the 654 miles of fence constructed by the agency across the U.S.-Mexico border: a looming, 15-foot-high vertical wall of concrete, topped in places by another 18 feet of rusty metal fence. What the federal government didn’t know was that Garza negotiated an unusual contract with county commissioners that earned him 1.5 percent of every dollar the drainage district spent on the levee project — in addition to his six-figure salary. In the end, Garza’s personal yield totaled at least $3.5 million, according to county records. The payouts didn’t stop there. To oversee the project, the drainage district hired Texas construction giant Dannenbaum Engineering, whose chief executive is one of the biggest GOP donors in the state. Dannenbaum and other project contractors, in turn, subcontracted with a company owned by Garza’s children — and later his wife — sending at least a million dollars to his family. In its haste to beat the congressional deadline, Homeland Security failed to follow basic safeguards designed to protect public money, according to a Texas Tribune and ProPublica review of previously unreleased court files, sworn depositions, emails and public records. The federal government also ignored repeated warnings that Garza was personally enriching himself and his family with federal dollars, the review found. The project left behind shredded accounting records, allegations of hush money in the form of tickets to a Pitbull concert and concerns over the possible drowning of ocelots, the review found. Homeland Security’s grant to the county for the levee-fence called for “ substantial federal involvement ” and required the agency to approve all contractors and subcontractors on the project. But Homeland Security officials have told Hidalgo County that they did not know about Garza’s compensation agreement or the payments to his family’s firm until the county launched its own investigation in 2014, according to county officials. The federal government also paid little heed when a local whistleblower stepped forward to report her concerns over Garza’s deal. The district’s chief financial officer went to the FBI as early as 2008 and to Homeland Security several years later. Even as project costs doubled, the agency continued to send money into a region infamous for its corrupt patronage politics. In fact, Homeland Security officials suggested that it would not probe too deeply into how the drainage district spent the money as long as the work got done on time. “We expect the County will do whatever it takes to complete the concrete wall segments by December 01, 2008,” the agency wrote just before approving the deal with Garza and the drainage district. Now, a decade later, Homeland Security is refusing Hidalgo County’s request for the final $2.9 million reimbursement for the project, accusing the county of failing to perform due diligence. The county, in turn, is suing Garza in state district court in Hidalgo County for breach of contract and conspiracy to commit fraud as it tries to recover some of the money it asserts was misspent on payments to Garza and his family. Garza has counter-sued, alleging the county owes him more than $1 million in back pay. Garza has defended his actions by saying that everything he did was approved by county attorneys and by the Hidalgo County Commissioner’s Court, which convenes as the Hidalgo Drainage District No. 1 when making decisions about local drainage issues. He said his fee applied to any construction costs incurred by the drainage district — whether federal or local money was involved. His supporters portrayed the contract as a cost-savings arrangement. Garza would provide the drainage district with the expertise of a highly experienced manager. In return, the county would only have to pay him a 1.5 percent fee, instead of the 3 percent to 5 percent charged by professional engineers on contracts. “The contract was nothing but transparent and was approved by the entire board,” Garza wrote in a letter to current County Judge Ramon Garcia. Reached by phone, Garza referred further questions to his attorney, Ethan L. Shaw, who called the whistleblower an unreliable witness upset by bad job performance reviews from Garza. He also said the federal government made no objections to Garza’s compensation package. “I’m personally unaware of the federal government ever objecting, even to this day,” he said. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversaw the project for Homeland Security, said the agency carefully reviewed spending on the levee-fence project. He said the agency had no role in hiring the contractors who built it. The drainage district “was responsible for awarding and administering all contracts associated with design and construction for the levee wall project,” said the CBP spokesman, who requested anonymity. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff did not return repeated requests for comment on a detailed list of questions. Hidalgo County officials do not dispute approving Garza’s 1.5 percent fee as part of his compensation package. But they say the fee applied only to county money, not federal dollars. They also said they were not aware that contractors on the project had hired Garza’s sons’ company. Former Hidalgo County Judge J.D. Salinas, the county’s top elected official when Garza’s package was approved, said the board trusted Garza to do what was right. “Obviously, I didn’t micromanage,” said Salinas, now a corporate lobbyist for AT&amp;T. “I’m not sure the day-to-day operations of what he was doing. As far as I remember, he did a good job.” The Rainmaker A Detroit native, Garza went to high school in the Valley, served in the military and returned to southern Texas to take classes at the local University of Texas campus. He worked for local engineering firms before he was hired as the drainage district’s general manager in the late 1990s, according to a sworn deposition from Garza filed in the county’s lawsuit against him. It might not have been the most exciting place to work, but in Hidalgo County, it was one of the most important. Like all counties in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Hidalgo was prone to destructive floods. Texas’ southernmost tip is a flat, fertile delta wedged between the Rio Grande and the Gulf of Mexico, making it vulnerable to inundation from both hurricanes and the river. The drainage district was created to lessen the impact of such disasters. Garza oversaw a network of hundreds of miles of ditches designed to draw floodwater toward the Gulf. He had tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money at his disposal every year. While county commissioners — acting as the drainage district board — had ultimate authority, they rarely questioned recommendations from Garza, who called himself the “eyes and ears” of the commission and was considered the county’s foremost expert on drainage issues. “He’s been in the Valley for 30 years,” said Mark Lupher, an executive with TEDSI Infrastructure Group, which did work on the levee-fence project. “He’s about as clean a man as you can find.” On Oct. 3, 2000, Garza resigned from his position. The same day, the drainage district board voted to give an exclusive contract to a company called Integ Inc. to take over the duties of general manager. Integ’s president and sole owner was Garza. It was an unusual deal, but the district’s elected officials had an explanation. By increasing Garza’s pay and allowing him to pursue outside opportunities, the board said it prevented Garza from leaving and retained his expertise on drainage issues. To outsiders, it looked as though no change had taken place — Garza still ran the district. He still had a county office, a county email address and county staff that reported to him. But Garza’s bank account told a different story. When he resigned in 2000, Garza had been making an annual salary of $71,715. After he became a contractor, the amount the drainage district paid Integ each year quickly ballooned. By 2006, his total compensation was $134,573, including allowances for a car and cell phone. That summer, Garza told the drainage district commissioners that the district’s levees and drainage network needed $563 million worth of repairs. The levees had been constructed decades before, more than 100 miles of dirt mounded 15 feet high, paralleling the Rio Grande. They were all that stood between Hidalgo County’s 700,000 residents and the river, and they were in poor shape. Garza convinced the drainage board to put a $100 million bond measure on the fall ballot, with $10 million devoted to fix the levees. He started driving up and down the county, making presentations to different towns and cities to convince voters to approve the measure. In September 2006, his campaign got an unexpected boost. The Federal Emergency Management Agency — concerned about the nation’s levees in the wake of Hurricane Katrina — informed the county that it was going to declare that the aging levees would not withstand a sizeable flood on the Rio Grande. County officials estimated that if FEMA designated the county’s levee system unsafe, flood insurance costs for homeowners and businesses would soar by as much as $150 million per year. That November, the voters in one of poorest counties in the nation overwhelmingly approved a tax increase to finance the bond. As Garza mapped how to spend the bond money, he figured out how he could earn some of it for himself. In February 2007, just months after the bond’s passage, Garza negotiated a new contract with the county. It was similar to his previous contracts, but with one lucrative difference : On top of his six-figure salary, Garza’s company would also collect 1.5 percent of every dollar spent on construction costs for projects in the county’s master drainage plan — which included levee repairs. A year later, when Garza began to work with Homeland Security to fix the levees and build the fence, he reasoned that his company’s commission extended to that project, too. At the time of the vote, county officials heard testimony from another engineering firm that they were getting a deal because a typical engineering manager charged 4 percent to 5 percent of construction costs. With little debate, Salinas and the rest of the board approved the new contract. A month later, Salinas and Garza journeyed to Washington, D.C. They were accompanied by a representative from Dannenbaum, which had been selected by the board to do the levee repairs. The group met with Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and other elected officials and asked for federal money to help fix the levees. Cuellar assured them he would help. “This visit to Washington, D.C. will pay big dividends for Hidalgo County taxpayers in the near future,” Cuellar declared, according to a press release from his office. Cuellar did not respond to requests for comment. A Hunt For Money The drainage district’s hunt for cash happened to coincide with the federal government’s hunt for land. A month after the Hidalgo delegation’s trip to the capital, Chertoff approved final plans for the footprint of the border fence. It would rise along 700 miles of the nation’s 2,000-mile long border with Mexico. Nearly 60 miles would be built in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. There, Homeland Security officials knew they faced a special challenge. Residents of the mostly poor, mostly Hispanic and mostly Democratic Rio Grande Valley were opposed to the border fence, and most of the land the government needed was in private hands. That meant the agency was going to have to seize property by using eminent domain — a process that would take time and cost money since the government had to pay compensation for any land taken. The Homeland Security task force charged with building the fence, called the Secure Border Initiative, was determined to avoid delays. “This project [must] be completed by December 01, 2008,” read task force notes from early 2008. “There will be no time extensions.” The deadline, inserted by Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, was designed to ensure the fence was complete before George W. Bush left office in 2009, according to one of her former senior staffers. Hutchison, now the U.S. ambassador to NATO, declined comment. Salinas saw the benefits of helping the federal government build its fence — if it was combined with the county’s planned levee repairs. “If they used the money to fix our levees, we get one, jobs, two, we fix our levees and they’re not going to break, three, we get mandatory flood insurance lifted from some of the most humble people in the United States,” Salinas said in an interview. “You minimize the amount of land the federal government is going to grab, right?” Customs and Border Protection officials didn’t initially embrace the idea. Chief Ron Vitiello, then head of the Rio Grande Valley sector, now CBP’s acting deputy commissioner, wrote a memo to headquarters after meeting with Garza, Salinas and Texas Sen. John Cornyn warning that the levee-fence idea would be “ hugely more expensive.” In November, the agency made its position official. The combination border fence and levee fix “was not considered a viable alternative, and will not be carried forward,” the agency declared. But the politicians were not ready to give up. Ready to Move Forward In the following months, Texas’ political establishment lobbied Homeland Security to approve the levee fence. Hidalgo County and local cities passed resolutions in favor of the project. Texas Gov. Rick Perry wrote directly to Chertoff to praise it. Cornyn called it a “win for Valley residents.” After meetings in December 2007 and January of the following year, officials with the Secure Border Initiative warmed to the deal, even as Customs and Border Protection officials continued to express concerns. On a typically balmy day in the Rio Grande Valley in February 2008, Chertoff flew down to Edinburg to make it official. With Cornyn and Perry by his side, Chertoff announced what he called a “win-win” for federal and local government. Homeland Security would pay Hidalgo County to build the levee-fence, which would stretch for 22 miles — roughly a third of the total border fence miles scheduled for the Rio Grande Valley. Hidalgo would kick in some money and make sure the project was completed on time. Under the initial terms of the deal, Hidalgo would pay $48.2 million from local bond money, while the federal government added $67.7 million. “I don’t want anyone to mistake the fact that we are determined to get this job done,” Chertoff said during a news conference. One problem remained: Nobody knew exactly how to get the money to Hidalgo County. Congress had appropriated funds for a border fence, not a levee. Homeland Security had no contractors ready to go. Finally, required environmental reviews could take years and drive up the project’s cost. “This was a pretty big deal and a lot of money,” said Greg Giddens, head of the task force and a longtime federal employee. “We were concerned. How was the county going to do this with proper management and oversight?” The answer came from Tiffany Hixson, a top procurement specialist at Homeland Security. The agency could issue a grant to Hidalgo County, she suggested. The money would flow directly to the county, and Homeland Security would rely on county officials to issue contracts to build the project. A senior Homeland Security official called Garza and told him to file a grant application. It would be approved. “Call Hidalgo and tell them we can do this,” the senior official told colleagues at a meeting at the end of March, according to a partly redacted email. The official gave verbal approval to spend tens of millions of dollars, an almost unheard of act in the paper-loving federal bureaucracy. In April 2008, Chertoff used special powers granted to him by Congress to overcome final hurdles to the deal. He declared that in Hidalgo County, the federal government could mingle federal funds appropriated to build the border fence with the county’s money to repair the levees. He also waived all environmental regulations. The following month, Hixson issued the grant. To ensure “substantial federal involvement,” the grant required DHS to approve “sub-awards/subcontracts and changes to contract and sub-contracts prior to execution.” All of the money would pass through the hands of a man who stood to directly benefit from the spending: Garza. As the checks flew from the U.S. Treasury into a special account at the First National Bank of Edinburg, the federal government’s costs quickly soared. The project was more complex than anticipated. The drainage district, run by Garza, requested and received additional funds. Homeland Security added additional miles of levee-fence to the project. The overall bill for the project ballooned over the next several years to $232 million. The drainage district paid out $58 million. The federal share came to $174.4 million — more than double the original agreement. Garza’s company’s commission: $3.5 million from 2008 to 2012, documents show. Most of the rest of the money flowed to Dannenbaum Engineering and other construction companies on the project. The Company Dannenbaum, which builds highways, airports, bridges and housing developments throughout Texas, had earned a reputation for generosity to the Republican Party. Since 2006, records show, CEO Jim Dannenbaum and his wife have contributed $2.8 million to candidates in local, state and national elections, 88 percent of it to members of the GOP. Records show the drainage district selected Dannenbaum as project leader. Dannenbaum, in turn, subcontracted with a company called Valley Data Collection Specialists — a manpower agency that provided engineering, construction and mapping experts, among other services. Other contractors on the levee-fence project did the same. At the time, Valley Data was owned by Garza’s two sons, Godfrey Garza III and Jonathan Garza, public records show. Later, company ownership passed to Garza’s wife, Annie Garza. Beyond kinship, Garza’s Integ Inc. and Valley Data were intertwined in other ways: The two companies shared office space at one time. And Integ once provided Valley Data with an interest-free loan of around $100,000, according to court depositions filed by Garza and his wife. Lupher, of TEDSI Infrastructure Group, said many construction firms in the Rio Grande Valley employed Valley Data at one time or another. He said he knew the company was owned by Garza’s sons but never felt any pressure to hire the firm. “I needed a crew. So I used them,” Lupher said in a brief interview. Garza said “a lot of the elected officials” also knew about his familial ties to Valley Data. “It was not something that was being hid by anybody,” Garza said in his deposition. County commissioners “would attend political functions, barbecues, because they were working with some of the engineers, so the elected officials were aware.” A lawyer representing Annie, Jonathan and Godfrey Garza III did not respond to a request for comment. It remains unclear how much Dannenbaum and the other subcontractors paid Valley Data. County lawyers overseeing the lawsuit against Garza say it could be as much as $15 million. In April, FBI agents raided Dannenbaum offices across the state, including in McAllen. Neither the FBI nor the company would comment on the raids. Bill Miller, a spokesman for Dannenbaum and one of the state’s most powerful lobbyists, noted the company was not a defendant in the county’s lawsuit regarding the levee-fence. He turned down a request for an interview with Jim Dannenbaum. “All work for the levee improvement project was approved by the county,” Miller said. Dannenbaum completed the project in spring 2009. It transformed Hidalgo County’s natural environment. During a major flood seven years ago, the levee-fence did its job, keeping the overflowing Rio Grande from inundating low-lying neighborhoods in Hidalgo County. But the towering structure drew criticism from environmentalists who worried that the new vertical concrete wall would impede the movement of endangered and threatened species. After the floodwaters receded in 2010, U.S. Fish and Wildlife scientists reported that “ hundreds ” of Texas tortoise shells had been found along the new levee fence — the reptiles apparently drowned while attempting to reach dry land. The agency worried about the fate of the highly endangered small wildcats that call the region home, ocelots and jaguarundis. “The Service fears any ocelots or jaguarundi that may have been caught in these areas when water began to rise may have been malnourished, injured or perished,” the report said. Concerns about the operations and financing of the levee-fence project remained hidden — at least, until Lora Briones decided to start talking. The Whistleblower A no-nonsense county employee, Briones had been hired as the chief financial officer of the drainage district in November 2003. One of her jobs was to calculate the 1.5 percent fee due to Garza, who provided her the invoices she needed to figure out the total, according to a sworn deposition Briones provided as part of the county’s lawsuit against Garza. She regularly sent checks to his firm, knowing that the compensation arrangement had been laid out in his contract and approved by the drainage district. Then, in early 2009, with federal money flowing into the district for the levee-fence project, Garza gave her a mass of invoices. Briones found herself writing an enormous check to Integ Inc.: $1.67 million. It struck her as strange and excessive, according to her deposition. She said she thought Garza’s contract called for the commission to be paid on county — not federal — dollars. Her concerns about Garza were further aroused by a private conversation she had with an administrative employee at Dannenbaum, who told Briones that the firm had hired Valley Data as a subcontractor on the project, according to Briones’ deposition. Briones was afraid to confront Garza directly — he was, after all, her boss. She said she decided instead to pay a visit to the FBI’s local office in McAllen, where she brought check registers, according to her deposition. She said she made several additional visits but never received any indication that the agency would investigate. An FBI spokeswoman declined to respond when asked if the agency had any record of the visits. A year later, Briones said she went to the county auditor. He told her he didn’t have the authority to audit the drainage district, according to a statement he provided the county. Garza had earlier convinced the drainage board to hire an outside auditor. At last, Briones said she decided to air her concerns directly to Homeland Security. She spoke to Scott Recinos, a Homeland Security contractor who visited Hidalgo County to monitor progress on the levee-fence project. In her deposition, she says Recinos told her he already knew about Garza’s commission arrangement, as did Hixson, the grant manager. According to a sworn affidavit that Briones signed in 2014, Recinos said that Hixson “was livid and that she could not believe he (Godfrey Garza) was getting money. Further, she said that this is something that could come out in 60 Minutes,” the popular investigative television show. In her deposition, Briones had trouble specifying the date of the conversation with Recinos. She told county attorneys that it took place between late 2012 and early 2014. Briones declined to comment. Neither Recinos nor Hixson responded to requests for comment. In 2014, Garza began berating Briones over her job performance — a step that Briones took as retaliation for her whistleblowing, according to her deposition. She feared for her job. Luckily for her, an election had brought in a new county judge whose position included an automatic seat on the drainage district board — and who had his own suspicions about Garza’s deal. His name was Ramon Garcia. The Unraveling Garcia had served as county judge from 2003 to 2006. During that time, he had strongly supported the $100 million bond to fix the county’s drainage issues. He returned to office in 2010 with an overriding question: Where had the money gone? His inquiries eventually led him to Briones, who told him the same concerns she had related to the FBI, the county auditor and Homeland Security. Garcia had voted to approve Garza’s contract and knew about the 1.5 percent commission. But after speaking to Briones, he began to investigate why Garza had received a commission on a project largely bankrolled by the federal government. And why Garza hadn’t disclosed that Valley Data was a subcontractor on the project. With backing from the drainage board, Garcia acted quickly. He hired a private attorney to analyze Garza’s contract. He changed Briones’ job so that she reported directly to the board, rather than to Garza. And he began to ask Garza tough questions at drainage district meetings. At a December 2014 meeting, Garcia grilled Garza after discovering that the drainage district had destroyed more than 140 boxes of records since October 2013. Among the documents were accounting records, personnel files and information about the bond measure. Garza told Garcia there was “no malintention” and that the destruction of the records was mere housecleaning. When Garcia continued to press, Garza introduced his secretary, Sylvia Sanchez, and stepped back from the podium. “Sylvia, my question is: Who made the decision to shred these documents?” Garcia asked. “I did,” Sanchez said, explaining that the records were old and, besides, the county was running out of space to store them. In her deposition, Briones testified that Sanchez took the fall for Garza’s decision to shred the records. As a reward, she said, Garza gave Sanchez tickets to a Pitbull concert. Sanchez did not respond to a request for comment. In a brief phone interview, Garza said Briones’ account was untrue. Shaw, his attorney, questioned Briones’ credibility. He noted that she had difficulty recalling the dates of her whistleblowing complaints and described the concert ticket allegation as false and “pretty bizarre.” Briones retaliated against Garza after he gave her negative performance evaluations, he said. And he noted that the drainage district’s attorney, Steven Crain, had ruled that Garza could apply his commission to federal money spent on the levee-fence. He emphasized that Hidalgo County commissioners had repeatedly approved Garza’s contract and said the board was aware that Valley Data Services was hired for the project. “County commissioners are basically saying, ‘Godfrey Garza tricked us into paying him,’” Shaw said. “It’s hard for me to understand how he was able to hypnotize four or five county commissioners to get them to do what he wanted to do.” Local watchdog groups were angry at both Garza — and the county commissioners who approved his compensation deal. “When it hit us — what had happened and how much ridiculous money he was getting — we realized that every single one of the commissioners and [County Judge J.D. Salinas] signed off on it,” said Virginia Townsend, co-founder of Objective Watchers of the Legal System — or OWLS. “You were the people in charge, and you sat there and went along with it.” By late 2014, newspaper editorial boards and watchdog groups were calling for Garza’s ouster. He resigned in February 2015. A few months later, Garza started another business — GG Consulting — whose clients include some of the engineering firms that hired Valley Data, according to his court deposition. The Taking The federal government’s boldest land grab in a generation produced the first border wall — and a trail of abuse, mistakes and unfairness. Read the story.

United States of America v. 15.919 Acres of Land (More or Less) The Taking, illustrated: A texas family’s story of losing land for the border fence Read the story. In May 2015, Michael Lee, the private attorney hired to examine Garza’s contract, delivered his report. It confirmed Garcia’s suspicions: While the county had indeed approved Garza’s contract, the 1.5 percent fee was supposed to apply only to local bond money, not Homeland Security funds. A later report showed that Garza also had failed to disclose to the drainage board that contractors had hired his family’s company for the levee-fence project. To Garcia, it looked as though both the county and the federal government had been hoodwinked by an entrenched bureaucrat. In January 2017, the drainage board filed the lawsuit against Garza to recover the misdirected money. Meanwhile, Garcia was trying to convince Homeland Security to release a $2.9 million payment to the drainage district it had withheld over a technical issue dealing with the start date of construction work on the levee fence. Homeland Security officials asked to see the county’s documentation on Garza’s contract. After reading Lee’s report, the officials told Garza they were reluctant to give the county any more money. In a November 2016 conference call, a Homeland Security contracting official told Garcia that Garza’s 1.5 percent commission was probably prohibited by federal law, according to two people familiar with the call — apparently referring to regulations that generally forbid the federal government from paying a fixed percentage of contract costs. It didn’t matter that Homeland Security had signed the deal with Garza years before. Or that the agency was required to approve all contractors and subcontractors on the levee-fence project. Another Homeland Security official on the call told Garcia the federal government was not inclined to pay out any more money to the county, given the “conflict of interest” with Garza and his family’s firm, the people familiar with the call said. The officials also expressed frustration about the increase in project costs under Garza’s watch. Today, Hidalgo’s drainage system still needs tens of millions of dollars in repairs. The county’s lawsuit against Garza is scheduled to go to trial in late February. Looking back, Garcia said he wished that the county — and the federal government — had done more to investigate Garza and his actions. “We relied on him,” Garcia said. “We expected him to act in the best interests of the district. Obviously, he didn’t do that.” Kiah Collier reports on energy and the environment for The Texas Tribune.

Sujatha Byravan,"The Kerala floods have been attributed to mismanagement of reservoirs, construction at sites that are off-limits, changes in land use patterns, destruction of forests and very heavy rain over weeks. Recently, other parts of the world too experienced extreme events. Sweden and Norway had a large number of wildfires that broke out with heat waves this summer. California has been ravaged by fire. With the climate getting warmer, communities need to be prepared for an increase in the severity and frequency of prolonged heat waves causing dry conditions and fire, cyclones, very heavy downpours in short periods of time leading to flooding, and the failure of seasonal rains leading to droughts. But climate change does not appear with a legible calling card. Each of these events interacts with local conditions and activities to manifest a separate pattern of destruction. So, there may be landslides in hilly areas with little vegetation, severe flooding in homes built on lakebeds, flooded streets when storm water drains are not clear, breaking of levees, destruction of property and loss of life. The meteorological events may trigger the natural disaster, but they do not necessarily cause it. Lessons to learn The squeaky wheel gets the grease, or so the expression goes. Residents and decision makers look for immediate measures to contain or prevent similar events in future. Unfortunately, these efforts quite often turn out to be short-term actions that could worsen challenges in the long term. Studies by Sarah Anderson and colleagues show that such extreme events, which are high impact but have a low probability of occurrence, lead to managerial responses that may be ineffective, can be maladaptive, and may in fact result in worsening the problems. There are some lessons to be learnt from looking back at how extreme events were dealt with in the past and what the consequences were. The 2010 Pakistan floods were caused by unprecedented rainfall along with sudden changes in the flow location of the Indus, which occurred due to the breach of the Tori Bund, a levee built upstream to contain the river water. Similarly, the Kosi in Bihar temporarily changed its flow path in 2008 as a result of mismanaged response to earlier floods. The river brings a large amount of silt, which, along with the large volumes of water, led to a breach of the embankments and caused severe flooding in northern Bihar and parts of Nepal. These levees were built in response to earlier floods. In such situations, when a river is prone to avulsion, there should be plans to accommodate large periodic flows of water and sediment. Responding for the long term often involves difficult choices by local people and decision makers, such as moving people out of flood plains or building homes that are designed to withstand flooding. Strengthening the engineering structures is not always the right solution. Short-term solutions demonstrate that some action is being taken, and they also match the political cycle of four to five years, but they do not generally take local ecology and the landscape into consideration and do not address long-term changes taking place as a result of climate change. In another example, various new kinds of vector-borne diseases are rearing their heads and some of the older ones are reappearing due to changes linked with higher temperatures. But increased spraying with insecticides, a short-term measure, results in boosting resistance of the pest to the chemical spray. Scientists give the example of Boa Vista, in Brazil, where aggressive efforts launched after one patient was found to be infected with the dengue virus led to rapid and widespread increase in insecticide resistance in the region. Similarly, the approach taken by the U.S. Forest Service to suppress forest fire as a result of prominent fires in the early part of last century had the inadvertent effect of making tree growth denser and more flammable. This most likely made subsequent fires more dangerous when they occurred in warmer temperatures. The way forward For Kerala, the long-term decisions would include improving land use, so that much of the rain water can be absorbed, paying heed to recommendations for limiting development projects in the Western Ghats, especially in vulnerable areas, developing systems for integrated management of water including in reservoirs, designing emergency evacuation measures, and improving institutional mechanisms so that there can be an immediate and integrated response when there is unprecedented rain. When the risk of extreme events increases, people and governments are more likely to pay attention and respond to that risk through action. But making sure that the action is suitable for the short and also the long term is crucial.

Ralph Northam on Monday ordered the evacuation of about 245,000 residents in flood-prone areas as Hurricane Florence strengthened on its path toward the East Coast. Residents were to be evacuated by 8 a.m. Tuesday in the Hampton Roads area — including portions of Virginia Beach, Hampton and Norfolk — as well as part of the Eastern Shore. Northam (D) said he had requested 21 swift-water rescue teams from other states and activated 1,500 of the state’s 6,000 National Guard members, with the rest on standby. “I’m making this announcement now to give residents, families, schools and businesses time to prepare,” Northam said. The Category 4 storm rapidly intensified Monday, with winds gusting to 140 mph. The National Hurricane Center said Florence is expected to strengthen to 150 mph before making landfall somewhere on the southeast or Mid-Atlantic coast Thursday night. Forecasters said the hurricane could slow or stall out over the Mid-Atlantic later this week, which could lead to significant rain and bring wind that could down trees. [ What will Hurricane Florence mean for the Washington area? ] Refusing to comply with the evacuation order would be a misdemeanor, but officials said they do not have the resources to go door-to-door. As for where evacuees should go, Northam said, “The simplest answer is, go to higher ground and inland.” Officials said local governments would have information on shelters throughout the state. Residents in coastal areas can check to see which zone they live in by going to wapo.st/knowyourzoneva. “If it stalls, we’re expecting significant rainfall,” Northam said. “The largest threat to life from hurricanes is not the high winds. Flooding is the deadliest result of these storms.” The Navy on Monday ordered warships in Norfolk to sea to avoid the storm. Across the region, officials began implementing plans to prepare for what forecasters say could be only the 11th major hurricane to hit the southeast coast since 1851. In the District, a flood levee built to protect parts of downtown could be deployed for the first time as the region braces for the possibility of heavy rain from Florence. National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said the agency is monitoring forecasts and stream gauges to determine whether conditions warrant deploying the levee across 17th Street NW, just south of Constitution Avenue. It would be the first time officials have used the levee. Rain from Florence would arrive at a time when the ground already is saturated in the region. Flood warnings were issued Monday for much of the Potomac River upstream from the District, and segments of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal were closed because of high water after weekend storms. Hains Point in East Potomac Park was inaccessible because of flooding. The Park Service posted a photo Monday on social media showing egrets, herons and mallards standing on posts as walkways along the Tidal Basin and Jefferson Memorial were underwater. On the Mall, officials have conducted four practice runs to put the city’s newest levee in place. The levee, in part, is made of two concrete and stone walls on either side of 17th Street. In the event of a flood, a barrier of metal posts and panels would be installed with a crane to span the street and connect with the two walls. “We’ve double-checked everything... and it’s all ready to go,” Litterst said. The post and panels are stored at a Park Service maintenance facility in the District’s Brentwood neighborhood and would be brought to the site. The levee system, finished in 2014, is designed to keep floodwaters from flowing north on 17th Street from the Tidal Basin. [ Mall flood levee project nears initial testing phase after three year delay ] The levee was built after the Federal Emergency Management Agency determined a flood could inundate a crescent of downtown Washington from 17th Street and Constitution Avenue east to the Capitol and south toward Fort McNair. The National Weather Service, Park Service and Army Corps of Engineers are continuing to consult on whether it will be deployed. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed an executive order Monday issuing a state of emergency for what he called potential “historic, catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding. He said during a news conference that officials should know more in the next two days about Florence and its possible effects. “There is still some uncertainty of the path of Hurricane Florence,” Hogan said, “but our state is taking every precaution and I urge all Marylanders to do the same.” Russell J. Strickland, executive director of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, said the executive order puts the National Guard and state agencies on alert. He said the state is particularly concerned about low-lying areas, including Ellicott City and Frederick, which experienced flooding earlier this year. D.C. officials Monday were discussing preparations for the storm, according to a spokeswoman for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). According to The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang, forecast models suggest more than a foot of rain could fall over higher elevations of the Carolinas and Virginia, which would generate dangerous flooding downstream. The heaviest rainfall could begin Friday or Saturday and continue into the following week. Parts of the region experienced flooding Monday after heavy weekend rain. Several roads in the Frederick area were closed. The Monocacy River bridge along Route 355 near Frederick had water approach record levels, leaving residents worried about the impact of more rain from Florence. The storm also altered Amtrak schedules south of Washington beginning Wednesday. [ ‘It was relentless’: Surge of rainwater floods streets, submerges cars in Maryland ] Officials with Maryland Natural Resources Police warned that rivers and streams are swollen and advised the public to stay away from rushing water. At Assateague State Park on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, beach access was closed because of dangerous surf and waves more than 12 feet higher than normal. In Alexandria’s low-lying Old Town neighborhood, sandbags were being distributed to businesses and residents. Raytevia Evans, a spokeswoman for the Alexandria Fire Department, said officials spoke with members of several city agencies to make preparations before Florence’s rain arrives. She said officials would keep swift-water rescue teams on call and develop plans to use schools and recreation facilities as shelters if flooding occurs. Crews were watching Weather Service predictions, Evans said, adding that the city does “absolutely expect we’ll get a whole lot of rain.” “We’re making sure people have a plan now,” she said. “We’re letting people know to communicate with their families, their employees, and prepare their businesses and homes for possible impact.” Ovetta Wiggins, Fenit Nirappil and Michael Brice-Saddler contributed to this report.","Washington Post Virginia governor orders mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas ahead of Hurricane Florence Washington Post Virginia Gov.

"by Lisa Song and Al Shaw, ProPublica, Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, and Alex Heeb, The Telegraph of Alton, Illinois","For years, the residents of Pike County, Missouri have blamed their worsening floods on their neighbors across the Mississippi River in Illinois. Ever since the Sny Island Levee Drainage District raised its levees above authorized heights, Pike residents claimed, the agricultural lands behind the Sny were spared while farms in Missouri, protected by lower levees, were inundated. The kind of science needed to prove allegations like this is expensive and time consuming. But thanks to a new government model, the Missouri residents finally have some science to back up their suspicions. Read More The Army Corps of Engineers designed a $500,000 computer model that lets scientists simulate how floods affect the Upper Mississippi River, demonstrating, in part, the difference that larger levees make. The tests show that if the region faces a disaster as grave as the Great Flood of 1993, communities with higher levees — found in a handful of levee districts on both the Illinois and Missouri sides of the river — would be far better protected, and those without them would fare far worse. On the Illinois side, the land behind the Sny’s higher levees would be much drier, with some areas saved from more than 16 feet of flooding. The Missouri side would weather floodwaters up to 1.7 feet higher than it experienced in 1993. It’s for this very reason that the Corps regulates levee heights. Levees are designed to prevent rivers from overflowing, but they create a zero-sum game where raising levees in one area can push extra flood risk onto others. “They’re throwing water on us,” said Pike County emergency management director Al Murry. “I’m not saying they don’t have a right to protect themselves but they need to do it ethically.” It’s hard to track overbuilt levees, because their growth happens gradually. During floods, districts are allowed to fight back by piling sandbags on top of levees as an emergency measure. They’re required to remove the sandbags afterward, but not all of them do. The Corps, which oversees thousands of miles of levees nationwide, leaves most of the day-to-day operations and maintenance to local levee districts. Last spring, the Rock Island, Illinois, office of the Corps announced it had surveyed 205 miles of levees in parts of Illinois, Missouri and Iowa and found 80 miles of barriers were 2 to 4 feet higher than authorized. The overbuilt levees spanned seven levee districts, including the Sny. To understand the impacts of the overbuilt levees and help local officials plan for future floods, the Corps designed the most comprehensive model to date of the Upper Mississippi River. The model includes data on the levees’ authorized heights as well as the current actual heights. Al Murry, emergency management director for Pike County, Missouri, in Louisiana, Missouri (Whitney Curtis for ProPublica) A handful of groups, including the Sny, have requested the model since it was released in January. The software can only be operated by experienced engineers, who can simulate floods of different sizes to see how communities up and down the river would be affected. The first publicly available results come from American Rivers, an environmental group. It hired Jonathan Remo, a scientist who studies flooding, to run the model. Remo is a professor at Southern Illinois University, but he conducted his work for American Rivers as an independent consultant. Remo said he simply plugged in the two levee scenarios of current versus authorized heights, taking care not to change any of the Corps’ pre-set parameters to avoid introducing any bias into the results. The parameters are calculations that determine things like how far the water will go in a certain area. Remo found some of the worst impacts in Pike County and the city of Hannibal, Missouri, Mark Twain’s boyhood home. Other hotspots include the Union Township area north of the overbuilt levees in the Fabius River Drainage District. Murry thinks Remo’s report underestimates the flooding he’s seen. Murry’s department couldn’t afford to hire an engineering consultant, and he said he’s not surprised the Corps’ model is only accessible to highly trained technicians. See the Map “I expected it to come out in pig Latin. That way it’s always open to interpretation,” he said. “Engineers and lawyers never say anything in plain English.” We sent a copy of Remo’s report to the Rock Island Corps, the Fabius and the Sny. Corps spokesman Allen Marshall said they don’t have the funding for an in-depth analysis, and that the agency hasn’t run the model to compare current and authorized levee heights, but Remo’s use of the data “is certainly one of the intended purposes of releasing the model.” The president of the Fabius district, Roger Sutter, said he wasn’t convinced about its accuracy. Russell Koeller, a commissioner of the Sny district, said that while the model has value, it was “merely an educated guess,” less useful than considering the river’s flood history. “We believe in what actually occurred instead of hypothetical analyses and theories,” he said. Rock Island has spent 10 years trying to force the Sny to push its levees down to authorized heights, to no avail. Instead of complying, the Sny is now part of a regional lobbying effort working to convince Congress to weaken the Corps’ authority over levees. Some officials aren’t waiting for the Corps to act. John Lyng, a former mayor of Hannibal, said his city needs to boost its own protection to remain competitive with surrounding levee systems. The 1993 flood hit the city just after the Army Corps had finished building a flood wall — a vertical barrier similar to a levee. Lyng said the wall was designed to clear the most extreme floods by at least 5 feet. But the floodwaters that year came within 27 inches of spilling into downtown. The Corps rushed to add an extra 3 feet of protection. The former mayor joked that the wall “set the record for the shortest time between the completion of an Army Corps project and its obsolescence.” A man paddles his canoe down a flooded street in downtown Davenport, Iowa, in June 1993. (John Gaps/AP Photo) In 2008 and 2013, the Mississippi once again came close to flowing over Hannibal’s flood wall. Each time, the community rushed to add sandbags. Lyng wondered how the Corps could have gotten its estimates so wrong. But then he heard some of his neighbors had built up levees beyond their approved height — protecting their farmland while putting Hannibal’s historic landmarks at greater risk. So Lyng has taken on a new campaign to protect his town from the next big flood: He wants Hannibal to build its flood wall even taller.","by Lisa Song and Al Shaw, ProPublica, Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, and Alex Heeb, The Telegraph of Alton, Illinois For years, the residents of Pike County, Missouri have blamed their worsening floods on their neighbors …",2018-03-30T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Propublica.org'}",New Model Shows Towns on the Wrong Side of an Illinois Levee District Are Treading Water,https://www.propublica.org/article/new-model-shows-towns-on-the-wrong-side-of-an-illinois-levee-district-are-treading-water,https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20180330-levees-1200x630.jpg?1522400440,,Propublica.org,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Katharine Schwab,"The Mississippi River meanders through the continental United States for 2,320 miles before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. This vastness is hard to envision–until you see a new model at the Louisiana State University Center for River Studies, complete with sand and flowing water. The super-realistic model is part of an effort to understand how the area will be impacted by climate change and other environmental phenomena in the future–and in particular, how the river’s many man-made levees impact southern Louisiana’s ability to replenish its wetlands and stave off sea level rise. These levees are basically walls that prevent the river’s natural flooding process. The problem is that without the sediment those normal seasonal floods bring to the area, the local wetlands are receding. The state has lost 1,900 square miles of land since the levees were built in the 1930s at the rate of about a football field every hour. This decades-long problem will be exacerbated with climate change-related sea level rise. If nothing is done, studies have shown that Louisiana’s coast could lose 4,120 square miles over the next 50 years, resulting in billions of dollars of damages. This is already impacting people’s lives: Louisiana is home to some of the country’s first climate change refugees. That’s where the Center for River Studies ‘ giant model of the lower 179 miles of the Mississippi comes in. Clocking in at 10,800 square-feet, or about two basketball courts, the model is a way to test and study the impact of a relatively new type of infrastructure intervention called “ sediment diversions.” These are structures built along the banks of the river that create channels through the man-made levees. They’re designed to bring sediment from the river out to the areas beyond its banks by mimicking the flooding process. In essence, diversions allow the area to reap the benefits of flooding–in a very controlled manner. If diversions are successful, they can replenish the state’s battered wetlands, counteracting the effects of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion–problems that will likely worsen because of climate change. The model also does something else: It gives people a visceral way to understand how the river works and why studying it is so important. [Photo: courtesy LSU] This isn’t LSU’s first model of the Mississippi. In the early aughts, the university and the Coastal Protection Restoration Authority (CPRA), which run the River Studies Center together, built a much smaller, 900-square-foot model to study how the river would respond to sea level rise. But this new model, which opened this month, gives the scientists far more quantitative tools to examine how the river will react to certain circumstances. The previous model covered about 60 miles of the river, but the new one covers 179 miles–necessary for the scientists to evaluate projects the CPRA is thinking about doing that are further upriver. The new model itself is far more detailed, and uses lightweight plastic fake sand that better mimics the way real sediment moves down the river. Scientists can change the locations of miniature sediment diversions, as well as the flow rate of the river and other parameters, and then test to see what happens. Because the fake sand moves much faster than real sand, they can simulate one year’s worth of time in one hour. Projectors above the model make it look more realistic and indicate the landscape, coastal features, and diversion locations. “We can look at future projects and how that would impact the river, the movement, flow rates, stages, and ultimately how that might impact river sediment diversions,” says Clint Willson, the center’s director and a professor of civil and environmental engineering. [Photo: courtesy LSU] He plans to do experiments by creating a particular scenario–like what might happen if the CPRA doesn’t build any sediment diversions–and running the physical model for 50 “years” to see what the impact looks like. Then, the scientists can add in a diversion in a particular location, or another, and see how that changes the river and the wetlands 50 years later. “It’s kind of going back to the scientific method,” he says. Why not just use a computer to do all this modeling? Willson says that using the physical model is actually faster than a computer because of the complexity of the simulations involved. To make the computer models run faster, he says that scientists often use approximations, but comparing the computer’s results to the physical model’s results might help them build better models overall. In essence, it’s another tool to study the river, one that can augment digital methods as well as the work of hydrologists out in the field, working with real-time measurements. The work is so vital because of the increasing threat of climate change, which is exacerbated in this particular region because the wetlands are sinking as the sea levels are rising. “If you think about those wetlands, a lot of them are not getting replenished,” Willson says. “When you have stresses like storms or future stresses like sea level rise, they don’t have material to help them bounce back or be more resilient.” [Photo: courtesy LSU] But there’s a delicate balance to be struck–because the Mississippi is a huge driver of the region’s economy. The levees are necessary to navigate the river and protect Louisiana’s coastal industries. “Y ou can’t just break open holes in the levee and let the river water go. The entire Midwest of the United States and the agricultural economy is depending on being able to use barges that go up and down the Mississippi River,” Willson says. “ It’s an extremely challenging problem from a political, social, economic, engineering, and ecological perspective.” That’s the final piece of what the Mississippi River model could do: Act as a physical argument for the importance of the CPRA’s work while doubling as a scientific and educational tool. After all, seeing a giant model of the river is far more interesting than reading scientific papers. “As engineers and scientists we love our PowerPoints. You think, I’ll jazz it up, we’ll show animations of our numerical models. But it’s an animation of a computer model,” Willson says. “But to have someone come out and see the river and be convinced that we’re replicating the relevant processes in our physical models, and look at the way it responds, look when the sediment moves? That’s all extremely valuable.”","With fake sand, real water, and super-realistic details, the model is a powerful tool in the fight against sea level rise.

"Opinion contributors, Jacob Frey, Frank Klipsch and Sharon Weston Broome, Opinion contributors","Americans are now seeing the nightmare unfold that mayors throughout the Midwest have warned about for years.
Breached levees, flooded farms, washed out roads and drowned homes are disrupting lives, devastating communities, and straining state and city budgets. But the floods that made headlines and caught the attention of 2020 presidential campaigners are not the first and wont be the last. 
In the past 26 years, the Midwest has seen multiple 100-, 200- and 500-year  flood events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that the flooding will get worse, bringing an unprecedented flood season to the heart of America. In fact, more flooding is expected in the coming days as a result of this week's  giant spring snowstorm.
Midwesterners are used to intense storms, but this extreme weather overwhelmed us. Torrential rains throughout the region washed the deep layer of snow into the rivers, causing record-breaking river rise and catastrophic flooding starting upstream and rushing downstream on the regions major waterways. Our river infrastructure is no match for what scientists predict is the new normal.

How I spent my summer vacation: Fleeing wildfires as a climate change refugee
The damage is staggering. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds says the flooding has cost her state an estimated $1.6 billion and submerged at least 1,200 homes. Roughly 70 miles of levees operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are damaged or destroyed, and the cost to repair them is estimated at $350 million. An additional 175 miles of levees that are not federally owned and operated also need repairs costing roughly an additional $175 million.
Minnesota is facing a  massive snowmelt, and Louisiana has been dealing with high water levels and the threat of floods since last November.
What does that mean? We are entering an unprecedented flooding season with an outdated and broken river infrastructure. Absent the necessary systemic solutions and support, we are left to pile sandbags around our homes, along our roads and around military bases, and hope for the best. Sandbags should not be our only option. Not in America. Not when we already know what we need to do to prepare and protect our communities.
Climate disasters require national response 
As leaders of the  Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, we work alongside  85 other mayors from  10 states bordering the Mississippi River to grapple with the environmental challenges facing the region. We understand the need for systemic solutions to climate challenges. When it comes to the environment and the critical national asset that is the Mississippi River, we are all in it together. 
For the past seven years, the mayors have presented to Congress and federal agencies a unified  infrastructure and investment plan to address the regions growing vulnerability to disasters. Each year, our plan has become more advanced, highlighting new and innovative partners across the globe. But the sheer scale of the challenges we face can only be met through bold congressional action like a comprehensive infrastructure bill. An infrastructure package that includes transformative proposals like a resilience revolving loan fund and projects such as natural infrastructure restoration, sustainability, resilience and climate risk mitigation is critical.
Our work with the Mississippi River Caucus in the U.S. House and Senate has yielded progress. But it will take the will of a nation to meet the problems at the scale we face today the wildfires of the West and floods of the central United States are prime examples that this is a national challenge.
The current administration proposed a budget that would set us back. It contains deep cuts to the Army Corps of Engineers, whose public servants maintain much of the levee system that we still rely on. The budget also threatens to deplete funding for critical domestic programs that cities along the Mississippi need. 
Rebuild old infrastructure for new reality
It would be easy to forget about the damage here once the headlines move on to the next crisis. But ignore the Midwest at your own peril. The Mississippi River and its tributaries span  31 states, covering 41% of the nation and supporting one of the most  agriculturally productive regions on the planet.
The river is the linchpin of the nations domestic freight and water infrastructure,  transporting 40% of the nations agricultural output, creating nearly $500 billion in annual revenue and directly supporting more than 1.5 million jobs. If we dont invest in maintaining our nations busiest waterway, the losses will ripple throughout the country.
Mayors dont have the luxury of distance and denial. We cant complain about gridlock or blame the opposition. We have little time for grandstanding. We live in our communities, and we feel the consequences of our decisions. When it comes to tackling the immense challenge of rebuilding old infrastructure for a new climate reality, its long past time that Washington take some direction from leaders on the front lines.

Photo Credit: Justapinch.Com Online sales of food and desserts for Christmas are estimated to increase by double-digits according to several retail analysts. As more food companies make its products available for sale online, consumers are embracing food as a gift for that special someone. Desserts are especially popular for purchase in the months of December and January. Although many families have its favorites in terms of desserts, I recommend that Christmas 2018 be the year of trying different desserts that are sure to leave a grand impression. The Most Awe Inspiring Dessert Ever Made Of the desserts I recommend in this article, none come close to generating a reaction as strongly as the Levee High Caramel Pecan Apple Pie. Invented by The Blue Owl caf&amp;eacute;, the Levee High pie is a dessert that most people have never heard, seen or tried. What's certain is this: Weighing nearly 10 pounds, it's a dessert that will create a Christmas dinner to remember. The pie made such an impression on Oprah Winfrey that she selected it as one of Oprah's Favorite Things. When served with ice cream, the Levee High Apple Pie is a special treat. Photo Credit: Smartertravel.Com Brazos Bottom Pecan Pie I continue to be amazed at how few families serve pecan pie during the holidays, especially Christmas. Associated primarily with the culture of the Southern United States, pecan pie is a dessert that deserves to become a favorite nationwide. With a flavor and texture to die for, pecan pie is a special treat. The pie can be made a number of ways but I recommend the Brazos Bottom Pecan Pie especially if this is the first time trying pecan pie. In order to bring out the best flavor in the pie, do not microwave the pie to heat it up. I believe pecan pie is best served at room temperature or warmed in an oven for no more than a few minutes. The secret to pecan pie is distributing throughout the pie instead of just on the surface of the pie. When in doubt, add more pecans. Photo Credit: Goodecompany.Com Sweet Potato Pie I first learned of sweet potato pie while serving in the United States Marine Corps. I had finished a workout with the boxing team when a member of the team made the comment that he &amp;quot;couldn't wait to make weight and fight so I can go home on leave and eat sweet potato pie.&amp;quot; I laughed and stated that I thought the joke was funny as most assuredly there was no such thing as a pie made from sweet potatoes. A slice of fresh homemade sweet potato pie. I recommend also trying sweet potato pecan pie. Photo Credit: Getty Getty I couldn't have been more wrong. In many homes throughout the South, sweet potato pie is the center of the meal. In fact, sweet potato pie is considered the &amp;quot;Southern cousin&amp;quot; to pumpkin pie and it is one of the best tasting pies I've ever eaten. I especially like sweet potato pecan pie. You can find a recipe here or order the pie online for delivery. Kuchen Last but certainly not least on the list of desserts I recommend is Kuchen (pronounced koo-gen). Kuchen is a type of sweet dessert that is baked similar to a cake. With origins in Germany, Kuchen is most popular in states with a heavy German heritage: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kentucky, Indiana, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Photo Credit: Justapinch.Com Online sales of food and desserts for Christmas are estimated to increase by double-digits according to several retail analysts. As more food companies make its products available for sale online, consumers are embracing food as a gift for that special someone. Desserts are especially popular for purchase in the months of December and January. Although many families have its favorites in terms of desserts, I recommend that Christmas 2018 be the year of trying different desserts that are sure to leave a grand impression. The Most Awe Inspiring Dessert Ever Made Of the desserts I recommend in this article, none come close to generating a reaction as strongly as the Levee High Caramel Pecan Apple Pie. Invented by The Blue Owl café, the Levee High pie is a dessert that most people have never heard, seen or tried. What's certain is this: Weighing nearly 10 pounds, it's a dessert that will create a Christmas dinner to remember. The pie made such an impression on Oprah Winfrey that she selected it as one of Oprah's Favorite Things. When served with ice cream, the Levee High Apple Pie is a special treat. Photo Credit: Smartertravel.Com Brazos Bottom Pecan Pie I continue to be amazed at how few families serve pecan pie during the holidays, especially Christmas. Associated primarily with the culture of the Southern United States, pecan pie is a dessert that deserves to become a favorite nationwide. With a flavor and texture to die for, pecan pie is a special treat. The pie can be made a number of ways but I recommend the Brazos Bottom Pecan Pie especially if this is the first time trying pecan pie. In order to bring out the best flavor in the pie, do not microwave the pie to heat it up. I believe pecan pie is best served at room temperature or warmed in an oven for no more than a few minutes. The secret to pecan pie is distributing throughout the pie instead of just on the surface of the pie. When in doubt, add more pecans. Photo Credit: Goodecompany.Com Sweet Potato Pie I first learned of sweet potato pie while serving in the United States Marine Corps. I had finished a workout with the boxing team when a member of the team made the comment that he ""couldn't wait to make weight and fight so I can go home on leave and eat sweet potato pie."" I laughed and stated that I thought the joke was funny as most assuredly there was no such thing as a pie made from sweet potatoes. A slice of fresh homemade sweet potato pie. I recommend also trying sweet potato pecan pie. Photo Credit: Getty Getty I couldn't have been more wrong. In many homes throughout the South, sweet potato pie is the center of the meal. In fact, sweet potato pie is considered the ""Southern cousin"" to pumpkin pie and it is one of the best tasting pies I've ever eaten. I especially like sweet potato pecan pie. You can find a recipe here or order the pie online for delivery. Kuchen Last but certainly not least on the list of desserts I recommend is Kuchen (pronounced koo-gen). Kuchen is a type of sweet dessert that is baked similar to a cake. With origins in Germany, Kuchen is most popular in states with a heavy German heritage: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kentucky, Indiana, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Dave,"Two bridges can be seen in this photo. One had been around for more than 25 years. The other, much bigger, was pretty new at the time. From a 1960s report for the Interior Department, addressing both:
        Although a railroad bridge connected Winona to the Wisconsin shore as early as 1871, the city had no direct highway access for another two decades. Teamsters made do with a ferry that carried them over the Main Channel to Latsch Island; there they disembarked onto a long wooden trestle that spanned the North Channel and the river's remaining expanse. In 1892, the ferry finally gave way to Bridge #5930, Steel, cantilever, through-truss design, the span was a municipally financed project designed to make Winona the main trade center for its Wisconsin neighbors. To retire the construction debt, the city administered the new ""High Wagon Bridge"" as a toll crossing.
By the 1930s, auto traffic was making the now ""old"" high bridge obsolete, with its zigzag connection to an older North Channel wagon bridge a serious impediment.
A new span was designed and survives today about a quarter mile up river from the bridges seen in the photo above. Ironically, an updated form of the original North Channel wagon bridge survives for non-motorized traffic.","The Mississippi River circa 1898. ""Winona, Minnesota. The levee below the bridge.""

Collin Abdallah,"One year after the launch of Resilient by Design 's Bay Area Challenge, the final nine design concepts have been selected. The Bay Area Challenge launched with a call to action to ""bring together local residents, community organizations, public officials and local, national, and international experts to develop innovative solutions that will strengthen our region's resilience to sea level rise, severe storms, flooding, and earthquakes."" The idea formulated as a “blueprint for resilience” that can be replicated and utilized locally and globally. Other urban challenges will also be addressed, including housing, transport, health and economic disparity as a means of not just protecting the current regions, but strengthening them. The elite, collaborative teams include world-renowned designers like BIG, Mithun and HASSEL +. Read on for more about each of the final design concepts. + 46 The Estuary Commons: People, Place, and Path Forward - All Bay Collective. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design The Estuary Commons: People, Place, and Path Forward All Bay Collective San Leandro Bay From the architects - To protect local neighborhoods and restore native habitats, All Bay Collective reimagines the shoreline of San Leandro Bay with the creation of Estuary Commons. Through the construction of ponds, landforms, and expanded streams, the communities of Deep East Oakland, Alameda, and San Leandro will not only be able to adapt to sea-level rise and groundwater flooding, but will also have a network of flourishing greenways to enjoy for generations to come. The All Bay Collective worked closely with eight community organizations to move community groups from the margins to the center of the design and planning process. Islais-Creek - Hyper Creek - BIG + ONE + Sherwood. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design Islais-Creek - Hyper Creek BIG + ONE + Sherwood City of San Francisco : Bayview-Hunters Point, Dogpatch, and Potrero Hill From the architects - Islais Creek - Hyper-Creek is a vision for the area where ecology and industry co-exist in harmony. The BIG + ONE + Sherwood unveiled six proposed pilot projects, developed together with stakeholders and local communities, to kickstart a long-term process toward realizing the overall vision. At the center of their proposal is a large park with a restored tidal creek system and soft shoreline shares the area with maritime functions, light manufacturing, and logistics that have formed the area’s economic backbone for decades. The park plays an important role in building physical and social resilience: it retains, conveys and cleans water, protecting the surrounding neighborhoods while providing amenities and benefits to the community. Elevate San Rafael - BionicTeam. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design Elevate San Rafael BionicTeam San Rafael, Marin County From the architects - Elevate San Rafael is a new paradigm for responding to complex environmental change and simply what needs to be done: occupy higher elevations and raise the quality of life and social connection for everyone. It proposes evolving the city by combining time-tested approaches to coastal adaptation with a moral, financial, and infrastructural agenda for large-scale preparation. The Grand Bayway - Common Ground. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design The Grand Bayway Common Ground San Pablo Bay, Sonoma &amp; Napa County From the architects - State Highway 37, a low-lying commute route that skirts the northern edge of San Pablo Bay, is both traffic-choked and increasingly flooded due to sea level rise. Sitting atop a precarious levee that confines an immense but compromised marsh complex, Fraser Shilling has observed, “the highway has the dubious distinction of constricting both traffic and tidal flows”. The project considers a new future for this highway as an elevated scenic byway, creating an iconic “front door” to a vast ecological open space previously known to few. Accessible to bikes, runners, kayaks, campers, and fishermen, the Grand Bayway will become a Central Park for more 21st century sensibilities in rapidly expanding North Bay communities. Collect &amp; Connect - Resilient South City - HASSELL+. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design Collect &amp; Connect - Resilient South City HASSELL + South San Francisco, San Mateo County From the architects - Collect &amp; Connect - Resilient South City is a proposal to create more public green space and continuous public access along South San Francisco ’s Colma Creek, aiming to reduce the impacts of flooding, mitigate against sea-level rise vulnerability, restore native flora and fauna, and create more amenity and healthy lifestyle opportunities by connecting a continuous public corridor from the Orange Memorial Park to a new public park at the shoreline. Designing Our Own Solutions - P+SET. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design Designing Our Own Solutions P+SET (Permaculture and Social Equity Team) Marin City, Marin County From the architects - The Permaculture and Social Equity Team proposed a social design process to build community capacity in leading the challenges of coastal adaptation and resiliency planning. The team was invited to implement their process in Marin City by Shore Up Marin, an environmental justice, and resiliency planning organization. Out of the process grew a capacity building program, resulting in an inspiring People’s Plan to authentically reflect the aspirations and intentions of the resident community. An intergenerational cohort expanded existing knowledge for assessing and addressing risks, developing near and long-term strategies with a prioritized set of projects to be partially implemented as early as this summer. Unlock Alameda Creek - Public Sediment. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design Unlock Alameda Creek Public Sediment Alameda Creek, Alameda County From the architects - Unlock Alameda Creek is an implementable project that links Alameda Creek with its historic baylands. By reconnecting sediment flows from Alameda Creek to the marshes and mudflats at the Bay’s edge, the proposal creates protective ecological infrastructure that adapts to sea level rise. It provides a sustainable supply of sediment to bay marshes and mudflats for sea level rise adaptation, reconnects migratory fish with their historic spawning grounds, and introduces a network of community spaces that reclaim the creek as a place for people, building an ethos and awareness around our public sediment resources. ouR-HOME - The Home Team - Mithun. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design ouR-HOME The Home Team - Mithun Richmond, California From the architects - The ouR-HOME sea level rise response projects are linked to the health and financial well-being of residents that have been traditionally shut out of opportunities to improve health and family wealth. Small lot housing, a community land trust, social impact bonds and community infrastructure combine to lower the cost of entry to home ownership. Green infrastructure proposals to bring the ‘marsh to Main Street’ with a horizontal levee, and plant 20,000 trees to filter air and water, are strategies that can be implemented through existing local job and career programs – benefiting the people in North Richmond. South Bay Sponge - The Field Operations Team. Image Courtesy of Resilient by Design South Bay Sponge The Field Operations Team San Mateo and Santa Clara County From the architects - The “Sponge” is a concept for using nature and natural systems as a primary tool for climate adaptation and resiliency in the South Bay, inspired by both the historic function of the region’s inter-tidal marshlands as flood protection, as well as by the remarkable efforts to restore the South Bay Salt Ponds. The potential of a large-scale assemblage of remnant marshlands, newly restored salt ponds and newly constructed wetlands as the core component of a regional flood protection strategy is at once radically innovative, but also resonant with the South Bay landscape today. In addition to addressing climate adaptation, the South Bay Sponge can give the landscapes of the South Bay a powerful and legible identity.

Meaghan Clark,"New Orleans-based artist Debbie Boyd Hageman has always looked to mother nature for inspiration, solace and refuge. From the time she was a little girl out in the garden with her mother, helping to grow their vegetables, to photographing and painting outdoors in her beloved New Orleans, Boyd Hageman finds her creativity flows best when outside.
I look at the landscape and I see something new every time, says Boyd Hageman. She paints big, bold, colorful abstract paintings for commercial and retail clients around the globe.
The Philly native spent a good chunk of her childhood in the state of Indiana. In her early 20s, she headed south to Florida, where she began her artistic career. Though she had always painted and briefly spent time in college art classes, it wasnt until the then 20-something hit the Sunshine state that she was able to sell her paintings and confirm she could be successful as an artist.
Her use of both bright and muted colors, often together, is part of what makes her art so appealing. Though she does sell smaller pieces so that her art is accessible at all price points, Boyd Hageman mostly creates larger pieces that can stand on their own. I tend to express myself best using large-scale canvases, she says.
Collect this ideaDeep, dark colors from artist Debbie Boyd Hageman work well in a monotone room.
Freedom of expression
For this busy artist and mom, it truly is all about expression.
Sometimes I hate a piece, then I love it, then I hate it. Eventually, I come to a place where I can stop working on it, which is where I love it again, she says with a laugh. Though she works to keep the artistic temperament to a minimum, Boyd Hageman jokes shes been known to throw a piece outside on the ground when completely unsatisfied. I usually go pick it up later and get back to work on it.
The prolific painter is also a talented cook who makes most of her family meals daily and from scratch. Working as an artist has allowed her to spend more time with her husband and two children. Her family also loves the outdoors. Often, they will walk the levee overlooking the Mississippi River. The scenic walk is just a few hundred feet from her front door in the Algiers Point neighborhood of New Orleans. Its that kind of freedom she finds most appealing.
I love that I make my own schedule, set my own rules and can truly be myself, she says.
Collect this ideaNew Orleans-based contemporary artist Debbie Boyd Hageman in her studio.
The creative process
The artist has set up a studio in her home and posts pictures of her process almost daily. Many collectors buy their pieces directly from Boyd Hageman through her social media channels. She says those channels are like a virtual art gallery and she has a huge appreciation for them. Some artists she follows and admires on Instagram are Adam Handler, Eileen Noonan and Joseph Conrad-Ferm, as well as many others.
The busy artist also sells her pieces at various art galleries and artistic spaces such as the Broad Theater. Plus, she sells at local hotels like the Old 77 Hotel through the curated collection from Where YArt. She also has pieces in the permanent collections of The Jung Hotel, Pigeon and Price and The Brent House Transplant Institute.
On days when her schedule and mother nature align, the natural beauty will pack up her paintings and her gear and head to the famous French Quarter. There, she often sets up shop in Jackson Square with a multitude of other talented artists.
Its a real community of people who take care of one another, she says. She adds that she learns a great deal from her contemporaries on everything from the location of the best parking spaces to easy ways to haul canvases and equipment through the busy streets.

Lulu Garcia-Navarro,"Two men pray at an early morning service at La Lomita chapel, a historical landmark in Mission, Texas.
Dana Cronin/NPR
Before sunrise and illuminated by lantern light, the faithful gathered to pray, as they have many times before, at La Lomita chapel in Mission, Texas. 
The chapel is made of simple white adobe, and Roy Rogers' song ""Blue Shadows On The Trail"" plays from a battery-operated radio in the chilly pre-dawn gloom as Rev. Roy Snipes makes his way down the aisle to preside over the Mass. 
The choice of processional music is an unusual one, but this congregation expects it. Father Snipes is known around here as the cowboy priest. He normally wears his wide-brimmed hat, and on the altar with him are two of his rescue dogs. 
On Friday, his prayers are politically pointed.

Dana Cronin/NPR
He intones, ""Oh Lord, you made our hearts and you know us and you know our affliction and our astonishment at the arrogance of our own government desecrating the sanctuary of our homeland ... ignoring our rights as free Americans and sons and daughters of Texas, South Texas. We pray to you.""
The local Catholic diocese is mired in a legal battle with the U.S. government over the chapel's land, which is right next to the Rio Grande River. 25 miles of President Trump's proposed border wall, funded in 2018 when Republicans still held a majority in the House, are slated to go through Hidalgo County, where Mission is located. 
La Lomita which means little hill has been here almost since the southern border was created, following the Mexican-American War in the mid-19th century. It's part of a series of missions established by the Catholic Church to maintain a presence on the U.S. side of the new border. The town of Mission now with a population of around 80 thousand people grew up around it. 
In last year's appropriations bill, money was allocated for ""levee fencing"" on the land at La Lomita a massive 30-foot wall on the north side of the property, complete with access roads and cameras. After the Mass, Snipes says he believes a wall will desecrate this place. Those who came to pray here agree. 
The Mass ends outside the chapel with a hymn in Spanish, and the congregation gathers around a bonfire amid the twisted mesquite trees.
Rene Villarreal is a 51-year-old electrical contractor and a father of five sons. He says this is more than just a spiritual place. Generations have prayed here. 
""I mean you're here in the mornings,"" Villarreal says. ""And you just wonder how many of your ancestors have been here praying for the same things we're praying, and asking our God to help us and give us the strength to go through another day.""
Like many residents here, he has deep roots on both sides of the border. People here switch easily between Spanish and English: The town of Mission is in Hidalgo County which is 92 percent Latino, and many of the residents have family in Mexico. 
""Well, look around,"" says Armando O'Caña, mayor of Mission, who attended the service. ""Look at people just eating breakfast here... under some of these trees here in this nice park here in Mission. You know. There's nothing unusual. You know it's normal. It's a normal event. So there's no crisis here on the border.""
It was the same message he delivered to President Trump when he met him last month during Trump's border visit. O'Caña says once the wall is built, it will cut off access to city services, like 911, for Mission's residents on the other side. 
""That's not right,"" he says. ""How can I protect them? How can we get even water and sewer on the other side? Yeah, they say they will have some gates and all that, but you know when seconds count, you still have to go through the gate."" 
The latest legal battle over the land between the government and La Lomita took place last week. The local diocese tried and failed to stop the government from surveying the chapel land.

Dana Cronin/NPR
Mary McCord is a senior litigator at Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, and she's one of the lawyers representing the diocese. She says the government has the right to claim private property for public use but La Lomita is a chapel, not just private land. 
""What's different about this,"" she says, ""Is that government can't take action that substantially burdens the free exercise of religion and that is not only part of the First Amendment, but it's also part of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.""
She says the church argues that the wall is inconsistent with Catholic teachings, ""which includes this principle of universality that all people are equal and need to be treated as such, and provided with basic necessities of life. Whether it's food and shelter... and according to the teachings of the pope migration is an important piece of this."" 
The next court battle will be over the government's plan to actually seize the land and start building. 
Driving down the proposed path of the border wall, there's an RV park where Texans come to enjoy the warmth in the winter. There's also a riverside restaurant and a lot of farms and houses. It's peaceful. But there's also the constant presence of Customs and Border Protection, with watchtowers and helicopters, as well as sensors dotting the river bank. 
The area encapsulates the debate over border security specifically, what kind does this part of Texas need? 
Monty Awbrey, pictured here in his home office, is a businessman and supporter of President Trump's proposed border wall.
Monika Evstatieva /NPR
For businessman Monty Awbrey, the answer is clear. 
""Our national security is at risk,"" he says. He runs his construction business from his ranch, where he also raises horses and cattle. 
He also met with President Trump when he was down here last month. And he made quite the impression. 
""When I asked President Trump to sign my name tag,"" he says, ""I asked him, you know, would be OK if I gave him a gift. And he said yes, and I just kind of reached out and started undoing my belt."" 
Imagine the scene: Monty Awbrey, a really big guy, digging around his pants in front of the president. 
""Everybody kind of lost their head like whoa. And [Trump] looked at me like, what are you doing?"" he recounts, laughing. 
He was actually going for his rodeo championship buckle, which reminds him of his late father. He wanted Trump's son Barron to have it. 
It's no surprise Awbrey was invited, since he's a vocal supporter of the president's signature campaign promise. 
Last month, he threw a barbecue for border patrol agents working without pay during the shutdown. 
""Each one of those agents I got to meet, I shook their hands and talked to them, thanked them for their service, and I asked them their opinion of the wall,"" he says. ""Out of all those 250 agents, not one of them was against it.""
He believes walls work. 
""It is a humanitarian crisis,"" he says. ""Whether the mayors or local law enforcement want to say so. They're not in the rural areas out here. They don't see what goes on, on a day to day basis. ... They've never had [migrants] walk up on their doorstep at three in the morning begging for help."" 
After his meeting with the President, Awbrey says he got a lot of hate on social media, where he was called a racist. He says those labels don't work on the border. His wife is Latina and he speaks fluent Spanish. And he's friends with Father Snipes he was even baptized at La Lomita six months ago, when he became a Catholic at his wife's request. 
""Father Roy [Snipes] and I discussed this,"" Awbrey says. ""And he knows what side I stand on and he understands my views and I understand his as well. You know Father Roy is a very compassionate man. I love him to death and I'll do anything in the world for him."" 
A bumper sticker on Father Roy Snipes' car.
Monika Evstatieva/NPR
It's the border way, Awbrey says. You can stand on different sides of an issue and still respect each other. 
Customs and Border Protection declined to comment for this story. They did confirm that no work has begun yet on the Mission section of the border wall. 
Back at La Lomita chapel, the post-Mass meal is winding down. And 72-year-old Leonor Ochoa is sitting at the table enjoying the food and company. 
""We live in a neighborhood where everyone shares,"" she says. ""Like right now, in this moment, we're a lot of different families, and all of us are coming together and sharing our tacos, and our lunch. We are united."" 
She says wall or no wall, that won't change.

CBS/AP,"DEMOTTE, Ind. -- A levee breach along the Kankakee River in northwestern Indiana has local officials urging about 30 homeowners to evacuate. Keener Township Volunteer Fire Chief Randy Woods said the breach was relatively minor when it was discovered about 3 p.m. Friday near Demotte, about 50 miles southeast of Chicago. He said some local residents tried to sandbag the breach ""to get it under control, but it just got bigger and bigger."" Local firefighters were called out to help them, but eventually everyone had to pull out for their own safety. No injuries were reported. The National Weather Service said record flooding was occurring along the Kankakee following several days of heavy rains and snowmelt that have sent streams out of their banks from the Ohio River to Michigan and Wisconsin. Some state and local leaders were looking at the damage in South Bend Friday, including Senator Joe Donnelly and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg damage, CBS affiliate WSBT reports. ""We haven't seen as much of a structural compromise as we did in the 2016 incident, but we're really not going to know the conditions of some of the houses and conditions of some of the roads until after the water has receded,"" Buttigieg said. One resident, Jim Gosa, was without power and had four feet of water in his basement. Some homes on Friday were halfway under water. Strong thunderstorms moving into Oklahoma and Arkansas on Saturday brought a chance for flooding and possibly tornadoes.

Miss Cellania,"The Mississippi Delta was destined to become the site of a big city. The Mississippi River was the method of transport for raw materials, people, and supplies for a large part of the U.S. and New Orleans became its sea port. Three hundred years ago this spring, French colonials first began clearing vegetation to establish La Nouvelle-Orléans on the meager natural levee of the Mississippi River. At most 10 to 15 feet above sea level, this feature accounts for nearly all the region’s upraised terrain; the rest is swamp or marsh. One Frenchman called it “Nothing more than two narrow strips of land, about a musket shot in width,” surrounded by “canebrake [and] impenetrable marsh.” Those two narrow strips of land were not enough for the growing city, so engineers went to work to make more land, by draining swampland and diverting water.

St. Joseph Post
Sandbagging operations continue in Elwood, Kansas near the Missouri River.
All eyes are on the Missouri right now, especially in Kansas.
Elwood, Kansas, just across the Missouri River from St. Joseph, has evacuated as the Missouri rises to nearly record levels. The National Weather Service reports the Missouri at 32.01 at 2:30pm Friday, just shy of the record crest of 32.1 feet reached in 1993. NWS expects the level of the Missouri River at St. Joseph to begin to lower this evening, projecting it to keep dropping and leave the major flood stage by Sunday morning.
Officials called for the evacuation of Elwood when the river reached 30 feet.
Doniphan County, Kansas Emergency Management spokesman Rick Howell says Elwood residents cooperated when asked to leave their town.
Youre talking about a town that for generations has lived with the Missouri River, so theyve seen this type of thing through the years, Howell says. So, when local officials start to talk about evacuation for precautionary steps and protection of life and property, these local residents take that seriously.
Members of the nearby 139th Airlift Wing at Rosecrans Airport are helping sandbag operations to fortify the levee which protects Elwood.
The 139th Vice Commander, Col. John Cluck, says high priority equipment has been moved from nearby Rosecrans Memorial Airport. Its command center is now located across the river in St. Joseph. The C-130 planes have been flown to Topeka, Kansas.
Cluck says the 139th feels confident the levee will hold.
Shes a strong old girl and shes holding tight, Cluck says. So, were helping her. We are continuing to stack sandbags on top of it to give us some more depth. We have water on sandbags, but thats okay, thats why we put them there.
Sandbagging will continue until the river recedes enough to be deemed no longer a threat to Elwood.","Elwood braces for flooding, but levee is holding back a Missouri River at near record height stjosephpost.com Nebraska flood 2019: “Potentially unprecedented flood season,” NOAA warns Vox.com Missouri River flooding forces evacuation of 7,500 from waterfront …",2019-03-22T21:10:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Stjosephpost.com'}","Elwood braces for flooding, but levee is holding back a Missouri River at near record height - stjosephpost.com",http://www.stjosephpost.com/2019/03/22/elwood-braces-for-flooding-but-levee-is-holding-back-a-missouri-river-at-near-record-height/,http://www.stjosephpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sandbagging_Elwood-1.jpg,,Stjosephpost.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima),"A section of the border fence between Mexico and the U.S. in Mexicali, Baja California state, Mexico on March 10 is pictured. | Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump promised to build a ""big, beautiful"" wall, but a border official’s description of the first major steps on the project framed it as more of a fixer-upper. U.S. Customs and Border Protection acting deputy commissioner Ronald Vitello told reporters during a news conference Friday that the administration would put 2018 congressional appropriations — about $1.6 billion — toward creating or replacing roughly 100 miles of wall structures along the southern U.S. border. Story Continued Below But Vitello declined to specify exactly how much of the that would go towards the creation of new barriers in previously-uncovered areas as opposed to enhancing existing border structures. “It’s a mix,” the customs official said. Pressed to differentiate between new wall structures and improvements to existing ones, Vitello argued that the distinction was moot. “I would say that it’s all new because there’s a different design going in, it’s replacing stuff that’s unsuitable,” he said. “I would call it all new. It replaces what is existing.” Vitello said the newly created border wall systems will provide “a comprehensive solution that provides wall, lighting, enforcement cameras, and other related technology, and all-weather roads to impede and deny illegal cross-border activity."" Among the newly-unveiled border enhancements are 14 miles of bollard wall set to replace steel landing mats in San Diego, as well as 14 miles for the replacement of a secondary barrier; two miles of a 30-foot border wall that will take the place of an existing pedestrian barrier in Calexico; the addition of gates to a 35-miles stretch of existing border wall and 25 miles of levee wall set to be put up in Hidalgo County. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. The agency said it will replace roughly 47 miles of border fencing with new border wall systems equipped with cameras and other tools. According to Vitello, officials are likely to first break ground on a project in April, where 20 miles of border wall systems will be replaced in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The agency said there's currently 654 miles of existing structures along the border, but that they would like to see it extended to about 1,000 miles. According to Vitello, that goal could be in reach if Trump received the $25 billion in funding he requested for the project in January. In its 2018 appropriations packaged, Congress granted $1.6 billion toward the Trump administration's efforts to improve border security. “Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming,” the president tweeted last week. Vitello, while praising Congress for allocating funds toward the project, said the amount ""does not fully fund our needs in the most critical locations.” The official lauded Trump’s efforts to tighten security along the southern U.S. border, citing his support for the project as crucial toward landing congressional funding for the projects. “Let me be clear, without the president and the administration’s leadership and a commitment to border security, the funding for construction of these projects would not be possible,” Vitello said.

Alexander Kay,"March 20 (Reuters) - The flooding that devastated the U.S. Midwest is likely to last into next week, as rain and melted snow flow into Kansas, Missouri and Mississippi, the National Weather Service said. Floods driven by melting snow in the Dakotas will persist even as Nebraska and Iowa dig out from storms that have killed four people, left one missing and caused more than a billion dollars in damage to crops, livestock and roads.
""It's already not looking good downstream for the middle and lower Mississippi and Missouri (rivers) into Kansas, Mississippi and Missouri,"" Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS's Weather Prediction Center, said early Wednesday.
The floodwaters have inundated a swath of Iowa and Nebraska along the Missouri River, North America's longest river. Half of Iowa's 99 counties have declared states of emergency.
""That snow pack is still there and it's going to keep melting, and that's bad news,"" Oravec said.
About an inch of rain is predicted for Saturday in the region, Oravec said. ""It's not a lot, but any precipitation is bad right now.""
Vice President Mike Pence toured some of Nebraska Tuesday and promised to help expedite federal help to the region.

Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin and Mississippi all declared states of emergency after the floods, which stemmed from a powerful winter hurricane last week. The flooding killed livestock, destroyed grains and soybeans in storage and cut off access to farms because of road and rail damage.
Authorities said they had rescued nearly 300 people in Nebraska alone, with some rivers continuing to rise. Rescuers could be seen in boats pulling pets from flooded homes. Some roadways crumbled to rubble and sections of others were submerged. In Hamburg, Iowa, floodwaters covered buildings.
$1 BILLION IN DAMAGE 
Nebraska officials estimated flood damage for the state's agriculture at more than $1 billion so far, according to Craig Head, vice president of issue management at the Nebraska Farm Bureau. Head said that was likely to grow as floodwaters recede.
""It's really too early to know for sure how bad this is going to get. But one thing we do know: It's catastrophic for farmers,"" said Matt Perdue, government relations director for the National Farmers Union. ""Were hoping it's only $1 billion, but that's only a hope.""
Nebraska officials estimate the floods have also caused $553 million in damage to public infrastructure and other assets, and $89 million to privately owned assets, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.
The water covered about a third of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, home to the U.S. Strategic Command, whose responsibilities include defending against and responding to nuclear attacks.
The Army Corps of Engineers is distributing 400,000 sandbags to operators of 12 levees along the Missouri River in Missouri and Kansas that are threatened by flooding, the Army Corps said in a news release on Tuesday.
Roads leading to the Nebraska Public Power District's Cooper nuclear plant near Brownville were engulfed by floodwaters from the Missouri, but the facility was still operating safely at full power on Tuesday.
The plant operator was flying staff members and supplies to the plant by helicopter, power district spokesman Mark Becker said.

Susan Szalewski World-Herald staff writer,"Residents of parts of western Iowa got good news Friday as high waters receded a bit, although they remained watchful in case the water rose again.
Others, such as those in Fremont County, braced for flood conditions to get even worse.
A mandatory evacuation in Missouri Valley was lifted about 11 a.m. Friday for most of the 1,000 or so people who had evacuated because the Boyer River was flooding on the south edge of town, Mayor Shawn Kelly said.
But about 150 to 200 people remained unable to return to their homes Friday evening, Kelly said. The river was receding, but officials were saying it could rise back to Thursday's levels, he said.
The town's Rand Community Center had been set up as a temporary shelter, but only about 15 people stayed there Thursday night.

David Pearson, a National Weather Service hydrologist, said many smaller rivers in western Iowa were going down. But he warned that some areas close to the Missouri River could see the still-rising Missouri back up into the tributaries  a rare occurrence but one worth monitoring.
Many communities along the Missouri faced closed roads and evacuations from flooding Friday and prepared for even worse.
Those below Nebraska's Platte River were especially vulnerable and could see ""extreme"" flooding, Pearson said.
Residents of Bartlett, in Fremont County, were evacuated late Thursday when water began seeping over a nearby levee, said Mike Crecelius, the county's emergency coordinator.
Others, in the Percival area, began evacuating Friday morning when a Mills County levee near the county line was breached, Crecelius said.
Getting out of Fremont County was becoming increasingly difficult, he said, as flooding forced multiple road closures, including Interstate 29 and Iowa Highway 2.
The Missouri River near Nebraska City had already topped the 28.2-foot level it reached in during the 2011 floods, Crecelius said, and the river's crest had yet to arrive from upstream.","Parts of Iowa see at least temporary improvement, while some wait for the worst Omaha World-Herald Massive Flooding Follows in Bomb Cyclone's Wake, With Nebraska Floods Possibly Worst in 50 Years Gizmodo Rescues, evacuations as floodwaters breach levees in Mi…",2019-03-16T05:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Omaha.com'}","Parts of Iowa see at least temporary improvement, while some wait for the worst - Omaha World-Herald",https://www.omaha.com/news/iowa/parts-of-iowa-see-at-least-temporary-improvement-while-some/article_3b153c51-c20e-52c1-8113-9271728690d7.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/20/b200003b-783a-5488-9631-6c754a12890f/5c8be3bcc507e.image.jpg?crop=1738%2C978%2C0%2C107&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Omaha.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ANDREA LARSON alarson@norfolkdailynews.com,"The worst of the immediate flooding danger seems to have passed in Norfolk and the immediate area, but that doesnt mean there arent still safety concerns.
Gov. Pete Ricketts, along with several other state and military leaders, emphasized that point repeatedly during a press conference Friday morning at the Norfolk Regional Airport.
Ricketts said he and the others had taken a tour of the river system via helicopter over the Platte River while flying into Norfolk.
The group witnessed extensive flooding over highways, roads and fields, as well as broken levees and a bridge out by Genoa, Ricketts said.
We still have a flooding situation where weve got water over the roads, and it is still dangerous to cross those roads. If you see water on the roads, dont travel, dont cross it, he said.
State Sen. Jim Scheer of Norfolk said the amount of devastation that occurred in the wake of widespread flooding has stressed the ability and resources of county and local officials, law enforcement and state military officials.
Theyre trying to take care of people that are actually needing help. Although a lot (of citizens) would probably like to go out and take a Sunday drive to take a look at the devastation, please dont. Because theres no saying what could happen to you, Scheer said.
There isnt enough manpower to block off all of the roads that are out, he said, so its important for people to follow the instructions of law enforcement.
People get hurt, people have died, Scheer said.
Brian Tuma, the assistant director with the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said the magnitude of the flooding event has brought about an increase in the number of requests for potable water.
A number of communities have water systems that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, including because they were overwhelmed by flood waters or have had breaks in water mains.
Additionally, search and rescue missions have been increasing very rapidly for those stranded or at risk because of flood waters, he said.
Major Gen. Daryl Bohac of the Nebraska National Guard and the director of NEMA said local officials in Norfolk were assisted Thursday night with a water rescue of three people using a high-wheeled vehicle.
Mayor Josh Moenning said there were at least 32 such rescue operations in Norfolk over the past 48 hours.
Those operations have ceased here in Norfolk, but we have two helicopters operating in the Columbus/Genoa/Arlington area right now, Bohac said.
As water continues to move downstream, the southern portion of the state will be at an increased risk, especially toward Ashland, he said.
Lincoln has a well field there. We are currently preparing to start operations and drop 1.5 tons of sandbags around the Lincoln water plant there in Ashland. And were also responding to a request for similar assistance in the Omaha community. ...
As water moves downstream in Nebraska and moves toward Missouri, were going to have increasing problems with flooding in those areas, Bohac said.
Col. John Hudson with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers went into further detail about river water flows and flooding.
He said a massive volume of water in the states river systems caused record or near-record flooding throughout eastern Nebraska, western Iowa and southeastern South Dakota.
Which has led to enormous flow on our rivers and into the Missouri River. We ceased flow out of Fort Randall Dam out on the Missouri two days ago on Wednesday morning, Hudson said.
That means 100 percent of the flow on the Missouri River now is from uncontrolled tributaries above Gavins Point Dam near Yankton or below with flooding from the Niobrara River, James River, Big Little Sioux River, Elkhorn River and Platte River, he said.
Were going to have record flows on portions of the Missouri River where we are already forecasting, particularly the levee system below Omaha, will likely experience overtopping at the levees, Hudson said.","State leaders: Safety is main focus in and around Norfolk Norfolk Daily News Many places are underwater, from Nebraska to Wisconsin, as major flooding engulfs the region Washington Post Heavy Rain, Massive Snow Melt Trigger Flooding Evacuations In Nebraska | …",2019-03-15T19:52:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Norfolkdailynews.com'}",State leaders: Safety is main focus in and around Norfolk - Norfolk Daily News,http://norfolkdailynews.com/news/state-leaders-safety-is-main-focus-in-and-around-norfolk/article_efc97958-475b-11e9-9145-47acbae79ac4.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/2d/02d4a914-475c-11e9-be89-ff47c6b45314/5c8c03349b35d.image.jpg?resize=617%2C412,,Norfolkdailynews.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
David A. Graham,"Almost a decade ago, a failed musician sat down at his kitchen table in Pittsboro, North Carolina, and began singing some new songs into a portable cassette player. M. C. Taylor had spent his youth dabbling in bands, skateboarding, and drugs in Southern California, but had given up on music and moved east to go study folklore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Taylor had to sing softly—his baby son was asleep in the other room—and the audio quality was, in his words “a joke.” He called the collection Bad Debt, which, given the reeling economy, was timely. The songs were not, abounding with gospel signifiers, road narratives, and impressionistic blues, all accompanied simply on acoustic guitar. The prophetic images bore some resemblance to old, weird Americana, with the grim fatalism and religious fervor of British ballads refracted through Appalachia. Taylor didn’t intend for anyone to hear the tapes. “It was like, I’m making music just for me,” he says. “I wasn’t even trying to get a gig. I wasn’t even playing shows, or playing the songs for anybody.” But when Taylor did cautiously share the music, people loved the songs. In a cosmic irony that Bad Debt ’s narrators, buffeted by forces beyond their control, would appreciate, the record now kicks off a forthcoming box set by Taylor’s band, Hiss Golden Messenger. The collection, which pulls together the band’s first three records and adds a fourth disc of unreleased material, shows how Taylor has produced—quietly at first, and then increasingly loudly—one of the most impressive bodies of songwriting of the last 10 years. Capping several years of fevered recording, frequent touring, and growing audiences, the release isn’t a capstone so much as a moment of reflection mid-journey. Taylor collects things: books of poetry, records, tattoos, phrases he mulls for months or years until they find a home in a lyric. At his cozy, eclectically decorated house on a quiet street in Durham, several rows of neatly arranged LPs are slowly conquering the living room. There are new releases, yellowing classics, a Jackson Southernaires record he chased for years, two copies of the same semi-obscure Abdullah Ibrahim LP. Off stage, Taylor tends to convey a wary warmth, amiable but circumspect. In contrast to his high, reedy singing voice, he retains the laid-back speaking cadence, and the ratty T-shirts, of a SoCal skater. He has a steady gaze and sandy facial hair that varies in length from neat mustache to scruffy walrus. But flipping through his recent musical acquisitions and offering real-time annotations, Taylor is at his most animated. Soon he’s bounding downstairs to a basement full of toys for children of all ages—Legos, woodblocks, books, and stuffed toys—to find another LP. While Taylor was writing Bad Debt, his day job was collecting folklore for the state of North Carolina. He’d find traditional musicians and get them to play him songs and tell him about them, though his expansive definition of tradition sometimes clashed with the hoity-toity academics who’d sent him out. One man played him John Prine’s “Paradise,” which belongs in the folk canon, but this singer had learned it from the credits of Steven Seagal’s 1997 film Fire Down Below. “It's the 21st century. That's a valid understanding of traditional music,” Taylor says. “In fact, learning a song from a VHS copy of a Steven Seagal film is pretty old-fashioned, all things considered.” Taylor’s fieldwork retaught him the value of playing music for its own sake. The musicians he collected might play an occasional gig at a local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, but they were performing for themselves and their families rather than to advance a career. Taylor had been playing in bands since he was in college. There was Ex-Ignota, an arty hardcore punk band memorialized by his college buddy Jack Johnson (yes) in a short documentary, and later the pleasant, forgettable, Gram Parsons–influenced Court and Spark. Music had become a grind. Burned out, he’d gone to graduate school at UNC to stall for time and figure out his next step, but these musicians inspired him to pick the guitar back up. Folk music provided a vocabulary and model for Taylor to reinvent his songwriting. He wanted any new songs to feel durable, like “Paradise”—versatile enough for all settings, even action movies, and assured enough to last for the rest of his life. Taylor’s prior songs, including a 2008 album released under the Hiss Golden Messenger moniker, weren’t bad, just listless. As he composed now, Taylor discovered a confidence he’d never felt in his music. “I had to figure out how to sing a song that I meant, that I could carry around every night for months or years. I didn't have that when I was in my late teens. I sure as shit didn’t have it in my 20s,” he says. “When I made Bad Debt it felt like I wrote the book of my life. I had never had that feeling creating music before.” Musically, his new work drew heavily on the Appalachian tradition and showed a knack for the folk alchemy of writing melodies that were catchy and novel yet familiar. Lyrically, the songs were packed full of old-fashioned imagery, much of it religious. The songs weren’t devotional—“I’m not saying I don’t believe in God. I’m skeptical,” Taylor told The Washington Post in 2014—but the near-universal reference points of biblical stories offered a lyrical shorthand. The old master, see, rode a beast like me through those city—those city gates. It was the Sabbath Day and I was picking many stones. It was the Sabbath Day and I felt like going home. All my friends are gone: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. That’s OK—yeah, that’s all right.... But should I stay in Babylon? Or should I go and roll on? “Those Bible stories, if you’re religious or not, they communicate something in shorthand that would take much longer to explain,” Taylor says. “That’s what has always drawn me to books like the New Testament. Not because I’m a Christian. It’s because we know those stories whether we like it or not, and they communicate something that can be profound.” If the songs weren’t about religion, what were they about? For most musicians, dreams of music stardom and the youthful angst that is the stuff of rock songs both burn out by the time a songwriter hits her or his fourth decade. Domesticity breeds dull songs. But by restarting his career at a comparatively late age, Taylor has both sidestepped the problem of juvenilia and managed to tap into the different, though no less real, drama of aging. While we sat at his kitchen table discussing the rock-star lifestyle last month, Taylor had to pause the conversation twice. Once there was a commotion in the other room, where his children Elijah, 9, and Ione, 5, were playing with friends. His wife Abby, a teacher, was at school getting ready for students to return to the classroom. Later, he huddled with a friend to work out childcare arrangements, a task complicated by his impending departure for a short European tour. These quotidian tasks are the minute-to-minute drudgery of fatherhood. Added together, they amount to a vast psychic burden and reward that forms Taylor’s musical wellspring. “The desire to have a longtime partner, the desire to have kids, and a house, the whole thing—I have seen those desires absolutely derail and wreck a lot of people, and I just have the good, crazy fortune of having found that before any of this happened,” he says. “So much of my life is about my family. Thinking about them. Being with them. Trying to understand how to be a father. All that stuff bleeds into music.” Taylor puts it a little more poetically on “Lion/Lamb,” a song on Virgo Fool, the box’s bonus disc: “It’s hard to be free—we all search for new shackles.” Last December, Taylor was enjoying an unseasonably warm evening before a show in Saxapahaw, North Carolina. His bandmates were still deep in a two-hour rehearsal, warming up for a two-and-a half-hour concert later that night. After years of playing in opening acts, granted at most a 15-minute soundcheck and a 40-minute set, the musicians were enjoying the luxury. “We just like to play,” Taylor grinned. The venue, a repurposed, disused textile dyeing plant, sits on the bank of the Haw River, the namesake of the record 2013’s Haw, which is included in the new box. Its first track mentions another North Carolina river, the Nantahala. Place names from across the south pepper Taylor’s lyrics: Rockingham, Biloxi, Shreveport. Hiss’s music draws on a range of Southern musical genres, from gospel to hillbilly, soul to twang. But Taylor didn’t grow up steeped in those traditions. He grew up in Orange County, California, and he hated it. “I had a wonderful childhood, but the place that I am from is not a place that I recognize spiritually,” he says. “The South offered me a doorway into a relationship with my environment that felt [like it was] living and stretched into the past. The past matters here. It's complicated and messy and bloody, and beautiful and confusing, but it’s the vernacular.” Taylor doesn’t claim to be a southerner, but he bristles at what he sees as lazy assumptions about the region. Speaking a few days after Doug Jones defeated Roy Moore in a U.S. Senate race, Taylor mocked what he felt was a one-dimensional caricature of Alabama voters, with white, rural, conservative Alabamians eclipsing the state’s depth. “‘That's what you get, it’s Alabama,’” he imitates, dismissively. “I've been through Alabama like 25 times in the past five years, and that's not the Alabama I know. I mean, granted, I'm running in certain circles, but those circles exist, and the boundaries of those circles are porous. All kinds of people pass through those circles.” Folklore collection paid terribly, and Taylor couldn’t see himself in academia, so he chose one of the few careers with worse prospects for both pay and career advancement and returned to music. Bad Debt was officially released in 2010, and the following year, he produced Poor Moon, which set the rough template for the Hiss Golden Messenger sound. The band combined the haunting mountain sound with a ’70s rock thump, horn parts, and electric guitars. On Poor Moon and its successor, Haw, Taylor revisited many of the Bad Debt songs, adapting them for a full band. David Bowie called Poor Moon “mystical country, like an eerie yellowing photograph.” Haw is better still, confronting the tensions posed by Taylor’s newfound success. In the liner notes, the music writer Amanda Petrusich sums up the album’s central question: “What if all the things I want exist in opposition to each other?” The record begins pleading, over a pounding beat, “Well, let me be the one I want / Well, let me love the one I want,” and closes with an accepting, or resigned refrain: “What shall be shall be enough.” Hiss’s growing fame was enough for the band to get a contract with Merge Records, the powerhouse indie label, which is releasing the new box set this fall. The rights to the old records were reverting to Taylor, and he wanted to see them in circulation. Compilations are typically the province of artists on the downswing of their careers, but for Hiss the set marks a rise. In 2014, the band released its Merge debut, Lateness of Dancers. It took nearly two years for the next album to see the light of day— Heart Like a Levee, which began as a commission to write songs inspired by the late documentary photographer William Gedney’s work in rural Kentucky. Frustrated by the long gestation of Levee, Hiss then quickly recorded its next record, 2017’s Hallelujah Anyhow, whose title seems like as good a summation of Taylor’s worldview as any. “Hiss Golden Messenger, from an existential angle, has always been about being sort of emotionally ambiguous or having that feeling of unresolve,” Taylor says. “I don't really want a song strictly in A minor, literally or figuratively. I'm looking for something more.” The newer albums (both produced by Brad Cook, the man Pitchfork calls “your favorite indie band’s secret weapon”) show the band exploring different musical terrain, dabbling in dub, prog, and ’70s-rock riffs. “Give me the gospel of the jukebox,” Taylor sings in “Domino,” and he gives it. The band is also increasingly indebted to gospel music, reflecting the influence of Hiss guitarist and keyboardist Phil Cook, Brad’s brother and Taylor’s inseparable right-hand man. At the same time, there’s less biblical shorthand in the lyrics. Worried it was becoming a crutch, Taylor has whittled his words to a smaller scope. “It's the ultimate irony that when you can go as small as you possibly can, that’s when it communicates the most, and that's when people can find connections to that idea in the most profound ways,” he says. This fall, Hiss is working on a new record at the upstate New York studio of Aaron Dessner, of The National. The band has recently toured in support of Bon Iver and Jason Isbell, and performed on Late Night With Seth Meyers last year. Taylor can dictate the shape of his tours, so he tries to schedule gigs in chunks, which better allows him to spend time at home with his family, and in two-night stands, which affords him more downtime in a city’s bookstores and record shops. Taylor has his wishlist—more money, he notes with a laugh—but given that 10 years ago he’d written off a music career, it’s a strangely comfortable position. “I never made a living playing music in my life until the past couple years,” Taylor told me in Saxapahaw. “There’s a sweetness to it. My faith in music had to be tested for 20 years. What I carry around with me musically is only the song. A good melody against chords will always sound fresh. It doesn’t matter who’s making it.” Later that evening, Taylor would take the stage and sing some songs he wrote for no one except himself. But instead of a sleeping baby, an archaic tape recorder, and a lone acoustic guitar, Taylor would be surrounded by a sold-out crowd singing along with the melodies and a nine-piece band playing the chords. It sounded fresh.",A new compilation of the band’s albums showcases one of the most impressive bodies of songwriting of the last 10 years.,2018-09-12T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",The Folk Alchemy of Hiss Golden Messenger,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/09/the-folk-alchemy-of-hiss-golden-messenger/569971/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/09/Mike_Taylor_August_2018_VI/facebook.jpg?1536700344,,Theatlantic.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lisa Rodriguez, Andrea Tudhope, Elle Moxley","Updated, 2:53 p.m. Thursday: Missouri Gov. Mike Parson declared a state of emergency Thursday, following flooding along the Missouri River.
Thursday morning the river breached a levee near Winthrop, Missouri, across from Atchison, Kansas. 
The rising floodwaters are affecting more Missouri communities and farms, closing more roads and threatening levees, water treatment plants and other critical infrastructure, Parson said in a written statement. We will continue to work closely with our local partners to assess needs and provide resources to help as Missourians continue this flood fight and as we work to assist one another.
The executive order activates the state's Emergency Operations Plan, which lets state agencies coordinate efforts directly with cities and counties.
Buchanan County Commissioner Ron Hook says water is coming through the levee and over the top, flooding farmland. Hes part of the team telling people to get out.
We had sheriffs department, emergency managers, going door to door, knocking, making sure people were aware water was going to be on their doorstep real soon,"" said Hook.
Amanda Horton lives in Winthrop, Missouri, about half a mile from the Missouri River.
It looks like I have a lake very close to my house, which is not normal, Horton said.
Horton said she was driving back and forth to Atchison, Kansas, Thursday morning over U.S. Highway 59. After the levee breach, she said the change was almost immediate.
There was water in the fields, everywhere. Its pretty significant, Horton said.
The highway was closed shortly after the breach. With U.S. 59 shutdown, Hortons three children had to stay home from school which is about eight miles away in Rushville, Missouri.
There are only a few businesses in Winthrop. Horton said the liquor store owners left last weekend, and the convenience stores have sandbagged the lower part of their buildings and are packing up today.
A lot of our neighbors have already gotten their water shut off, so theyve moved a lot of stuff out fearing water will get in and destroy their things, she said.
Horton said usually when the river rises, the water flows into Sugar Lake at the Lewis and Clark State Park southeast of Winthrop. She said residents there have basements and houses filled with water.

Jim Kunce is the superintendent of Lewis and Clark State Park. He said the park was prepared for the flood. All staff and equipment were evacuated.
The park has been through different floods throughout its existence. Each time it floods, something does change, whether we lose some trees, or we have to make adjustments to our landscaping, he said.
He said he expects to see the impacts of Thursdays levee breach within the next 24 hours. Compared to a flood in 1993 and one in 2011, this would be the worst, as far as the water level is concerned.
Severe flooding along the Missouri River after last week's ""bomb cyclone"" and ongoing snowmelt has affected communities in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri. 
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly has issued an executive order temporarily waiving fees and easing regulation on motor carriers assisting with flood relief, to expedite restoration efforts.
""Its important communities in both states receive the aid they need immediately,"" Kelly said in a statement.
Kelly is expected to tour affected areas today (Thursday) with the National Guard and Kansas Department of Emergency Management.
The National Weather Service says the Missouri River at Atchison is in major flood stage and expected to crest at 31.8 feet around 1 p.m. Friday. The record for that area is 31.6 feet.

The Associated Press,"Tropical storm Gordon lashed South Florida with heavy rains and high winds on Monday and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane when it hits the central U.S. Gulf Coast. Gordon formed into a tropical storm near the Florida Keys early Monday as it moved west-northwest at 28 km/h. The storm is expected to reach hurricane strength when it hits the Gulf Coast, including coastal Mississippi, by late Tuesday. From there, it is forecast to move inland over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center said at 11 p.m. ET that the storm was centred 530 kilometres east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 95 km/h. A hurricane warning was put into effect for the area stretching from the mouth of the Pearl River in Mississippi to the Alabama-Florida border. As much as 20 centimetres of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday. State of emergency in Louisiana The Miami-based centre said the storm is also expected to bring ""life-threatening"" storm surge to portions of the central Gulf Coast. A storm surge warning has been issued for the area stretching from Shell Beach, La., to Dauphin Island, Ala. The warning means there is danger of life-threatening inundation. The region could see rising waters of.9 to 1.5 metres. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,"" the centre said. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Monday and said 200 National Guard troops will be deployed to southeastern Louisiana. The storm's predicted track had shifted slightly east as of Monday evening, meaning Louisiana is currently just outside the area under the hurricane warning. Still, the southeastern part of the state remains under a tropical storm warning and residents need to be prepared for the storm to shift west, Edwards said. 'NOT a beach day' ""This storm has every possibility to track further in our direction,"" Edwards said during a news conference Monday evening. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell held an afternoon news conference and said the city has ""the pumps and the power"" needed to protect residents. But authorities issued a voluntary evacuation order for areas outside the city's levee protection system, including the Venetian Isles, Lake Saint Catherine and Irish Bayou areas. Cantrell urged residents within the levee protection area to stock up on supplies and shelter in place. Miami Beach Police said via Twitter that the Labor Day holiday was ""NOT a beach day,"" with rough surf and potential rip currents. Red flags flew over Pensacola-area beaches in Florida's panhandle, where swimming and wading in the Gulf of Mexico was prohibited. More than 4,000 Florida Power &amp; Light customers lost power Monday due to weather conditions. Tornadoes possible The U.S. National Weather Service said conditions were ""possible"" for tornadoes in the affected parts of South Florida on Monday night. The storm left many businesses on Florida's Gulf Coast feeling shortchanged by the holiday weekend. The area has already been heavily impacted by this summer's so-called ""red tide""— massive algae blooms that have caused waves of dead marine life to wash up along the coast. Jenna Wright, owner of a coffee shop in Naples, Fla., told the Naples Daily News that she had expected higher numbers for the Labour Day weekend. ""This is normally a decent weekend, but the storm and red tide aren't helping,"" Wright said. ""We're a beach coffee shop, and if people can't go to the beach, then we won't get any customers."" Separately, tropical storm Florence continues to hold steady over the eastern Atlantic. Forecasters say little change in strength is expected in coming days and no coastal watches or warnings are in effect.",Tropical storm Gordon lashed South Florida with heavy rains and high winds on Monday and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane when it hits the central U.S. Gulf Coast.,2018-09-04T04:24:26Z,"{'id': 'cbc-news', 'name': 'CBC News'}",Tropical storm Gordon brings hurricane warning to U.S. Gulf Coast,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tropical-storm-gordon-floriday-1.4809268,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4809269.1536034879!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/775219471jr003-tropical-sto.jpg,cbc-news,CBC News,levee,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jim Newell, Jim Newell","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks during a Congressional Gold Medal award ceremony at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in Washington. It’s taken them several crucial days longer than they had hoped, but Democratic and Republican leaders on Wednesday closed in on an agreement to fund the government through September at the higher spending levels they set last month. The omnibus spending bill, the last big “must-pass” bill of the year, is a vehicle for legislators to tack on all of their other legislative priorities that they couldn’t get through regular order. If they’re not included in this $1.3 trillion beast, most of them will wither away as Congress enters election season. The deal was officially wrapped up late Wednesday as leaders applied finishing touches. If they’re lucky, lawmakers may even have a few seconds to read the most important legislation of the year—much of which was negotiated privately at the leadership level—before voting on it. There will be no broad immigration deal to resolve the fate of Dreamers, border security, and legal immigration. A last-minute volley of offers between the White House and Democratic leaders proved fruitless, largely due to the White House and Democrats having diametrically opposed views on American immigration policy. As a result, the White House won’t get its $25 billion request for border wall funding, and Democrats won’t be able to secure a path to citizenship for Dreamers. The fate of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiaries remains mired in the legal system indefinitely. The administration will, however, get some physical barrier money—about $1.6 billion—which is described quite differently depending on which party you ask. A senior GOP aide said “this amount provides for more than 90 miles of ‘border wall system,’ going beyond the administration’s budget request for 74 miles in fiscal year 2018.” That 90-mile figure contains replacement fencing and levee improvement, though. A Democratic source said that the bill will only allow for 33 miles of new physical barrier and emphasized that it would be fencing or current barrier technology—“NOT concrete wall” or any of those flashy prototypes Trump recently fawned over during a trip. Another 14 miles would go toward secondary barriers near San Diego, and 45 miles worth of replacement fencing would be available elsewhere. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, meanwhile, said Wednesday that the deal has funds for “more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall.” Rounding those 92 miles up to a nice, round 100 might have been what it took to bring President Trump, who was reportedly upset at the lack of wall funding in the deal, on board. There will also be no section shoring up Obamacare’s individual insurance markets, and members on both sides are mad about that. The dispute that precluded an agreement revolved, in large part, around abortion. Republicans demanded an expansion of the Hyde amendment—which prohibits federal money being spent on abortion—to cover individual insurance markets. Such an expansion is a non-starter for Democrats, but it’s a must-have for Republicans, in order to provide cover for members skittish about voting to “prop up” Obamacare. In a press conference Wednesday morning, Republicans raged over Democrats’ opposition to the Hyde language, claiming they were overstating its effects to maintain the election-year narrative that Republicans are “sabotaging” health insurance markets and causing higher premiums. There will also be no section shoring up Obamacare’s individual insurance markets, and members on both sides are mad about that. “This is phony,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “I hope you lose votes, I hope you lose seats, you’re not worthy of governing this place.” There is one sensitive policy area, though, where it appears negotiators have been able to reach a modest accord: guns. It shouldn’t be surprising a bill to improve the background check system, which more than three-fourths of the United States Senate is co-sponsoring, will find its way into law. And yet, it is. The omnibus will include the Fix NICS bill, which incentivizes better reporting of information in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. There will also be additional money for school safety, similar to a bill introduced by Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch. In an extra boost for Democrats, who didn’t think that Fix NICS alone was enough of a response to Parkland, language will be added to the Dickey amendment clarifying that it doesn’t bar the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from studying gun violence. One gun measure that will not be in the omnibus is the National Rifle Association’s top legislative priority this Congress: concealed-carry reciprocity. House Republicans had logrolled concealed-carry reciprocity and Fix NICS together, and conservatives, particularly in the Freedom Caucus, will be furious that their leaders acceded to this uncoupling. But guess what? When you have two parties from which to draw votes, the opinion of a 40-person bloc of members on the right end of the spectrum doesn’t matter. One of the stickiest issues throughout the process has been the Gateway Program, a plan to improve the Hudson River tunnel connections between New York and New Jersey. President Trump issued a rare and unwavering veto threat against inclusion of appropriations for this project—a move that was to either secure leverage over, or simply annoy, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Though there will be no direct appropriation, a Democratic aide argues that the bill will boost enough accounts, like Amtrak’s, to provide $540 million in funding for the project not subject to administrative approval The bill will also fix a major screw-up within Republicans’ recently passed tax bill. Known as the “grain glitch,” the tax law inadvertently gave farming cooperatives a lopsided competitive advantage over agriculture companies. Democrats, after years of watching Republicans not only sit on their hands over technical problems within Obamacare but take those technical problems to the Supreme Court as a strategy for collapsing the entire law, were not inclined to help Republicans without a price. After dragging their feet over the last few days, Republicans appear to have agreed to some expansion of the low-income housing tax credit in exchange for the fix, though leaders were still finalizing the deal Wednesday afternoon. The main selling point for Republicans will be the major increase in military spending, which fulfills one of Trump’s key promises during the presidential campaign to “rebuild the military.” It will come as no surprise that the messaging for the bill, both in private and in public, from Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week has revolved around that issue. They would prefer not to talk about all of the domestic spending increases they had to concede in order to secure it. Elsewhere, the usual conservative efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and “sanctuary cities” didn’t make the cut. Hundreds of millions of additional dollars will allocated to both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and states, respectively, for counterintelligence efforts to stop Russian intervention in the 2018 midterms and to secure state election systems. A down payment of $10 billion toward new infrastructure spending will be included, as well as billions to combat the opioid epidemic. This should go down the way secretively written, lengthy, expensive omnibus packages usually do: with lots of bitching from various ideological corners, and maybe an hourlong shutdown from Sen. Rand Paul, until it passes comfortably and everyone flies home for the two-week recess.

If they had known, they never would have bought the house on Bayou Glen Road. Sure, it was a beautiful lot, tucked in a bend of the creek, backyard woodsy and wild, the neighbors friendly and the street quiet. A little piece of nature just 20 minutes from downtown Houston. It was exactly what John and Heather Papadopoulos recently married, hoping to start a family were looking for in 2007. They didn't think much about the creek that ran along their yard, aside from appreciating the birds it attracted to the neighborhood.
Across town, the Evans family was similarly indifferent to the wooded bayous that cut through their neighborhood. Janice Perry-Evans chose the house she rented because it was conveniently located near the local high school, which made it easy for her two boys to get to class and home from football practice. Her commute to the post office wasn't far either. Plus, at $800 per month, the rent was affordable. By 2017, the family had lived there for four years, and didn't have any plans to move. 
And then, in August of that year, both homes were destroyed. Both families had to start over from nothing. But today, one family is financially stable. The other is facing bankruptcy.

Disasters are becoming more common in America. In the early and mid-20th century, fewer than 20 percent of U.S. counties experienced a disaster each year. Today, it's about 50 percent. According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, climate change is already driving more severe droughts, floods and wildfires in the U.S. And those disasters are expensive. The federal government spends billions of dollars annually helping communities rebuild and prevent future damage. But an NPR investigation has found that across the country, white Americans and those with more wealth often receive more federal dollars after a disaster than do minorities and those with less wealth.Federal aid isn't necessarily allocated to those who need it most; it's allocated according to cost-benefit calculations meant to minimize taxpayer risk.
Put another way, after a disaster, rich people get richer and poor people get poorer. And federal disaster spending appears to exacerbate that wealth inequality.
The Flood
Nowhere are the economic and racial inequities of disaster aid more apparent than in communities that have experienced one of the most costly and widespread disasters: urban flooding.
Houston is arguably ground zero for urban flooding a sprawling city built on low and marshy flatlands exposed to hurricanes blowing in from the Gulf of Mexico. In the past decade, there have been five major floods in the city, culminating in the largest amount of rain ever recorded from a single storm: Hurricane Harvey in August 2017.
The Papadopoulos and Evans families were two of the hundreds of thousands of families who evacuated their homes during the storm.
After Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast in August 2017, the storm stalled over Houston and dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on some parts of the region.
Katie Hayes Luke for NPR
""We were the first ones to evacuate out of our house, up the street,"" remembers John Papadopoulos. In the years before the hurricane, their home had gone from a refuge to a nightmare. It flooded in 2009, in 2015 and in 2016. By 2017, they knew what to do: Put the valuables up high, and get out. They went to a neighbor's house first, and then to a hotel.
It was a new experience for the Evans family. ""When the water started coming up, we thought we were going to have to go on the roof,"" says Janice Perry-Evans. ""But we ended up not going on the roof. We ended up, me and the kids, packing up a little bit of stuff"" in a plastic container.
""We got out and we walked in that water,"" she remembers. The water was up to her armpits in places. Eventually, a dump truck carried them to a bus, and the bus dropped them at the convention center downtown.
The next morning, Perry-Evans and Papadopoulos took the same first step to start rebuilding their lives they turned to the federal government for help. But almost immediately, their experiences diverged.

From the beginning, a lot of things went right for the Papadopoulos family. John's employer, Microsoft, gave him as much time off as he needed and more than $10,000 to help with rent and other bills that piled up after the flood. The Papadopouloses rented a townhouse nearby and, within a few months, the federal aid they had applied for began to arrive.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency gave them $30,000; because the family owned a home that had been destroyed in the flood, the Internal Revenue Service sent checks for more than $100,000 in refunded taxes a perk of having a relatively high income. The Small Business Administration gave the family a low-interest loan.
About a year after the storm, Papadopoulos said, his family was financially stable.
The Evans family was not.

Janice Perry-Evans had one goal after the floodwaters receded: find a place to stay. She didn't have any savings for a hotel or a new apartment, so when a co-worker offered her a room in his house, she took it, even though it was one room for her and her three kids and it was a 45-minute drive from work and school.
Then, she started applying for help from FEMA.
The agency gave her about $2,500, enough to cover a deposit and first month's rent in a new place, but Perry-Evans needed the money for something else. Her oldest son was hoping for a college football scholarship. He couldn't afford to miss school or football practice that fall, and the family couldn't afford for Perry-Evans to miss shifts as a mail carrier for the post office.
""I had to go to work, and I had to get these boys back and forth to school. So I took that [money] and I put it for a car,"" she explains.
With her immediate transportation needs met, Perry-Evans went back to FEMA to see about getting more money for housing, but she says agency representatives reprimanded her for incorrectly using the money she had been given.
Perry-Evans never missed a day of work as a mail carrier for the USPS in the months she spent applying for disaster funds.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""Some of them were kind of rude,"" she remembers. ""Some of them felt sorry for me because I would be crying, [saying] 'Hey, I have nowhere to go. I don't have no money. You guys are not helping me like I thought.' ""
FEMA didn't block Perry-Evans from reapplying for housing money, but she says after the scolding she turned to other potential sources of federal aid, unsuccessfully. Her income wasn't high enough to claim a significant tax refund. She says she was denied a low-interest loan from the Small Business Administration because her credit score was too low. A FEMA representative suggested she try to get housing money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but after she used her day off to go to an information session, she was informed that her income was too high to qualify.
""It was like every time I tried something, it was an obstacle in the way,"" she says.
The entire time, Perry-Evans says, she never missed a shift at the post office. She even worked the week that Hurricane Harvey hit Houston. She often worked six days a week. But her paycheck just wasn't enough to cover all her bills, and her co-worker said it was time for the family to move out of the spare room.
Six months after the flood, Perry-Evans did the only thing she felt she could: She signed a lease to rent a house that cost 50 percent more than where they used to live, for less space. The electricity didn't always work. For more than a year after the flood, Perry-Evans was still sleeping on a cot she took from the convention center.
The Rich Get Richer; The Poor Get Poorer
Perry-Evans is not alone in her struggle. ""Recovery for vulnerable families [looks] a lot different than it does for more affluent neighborhoods,"" says Kathy Payton, the director of the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corp., a neighborhood nonprofit that works a few miles from where Perry-Evans lives.

Payton grew up in Houston and has spent decades supporting the basic needs of her neighbors, many of whom live on fixed incomes or do not have a cushion of savings to fall back on after a disaster.
""We had loss of income because people lost their jobs. We had increased health issues as a result of them living in bad situations,"" she says, ticking off the cascade of challenges lower-income families have contended with since the flood. Many families struggle to successfully apply for money because they do not have access to a computer, she says, or do not have all the paperwork they need, or can't take time off from work to meet with a FEMA representative.
Payton says wealthier families are more able to comply with the rigid application requirements. ""There shouldn't be a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all template,"" she says. ""You've got to make adjustments based on the vulnerabilities and the needs of the families. And that's not what we do.""
Those application requirements are not explicitly designed to favor some citizens over others. Under the 1988 federal disaster relief law, the requirements exist to protect taxpayers from fraudulent or improper payouts after a storm, by keeping track of who has been given money for what.
But Payton says the upshot in Houston is that the more affluent parts of the city have recovered more quickly and deeply since the flood. Private insurance accounts for some of that, but Payton also believes residents in those areas have been more successful at getting federal money.
""Those families who are more apt to be able to respond to that [funding] will do so quickly, will do so more efficiently and the funds will be available on a first come, first serve basis,"" she says. Families who cannot, she says, ""will be left behind again.""
Football players gather at C.E. King High School. Perry-Evans' younger son is on the team. After the family was displaced by the flood, Perry-Evans needed to use the $2,500 she had received from FEMA for a car because they were living more than 45 minutes away.
Claire Harbage/NPR
A new and growing body of research backs up Payton's observations. Studies by sociologists, as well as climate scientists, urban planners and economists, suggest that disasters, and the federal aid that follows, disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans. The same is also true along racial lines, with white communities benefiting disproportionately.
""Cities are often very unequal to begin with,"" says James Elliott, a sociologist at Rice University. ""They're segregated and there are lots of income disparities, but what seems to happen after natural hazards hit is these things become exacerbated.""
""We see these same patterns of wealth inequality being exacerbated in communities that receive more FEMA aid,"" explains sociologist Junia Howell of the University of Pittsburgh. Howell and Elliott have published multiple studies that find a pattern in who wins and who loses after floods and other disasters: Rich people get richer after a storm, and poor people get poorer.
""That's particularly true along racial lines, along lines of education, as well as homeownership versus renting,"" explains Howell. And rather than mitigating the inequity, federal aid exacerbates it, in part because of the biases Payton has noticed that are baked into how federal money is distributed.
NPR examined one federal disaster program and found evidence of exactly that phenomenon. The program uses federal and local money to purchase homes that have flooded or been affected by other natural disasters and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
The buyouts are voluntary, and the homeowner can use the money to move to a safer place. As climate change drives more extreme rain, David Maurstad of FEMA says he expects the program to grow more in the coming years.
But buyouts have disproportionately gone to whiter communities. NPR analyzed records of about 40,000 property buyouts funded by FEMA and state and local governments and found that most of them were in neighborhoods that were more than 85 percent white and non-Hispanic. (For context, the nation as a whole is 62 percent white/non-Hispanic, and disasters affect communities of all demographics.)

A Tale of Two Cities
Hurricane Harvey in Houston was a cataclysmic event. But more extreme rainfall is falling all over the United States, and that means more flooding. The trend will continue in the coming years, and so will the need for disaster relief programs and programs designed to mitigate damage. But even when those programs work as designed, NPR has found that inequality persists.
More than 1,500 miles northeast of Houston, two towns show how disaster relief efforts are determined and who wins and who loses in the calculation.
Manville, N.J., an hour outside Manhattan, has flooded repeatedly since the 1970s. On a recent tour, Superintendent of Schools Robert Beers drove over a bridge and into a neighborhood called Lost Valley, a suburban enclave of Cape Cod-style homes built in a compact grid along the Raritan River.
The numbers spray-painted on the front of this house in the Lost Valley neighborhood in Manville, N.J., indicate that it was bought as part of a federal disaster program. The program uses federal and local money to purchase houses that have flooded multiple times and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""This area was hit the hardest,"" he says. ""And as we drive through you're going to be able to see a lot of vacant homes, and areas that were bulldozed. Some of these open, these vacant lots here, there were homes here.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. A drop in household incomes followed, and home values lagged behind nearby towns.
""After the first flood, people began thinking, 'Is it time to get out?' "" says Eleanor Nieliwocki, who lived in Lost Valley for more than 30 years. ""After the second flood, not again. And the third flood, we've had it."" She finalized the sale of her house to a government buyout in 2015.
""We've had to cut programs; class sizes have grown; and, quite frankly, we haven't been able to offer the supports that our students so desperately need,"" said Robert Beers, the superintendent of Manville School District.
Claire Harbage/NPR
And buyouts like Nieliwocki's matter to Beers. All those vacant lots affect how much money his schools get. Fewer homes overall mean less tax revenue to fund education. Last year, Manville's public school system found itself battling large budget shortfalls. At the same time, Beers says, the schools faced new demands: Since 1999's Hurricane Floyd, Manville's Hispanic population had risen from 5 percent to 23 percent.
""Nearly 30 percent of our students speak only Spanish at home, so we need to fund additional positions to transition these children and provide them with the services they need,"" Beers said last spring. (By summer, after an intense lobbying effort, Beers was able to get the state government to increase funding for Manville's schools.)
And even though the buyouts in Manville hurt the tax base, FEMA says the strategy actually saves money in the long run. The agency says for every dollar spent on buyouts and other hazard mitigation programs, federal taxpayers save $6 in future disaster losses. The agency has allocated more than $15 billion on those strategies since 1989.
Students walk through the hallways of Manville High School between class periods. Fewer homes have meant fewer tax dollars to fund education, and the public school system has found itself battling large budget shortfalls.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""I think our program is achieving in Manville what it's intended to achieve,"" says Maurstad, who oversees FEMA's buyout program. He says FEMA is meeting its goals if it makes a community less risky, saves property and potentially saves lives.
And he points out that while FEMA pays 75 percent of the cost to buy out homes in disaster-prone areas, states and localities decide where they want those buyouts to occur, so demographic changes aren't on the federal agency's radar.
""I'm not aware that there's been a specific study by FEMA or anyone else on the demographic distribution of [the buyout] approach,"" says Maurstad. ""But the approach itself is not one that would necessarily, intentionally lead to those outcomes.""

Reeling from repeated floods, Manville asked the Army Corps of Engineers to build a flood control system to protect it. In 2016, the Corps said no.
Catherine Kling, an economist at Cornell University, studies the kind of benefit-cost analysis the Corps does to decide which property is worth saving. ""The whole idea of a benefit-cost analysis is actually very simple,"" Kling says. ""It simply seeks to answer the question: If we do this project, is the total value from this project greater than the total costs?""
That means that protecting 10 families in $1 million houses has the same value as protecting 100 families in $100,000 houses.
In Manville, the Corps counted about 500 homes and businesses in flood zones and said it could protect them for about $67 million. But for every dollar spent on the project, only 40 cents' worth of property would be saved. Under federal guidelines, that's not enough.
""It is completely agnostic as to who receives those benefits and those costs,"" says Kling. And, she says, economists assume the people displaced and the economic activity they generate will simply move somewhere else.

Claire Harbage/NPR
Still, even if the approach is designed to avoid picking winners and losers, it ends up doing so anyway, favoring wealthier neighborhoods. ""It's also going to be [choosing] more valuable businesses,"" Kling says. ""More valuable real estate.""
Indeed, if there were a climate change lottery with public funding as the prize, you could say Bound Brook, N.J., just 4 miles from Manville, hit the jackpot: a sweeping, $650 million flood control project whose local portion was completed in 2016. Developers followed, investing tens of millions of dollars.
In Bound Brook, on a very different tour around town last summer, Councilman Abel Gomez detailed plans for hundreds of upscale apartments, new restaurants and an expanded Main Street. ""Without flood control,"" he said, ""you were always the next natural disaster before you were wiped out.""

But some residents worry how they will afford to live there once the new projects are completed. Bound Brook has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Costa Ricans enough that the country's president visited in 2014 and a history of alleged housing discrimination. The Justice Department sued the town in 2004, saying its housing policies discriminated against Latinos, and for years its housing and development practices were regulated by a consent decree. In 2017, a local government analysis found that households in the most heavily Latino neighborhoods had lower incomes and spent a greater portion of their incomes on housing than those in the majority-white area.
Some of the newer apartments are already renting for hundreds more than the town's median rent.
Francisco Morales Mora, who emigrated from Costa Rica in 1994 and owns a restaurant downtown, says that's too much. ""The people of Bound Brook are poor,"" he says. ""And unless the new [apartments] are cheaper, people will leave.""
Francisco Morales Mora, a Costa Rican immigrant, owns a restaurant called Frank's in downtown Bound Brook. Morales says more development in town, fueled by feelings of relative safety from floods, will be good for business and make the town more vibrant. But he worries about affordability.

Robert Greco, the project's manager for the Corps, says the flood control project in and around Bound Brook protects a highly dense area with a range of income levels. He says it isn't intended to favor the wealthy but acknowledges that the project is changing the area.
""The Borough of Bound Brook is not wealthy,"" Greco says. ""But guess what, now they're building and the economic vitality is picking up, and it's beautiful, actually.""
Pressed on what the new, expensive development plan might mean for the Latino community, Gomez, the councilman, says, ""We really, really hope that the Latino identity that's here remains here. ... Because that's key to this. It sets us apart.""

The bigger picture around the country is that some Americans will be more vulnerable and some will be more resilient in the face of climate change. And who wins and who loses appears to mirror existing inequalities.
""Hardworking Americans who are working class are going to find their communities stressed even more than they are now,"" says Andrew Light, an editor of the 2018 National Climate Assessment. ""If you're already a community at risk, you're going to be at more risk.""
In Houston, the Papadopouloses have applied for a buyout and are likely to be offered one if they wait long enough. It may take years. 
Janice Perry-Evans and her family are still in their rental but, ""It is really a struggle now to stay afloat,"" she says. She plans to file for bankruptcy.
And in Manville, even as the Army Corps of Engineers declined to build a flood control project, it predicted that ""significant flooding can result in municipal infrastructure damage, loss of jobs, and closure of businesses,"" as well as ""continued potential for loss of life.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. This house in Lost Valley was bought out.

Elijah Wolfson,"On July 27, 2014, monsoon rains hit the sister cities of Nogales, Arizona, in the US, and Nogales, Sonora, in Mexico. As the rain poured down, floodwaters rushed west of the Mariposa Port of Entry, clogging a 60-foot section of the border fence with debris. The bollard-style fence, with posts buried at least 7 feet underground, had been designed to let water pass through, but the intensity of the flooding and the size of the debris, which included tree trunks, toppled it. Lllew Mejia/Daniel Wolfe for Quartz For longtime Nogales residents on both sides of the border, the incident felt like déjà vu. Six years earlier, monsoon rains had flooded the downtown Nogales, Sonora, a city of about 210,000, trapping merchants in their stores, causing $8 million worth of damage, and drowning two people. That time, too, the culprit was border infrastructure. In the 1990s, US Border Patrol had built a series of steel walls between the two Nogales towns to deter illegal activity. But traffickers simply began using the drainage tunnels between the towns to get into the United States. The agency then installed grates in the tunnels, but traffickers cut through them. In the escalating arms race, Border Patrol finally constructed a 5-foot-high concrete wall in one of the tunnels. In 2008, monsoon floodwaters built up behind the wall, collapsing the tunnel on the Mexican side. Floods on the Mexico side of the border between Nogales, Sonora, and Nogales, Arizona, have been devastating in the recent past. Until the 2008 floods, the International Boundary Water Commission (IBWC)—the binational agency that carries out the provisions of US-Mexico water treaties—had no idea that Border Patrol had plugged up a tunnel the commission had built to mitigate flooding. Border Patrol refused to take responsibility. Over the years, border walls and fences have exacerbated flooding in both the US and Mexico. Environmental advocates and local activists in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas now fear their communities will also face increased risk of flooding as a result of new segments of border wall planned for the region. In March, Congress allocated $1.6 billion for border enforcement, including $641 million for border-wall construction in the Valley. Of the 33 miles of fencing and walls planned, the agency expects to build 25 miles of what are called levee walls—12-foot high concrete wall with 18-foot bollards on top—in Hidalgo County, as well as 8 miles of bollard walls in adjacent Starr County. “The Rio Grande Valley isn’t really a valley, it’s a delta,” says Melinda Melo, an organizer for the No Border Wall Coalition. “There are flooding risks here in the same sort of way as in Nogales.” Lllew Mejia/Daniel Wolfe for Quartz In 2006, the arid sister cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, experienced the wettest monsoon period on record, receiving about three-fourths of their average annual precipitation in one week. The heavy, sustained rains resulted in flooding in both towns. The flooding in Juarez was particularly severe, with losses totaling $600 million (pdf). El Paso suffered $200 million in damages. Geographers believe the disparate impact was at least in part a result of debris clogging the Mexico side of the grates that Border Patrol had installed in tunnels. In 2007, officials with the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona (a US National Park) warned border authorities that a planned 5-mile segment of fence to be built along the park’s southern border would impede the movement of water in the flash flood-prone washes that traverse the international border. Construction was completed in 2008. Sure enough, that same year, debris stacked up behind the fence, acting like a dam and pushing water into nearby private businesses and the port of entry at Lukeville, Arizona. Flooding on the Mexico side of the international bridge between Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua in 2008. The US Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol’s parent agency, promised to upgrade the fences to let water through; the design would prevent flooding, the agency said. But in 2011 floodwaters were so strong they knocked a segment of fence over again. Environmental advocates expect that the 25 miles of levee walls planned for Hidalgo County will worsen flooding in Mexico. During floods, waters that rise up the side of the levee can dissipate on the other side, but advocates fear that water will be dammed by the concrete and metal structure planned for the top of the wall, causing flooding. Lllew Mejia/Daniel Wolfe for Quartz Additionally, if a J uly 2018 map of proposed border construction from Border Patrol is accurate and overlaps with a similar map from 2017, the 8 miles of bollard walls planned for Starr County intrude into a floodplain. In 2010, then-IBWC commissioner Edward Drusina told Border Patrol officials that modelling showed (pdf) construction of border walls in Starr County would result in “substantial increases in water surface elevations and deflections of flow.” “There’ve been severe rains already in McAllen and Brownsville”—two towns in south Texas—”just in the last few months,” said Laiken Jordahl, a borderlands campaigner with the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, in July. “Rains of that volume will almost certainly be backed up by this style of border wall.” IBWC and Border Patrol have long been at odds over border infrastructure. Border Patrol’s priority has been to embrace anything believed to deter illegal crossings. Congress has frequently weaponized that mission. In 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act, which allowed the secretary of Homeland Security to waive dozens of laws that stood in the way of building a border wall. The Bush administration used that authority to clear the way for 654 miles of fencing across the US-Mexico border. In 2010, when Border Patrol wanted to build about 14 miles of bollard fences in Roma, Rio Grande City, and Los Ebanos (all in Texas), the IBWC initially opposed the plans, citing the increased risk of flooding and loss of life, both in those cities and in their sister cities on the Mexican side. The US half of IBWC is bound by a 1970 treaty (pdf) that prohibits taking actions that would worsen the risk of flooding in Mexico. Border Patrol persisted in pressuring IBWC to issue what it called a “unilateral decision” to approve the border wall construction. The agency hired Baker Engineering, a global consulting firm that contracted with the federal government to build the border wall, to develop a new model that posited only 10% to 25% of floodwater would be blocked by the fencing and concluded the infrastructure wouldn’t result in severe flooding. The same firm a year before had concluded there would in fact be “noteworthy floodplain impacts from the fence.” Eventually, the US side of the IBWC caved in to Border Patrol’s demands and, in 2012, the water agency gave the go-ahead for construction. Those sections were ultimately never built due to a lack of funds. The IBWC’s Mexican counterparts were not pleased with the US officials’ capitulation. They wrote (pdf) that the fence represented “a clear obstruction of the Rio Grande hydraulic area” and that it would “cause the deflection of [storm] flows towards the Mexican side.” Now the Trump administration has revived the possibility of building the sections of border wall that were a point of contention between IBWC and Border Patrol in 2011. Landowners and activist group in the Valley have been served notices by Border Patrol in the last few months about the agency’s plans and some have received condemnation letters with offers of money for access to their property. In response to protest by a coalition of environmental and human rights groups, the agency extended the comment period by 30 days earlier this month But the agency still hasn’t held a single public meeting about the wall in the Valley and hasn’t sent out notices in Spanish even though the vast majority of Valley residents are Hispanic. Meanwhile, Mexican officials with the IBWC are wary of the latest round of proposed construction, too. In April 2017, the chief engineer with the Mexican section of the IBWC, Antonio Rascón, told NPR that Mexico is “not in agreement with construction of a wall in the floodplain that affects the transborder flow of water.” “We’ve seen lots of pressure by Homeland Security so that this project moves forward,” he said. “But the kind of wall they’re planning would have drastic effects on transborder water flows.”",US Border Patrol has a history of building infrastructure that exacerbates flooding.

CBS/AP,"MCALLEN, Texas -- Federal authorities have awarded a $145 million contract to a Texas company to build 6 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said Friday that SLSCO will begin construction of an 18-foot reinforced concrete levee wall in February in the agency's McAllen Station region. The company will also increase the height of existing fences. It will be the first section of President Donald Trump's border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The government recently completed construction of a 2-mile, 30-foot tall section of fencing along the border in California. Mr. Trump has been ramping up anti-immigration rhetoric heading into Tuesday's midterm elections and has ordered troops to the border to meet a caravan of Central American migrants slowly traveling through Mexico. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump's plan to send troops to the southern border, dismissing criticism that the move is motivated by politics ahead of the midterm elections. ""We've made clear to them they need to undertake every effort they can to stop this illegal migration from entering the United States, and the president's made very clear they will not be permitted to enter our country unlawfully,"" Pompeo said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. He disputed that Mr. Trump's emphasis on hardening his immigration policies in recent weeks was aimed at rallying his base. ""I've been involved in scores of conversations about stopping illegal immigration from Mexico and never once has there been a discussion of the political impact in U.S. domestic politics,"" Pompeo said.

"by Lisa Song, ProPublica, and Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting","In the last days of April 2011, the mayor of Cairo, Illinois, told residents to get out. A spring flood had grown out of control, and the low-lying city of 2,800 at the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers was fighting for its life. Water poured from the sky and bubbled up from the ground like miniature geysers. It leaked through the levee system, giant earthen and concrete walls built to protect the city from flooding, as hundreds pushed their bodies against sandbags to shore it up, including inmates from a nearby prison, residents who chose to ignore the evacuation order and even children. Emergency managers passed out life vests. If the levees fell, there would be nowhere to run from the wall of water. The Army Corps of Engineers had a procedure, written into law, to spare Cairo this level of danger. But it kept delaying. The plan called for activating something called a floodway, a pocket of land across the river that the Corps could legally flood to relieve the pressure on Cairo’s levees. Once water on the river gauge at Cairo rose to 61 feet — or got close enough to threaten devastation — the Corps was supposed to blow up the levee that protected the floodway. How the Army Corps’ Hesitation Nearly Destroyed a City See a day-by-day reconstruction of one critical week in 2011 and how delays and indecision cost millions in avoidable damage. When the Corps dedicated the floodway in 1928, it was a swampy patch of timberland on the Missouri side of the border, which farmers and loggers were just starting to transform. Property owners accepted a one-time payment of roughly $17 per acre for the government’s right to flood their land. In the eight decades that followed, it became some of the most fertile farmland in the state, home to more than 200 people. Now, as the water rose in Cairo, those farmers argued their land was too valuable to sacrifice — especially for Cairo. The plan to protect Cairo was drawn up when it was a prosperous, highly valued place — the “ crown jewel ” of the region with “lavish antebellum homes,” according to former Corps historian Charles Camillo. But by 2011, it was a poor, predominantly black city with a crumbling downtown. “I’ve been there. Trust me. … Have you been to Cairo?” asked Rep. Steve Tilley, Missouri’s Republican House speaker. “OK, then you know what I’m saying then.” (He would later apologize for the “insensitive” remark.) As the water rose, congressional representatives for the Missouri farmers were writing to President Barack Obama and arranging for them to speak to Corps leadership. The Missouri attorney general filed a lawsuit to stop the floodway from getting activated. The farmers even had a seat on the river commission that would decide their fate. The Corps ultimately detonated the levee to activate the floodway, but not before causing millions of dollars in unnecessary damage to Cairo and surrounding communities, according to a report from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. That report is echoed by the engineer for Alexander County, whose seat is Cairo, and city residents who said the agency’s delay led to the flooding of many rural homes and farmland on the Illinois side of the river that could have been saved if they’d opened the floodway sooner. The Corps’ job is to manage the flood risk posed by rivers, but in this case, it made the damage worse. An analysis of the timeline by ProPublica and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting shows how Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh, the Corps official in charge, missed several opportunities to act sooner, going against his own advisers. At one point, Walsh held off on a key step because it would “create a stir with the public, the press and politicians,” according to a report Camillo wrote that serves as the Corps’ historic account of the flood.

Several hundred residents have left since then. (Darren Hauck for Reveal News) Walsh left the Corps in 2013. Through a spokesperson at his current employer, a consulting firm, he said he no longer represents the Corps and directed questions to the agency. When ProPublica and Reveal asked the Corps about the timing of activating the floodway, a spokeswoman said the agency’s deliberations were about the preparation of the floodway — not whether Walsh would ultimately pull the trigger. She did not address allegations that the delay stemmed from Cairo’s demographics and lack of political clout, or how the Cairo region sustained unnecessary damage. Phillip Matthews, a pastor, community activist and chair of the Democratic Party in Alexander County, said he’s certain the Corps wouldn’t have stalled for a wealthier, whiter city. The military is “normally big on policy and procedure,” Matthews said. “So why did those rules not apply to the blacks in this city? … We didn’t even have the protection of something that was on the books.” The Scientific Plan Since the 1800s, the Corps has protected riverfront communities by building levees — earthen or concrete walls designed to confine rising water to a river’s banks. But during floods, all that water needs to go somewhere. Because levees constrict rivers, they make floodwaters flow faster and harder onto communities not equally protected. In 1927, the Corps got a lesson on this when a flood in the Mississippi River Valley made refugees of half a million people and killed more than 1,000. With the Flood Control Act of 1928, the Corps diversified its solutions. It designed a federal system of levees, dams, reservoirs, floodways and control structures to reduce flooding from Missouri to Louisiana. Known as the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project, the system is meant to withstand the worst probable floods, but only with the extra capacity the four floodways provided. To protect Cairo and surrounding communities on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River, the Corps set aside 130,000 acres between the Missouri communities of Bird’s Point and New Madrid to serve as a floodway. When the Corps first had to activate the floodway in 1937, government planes flew overhead, dropping pamphlets warning people to leave before the Corps broke the levee with dynamite. Farmers sued afterward, and courts ruled the Corps had been within its rights to flood their land. In the 1990s, the agency briefly considered buying all the land in the floodway and leasing it back to residents at their own risk. The payments would have been an explicit reminder of the ever-looming threat. But the Corps decided the more than $200 million price tag was too high. The Wait When the river began climbing in late April 2011, it was the first time the Corps had to seriously consider using the floodway since it blew up the levee in 1937. The Cairo gauge reached 49.8 feet on April 21, and a worst-case scenario forecast predicted it would exceed 61 feet in early May, enough to cross the red line that called for detonation. Walsh had the authority to blow up the levee at 58 feet, if the levees in the Corps’ flood control system deteriorated quickly. Cairo’s floodwall protects the city from the Ohio River. The markings show historic flood crests and how high they reached on the floodwall. (Darren Hauck for Reveal News) As president of the Mississippi River Commission, Walsh had the final say. The other six members of the commission, a powerful group of presidential appointees that oversees navigation and flood control along the river, advised Walsh throughout. One of them, R.D. James, owned land in the floodway. Generations of his family’s wealth was bound to that corner of Missouri. As the flooding worsened, neighbors kept asking him for updates about the fate of their land. By April 27, floodway residents were ordered to evacuate. The Corps loaded explosives onto barges and sent them to Hickman, Kentucky. If the order came for final floodway preparations, it would take several hours to reach the part of the levee where the explosives would be pumped into the embankment. Farmers in the floodway weren’t about to let that happen, and they had politicians on their side. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster sued the Corps, citing the area’s more than 90 homes, 200 residents and crops with “significant economic value.” Koster’s lawsuit said the Corps had “abused their discretion” by sticking to the floodway plan, because the agency hadn’t accounted for the relative change in property values. Jo Ann Emerson, the farmers’ congresswoman, hosted a town hall and brought Walsh to answer the farmers’ questions. “I recognize all of your livelihoods will be impacted, Walsh told the room, “but when it gets to 61 feet, these levees have never been under this kind of pressure before.” Get ProPublica’s Top Stories by Email Across the river in Cairo, Mayor Judson Childs wondered what was taking so long. “The city of Cairo is on the verge of being the next 9th Ward of New Orleans,” he warned. “It’s a shame that anyone would argue that saving farmland in a designated floodway is more important than saving lives.” It wasn’t just politicians and farmers. Some in the press characterized it as a tough call between saving the people of Cairo versus homes and farmland in the floodway. ABC News called it an “excruciating dilemma.” UPI presented Cairo’s concerns about becoming another 9th Ward next to a farmer who said he would be left with “nothing” if the Corps acted. And an April 27 editorial in the Chicago Tribune said Childs had exaggerated the risks, because Cairo’s residents still had time to evacuate. The editorial ran a day before a massive sand boil — a surge of sediment and pressurized water — erupted behind the floodwall that stands between Cairo and the Ohio River. It meant the floodwall was weakening, and crews from the Corps worked all night to stabilize it, as other “mega boils” emerged. When Walsh toured the site, he told a reporter it was the largest sand boil he’d ever seen. Cairo wasn’t the only place at risk; according to Corps designs, 2.5 million acres of land on both sides of the river would be safe if the floodway were opened. The levees in Fulton County, Kentucky, had so many sand boils that the area became “ a sloppy mess.” Some parts of Alexander County had no levees at all and were simply swamped.

Walsh informed Nixon on May 2 that the agency would open the floodway. (Jeff Roberson/AP Photo) Over the next few days, senior Corps officials urged Walsh at least three times to pipe the explosives into the levee or otherwise accelerate the timeline. Each time, he held off just a little longer. At one point, he declined a suggestion to move the barges to the levee, as it would draw too much attention, Camillo wrote. The last warning came the morning of May 1. Col. Vernie Reichling told Walsh the crew handling the explosives had less than 24 hours to load the pipes before the river would rise so high they wouldn’t be able to work safely. Walsh decided to wait and asked for another briefing in five hours. “Col. Reichling appeared shocked, perhaps even angry, that Walsh denied his recommendation,” Camillo recalled in his report. “His jaws clenched; his face reddened.” When the group reconvened that afternoon, Walsh went around the room. Reichling said they were behind schedule. According to the Corps’ floodway procedures, the explosives should have been fully loaded by the time the river reached 60 feet, but the agency hadn’t even started by then. One of the last people Walsh consulted was James, the farmer who “personified every single person who lived or owned property in the floodway.” James “looked forlorn,” his shoulders slumped, according to Camillo’s account. He told Walsh he would support whatever the general decided. Walsh gave the go-ahead, but thunderstorms and lightning delayed the process until the next morning. By the time the levee was prepped and ready to go, it was 10 p.m. on May 2. The water was 61.7 feet high. Loud booms announced the explosions, and a wave as tall as a house poured through the breach and into the floodway. The Aftermath When the levee blew, the river dropped nearly half a foot in an hour. Cairo’s “entire floodwall and levee system was very close to failure,” said a 2015 study on how the flood affected Cairo’s levee system. “Failure would have resulted in 6.7 m (22 feet) of water covering the city of Cairo at a time when 2,900 people living in Cairo had yet to be evacuated.” Though Cairo’s levees survived the test, surrounding communities weren’t so lucky. The Len Small levee northwest of the city collapsed half a day before the Corps opened the floodway. “As far as the rest of Alexander County, I know 100 families that flooded the last day or two,” County Engineer Jeff Denny said. “There were people that flooded that didn’t have to.” Flooding near Wyatt, Missouri, on May 3, 2011, after the Army Corps blew up the levee that protects the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) Water levels in south Alexander County “were directly affected by the timing of the operation of the” floodway, said a 2012 report from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The report concluded that millions of dollars in flood damages could have been prevented. If the Corps had opened the floodway when the river was a foot lower, 41 fewer structures would have flooded, out of nearly 200 total. At 2 feet lower, the county would have avoided more than a million dollars in building-related damages. Camillo, now executive director of the Mississippi River Commission, said the Corps’ floodway procedures aren’t set in stone. The thresholds include flexibility to account for factors such as weather forecasts and how fast the river is rising. He said he understands the frustrations of Cairo residents, but the city’s value wasn’t a factor. Nor was the lawsuit from the Missouri attorney general, which ended when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, leaving the ruling in the Corps’ favor. Walsh’s decisions were based solely on the river and levee conditions, Camillo said. Tyrone Coleman, Cairo’s current mayor, said that he’s grateful the city’s levees held, and that neighboring communities might have been spared if the Corps had acted sooner. But he said the agency was in a difficult situation, and “there is no way I would blame the Corps” for what happened. The agency has repaired the city’s levees, and loaned it pumps to deal with drainage. But Cairo is struggling to pay for maintenance work needed to keep its drainage system working well. It’s also struggling in general, facing a public housing crisis. Last year, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson called Cairo a “dying community.” Across the river in the floodway, the farmers have rebounded far more quickly.

Less than 1 percent of the farmland was permanently damaged, according to University of Missouri Extension agronomist Sam Atwell. “The land itself came out better than we thought,” Atwell told the Columbia Missourian. He estimated that about half the farmers had crop insurance, and a 2013 paper said residents successfully planted 100,000 acres of soybeans and wheat that year after the water drained away. Even so, they’ve argued in court that the government should compensate them for their losses. Their position was backed up by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling on another flood-related case. Last fall, President Donald Trump appointed James, Walsh’s former colleague on the river commission, to lead the Corps’ civil works division, which oversees levees and other infrastructure. A ProPublica/Reveal review of property records shows James and his family own 3,000 acres in New Madrid County, with at least 800 acres within the floodway. According to his financial disclosure forms, the net assets of James and his wife — including farmland, rental income, family trusts and a cotton gin — are worth at least $9.4 million. James now oversees a system that is interconnected, in which choices involving upstream reservoirs and other features could factor into whether the floodway gets used. In federal ethics paperwork, he says he’s recused himself from decisions that affect his farm. James’ office didn’t respond to a list of questions about potential conflicts of interest, except to say that the person in charge of floodway activation is the current president of the river commission, not James. “You have to really question why they would put someone with this kind of financial interest in charge,” said Virginia Canter, a former ethics lawyer in the Obama and Clinton White Houses. (Canter is now chief ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that’s suing Trump over alleged illegal payments from foreign governments to Trump’s businesses.) Ethics experts said the true test of James’ conflicts won’t come until the next catastrophic flood. He could seek an ethics waiver, as other government officials recently have, which would allow him to be involved in decisions affecting his farm. The Invisible Chapter While wealthier landowners farming in the floodway had a chance to plead their case to the Corps during the 2011 flood, residents of the tiny town of Pinhook didn’t get that chance. Pinhook was founded in the 1940s by African-American sharecroppers. The floodway was the only place they could get anyone to sell them land, and they made the most of the opportunity, building homes, a general store and a Baptist church. Its population reached 250 by the 1960s. The town shrank as children grew up and moved away; by 2011, fewer than 50 people lived there. A home in Pinhook, Missouri. When the Army Corps opened the floodway, the town was destroyed and its residents have struggled to recover. (Darren Hauck for Reveal News) When the waters rose that April, they packed what they could and fled days before the levee blew. They saw their homes in aerial footage on television, covered in water up to the rooftops. When they returned, whole rooms had been warped by floodwater, fan blades drooping from ceilings like the petals of dead flowers. In the weeks that followed, their buildings were looted, stripped of wiring and burned. Today, there’s little to suggest there was a town where Pinhook stood. Weeds grow in the cracked foundations. Utility lines have been subsumed by thick vines. Debra Robinson Tarver was the mayor of Pinhook in 2011. After the flood, Tarver spent years in limbo. She finally got a house this year. (Darren Hauck for Reveal News) Its former residents return just once a year, on what they call Pinhook Day, an annual homecoming held on Memorial Day weekend. This year, Debra Robinson Tarver, whose grandfather co-founded the town, greeted them; she was mayor when Pinhook was destroyed. Unlike the other floodway farmers, Pinhook residents decided not to sue, feeling a lawsuit would be a longshot and eat up money they didn’t have. Tarver tried to re-establish the town on higher ground, with money from a federal grant and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and donated labor from the Mennonite Disaster Service volunteers. After seven years in limbo, Tarver and a handful of other Pinhook residents moved into homes in and just outside Sikeston, Missouri, this April. Everyone else who lived in Pinhook has either died or moved away. Tarver wishes the Corps would have done more to acknowledge what Pinhook lost when the agency activated the floodway. “I felt that they should have stepped up to the plate and said, ‘OK, we did this, we’re sorry for what we’ve done,’” she said. “That didn’t happen.” While the Corps’ official history makes note of James, and the perspective of white farmers in the floodway, it does not mention Pinhook. Camillo, who wrote it, said he was preoccupied with following the agency’s top officials as the crisis unfolded. Their itinerary, evidently, did not include a visit to the only town in the floodway. “For Pinhook people especially, it’s almost like they never existed,” said Todd Lawrence, an English professor at the University of St. Thomas, who co-published an oral history about Pinhook intended to help correct its absence from the official Corps record. On Pinhook Day, there was singing and praying. Children got four-wheeler tours to learn about what the place once was. A message resonated through the day: We existed. “This is my grandparents’ yard,” said Marcus Williams, a young man standing quietly beside a cooler full of soda. “This is where I was raised.”","by Lisa Song, ProPublica, and Patrick Michels, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting In the last days of April 2011, the mayor of Cairo, Illinois, told residents to get out.

Community fights over levee heights on the Upper Mississippi River are particularly heated because the region has seen increased flooding in recent years. Levees are permanent earthen barriers designed to protect low areas from rising floodwaters. Higher levees protect farms and towns behind them but can cause greater flooding across the river, downstream or even upstream.
In a 2016 survey of levees along a stretch of the Mississippi River, 40% of levees, located on both sides of the river, were higher than authorized.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed roughly 200 miles of levees along the Mississippi in 2016 and found that levee heights along 80 miles, or 40%, were higher than authorized by federal law.
Levees were found to be too high in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois. Of the 10 levees that were up to 4 feet too high, the Sny district, located in Illinois near Hannibal, Mo., accounted for three, covering 30 to 40 miles.
Levees are usually built and maintained by local authorities known as levee districts under supervision or approval from various federal agencies. In recent years, some districts have raised levees to prepare for floods but not lowered them afterward, according to an Army Corps official.
Levees along the Mississippi date to the late 19th century, when they were built to protect crops and businesses as well as people from waterborne diseases following floods. In recent decades, disputes have arisen in part because not knowing the exact heights of levees makes it difficult to plan for flood emergencies.
David Stokes, executive director of the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, said uncertainty about levee heights has inspired this constant arms race among districts to raise their levees higher to offer protection.
A spokeswoman for FEMA said the agency has been working with the state of Illinois and the Army Corps of Engineers to determine the best way to address the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance concerns. 
Mike Reed, superintendent of the Sny district, said the districts levees were approved in 2004 by FEMA, with involvement of the Army Corps, to protect against a 100-year-flood, or a flood with a chance of occurring once every 100 years. The designation allows landowners to qualify for lower flood-insurance premiums and determines standards for building development. 
We complied with all the regulations and all the processes that were in place when we received our accreditation in 2004, Mr. Reed said.
The Army Corps, one of the agencies with oversight of the national levee system, disagrees with the Sny districts interpretation and has already removed it from a federal program that helps cover the cost of repairing levees damaged during flooding.
Scott Whitney, flood-risk manager with the Army Corps Rock Island District, which includes the Sny, said the Army Corps, FEMA and the three states involved have been in discussions to try to resolve the situation.
Its a complex situation. Its politically charged, and public safety is at the center of it, said Mr. Whitney.
Mike Klingner, chairman of the Upper Mississippi, Illinois &amp; Missouri Rivers Association, which represents levee districts, said the Sny district and others want to maintain their FEMA certification for reduced flood insurance.
The association is pushing for a plan for the Upper Mississippi that would call for some increased levee heights as well as agreements with districts to take on water during certain flood conditions. The plan hasnt received federal approval.
What were trying to do is prevent future disasters, he said. We all ought to be working together.
Some landowners, however, oppose the plan. Water is on our land longer, saturating our land and that can make a difference between getting your crop in or not, said Nancy Guyton, whose family farms land in Missouri across from the Sny district.
She is part of a group of Missouri landowners called Neighbors of the Mississippi, which is also fighting the higher levees. She also supports action by FEMA. FEMA could put a stop to this, and theyre not, she said.
In Hannibal, city manager Jeff LaGarce has some concern about higher levee heights. But the city has a floodwall, and he hasnt taken a position in the fight. From a municipal standpoint, I dont know whos right and whos wrong, he said.

Erica Gies,"When people need more water, they often build dams to increase supply. But can dams increase water use in an unsustainable way, leading communities to live beyond their water means? That appears to often be the case, according to the authors of a recent paper in Nature Sustainability.
Las Vegas is a textbook case. Decades ago the population was projected to reach 400,000 by 2000, so the city built a pipeline to tap into Lake Mead, a reservoir created by Hoover Dam. The population ballooned nearly four times higher than anticipated. Reservoirs can indeed create a “false sense of abundance” in places where “the natural water availability does not fit the population it’s hosting,” says Newsha Ajami, director of urban water policy at Stanford University, who was not involved with the work.
Dams or other water-supply infrastructure such as desalination plants can also make communities less resilient because they mask droughts, says the paper’s lead author, Giuliano Di Baldassarre, a professor of hydrology at Uppsala University in Sweden. Communities may be less likely to reduce their water use until shortages get dire, forcing a sharp reckoning. It’s similar to the way in which a levee protects an area from small floods, encouraging development in the floodplain, making people newly vulnerable to big floods.
Rather than build dams, the authors recommend reducing consumption. That may sound like common sense, but a dam-building boom is underway in developing countries. Conservation can be a significant source of water “supply.” In the U.S. the EPA estimates Americans can use 20 percent less water just by installing water-efficient fixtures and appliances. Nationwide, leaks in U.S. households lose 900 billion gallons of water annually, equal to the consumption of nearly 11 million homes. That doesn’t include leaks in municipal systems.
Another alternative is to capture rain where it falls, rather than rushing it out of a city. Dry areas are increasingly turning to this tactic. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power captures about 29,000 acre-feet of stormwater annually and is aiming for up to 143,000 acre-feet per year by 2035 That would be enough to supply about 286,000 homes.
Reusing water, whether for toilet flushing, irrigation, industry or drinking is a large potential resource. For example, in 2009 California reused about 0.7 million acre-feet of recycled water—about 13 percent of the wastewater generated. A 2014 analysis by the Pacific Institutean independent global water think tank in California, estimated the state’s potential was at least an additional 1.2 million to 1.8 million acre-feet per year. California, along with Arizona and Singapore, are leaders in water reuse. But many places have not begun to tap this resource.
Conservation can have huge impacts. Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego and Albuquerque would not be the significant cities they are today without water supplied by large reservoirs. Yet water use in the Southwest has remained flat since the 1980s, despite rising populations—just as it has across the U.S., thanks to efficiency measures. This phenomenon may happen when people achieve a certain average income, according to John Fleck, director of The University of New Mexico Water Resources Program who was not affiliated with the study.
Globally, however, annual water demand has continued to rise—from 650 cubic kilometers in 1980 to 1,000 cubic kilometers in 2010. “This is driven by emerging economies,” Di Baldassarre says. Countries including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Mozambique, Rwanda and Turkey are building dams to satisfy demand.
Ajami is frustrated that Western funding agencies and engineering firms are still pushing dams in developing countries when they now understand the social and environmental impacts and have stopped building them at home. In some communities traditional water supply practices still work, and keep people in better touch with the limitations of the resource, she says.
Dams also tend to create hydrological winners and losers, according to Ajami. Between 1971 and 2010, 20 percent of the global population gained water from human interventions on rivers, including dams, but 24 percent were left with less water, according to a 2017 study. Dams on the Euphrates River in Turkey cause water shortages in Iraq and Syria; the ones on the Colorado in the U.S. deny water downstream in Mexico, often leaving the riverbed there dry.
Even with flat demand, use of the Colorado River may already be unsustainable because allocations were based on false assumptions about water availability. Climate change is further tightening the supply, says David Wegner, a consultant and retired adviser on water to the U.S. House of Representatives. There’s a “high potential that significant and severe water restrictions will be put into place,” he says.
Fleck adds, about 70 percent of freshwater used by humans globally goes to irrigated agriculture, where there is a lot of room to reduce demand. A 2015 studyfound that, globally, nearly half of irrigation water does not benefit crops. Switching to sprinkler or drip irrigation could reduce the nonbeneficial consumption by 54 and 76 percent, respectively, while maintaining crop yields.
The answer to profligate use is better regulation, possibly via higher pricing that would likely suppress demand, says Landon Marston, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Kansas State University. Even when water becomes scarce, “often it’s free or nearly so,” he notes.
Dams and reservoirs are not innately bad, Di Baldassarre says. But when planning new ones, decision makers should think about these long-term effects and weigh them against other social, environmental and economic costs and benefits. “It’s important to not constrain ourselves for the future,” he says. Now that more than 2.2 million people live in the Las Vegas Valley “there is nothing you can do. We can’t move these people somewhere else.”",Reservoirs may promote waste by creating a false sense of water security -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2019-02-18T11:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Do Dams Increase Water Use?,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-dams-increase-water-use/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/EE45BDF7-641B-4821-A73373E9EFC0041A.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Associated Press,"NATCHEZ, Miss. (AP) — County supervisors in Mississippi have retroactively rejected a bid for the next phase of a levee project at an industrial site, citing a previous project and pending legislation. The Natchez Democrat reports Adams County supervisors voted to reject Camo Construction’s bid to construct about 1,000 feet (305 meters) of levee Monday after approving it in January. Board Attorney Scott Slover says the move was made primarily because of an emergency watershed project with the company. Slover says erosion reappeared after work was completed on a slide that the company was contracted to repair. Camo Construction President Mike Grantham says the erosion reoccurred because the portion of the road the company had been hired to fix didn’t immediately have asphalt. County Engineer Jim Marlow says asphalt being laid later wouldn’t have induced the reoccurrence. ___ Information from: The Natchez Democrat, http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/","NATCHEZ, Miss.

Ralph Jennings,"Chen Chien-hsiang had just gone to sleep in the apartment where he had lived for some 20 years. So had most people in the 12-story building, tucked between a creek levee where people stroll by day and a neighborhood of restaurants and massage parlors that's active at night. When Chen awoke, his world had turned topsy-turvy. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake had violently rocked his building, then knocked it off its moorings. It was tilting at a 45-degree angle, spilling occupants into the corners of their apartments, with the floors suddenly sloping at crazy angles. Chen found it impossible to crawl or claw his way to the door. ""Wow, stuff was all over the place,"" the 66-year-old retired antique dealer said Wednesday. His sixth-floor flat had become, in effect, a second story. Chen was among the dozens who would eventually be rescued from the multi-use building, the worst of five damaged in the quake. Three people died there and another seven were feared trapped in the hardest-hit ground level and second floor. Overall, the National Fire Agency reported, seven people died and 260 were injured in the quake. The structure, named Yun Tsui, became a focal point Wednesday for hundreds of rescue personnel. Rescues had wrapped up at other damaged buildings, while hundreds more stood without incident in Hualien, a city of 100,000 on the northeast coast of Taiwan. Rescue crews led by the Hualien County Fire Department pulled all occupants out of floors 3 through 12 overnight, a department spokesman said. They were able to extend ladders onto balconies or through windows, many of which had been broken. Chen climbed onto a balcony after breaking through the glass door he could reach from the corner of a room. But after dawn, the fire department suspended relief to take another look. The building was slowly continuing to tilt over, threatening to collapse outright and threaten any rescue workers inside, disaster relief center worker Chen Tzai-tung said. Portions of the bottom four floors collapsed. The lower two were partly buried. The building's decorative, semicircular glass facade — a hallmark of Taiwanese multi-use architecture in the 1980s — had also caved into the ground. So the county ordered four steel construction beams be inserted into the building's mid-level windows and corners to stop it from collapsing. Then, as rain muddied the ground, rescue work stopped again so crews could place large concrete blocks against the beams to keep them from slipping. Six adults and one child, guests at the second-story Beautiful Baby Inn, were trapped underground, fire department spokesman Chu Che-ming said. ""This work won't go so quickly,"" said Fan Kang-wei, a Red Cross rescue volunteer at the scene. ""Where these people are buried, we still don't know. As it gets darker, it gets all the harder,"" ""The whole thing was underground, so we had to dig and dig and dig,"" said Yen I-chia, deputy captain with a rescue team from northern Taiwan who was taking a break at his rain-soaked plastic tent a block away from the building. ""Progress is slow now because of so many uncertainties."" By Wednesday evening the search was back on as the cement buttresses were holding. The county had ordered workers back inside with flashlights to search through dark, cramped underground spaces where the hotel walls had collapsed but beams still held. ""The first to fourth floors are collapsed and it's a really tight space, so rescue work is quite difficult,"" Chu said after a mid-evening meeting to discuss safety measures for the next shift of people due to enter the building. ""We don't rule out any danger of collapse danger, especially with so many aftershocks."" Some 160 aftershocks, one as strong as magnitude 5.7, shook the county in the first 24 hours after the quake. Outside, about 1,400 staff people and volunteers from charity organizations mixed in the crowded streets packed with ambulances and lined mostly by low-rise retailers. Firefighters from around Taiwan plus more than 400 army troops huddled in their tents to be called for backup. Charities handed out coffee and bowls of soup to survivors as well as weary rescue workers. The Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation alone had given away 1,210 blankets and 3,600 meals in the first 16 hours after the quake. ""We've seen people coming out after a rescue and of course they're really happy,"" Tzu Chi publicist Eason Pan said. One came out carrying a child, the Red Cross worker said. Building residents who had escaped unharmed slept outside to avoid the danger of aftershocks. ""It happened really fast and everything was falling over,"" said Chen Chien-chieh, 26, a neighbor of Chen Chien-hsiang who lived in a two-story building above his family's diner. He and his mother and father all took to the streets after being awakened by the quake. ""We went back inside only this morning. We slept in cars. Almost everyone did."" Chen Chien-hsiang became one of the 786 people admitted to emergency shelters in Hualien. He was too keyed up to sleep. By late Wednesday, he was eyeing his bunk in an elementary school auditorium with about 100 other people, including children, many too scared to return to their undamaged homes around Hualien because of the aftershocks. A shout went up whenever an aftershock rattled the school, which was on holiday break. Taiwan sits on a Pacific Rim chain of fault lines. The last major quake, which also measured 6.4, toppled an apartment complex in 2016 and killed 116 people. ""We get so many earthquakes in Hualien,"" said Chen, who had grabbed his mobile phone but nothing else before fleeing. ""I'm usually not scared of quakes. But this was like the day the world ended, really scary.""","Chen Chien-hsiang had just gone to sleep in the apartment where he had lived for some 20 years.

Samantha Montano,"Disaster movies often depict people running around after an earthquake or hurricane in helpless panic, while looters break into jewelry stores. While perhaps effective from an entertainment perspective, this is far from the reality of what actually happens in these situations—and the myth is affecting our ability to effectively respond in a crisis. During the Cold War, the federal government was concerned about how Americans would react to nuclear bombs detonating on U.S. soil. In an effort to address this question, sociologists were asked to study the issue. Their work became the foundation of a body of research that finds, contrary to what film directors seem to think and contrary to the way media reports are often presented, that people tend not to panic during disasters; they are not helpless; and crime rates rarely rise. Instead, researchers have found that people react rationally in such situations. When we become aware of the possibility of danger we talk about it with those around us, sharing information and trying to understand the situation. We then make rational decisions about how to protect ourselves. We don’t just flee the scene of a crisis without regard for the well-being of others, or become shocked into inaction. The belief that people who experience a disaster behave irrationally is closely connected to the impression many have that disaster survivors are helpless victims. While survivors and communities do need help, they are not helpless. In fact, during disasters, the survivors themselves are the first responders, because they were already there when the disaster happened. The decisions survivors make can and do save their own lives and the lives of the people around them. It can take a while for help from the outside to arrive, but people don’t just sit around waiting. They begin to organize themselves into groups, identify the resources they have, and use those resources to others. In fact, this spontaneous response is so reliable that research from around the world has found that people are often more likely to be rescued by these emergent, informal groups than they are by official search and rescue teams.

In fact, this spontaneous response is so reliable that research from around the world has found that people are often more likely to be rescued by these emergent, informal groups than they are by official search and rescue teams. There is also a widespread belief that amidst the (imagined) panic and chaos, communities turn into a sort of lawless Wild West, with looters running rampant. But just as with panic, paralysis and other maladaptive behaviors, looting is extremely rare during disasters—yet time and time again the media, the public, and even law enforcement reinforce the belief that this is a common occurrence. Over the past week, we watched this myth unfold in real time as Hurricane Florence devastated the Carolinas. A headline on a Florida TV station’s website that read “ Looting already starts as Florence arrives ” captured the attitude many in the media take on as a disaster begins. They find a single, isolated incident, and frame it as “just the beginning” of an impending crime wave—with no evidence that this is the case. Reports like this can instill fear and convince people that they shouldn’t evacuate. A second incident during Hurricane Florence exemplifies a second issue with the looting myth. In Wilmington, a city described as being “cut off” by floodwaters, a group of people were seen leaving a dollar store with food, water and other supplies. A local news crew arrived and the resulting, jarring footage shows a reporter chasing people down while screaming. The fact that these items might have been needed for survival didn’t seem to occur to anyone. Taking food and water from a dollar store is hardly the moral equivalent of taking TVs or jewelry. Hurricane Katrina and the levee failure in New Orleans highlighted that other factors, including race, underlie the looting myth. In the days after the storm, photojournalists posted two nearly identical photos of people swimming through chest-deep water carrying food. The first photo, depicting two white people, was labeled “finding” food while the second photo, of a black woman, was labeled “looting” food. With this type of media coverage, it’s clear why the public has such a focus on looting. In fact, this myth is so prevalent that researchers found that 70–90 percent of people who had been through a disaster heard that looting had occurred. Yet when researchers investigate such a rumor, they usually find that it traces back to one or two specific incidents and/or was based on a misunderstanding or exaggeration. Unfortunately, it is not only media that perpetuate the looting myth. News coverage during disasters also comes with comments from law enforcement, and even emergency managers, that suggest they too believe lawlessness reigns during disaster. Even when they are educated on the subject, they still may publicly denounce looting, perhaps in an effort to appease the concerns of the public, and that can feed back into the cycle of this myth. This is not to say that no one commits crimes during disasters. Certainly, there are confirmed cases of people stealing luxury items at such times, but it is nowhere near the widespread problem the public believes it to be. Lawlessness and violent behavior are rare during disasters (with the notable exception of domestic violence, which has been found to increase and be reported more often post-disaster). Disaster myths are not just a pet peeve of disaster researchers; they have serious implications for how we plan for and respond to disasters. When the public is concerned about looting, for example, public resources can be diverted to protect property instead of addressing more pressing tasks like search and rescue. The dollar-store incident during Florence is a good example.","Contrary to what we’ve been led to believe, people tend not to panic during emergencies, and looting is rarely widespread -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-09-25T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",There Goes Hurricane Florence; Here Come the Disaster Myths,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/there-goes-hurricane-florence-here-come-the-disaster-myths/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/B9E37819-44BF-4134-BE6A424C32CCB2A5.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Valley begins evacuations; Elkhorn River near Waterloo rapidly rises three feet
The City of Valley was telling residents about 9:45 a.m. Friday that they had one to two hours to evacuate.
The Elkhorn River at Waterloo has risen about 3 feet in the last couple of hours, the National Weather Service said.
Officials suspect that there is an ice jam somewhere that has backed up the river, said weather service meteorologist Taylor Nicolaisen.
The increase put the level at 20.7 feet, over the record of 19.1 feet, he said.
Valmont Industries in Valley closed its manufacturing facility in Valley on Friday as a precaution. The building, where about 1,600 employees work, had not experienced any flooding as of Friday morning. Renee Campbell, a Valmont spokeswoman, said the facility is closed during Fridays day shift, affecting about 1,000 workers and is the company's largest manufacturing facility.
Fear of levee breach south of Plattsmouth
Fremont County emergency management officials fear the Missouri River will breach the levee near Bartlett, Iowa, sometime Friday if water rises just a couple more inches.
Authorities went door to door Thursday night, suggesting residents west of Interstate 29 evacuate.
""We'd rather get people out now than wait until water is flowing across the levee, because once that starts, we can have a breach,"" said Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius. ""If we have a breach, then that whole bottom (nearby) will be filled.""
If the levee is breached, officials will recommend residents who live west of Bluff Road will evacuate.
Nebraska rivers hit record levels
A few rivers have hit record levels overnight as National Weather Service meteorologists caution that water levels will continue to rise for the next several days.
Thankfully, no additional moisture is expected in the coming days that will add to the totals, other than a low chance of snow Monday night, said weather service meteorologist Dave Eastlack.
""We're probably not going to see some kind of receding until mid- or late next week,"" he said. ""Fortunately, we have dry conditions on tap.""
Overnight, the Missouri River at Plattsmouth hit a record high of 37.15 feet, surpassing the previous high of 36.73 feet in 2011. The Platte River at near Leshara reached 12.23 feet, beating the last historical crest of 11.84 feet.
Also early Friday morning, Sarpy County officials announced that residents in the Sands Trailer Court and the south side of Hanson Lake #2 near La Platte Road U.S. Highway 75 should seek higher ground. Sarpy County Sheriff's Office deputies and Bellevue Fire Department workers went door to door around 3:45 a.m. to ask people to evacuate.
Eastlack stressed that motorists should not drive through water, for their own safety and to avoid tying up first responder resources.
Missouri River levels will surge higher; Omaha officials expect levees to hold
Levels on the Missouri River will surge even higher in the next few days as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tries to ease pressure from flooding by ramping up releases from Gavins Point Dam.
Officials announced Thursday night that releases will increase to 90,000 cubit feet per second.
While it's not immediately clear how much the releases will raise river levels, what appears clear is the Missouri River is expected to reach record levels in some stretches, notably around Brownville.
As a result, the rising Missouri River in the next day or so is likely to overtop federal levees on the Missouri and Iowa sides and inundate Interstate 29 near Brownville in the process. Water levels may also require the shutdown of the Cooper Nuclear Station.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expects the Missouri River to crest at 33.7 feet by Sunday, but City of Omaha officials said the river is not expected to compromise the 13 miles of levee it controls.
Officials said they still plan to monitor the levee as a precaution.
During the 2011 Missouri River flood, the river crested at 36 feet and the levee was not breached.
Workers are installing gates at Lewis and Clark Landing to prevent public access to parking lots. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge is closed because of flooding on the Council Bluffs side of the bridge. The power supply to the bridge lights has been shut off because it is underwater.
Firefighters rescued after boat capsizes during rescue attempt near Arlington
Two boats with five firefighters and two drivers capsized Thursday night as they were trying to rescue people in Dodge County near the Elkhorn River.
Numerous helicopters were called to assist at the scene southwest of Arlington, the Dodge County Sheriff's Office said.
All seven rescuers were taken to Methodist Fremont Health to treat hypothermia, with at least one in critical condition, according to 911 dispatch reports. That firefighter may have been in the water for an hour or more.

Corps of Engineers increasing water releases at Gavins Point Dam
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said at midday Thursday that it was increasing water releases at Gavins Point Dam near Yankton, South Dakota, to 50,000 cubic feet per second and plan to increase it again to 60,000 cfs later Thursday or Friday.
Officials said runoff between Fort Randall and Gavins Point Dam is very high and continues to increase because of snowmelt, heavy rain and wet soil.
""We know there are communities experiencing flooding, or nearing that condition, along the Missouri downstream of our dams, said John Remus, chief of the corps Missouri River Water Management Division in Omaha. We are managing releases from Gavins Point as judiciously as we can in order to lessen the impact downstream.
The corps said Thursday afternoon that it was surveying the integrity of the levees along both banks of the Missouri River from Omaha to Rulo, Nebraska, as well as dams along the Papillion Creek in Omaha and Salt Creek in Lincoln.
Releases from Fort Randall Dam, about 65 miles upstream from Gavins Point Dam, have been stopped to relieve stress at Gavins Point, the corps said.
The corps' Omaha office has provided about 25,000 sandbags to the cities of Columbus and North Bend, Holt and Howard Counties and the Yankton Sioux Tribe.
Spencer Dam 'compromised'; tavern washed away
The phone rang at Paul Allen's ranch house along the Niobrara River at 6 a.m. It wasn't good news.
Five miles upstream, the Spencer Dam a 91-year-old concrete structure had ""been compromised,"" and a wall of water was heading his way. Just below the dam, a popular tavern, built of straw bales, was washed away, as was a bait shop, a half-dozen campers and a home. One man who lived in the home was missing.
A quarter-mile section of U.S. 281 was washed out just south of the bridge over the Niobrara River.
Rain, snow will keep falling
The giant storm that moved into Nebraska was the product of a rare phenomenon called bombogenesis, or bomb cyclone.
Over the weekend, temperatures are predicted to rise across the state, and dry conditions should prevail, Walker said. High temperatures in the region will be in the 40s Friday and Saturday before pushing up to 50 on Sunday.
""It should be a much quieter (weather) weekend in Nebraska as that massive storm moves on into eastern Minnesota and then Wisconsin,"" Walker said. ""Eastern Nebraska will have a lot less wind as well.""
Emergency lines open around the state
The Nebraska State Patrol Highway Helpline is available 24 hours per day for motorists in need of assistance. Drivers can reach NSP by dialing *55 from any cell phone or 911 in an emergency.

They also have not determined whether the blazes, which occurred between March 26 and Thursday, were intentionally set, she said in an email. At a news conference on Thursday, State Fire Marshall Butch Browning was asked if investigators were treating the fires as potential hate crimes.
""If the hate crime definition was violated, we will certainly vet those things out,"" Browning said.
The number of hate crimes in the United States increased 17 percent in 2017, the third consecutive year such attacks rose, according to FBI data released last fall.
Investigators probing the St. Landry Parish fires were awaiting lab results but view the three blazes as ""suspicious,"" Browning said at the news conference.
Without giving details, he said certain ""patterns"" had been discovered, but that it was too early to say whether a single individual had started the fires.
""There certainly is commonality and whether that leads to a person or persons or groups, we don't know,"" Browning said.
The fires destroyed St. Mary Baptist Church in the community of Port Barre, and Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, the parish seat.
The FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined in the investigation, Browning said.
Investigators have concluded that a fourth fire last Sunday, more than 200 miles outside St. Landry Parish at a predominantly white church in Vivian in northwest Louisiana, was intentionally set, state fire officials said in a statement.
That fire, inside the sanctuary at Vivian United Pentecostal Church, was relatively small and burned itself out.
No one has been arrested in connection with any of the church fires, which have not resulted in any injuries, officials said. (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Tom Brown)

Cale Hunt,"It's a brand new year! Here are the movies, music, and books the Windows Central team is enjoying this first week of 2018. The holiday season is winding down, and 2018 is just getting started. Whether or not you've put away the decorations and recycled the tree, you can enjoy a bit of time to yourself (or with the family) with some great tunes, a quality movie, or a real page turner. Need a suggestion? Here's what Team Windows Central is enjoying. TV and movies Here are some of the movies and TV shows Windows Central is enjoying this week. The Emoji Movie Recommended by Zac Bowden, senior editor This week I recommend The Emoji Movie. Not because it's a good movie, but because it's so bad you just have to see it. It's a baseless movie that has no reason to exist. Yet here it is. See at Microsoft Store Fight Club Recommended by Richard Devine, reviews editor Fight Club is one of my all-time favorite movies, and not in any way because of the gratuitous violence. It's an incredibly clever tale with an ENORMOUS twist and one that shows you more and more every time you re-watch it. The first rule of Fight Club is, you don't talk about Fight Club. See at Microsoft Store Black Mirror Season 4 Recommended by Matt Brown, Xbox editor Late last year, Netflix finally dropped the next long-awaited entries to its Black Mirror series — a show that takes a dive into the twisted future of technology, and its impact on society. For those who've watched previous seasons of the series, the contents of the fourth season are familiar, though establish new storylines around different technological environments. Coming off a strong string of episodes last season, the six new entries have compelling stories to tell. While certain episodes in earlier seasons still stick out as favorites, I couldn't have asked for much this latest installment. If you're in for thrilling short stories that leave their mark, look no further than Black Mirror. See at Netflix Terminator 2 (Digital Remaster 2017) Recommended by Jez Corden, senior Xbox editor Most of you have (hopefully) seen Terminator 2, but recently, the legendary action movie's digital remaster hit the Microsoft Store for a totally solid price. If you haven't seen Terminator 2 before, know that it is essential cinema viewing. It is arguably the greatest action movie of all time, telling a foreboding tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong. T2 is pure joy from start to finish, and certainly isn't something you'll soon forget. The digital remaster sharpens the 90s movie's picture quality, making it the best version yet. Ideally you should get the 4K bluray, but if you haven't jumped on that train yet, the HD version on the Microsoft Store is still an essential purchase.

It's a new year, which makes it the perfect opportunity to treat oneself (or a significant other) with access to Amazon Prime. Unlimited next-day delivery on select products, music, video, and much more make the $5.99 well worth it. See at Amazon Music Here's some of the music the Windows Central team is listening to this week. Buddy Holly — Greatest Hits Recommended by Al Sacco, managing editor I hate country music. Or most country music. But I love Buddy Holly, a country musician who rose to fame in just a few short years and then died in a 1959 plane crash at the tender age of 22. Every single Buddy Holly tune — literally every one — has the potential to get stuck in your head for days. Seriously, this dude knew how to write catchy songs. Most of the lyrics feel kind of silly and prudish by today's standards. But those choruses and riffs and everything else that tie them together are plain old special. I was visiting family in Lubbock, Texas, a few years ago, and I visited the Buddy Holly Museum. (Holly was from Lubbock, and, yeah, that museum is really a thing.) Before then, I was sort of familiar with his work, but there is nothing to do in Lubbock, Texas, except eat, drink and go to the Buddy Holly Museum. So after eating (a lot) and drinking (even more), I went to that museum. And I've listened to Holly frequently ever since. For a 22-year-old guy, he created a decent amount of music, and his greatest hits album is a good place to familiarize yourself with his work.

Songs on The Basement Tapes were recorded waaaaay back in '67 at the recording studio known as ""Big Pink"" in New York. This was while Dylan was on the mend from his motorcycle accident. These songs are part of what is supposedly a collection of over 100 cuts, and while a few of them are meandering and of poor quality, there are a number that stand the test of time. ""Ain't No More Cane,"" ""Crash on the Levee,"" ""This Wheel's On Fire,"" and ""Goin' to Acapulco"" are personal favorites that are fun to play around the campfire when the whiskey's flowing and an acoustic is nearby.

The Collectors — David Baldacci Recommended by Al Sacco, managing editor A few weeks ago, I recommended the first book in author David Baldacci's ""Camel Club"" series, called just The Camel Club. I liked it so much that I quickly sought out the second part of the story, ""The Collectors"", picks up with the same ragtag bunch of conspiracy theorists in Washington, D.C. The leader, who calls himself 'Olive Stone,' and his crew are trying to get to the bottom of the murder of a rare book collector, who may have witnessed the murder of a government official wrapped up in a plot to leak secrets to terrorist. I know, it kind of sounds cliché. And it kind of is. But the execution of the story, and the lovable band of misfits that make up the cast of characters make this a series worth coming back to. If you're looking for a light but thoughtful and well-written mystery, you'll find a friend in ""The Collectors"". But you'll definitely want to read the first book first.

I still remember not being able to set it down until I'd turned the final page. The same holds true for 11/22/63. I grabbed it from my parents' place following the holiday break, and couldn't put it down until about four days later when I finally found out what happened to Jake/George. The plot is all about a time travel bubble that takes people back to the late '50s. What do you do in this era? Stop the Kennedy assassination! There are all sorts of subplots and twists, and holding true to King's style, he keeps you hooked. Seriously hooked.

News-Press Now,"City officials in St. Joseph expected the Missouri River to crest at 32 feet between 1 and 4 p.m. this afternoon and are ordering an evacuation for parts of St. Joseph. The order came during an EOC meeting this morning at Fire State 12 on St. Joseph Avenue.
During a noon EOC meeting with the city of St. Joseph, Mayor Bill McMurray said the levees in are holding. St. Joseph Police Chief Chris Connally also shared that police have been helping evacuate residents. Connally added the department would assess the need for evacuation check points depending on the river's crest and recession.
During the morning meeting, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers confirmed the 32-foot crest, which city staff said will top the airport levee on the west bank of the Missouri River and put part of the east side at risk for flooding Friday afternoon. At noon, the National Weather Service measured the river at 32 feet, while the U.S. Geological Survey showed a measurement of 32.32 feet.
McMurray and Buchanan County presiding commissioner Lee Sawyer said they would sign evacuation orders as soon as prepared Friday morning. Once signed the emergency sirens will sound and the evacuation will begin.
The evacuation order includes an area in south St. Joseph west of Lake Avenue and bordered by Atchison Street to the north and Contrary Creek to the south.
City staff said the evacuation order applies to residents and businesses. St. Joseph's Police and Fire Departments said at the meeting they are ready for systematic evacuation once ordered. Other city operations, such as its sewer plant, will continue.  
A St. Joseph Animal Control &amp; Rescue representative said more than 50 dogs and cats with their food and supplies were moved overnight from their Lower Lake Road location to the Friends of Animal Shelter on Corporate Drive.
City administration also directed 130 city workers to sandbagging efforts to help shore the Missouri River west bank levee to help protect the Missouri Air National Guard and Rosencrans Airport.
Also Friday morning, Triumph Foods announced at 10 a.m. that it was suspending operations for the day.
Triumph said it would monitor flooding conditions throughout the day and hoped to reopen Saturday.","South St. Joseph to be evacuated News-Press Now Mandatory evacuations ordered for parts of St. Joseph as floodwaters rise KMBC Kansas City KQ2 Forecast: Continuing to watch Missouri River; Quiet & warmer weather for Friday KQ2.com Elwood, Kansas, evacuated as…",2019-03-22T13:23:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newspressnow.com'}",South St. Joseph to be evacuated - News-Press Now,http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/city-officials-evacuate-south-st-joseph/article_61258d39-42ac-5b3b-958c-a2eb39cc7113.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newspressnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/90/f90e4bdd-46ec-537a-a835-023321e7fb09/5c944acb55bb0.image.jpg?crop=1740%2C789%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C544&order=crop%2Cresize,,Newspressnow.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though they’ve toured heavily behind two albums over the last two years — Heart Like a Levee and the more recent Hallelujah Anyhow — M.C. Taylor’s indie folk outfit hasn’t appeared on TV since 2014. That made last night’s performance on Seth Meyers all the more special. Taylor led his 10-piece band in a rendition of “Domino (Time Will Tell)”, one of the early singles from Hallelujah. A swinging, soulful song, it made for a perfect late night showcase for the band. Taylor may be the centerpiece of Hiss Golden Messenger, but the performance did well to highlight everyone else, from the horns to the backup singers to — perhaps especially — Phil Cook on piano.

"Shane Bauer, Shane Bauer","A Southern chain gang from the 1900s. What One Historian Learned About Believing 19th-Century Women in the Age of #MeToo Were Never Going to Get Our Have You No Sense of Decency, Sir? MomentBecause That Moment Isnt Quite What We Remember America Has Perfected the Art of Pretending It Isnt Discriminating in the Name of National Security Kanyes Brand of Freethinking Has a Long, Awful History In August, an organization called the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee announced that prisoners in at least 17 states had pledged to stage a strike to protest prison conditions. It is unclear how many inmates actually took part in the 19-day strike, but organizers said thousands refused to work, staged sit-ins, and turned away meals to demand an immediate end to prison slavery. Nationwide, inmates labor is essential to running prisons. They cook, clean, do laundry, cut hair, and fulfill numerous administrative tasks for cents on the dollar, if anything, in hourly pay. Prisoners have been used to package Starbucks coffee and make lingerie. In California, inmates volunteer to fight the states wildfires for just $1 an hour plus $2 per day. The link between prison labor and slavery is not merely rhetorical. At the end of the Civil War, the 13 th amendment abolished slavery except as a punishment for a crime. This opened the door for more than a century of forced labor that was in many ways identical to, and in some ways worse than, slavery. The following is an excerpt from my new book, American Prison: A Reporters Undercover Journey Into the Business of Punishment. The book details my time working undercover as a prison guard in a for-profit prison in Louisiana. It also traces the ways in which our prison system evolved out of the attempt of Southern businessmen to keep slavery alive. A few years after the Civil War ended, Samuel Lawrence James bought a plantation on a sleepy bend of the Mississippi River in Louisianas West Feliciana Parish. It was known as Angola, named for the country of origin of many of the people who were once enslaved there. Before the war, it produced 3,100 bales of cotton a year, an amount few Southern plantations could rival. For most planters, those days seemed to be over. Without slaves, it was impossible to reach those levels of production. But James was optimistic. Slavery may have been gone, but something like it was already beginning to come back in other states. While antebellum convicts were mostly white, 7 out of 10 prisoners were now black. In Mississippi, Cotton King Edmund Richardson convinced the state to lease him its convicts. He wanted to rebuild the cotton empire hed lost during the war, and, with its penitentiary burned to ashes, the state needed somewhere to send its prisoners. The state agreed to pay him $18,000 per year for their maintenance, and he could keep the profits derived from their labor. With the help of convict labor, he would become the most powerful cotton planter in the world, producing more than 12,000 bales on 50 plantations per year. Georgia, whose penitentiary had been destroyed by Gen. Sherman, was leasing its convicts to a railroad builder. Alabama had leased its convicts to a dummy firm that sublet them for forced labor in mines and railroad-construction camps throughout the state. There was no reason Louisiana couldnt take the same path. Black Americans were flooding the penitentiary system, mostly on larceny convictions. In 1868, the state had appropriated three times as much money to run the penitentiary as it had the previous year. It was the perfect time to make a deal, but someone beat James to it. A company called Huger and Jones won a lease for all of the state prisoners. Barely had the ink dried on the contract before James bought them out for a staggering $100,000 (about $1.7 million in 2018 dollars). James worked out a 21year lease with the state, in which he would pay $5,000 the first year, $6,000 the second, and so on up to $25,000 for the 21 st year in exchange for the use of all Louisiana convicts. All profits earned would be his. He immediately purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars of machinery to turn the state penitentiary into a threestory factory. One newspaper called it the heaviest lot of machinery ever brought in the state. The prison became capable of producing 10,000 yards of cotton cloth, 350 molasses barrels, and 50,000 bricks per day. It would also produce 6,000 pairs of shoes per week with the most complete shoe machinery ever set up south of Ohio. The factory was so large that the Daily Advocate argued it would stimulate Louisianas economy by increasing demand for cotton, wool, lumber, and other raw materials. In 1873, a joint committee of senators and representatives inspected the Louisiana State Penitentiary and found it nearly deserted: The looms that used to be worked all day and all night, are now silent as the tomb. The warden and the lessees were not at the prison. It is pretty difficult to find out who are the lessees or, indeed, whether or not there are any, the inspectors wrote in their report. Where were the convicts? Almost as soon as James prison factory was running, hed abandoned it. Hed discovered that he could make a lot more money subcontracting his prisoners to labor camps, where they were made to work on levees and railroads. A convict doing levee and railroad work cost onetwentieth the labor of a wage worker. Some in Louisianas Reconstruction legislature tried to rein in James. In 1875, it forbade convict labor from being used outside prison wallssenators and representatives were concerned it would deprive their constituents of jobsbut James disregarded the ban and kept his labor camps going. A Baton Rouge district attorney sued James for nonpayment of his lease. James ignored him and made no payment for the next six years. He had become untouchable. Samuel L. James recorded more about how he himself lived than about the people forced to labor for him. James kept a second home in New Orleans where he and his wife would receive the citys elite. Their very elegant toilets and cordial hospitality would be noted in the papers gossip columns. After visits to New Orleans, the James family would ride his steamboat back to Angola, eating delicious meals and playing poker on deck, while transporting convicts in the cargo below. On the plantation, the family kept about 50 prisoners in an illventilated 15by20foot shack located a half-mile from their ninebedroom mansion. During the day, some convicts would tend to the expansive yard, its oak, pecan, and fig trees, and the familys stable out back. Throughout the South, annual convict death rates ranged from about 16 percent to 25 percent, a mortality rate that would rival the Soviet gulags to come. In the mornings, the convict houseboys would bring James coffee in bed and saddle up his horse, which hed ride out into the fields at daybreak to see that the work had begun. The few scant accounts reporters recorded from prisoners described a dawntodusk work regimen, whippings, and being forced to sleep in muddy clothing. While the fieldworkers ate starvation rations, James would return to the big house in the morning to a spread of bacon, eggs, grits, biscuits, batter cakes, syrup, coffee, cream, and fruit. At lunchtime, a little Negro boy would sit on the stairs and pull a rope that would spin a fan to keep the family cool. The fieldwork continued through the day, but during the hottest hours, the James family slept, rising later to take a ride around the plantation in their carriage. One day, in 1894, James was doing his rounds when he was struck by a sudden brain hemorrhage. He died soon after, and his body was laid out in the big house for a viewing. When the estate was passed on to his son, it was valued at $2.3 million, the equivalent of about $63 million in 2018. A convict under James lease had a higher chance of death than he would have had as a slave. In 1884, the editor of the Daily Picayune wrote that it would be more humane to punish with death all prisoners sentenced to a longer period than six years because the average convict lived no longer than that. At the time, the death rate at six prisons in the Midwest, where convict leasing was nonexistent, was about 1 percent. By contrast, in the deadliest year of Louisianas lease, nearly 20 percent of convicts perished. Between 1870 and 1901, about 3,000 Louisiana convicts, most of whom were black, died under James regime. Before the war, only a handful of planters owned more than 1,000 slaves, and there is no record of anyone allowing 3,000 valuable human chattel to die. The pattern was consistent throughout the South, where annual convict death rates ranged from about 16 percent to 25 percent, a mortality rate that would rival the Soviet gulags to come. (Gulag death rates during 1942 and 1943 were about 25 percent, according to the Soviet Unions Interior Ministry records.) Some American camps were far deadlier than Stalins: In South Carolina, the death rate of convicts leased to the Greenwood and Augusta Railroad averaged 45 percent a year from 187779. In 1870, Alabama prison officials reported that more than 40 percent of their convicts had died in their mining camps. A doctor warned that Alabamas entire convict population could be wiped out within three years. But such warnings meant little to the men getting rich off prisoners. There was simply no incentive for lessees to avoid working people to death. In 1883, 11 years before Samuel L. James death, one Southern man told the National Conference of Charities and Correction, Before the war, we owned the negroes. If a man had a good negro, he could afford to take care of him: if he was sick get a doctor. He might even put gold plugs in his teeth. But these convicts: we dont own em. One dies, get another.

Tim Swift,"SOUTH BAY, Fla. - The search for a missing fisherman on Lake Okeechobee entered its third day Sunday as dozens of private boaters joined the rescue efforts. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Nik Kayler, 38, of Apopka has been missing since Thursday when he and his friend Bill Kisiah didn't check in at the designated weigh-in location at C. Scott Driver Recreational Area. The two had planned to compete in the Costa FLW Series event, a professional bass fishing tournament. The tournament canceled its final two days to make way for the massive search. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Kayler and Kisiah were thrown overboard sometime Thursday. Kisiah was able to get back on the boat, and he was found late Thursday when the boat came ashore. Kisiah was suffering from hypothermia and the boat was damaged when it crashed into rocks along the shore. Richard Bowie, director of the Down East Emergency Medicine Institute, one of the outside groups assisting with the search, said the lake's murky waters have complicated their efforts. However, Bowie said many of the search vessels are using sonar and other tools to help the effort. Bowie said the groups are also searching the shoreline for Kayler, and believe that finding him on land is the best chance for finding him alive. The group had planned to use all-terrain vehicles to search the shore, but Bowie said that the Army Corp of Engineers did not want the ATVs near the levee. Kayler, a military veteran, is married with a young daughter. Kelly Kayler, Nik Kayler's wife, has posted words of encouragement to the search teams on Facebook.

Scott Lemieux,"President Trump on Friday questioned the credibility of the woman who has said Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were both teenagers. He said that if the attack “was as bad as she says,” it would have been reported to the authorities. Attacking the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, directly for the first time after days of atypical restraint, the president challenged her to produce contemporaneous law enforcement reports “so that we can learn date, time, and place!” A big reason Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s accuser says she doesn’t want to testify in the Senate without first having her claims investigated by the FBI is she doesn’t think she’ll be treated objectively and fairly by politicians. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) just thoroughly justified Christine Blasey Ford’s concerns. In comments Friday, he laid plain his intention to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, apparently no matter what Ford has to share. “Here’s what I want to tell you,” McConnell said Friday morning at a summit for social conservatives. “In the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the U.S. Supreme Court. So, my friends, keep the faith. Don’t get rattled by all this. We’re going to plow right through it and do our job.” There is no other way to read McConnell’s comment other than that the Ford allegation doesn’t matter to him, at least not when he’s so close to fulfilling his goal of firming up the Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 conservative majority weeks before an election.","I’m surprised it took this long: President Trump on Friday questioned the credibility of the woman who has said Judge Brett M.

DeMarco Morgan,"LUMBERTON, N.C. — As Florence continued to pound the Tar Heel state with high winds and heavy rain on Friday evening, volunteers and National Guardsmen were outside the West Lumberton Baptist Church. Volunteers, many of them residents, got the call for help earlier Friday morning and showed up in big numbers. But they were in a race against time because they needed to get sandbags to the most critical area. ""We are trying to get ahead of it,"" said Andrew Collier. ""The water levels are expected to be higher than Matthew, so we are trying to sandbag this opening up... trying to save homes and businesses."" People braved the rain to put sandbags in Lumberton, North Carolina. Two years ago, Hurricane Matthew dumped 20 inches of rain on Lumberton. According to city officials, the town's protective levee never breached during that storm. But where the railroad passes through, the levee drops down for tracks and that's where they say the flood waters from Matthew rushed in. Florence is expected to drop even more rain than Matthew did. ""We are trying to plug the hole in the levee,"" said Corey Walters, deputy director of public works for Lumberton. Walters said the town reached out to the railroad company for permission to close up the levee on Tuesday and they were denied. They then reached out to the governor, who issued an order to protect the area. ""We basically got a lot of work to do,"" Walters said. ""No time to do it and really not a whole lot of time to think about what we are doing and how the best way to do it is."" CSX Transportation, the railroad, issued a statement saying they are providing ""safe access"" to the community to ""minimize flooding.""

Jeremy Raff,"MISSION, TEXAS—About a hundred parishioners gathered for mass at a white adobe chapel built beside the Rio Grande in 1899. Father Roy Snipes, the parish priest, tolled the rusty church bell by hand, signalling the start of a welcome-home service for migrant farmworkers and “Winter Texans”—retirees flocking back to the Rio Grande Valley for another season of warm November mornings like this. But just as Snipes began to speak, an olive-drab military helicopter— part of President Trump’s troop surge at the border— drowned out his welcome message. “Grandaddy would have never believed that,” Snipes said, his white cassock billowing. “It’s like a priest saying mass in a war zone.” The military presence only foreshadowed what might be an even starker federal presence at the chapel: La Lomita stands in the proposed path of President Trump’s border wall. Last year, more than 160,000 people crossed the border illegally in the Rio Grande Valley, making the region a top priority for border wall construction. Customs and Border Protection maps from July 2017 showed the agency planned to build a wall segment just yards from La Lomita, which means “little hill.” At best, the plan seemed to leave the chapel on the Mexico-facing side of the wall—a liminal “ no-man’s land ” south of the wall, but north of the border itself. At worst, advocates feared the chapel could be bulldozed. Then, on February 14, Congress funded 55 miles of new walls in the Rio Grande Valley, and wrote protections for the chapel into the bill. For a moment, La Lomita seemed safe. But then President Trump declared a national emergency to unlock more wall-building money than Congress had allowed. Administration officials claimed that the Congressional restrictions don't apply to the national emergency funds, leaving the chapel’s future again uncertain. CBP planned to build the wall at the base of the flood levee behind the chapel (Jeremy Raff) In November, I met art professor and activist Scott Nicol at La Lomita. Nicol, who has been fighting the border wall since the Bush-era Secure Fence Act, brought a large roll of measuring tape to see whether the chapel would fall within CBP’s planned “enforcement zone”— a 150-foot strip extending from the base of the wall, clear-cut of vegetation, featuring a gravel road, stadium lighting, and surveillance equipment. Starting at the base of the flood levee, where the wall would be built, Nicol unspooled the measuring tape, and reached the adobe structure after about 90 feet. The entire chapel falls within the enforcement zone, and its presence seemed clearly incompatible with CBP’s construction plans. In an email, a CBP spokesperson said the agency did not have plans to remove the chapel and is “working to minimize or avoid impact to sensitive areas such as La Lomita Chapel,” but declined to rule out the possibility. “That’s why we’re concerned that the chapel could be destroyed,” said Nicol. That week, the government inked two contracts with a Galveston-based construction company to build eight miles of wall near La Lomita. Advocates ramped up their campaign to defend the chapel, nearby wildlife sanctuaries, and the private landowners who stood to lose their riverside property to the government. Valley residents have lost homes, backyards, and businesses to the no-man’s land created by Bush and Obama-era walls. Pamela Taylor, a homeowner who has lived on the Mexico-facing side of the wall for a decade, deadpanned, “We live in a gated community.” Fred Cavazos could lose his land to the border wall (Jeremy Raff) Fred Cavazos’s 77-acres of riverfront property has been in his family since a mid-18th century Spanish land grant to his ancestors. Cavazos, who uses a wheelchair, rents out thirty riverfront plots for camping, fishing, and jet skiing on the Rio Grande. Three tenants are Border Patrol agents, and Father Roy Snipes docks his old motor boat there. The income, about $30,000 a year, supports Cavazos and his sister. The planned border wall would leave the property in the no-man’s land, behind a 30-foot wall. “Who would want to lease?” Cavazos worried. “I don’t think I’ll have any tenants left.” Roy Snipes began teaching in an unincorporated Rio Grande Valley town in 1968. He loved “the old culture of sweet hospitality,” and saw its embodiment in La Lomita— quiet, open-air, no electricity. On his first visit, he was “impressed with the simplicity and the humility.” He imagined the band of priests on horseback who proselytized along the Rio Grande in the mid-19th century, when the border itself was brand new. A sepia-toned photograph shows seven of them dressed in black— the“Cavalry of Christ.” After six years of teaching, Snipes joined their order, The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, and took his final vows at La Lomita in 1980. Known locally as the “cowboy priest,” Snipes is a little like Mr. Rogers with a Stetson and a love for Lone Star, the “national beer of Texas.” These days, his horseback riding is mostly confined to the yearly citrus parade in downtown Mission, which is named after those early missionaries. Instead of a horse, Snipes drives a Suburban that permanently smells like his dozen or so rescue dogs, but he did stick a Cavalry of Christ decal on the rear door. Roy Snipes, the “cowboy priest” (Jeremy Raff) Most afternoons, Snipes unlocks his boat at the Cavazos dock for a sunset cruise on the Rio Grande. “We’re off like a herd of turtles,” he said on a warm fall evening, the motor coughing. Snipes waved to neighbors on both banks— to the north, Winter Texas at a trailer park, to the south picnicking Mexican families. Past dusk, Snipes idled above the technical, imaginary, U.S.-Mexico line—the middle of the glassy river. The chapel’s white adobe was visible through the trees, illuminated by solar lights Snipes installed himself. “When the craziness of the world is wounding your heart you can come here,” he said. But now, it seemed as if the river and the chapel themselves needed respite. Border wall construction at La Lomita was uncertain, but militarization in the area is well underway. In the days before the 2018 midterm election, President Trump deployed 5,900 troops to the border. “It’s meant to intimidate people from the other side who might want to come across,” said Snipes. “But it is scaring people here.” Mission is 88 percent Latino, and many families have mixed immigration status. Snipes worried that even if the church remained technically accessible, it can become functionally out of reach. “Would they start asking people for papers?” he wondered aloud. “Of course, if you got blue eyes, they may not ask you for papers.” Snipes on the Rio Grande (Jeremy Raff) A few miles downriver from La Lomita, soldiers strung up rows of concertina wire, razor-blades glinting in the sun. It was a compelling picture, and five Army public affairs units armed with late-model digital cameras churned out news-ready images. The major TV networks congregated at a vast tent camp that soldiers had erected next to the Donna-Rio Bravo International Bridge. The stated target of the mission— a large group of asylum-seeking migrants trekking through Mexico—was still 2,000 miles away. There wasn’t much for the soldiers to do. In Washington, Pentagon officials “derided the deployment as an expensive waste of time and resources,” The New York Times reported. In Donna, a soldier who grew up in the valley told me the whole thing was “kind of surreal.” A week later, priests from the border towns of Brownsville and Roma gathered at Snipes’s place for a “bachelor Thanksgiving” replete with Lone Star, canned beans, and instant mashed potatoes. “La Lomita is at the wrong place at the wrong time,” said Father Pablo Wilhelm from Roma, Texas, a trafficking hotspot. “The razor wire is an escalation...it’s like a war’s been declared.” Michael Amesse, of Brownsville, said he was the “odd man out” because he had voted for Trump. “We’re going a little too far in labelling the president in being a fear monger,” he said. “There’s people that are ready to barge the border—do we have a right to just let that happen?” But despite his sympathy for Trump, Amesse’s views did not easily comport with the president’s. Technology was far more effective than walls, he said, and he routinely brought food to desperate asylum seekers camped out in Matamoros, just across the international bridge, not far from his church. Troops installed razor wire on the bank of the Rio Grande in Hidalgo, Texas (Jeremy Raff) Snipes strained for hope. He called the federal encroachment “a fortunate fracaso,” or failure, because both the military presence and the proposed border wall threw the chapel’s own symbolic power into high relief. “The symbols clash,” said Snipes. “The symbol of La Lomita is that we want to be humble and kind, and hospitable.” In federal court last fall, as the Catholic Church sought to block construction at La Lomita, its lawyers too argued that the wall was a kind of symbolic opposite of the chapel that would block parishioners from worshipping there. “The proposed border wall is fundamentally inconsistent with Catholic values and, if completed, would substantially burden the free exercise of religion,” lawyers for the church wrote in a December motion. In February, the judge allowed the surveying to go forward days before Congress wrote protections for the chapel into its border wall funding bill. “Opposing the wall doesn't mean we want to have an open border,” Snipes told me, “but it does mean we really want to treat people the way we would like to be treated.” Quietly but routinely, Snipes offers sanctuary to immigrants who approach the church seeking help. The week before bachelor Thanksgiving, a Guatemalan man named Carlos knocked on Snipes’s office door in a fit of desperation. He said he had been kidnapped by the fearsome Gulf Cartel and held for ransom for more than three months. Such kidnappings in this part of the border have become commonplace in recent years as criminal syndicates have mined migrants for profit, a University of Texas study found. Finally, Carlos said, one of his jailers took pity on him and dropped him at the nearest church when the boss wasn’t around. Now he was staying in one of Snipes’s makeshift shelters— a donated RV, a Winter Texan hand-me-down. Carlos’s hands trembled as he told the story. “Now you can rest and breathe and give thanks to God,” Snipes said when he was finished. “Later, we’ll figure out the best way forward.” There is little that authorities could do to persuade Snipes to withhold such help. “There's a much more profound and powerful law that says I have to do that,” he said. Less than a week after President Trump declared the national emergency, five lawsuits had already challenged it in court. If those suits can’t stop construction, powerful “ border barons ” who support Trump but don’t want the wall on their land might. Andrea Chavez Garza at La Lomita (Jeremy Raff) In Mission, where emblems of the chapel decorate the town’s welcome sign, the streetlights, and even the trash bins, the prospect of a wall has only sharpened local appreciation for La Lomita. On the day of the welcome-home mass, Snipes and three dogs streamed out of the Suburban with a small crowd already gathering. “Looking good in the neighborhood,” Snipes said. He greeted 82-year-old Andrea Chavez Garza, who visits the chapel almost everyday to pray and sing. “A day I don't come is not a day for me,” she said. “This church is my refuge.” Snipes introduced her to the Winter Texans, and she approached the microphone to recite a psalm and thank the crowd. “Stay united when I go to heaven,” she advised. “I don’t know why they want to build a wall here,” Chavez shrugged before her face turned serious. “I say over my dead body.”",A “cowboy priest” confronts the wall and the military presence on the banks of the Rio Grande.,2019-02-24T19:29:27Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",The Chapel at the Border,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trumps-border-wall-threatens-loma-lomita-chapel/583447/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/Border_Chapel_LR_5/facebook.jpg?1551035972,,Theatlantic.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JEFF AMY,"ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) An unusual flood is submerging thousands of square miles of Mississippi’s Delta region.
Water is rising behind a levee and is predicted to cause record flooding.
The Yazoo Backwater Levee protects thousands of square miles of the Mississippi Delta region from even worse flooding that could come from the Mississippi River. But when officials close a floodgate keeping out the big river, water draining from the north has nowhere to go, rising inside the levee.
That gate has been closed since Feb. 15 and region is on track for the worst flood since 1973.

,"At a Glance
Offutt Air Force Base, home to U.S. Strategic Command, is fighting floodwaters.
A Nebraska farmer was killed trying to rescue a stranded motorist. Two others are missing.
Another Nebraska man was swept away by floodwaters in Iowa and later died.
Rivers have reached historic levels in 41 locations across the Midwest, creating devastating flooding that has killed at least three people, forced countless evacuations, breached dams and levees, damaged hundreds of homes and flooded a military base.
The death toll from the flooding rose to three when an unidentified man died after refusing to leave his home, NBC News reported. In addition, a Norfolk, Nebraska, man died and two others were injured when they drove around a flood barrier in Freemont County, Iowa, on Friday and were swept away. On Thursday, a Nebraska farmer died after attempting a rescue in high water. 
Two other men are missing and presumed dead in Nebraska.
The deaths add weight to the grim statistics in the ongoing flood disaster. On Sunday, the Sarpy County Nebraska Sheriff's office said that at least 500 homes were ruined by floodwaters that overtopped two levees in the county. 
The total number of homes and businesses lost in the disaster is likely much greater.

The entire town of Pacific Junction, Iowa, was ordered to evacuate late Sunday because of two levee failures and a confirmed levee breach on the Missouri River, the Mills County Sheriff's Office reported. Gas and electricity were cut off to the town.
On the other side the river across from Pacific Junction, Offutt Air Force Base was restricted to ""mission essential personnel"" on Sunday after about a third of the base was cut off by rising floodwaters. Thirty buildings at the base south of Omaha have been inundated with as much as 8 feet of water, Tech. Sgt. Rachelle Blake, a 55th Wing spokeswoman, told the Omaha World-Herald. 
Thurman, Iowa, began evacuations about 7:30 a.m. Sunday EDT as fast moving water approached the town in the southwest corner of the state. The National Weather Service said the flooding was likely the result of levee breaches on the Missouri River. Areas of other Iowa towns had already evacuated, including Hamburg, Percival, McPaul and Bartlett.
Shortly after 3 p.m. Sunday, water topped a levee west of Hamburg as residents filled sandbags to build a retaining wall. 
We all take care of each other. We were all rubbing elbows, bagging sand together, helping each other out, said Taylor Parton, 67, who has lived in Hamburg for three years.

In St. Joseph, Missouri, where the river is expected to crest at 30.1 feet early this week, city officials asked volunteers to help fill sandbags. The goal, city spokesperson Mary Robinson told WDAF-TV, was to have 150,000 sandbags by Tuesday to add a 2-foot wall to the levee. 
Farther downstream, the Missouri is expected to crest above major flood stage in Atchison, Kansas, and just below that stage in Leavenworth, according to the National Weather Service. In Kansas City, where banks and levees are higher, its projected to crest at 32.4 feet, which is just above minor flood stage.

Douglas County West Community Schools in Valley, Nebraska, are closed for the week, the World-Herald reports. Many families in the district, which has about 980 students, have been evacuated from their homes, Superintendent Melissa Poloncic said.
Earlier in the weekend, flooding from the Elkhorn and Platte rivers turned Nebraska's sixth largest city into ""an island."" Fremont, Nebraska, which lies about 40 miles northwest of Omaha and is home to more than 26,000 residents, was cut off from the rest of the state Saturday when two levees were breached northwest of the city. Volunteers have spent much the weekend filling sandbags and lining them up to block water, the Fremont Tribune reported. 
Volunteers also helped set up shelters; Spanish teachers translated for those who didn't speak English, and cooks at the Hy-Vee grocery store worked with the American Red Cross to feed stranded people, the Omaha World-Herald reported. A pilot from Lincoln, Nebraska, landed at Freemont's airport to give three meat cutters at the WholeStone Farms plant a lift home, where they each had children waiting.
As long as we can help other people, thats what were doing, Adam Hunnel said.

Mike Wight, public information officer for the Nebraska Emergency Management Office, told weather.com they are keeping a close eye on the situation in Fremont. 
The rising Missouri River in the town of Brownville, Nebraska, meant officials began preparing to shut down the Cooper Nuclear Power Station if it was needed, according to a press release. 
Wight told weather.com there is ""concern"" for the nuclear plant but emphasized that it ""is perfectly safe.""
""We don't expect any safety issues but we do expect they will get flooding around them and if it gets too far they will shut it down,"" Wight said, adding that it will not be an ""issue with power supply"" because they can get power from other sources within the grid. 
On Sunday, the Nebraska Public Power District said in a release the plant was still operating at 100 percent and the river's water level had been stable for six hours.

On Saturday, Black Hawk helicopters were dropping 1.5-ton sandbags to protect wells that serve the city of Lincoln, home to more than 284,000 people. The wells are located on an island in the rising Platte River. 
After surveying the extensive flooding from the air, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said in a Friday press conference that it was the ""most widespread flooding damage we've had in the last half-century.""
""Even when we were away from the water system, we saw that the fields were very saturated,"" he added.

The U.S. Coast Guard closed all traffic Friday on a 70-mile stretch of the Missouri River from 50 miles south of Omaha, Nebraska, to St. Joseph, Missouri.
A Nebraska farmer identified as James Wilke, 50, was killed Thursday after the tractor he was using to attempt to rescue a stranded motorist was carried away by floodwaters, the Omaha World-Herald reported. The incident occurred at Shell Creek near Columbus in eastern Nebraska.
A 55-year-old Nebraska man died Friday night after being trapped by flooding in Riverton, Iowa, the Des Moines Register reported. Aleido Rojas Galan of Norfolk, Nebraska, and two other men were in a car that was swept away by floodwaters. All three were rescued, but Galan died on his way to the hospital, the Fremont County Sheriff's office said. The other two men were recovering in an Omaha hospital.
Also in Nebraska, two other men are missing and presumed dead. Scott E. Goodman, 30, of Norfolk was seen at 4 a.m. Thursday on top of his car near a levee that failed. It was reported that he was later seen being carried away by a surge of water, according to the Norfolk Daily News. 
A second, unidentified man may have been swept away Thursday when the Spencer Dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
When the dam failed, it caused a large ice floe to jam a hole in a small electrical plant, where employees were working. No other injuries were reported. The failure also forced the evacuation of dozens of residents along the river.
Chunks of ice from the Niobrara, some up to 2 feet thick, crashed into a gas station, a storage facility and a garage in the town of Niobrara, Nebraska, the World-Herald reported. The ice was left in piles 6 to 10 feet high around town.
Its total devastation. The ice just destroyed everything, said Laura Sucha, who lost the Country Cafe restaurant she has owned since 2015.
Also along the Niobrara, the three bridges that connected Boyd County to the rest of Nebraska were closed. The bridges south of Butte and Spencer were closed because of the flooding, and the so-called Mormon bridge in Niobrara washed away.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Critics say the Army Corps of Engineers never saw a flood control project it didn’t like. The agency is swinging for the fences again in 2019 with the rollout of what could be the most expensive public works project in the agency’s history.
What began as a $10 billion flood wall proposal to protect Galveston Island and the Houston Ship Channel ballooned to between $23 billion and $32 billion. The project, spurred by the devastation of Hurricane Ike in 2008, also got a new name to match its rising price tag.
Once called the “Ike Dike,” the megaproject is now named the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration plan.
The 70-mile “coastal barrier system,” drafted by the Army Corps and the Texas General Land Office, could be decades away from funding and construction. A feasibility study is receiving its first formal public review, and even proponents acknowledge that the network of flood walls, navigation gates, ring levees and coastal restoration projects could test the limits of government action.
“There are a lot of details that still need to be worked out,” Army Col. Lars Zetterstrom, commanding officer of the Army Corps’ Galveston District, said in a public meeting last month.
Meanwhile, opponents are mobilizing.
Residents of Galveston and the adjacent Bolivar Peninsula fear diminished or lost ocean views and shrinking property values. Taxpayer watchdogs are barking over the plan’s eye-popping cost estimates. Environmentalists warn that it would be nothing short of an ecosystem amputation for the Texas coast.
But virtually everyone agrees that the Texas coast is more vulnerable than ever. Warming oceans, sea-level rise and the prospect of stronger, wetter, more destructive hurricanes put the nation’s fifth-largest population center in the crosshairs of climate change.
Here are four more major flood projects expected to reach important milestones in 2019:
Fargo-Moorhead Area Diversion Project
Minnesota regulators last month approved a long-awaited permit to advance a $2.2 billion dam and diversion channel on the Red River of the North. The Red drains hundreds of square miles of farmland along the Minnesota-North Dakota border, but spring floods pose multibillion-dollar risk to two river cities, Fargo and Grand Forks, N.D. (Climatewire, Oct. 27, 2017).
Catastrophic flooding in 1997, 2009 and 2011 solidified federal and local determination to build a high dam, an embankment structure and a 36-mile diversion channel to bypass water around Fargo during spring floods. Scientists say inundations will become more common with climate warming.
The project stalled after a group of upstream landowners, joined by the state of Minnesota, claimed the project would flood private property and violate Minnesota’s floodplain laws. Negotiations between the states’ governors, followed by revisions to address Minnesota’s concerns, put the project back on track last month.
But Minnesota attached 54 conditions to its pending permit, driving the project’s cost to $2.75 billion. North Dakota lawmakers, facing an additional $300 million in shared costs, are grumbling in Bismarck. And a new landowner lawsuit appears to be brewing upriver. Stay tuned.
Folsom and Oroville dams
Northern California has a long and harried relationship with water impoundments, none more serious than the near-failure of the 770-foot Oroville Dam north of Sacramento in February 2017.
That’s when an undetected crack in one of the dam’s concrete spillways erupted as a winter storm filled Oroville Lake to near capacity. Nearly 190,000 people evacuated as officials scrambled to correct the problem. Days later, two seismic tremors in the same area sent a new wave of fear through the Sacramento Valley.
The California Department of Water Resources, which is responsible for the dam, spent hundreds of millions of dollars on repairs, whose cost is now projected to reach $1.1 billion. The state hopes to recoup 75 percent of that from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But FEMA says it might not pay the full amount after finding that the spillway failure could have been caused by poor maintenance and errors in design and construction.
Meanwhile, the Army Corps is working to expand the capacity of another massive reservoir, Folsom Lake, about 25 miles east of Sacramento in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The Army Corps is raising the lake’s primary dam by 3.5 feet.
Army Corps officials maintain that the Folsom project, which includes the recent construction of a second spillway, will improve flood protection for Sacramento, one of the nation’s most at-risk cities due to its location below the confluence of the Sacramento and American rivers.
The dam raising, combined with associated flood-control projects at Folsom Lake and along the Sacramento River, will come at a cost of nearly $3 billion.
Herbert Hoover Dike
The 143-mile levee ringing Florida’s Lake Okeechobee has been a thorn in the Army Corps’ side for decades.
Environmentalists may never forgive the agency for severing the Everglades from its primary water source nearly a century ago. The 60-year-old Herbert Hoover Dike has created or contributed to another set of environmental concerns, from toxic algae blooms to chronic seepage and risk of outright failure.
The Army Corps began reinforcing the dike in the early 2000s and spent more than $870 million on new flood control structures through 2016. But two unprecedented hurricane seasons since then, including some of the most powerful and rain-intensive storms on record, have made Floridians more nervous than ever that a storm tracking across “Lake O” could overtop the dike and send torrents of polluted water across South Florida.
After 2017’s Hurricane Irma, which crossed the Florida Peninsula north of the lake and raised water levels to a 12-year high, the Army Corps secured another $517 million in emergency funding to finish the job by 2022. The total cost: $1.7 billion.
Bluestone Dam’s safety assurance megaproject
The Army Corps does not use the word “project” lightly. So when it names something a “megaproject,” as it did with the expansion and rehabilitation of a 175-foot-high concrete dam on West Virginia’s New River, taxpayers should take notice.
The project, which calls for raising the 70-year-old dam by 8 feet and building an auxiliary spillway to reduce the risk of water overtopping the dam during heavy rains, has been ongoing since 2000. It received a major cash infusion last year when Congress allocated nearly $575 million to complete phases 4 and 5. The final cost will approach $800 million.
According to the Army Corps, Bluestone Dam provides flood control for an area nearly the size of Connecticut, and 50 percent of the water flowing through the state capital at Charleston flows through the dam. But its original design, which relied on the dam’s own weight to hold back water, was deemed insufficient to meet today’s flood risks. So the Army Corps is anchoring the dam’s foundation to bedrock while simultaneously increasing its holding capacity.
Bluestone dodged a bullet last year when Hurricane Florence made a northward turn before reaching the west side of the Appalachians, where a half-dozen rivers converge to charge Bluestone Lake.
The densely forested southern Appalachians are experiencing more significant disaster events, including river floods and fires that are expected to grow worse as the climate warms.

The Associated Press,"DEMOTTE, Ind. (AP) — A levee breach along the Kankakee River in northwestern Indiana has local officials urging about 30 homeowners to evacuate. Keener Township Volunteer Fire Chief Randy Woods says the breach was relatively minor when it was discovered about 3 p.m. Friday near Demotte, about 50 miles southeast of Chicago. He says some local residents tried to sandbag the breach “to get it under control, but it just got bigger and bigger.” Local firefighters were called out to help them, but eventually everyone had to pull out for their own safety. No injuries were reported. The National Weather Service says record flooding was occurring along the Kankakee following several days of heavy rains and snowmelt that have sent streams out of their banks from the Ohio River to Michigan and Wisconsin.","DEMOTTE, Ind.

Madeleine Rivera,"MISSION, Texas Marianna Trevino-Wright, executive director of the National Butterfly Center, is preparing for the inevitable. The 100-acre nature preserve on the U.S.-Mexico border sits in the path of a border wall that will soon be built. In more than three months, government contractors will begin work on the levee road that divides the property. “They will be clearing all the trees and vegetation from this area to create their enforcement zone. They’re going to excavate the earth and levee, put in an 18-foot vertical concrete slab wall, and on top of that 18-foot steel bollards,” said Trevino-Wright. In the last two weeks, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, announced the construction of two additional border walls in Hidalgo County in southern Texas. One wall would stretch six miles and cut through the preserve, and the other would span eight miles. Both contracts were awarded to Galveston-based SLSCO Ltd. The two projects, totaling $312 million, would begin in February. The National Butterfly Center in Mission is just one of several places that would be affected by the new border wall. (Fox News) The government in the beginning stages of building the border wall, recently started issuing right of entry requests, giving them the right to explore the land to figure out where to best put up the wall. That has set up a potential battle between the government and longtime landowners in the area where the wall will go up. “For some of (the landowners), the land has been there for generations. It’s very meaningful to them,” said Efren Olivares, legal director for Racial and Economic Justice at the Texas Civil Rights Project, who has been working with several other landowners in the Valley, advising them on their rights and the government’s right of entry requests. “That’s why they don’t want it destroyed by building a wall through it.” Some believe the wall would degrade their property. “We’re going to lose 70 percent of our land to the border wall because the border wall is not on the border,” said Trevino-Wright, who has been fighting the project since July 2017. “In some places, the habitat would be bulldozed entirely.” The expected construction site in the National Butterfly Center is located about one mile north of the Rio Grande River, which divides the United States and Mexico. In October, the Trump administration waived 28 environmental and public-health laws to make way for the construction of 18 miles of border wall. While some local landowners here are against the wall, others are in favor of it, arguing they are fed up with migrants illegally entering the country through their land. The new wall would run along this levee road of the National Butterfly Center, separating 70 acres on the southern section of the levee. (Fox News) Othal Brand, president of Hidalgo County Water Improvement District 3, also received a right of entry request – but he was happy about it. “Some people say ‘oh, you want a wall?’ I believe in securing the border,” Brand said. “For those that live in a city, they can have a level of security and safety. But those of use that work outside of the city and work along the river, it is a totally different environment.” Brand, who has lived and worked along the river for generations, already has a border wall running through his land. He said he noticed a drop in illegal activity after it was built. Conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the move, saying it will destroy the area’s wildlife and natural habitat. But, security experts believe there’s a reason why the locations were chosen. “I do understand the unfortunate nature of some of these locations. On the flip side, though, you’re having these walls constructed in areas where you have heavy smuggling operations in both directions, which I think is an important aspect to remember here,” said Fred Burton, chief security officer at Stratfor. U.S. Customs and Border Protection have called the Rio Grande Valley Sector the busiest in the country for illegal activity. (Fox News) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has called the Rio Grande the busiest sector in the country. In the 2017 fiscal year, they arrested 137,000 illegal border crossers and seized 260,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,192 pounds of cocaine. CBP said they’ve met with landowners not only to request access to the property for survey but to also listen to their concerns. “Concerns are captured in order to incorporate them into the design of the wall,” CBP officials said. Olivares is pushing for the CBP to hold an open community meeting, which he said has not been done. He said the format would allow for more productive dialogue instead of individual meetings with agents. “We are trying to tell them (the landowners) that they have rights,” Olivares said. “They don’t have to do what the government tells them to do.”","Fox News As border wall goes up in Texas, some local landowners put up a fight, others welcome it Fox News MISSION, Texas – Marianna Trevino-Wright, executive director of the National Butterfly Center, is preparing for the inevitable.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/anna-giaritelli,"A U.S. company is offering to build 234 miles of President Trump's border wall for just $1.4 billion, a fraction of the $8 billion the Trump administration is hoping to use for that project. 
Fisher Sand and Gravel Company's President and CEO Tommy Fisher said the government is overpaying and said that for $4.31 billion, he can build the wall and incorporate paved roads and border technology plus warranty. 
""Our whole point is to break through the government bureaucracy,"" Fisher told the Washington Examiner. ""If they do the small procurements as they are now thats not going to cut it."" 
Of the $8 billion Trump is hoping to spend, he already has $1.375 billion of that amount from Congress, which can only be used to build fencing in the Rio Grande Valley. Trump is seeking to repurpose another $3.1 billion in defense funding for more border wall and $3.6 billion more through his emergency declaration that Congress and the courts will challenge. 
Fisher said that the roughly $1.4 billion is enough to build 20 miles of levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley, plus another 214 miles. That pot of money, however, can only be used in the Rio Grande Valley, according to the bill Congress passed approving those funds and was only expected to be used for about 55 miles of steel slat fencing. 
The Army Corps of Engineers is not ready to start looking at how to spend the $8 billion Trump seized in his national emergency order last month, a representative told the Washington Examiner last week. The corps is considering how to spend money Congress gave DHS last fiscal year and has not requested bids from the private sector because it's still in the procurement process. 
Replacement and new wall projects have struggled to get underway in Trump's first two years in office. Just 35 miles of wall have gone up in that time. The Army Corps of Engineers has procured around 75 miles but has not awarded $900 million for the project of the $1.35 billion that was in the 2018 omnibus. 
DHS officials and several lawmakers are expected to visit the site of his border wall construction site in Arizona next week.","Company offers to build 234 miles of border wall for $1.4 billion...

Margery A. Beck,"OMAHA, Neb. — Authorities were using boats and large vehicles Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. And in Freemont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River.
The flooding followed days of snow and rain — record-setting, in some places — that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Neb., said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilke’s death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water, and another man was swept away by water when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte, and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Freemont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Service’s Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
‘‘What we’re having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event that’s going to happen in early April,’’ he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford, and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.",Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads.,2019-03-16T20:39:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bostonglobe.com'}","Rescues, evacuations underway as floodwaters breach levees in Midwest",https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2019/03/16/rescues-evacuations-underway-floodwaters-breach-levees-midwest/uzPMvzsZAiTBUHnUbQcRNL/story.html,https://www.bostonglobe.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2019/03/16/BostonGlobe.com/National/Images/922eb09fb9fe414a82f67079e55d430a-922eb09fb9fe414a82f67079e55d430a-0.jpg,,Bostonglobe.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chris D'Angelo,"LUMBERTON, North Carolina — In the days before Hurricane Florence struck, officials and residents here scrambled in an effort to minimize the impact of flooding that the massive storm would bring. They used sandbags to plug a gap in the levee on the southwest side of town. And on Sunday, crews with bulldozers worked frantically to reinforce the temporary berm in hopes of holding back the floodwaters. It was here that waters from Hurricane Matthew entered town in 2016, devastating entire neighborhoods. The makeshift wall ultimately could not withstand the powerful rains that have been unleashed by Florence, now a tropical depression. Emily Jones, a spokeswoman for Robeson County, confirmed that the barrier broke around 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon. The levee remains intact. Jones stressed that residents in low-lying areas “need to get out now.” A mandatory evacuation order is in place for the south part of town. At the city water plant, which lies just east of the levee gap, Lumberton’s public works department used excavators in the days before Florence hit the coast to construct a giant berm around the facility’s water pumps and backup generators. The infrastructure was inundated during Matthew, and it took weeks and around $2 million to get the plant back online, according to Corey Walters, the deputy director of public works for the city of Lumberton. “We’re throwing everything we got at it,” he said of Florence on Thursday. “Matthew was only two years ago. It’s still very fresh in everybody’s mind,” he added. “We’re still trying to get over it. That’s just what is horrible about the whole thing.” The Lumber River crested at more than 24 feet during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, highest in history according to the National Weather Service. Water flowed through an underpass beneath the I-95 highway during that storm and caused catastrophic flooding that displaced more than 1,500 residents for months. About 27.8 percent of county’s residents lived under the poverty line in 2017, more than twice the U.S. Census Bureau’s national rate of 13.4 percent. Lumberton residents in the low-lying areas surrounding the river ― the most likely to lose their homes ― are in one of the poorest communities in Robeson County. Jeff Wade moved to Lumberton from Lynchburg, Virginia, in February 2017 to help with Hurricane Matthew recovery and has been helping to rebuild dozens of homes flooded during Matthew. “I worry that Florence may be more than people can handle,” Wade told HuffPost on Thursday. Lisa Hardin’s home is located on the bank of the Lumber River, among the flood-damaged homes on the south end of Lumberton. It took Hardin nearly two years after the devastation of Matthew to rebuild her life, she told HuffPost on Thursday ahead of Florence’s landfall. “Leave it in the Lord’s hands,” she said. “Pray about it. That’s all I can do.”","A Robeson county official confirmed a temporary berm in Lumberton has been damaged and urged residents to ""get out now.""",2018-09-16T21:25:30Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Florence Flooding Breaches Makeshift Levee Reinforcement In North Carolina,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florence-berm-lumberton-north-carolina_us_5b9e9fdfe4b046313fbc2020,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ead452200008300da200e.jpeg?ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paulina Dedaj,"Tropical Storm Gordon is continuing to gain strength Tuesday morning and is expected to become a hurricane later in the day when it hits the central U.S. Gulf Coast, including coastal Mississippi. Voluntary evacuation orders were issued on Monday for parts of Louisiana for residents in areas outside the levee protection system. Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Monday and said 200 National Guard troops will be deployed to southeastern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center said at 8 p.m. ET that the storm was centered 95 miles west of Fort Myers, Florida. Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 60 mph. After making landfall, it is expected to charge inland over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. The hurricane warning was placed into effect for the area stretching from the mouth of the Pearl River in Mississippi to the Alabama-Florida border. As much as 8 inches of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm could unleash ""life-threatening"" storm surge to portions of the central Gulf Coast. A storm surge warning has been issued for the area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama. The warning means there is danger of life-threatening inundation. The region could see rising waters of 3 to 5 feet. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,"" the center said. Gordon is expected to dissipate by Saturday somewhere in the central U.S. After periods of heavy rainfall, flood advisories were in effect for parts of South Florida late Monday. Tropical Storm Gordon is the Atlantic basin’s seventh named storm of the year. Fox News’ Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Hindu,"The capital city with its charming palaces and heritage buildings, many of which have fallen into ruins or been replaced by ugly concrete blocks, still has a few buildings and locations that hark back to a gracious past. Some of those places have been aesthetically repurposed for cultural events that enhance the vintage surroundings of the venue.
 Foremost amongst the lot is the Kuthiramalika Palace, where the annual Swathi Sangeethotsavam is held. It commemorates the musical legacy of Swathi Thirunal, ruler of erstwhile Travancore, who built the Palace. 
MetroPlus explores five such heritage venues in the city. 
KUTHIRAMALIKA PALACE
Granite pillars, wooden eaves, wide, pillared verandahs and courtyards make up the facade of the Palace. For the next 10 days, the quiet and sleepy surroundings of the heritage Kuthiramalika Palace in the heart of the city will be the venue of the annual Swathi Sangeethotsavam. Built by Swathi Thirunal around 1840, the palace now houses a museum and is a popular place for tourists. But the vast grounds of the palace comes into its own during the festival. 
The stage for the musicians, both veterans and newcomers, is a raised platform surrounded by stone pillars, situated right beneath a spacious room with an alcove from where one can see the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. The royal musician is believed to have composed many of his latter-day compositions in this very room. During the festival that begins today, traditional lamps, garlands of flowers and festoons of tender coconut leaves lent the place a festive look, as leading musicians from India celebrate the composers legacy by singing his kritis. 
Legends like DK Pattammal, M Balamuralikrishna, Bismillah Khan, Gangubai Hangal and Kishori Amonkar have held court here. Modern-day stalwarts such as Sanjay Subrahmanyam, TM Krishna, Ajoy Chakravorthy, Pandit M Venkatesh Kumar, Lalgudi siblings and Amrutha Venkatesh have all performed in the festival organised by vocalist Rama Varma, heir to Swathis musical legacy. Sanjay Subrahmanyam has been performing here without a break for the last 12 years.

LEVEE HALL
Levee Hall, the old audience hall of the erstwhile Travancore royals, was originally constructed in the early decades of the 19th century. The Levee Hall that we see today is the result of many additions, made by subsequent rulers, to the original structure. Located inside the sprawling Valiya Kottaram complex, the Levee Hall lies adjacent to the Krishna Vilasam palace. 
The older section of the Levee Hall is a simple double-storied rectangular structure with a poomukham facing east; an ornate gable adds to the beauty of the poomukham. However, today, the entry to the Levee Hall is through a grand portico on the western side. The entranceway is supported on six columns, fashioned in the neoclassical style. The western elevation of the structure is in stark contrast to the eastern façade, which still retains elements of traditional Kerala architecture.
An arched door opens to the spacious Levee Hall, flanked on either side by rectangular courtyards. Old Belgian mirrors in their ornate frames, crystal chandeliers, the rich patterns of the floor tiles, and grand regal portraits of the Travancore kings add to the vintage charm of the Levee Hall. In the olden days, the Levee Hall was where the Travancore rulers gave special audience to distinguished guests and top officials. The Levees conducted in association with the Tirunal (royal birthday) celebrations as well as the parties hosted by the royal family were held here. Today, Levee Hall is a venue for many cultural activities such as music recitals and book releases.

POOJAPPURA MANDAPAM
Poojappura Mandapam, the beautiful pavilion crafted out of stone, is a typical example of Dravidian architecture that prevailed in Southern India. This pavilion was once known as Vijaya Mandapam, probably due to its proximity to Vijaya Vilsam, a palace that existed near it. 
The sizeable pavilion has a two-layer concentric plan, with an inner square platform slightly elevated from the rest and flanked by four ornate pillars reaching up to the ceiling. The outer section of the pavilion has 16 finely crafted columns. These columns support the structural beams, over which the roof is laid with finely hewn stone blocks. The fine carvings adorning the surface of the columns indicate the importance of the structure, for it is not simply a pavilion that was used as a halting place for weary travellers. The pavilion transforms into a hallowed spot during the Navarathri celebrations. Kumaraswamy, the commander-in-chief of the celestial warriors, is taken to Poojappura for the Vijayadasami celebrations. 
From the time of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma to the reign of the last ruler of erstwhile Travancore, Sree Chithira Tirunal Bala Rama Varma, the grand procession to Poojapura, the Poojappura Ezhunnalathu, used to be conducted with great pomp.

VJT HALL
Victoria Jubilee Town Hall, a.k.a. VJT Hall, was built to commemorate the golden jubilee of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1896. Inaugurated by Sree Mulam Tirunal Rama Varma on January 25, 1896, the hall was the venue of the first meeting of the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly. It also functioned as the Legislative Assembly till 1939. 
Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Ayyankali, Mannathu Padmanabhan and Mahakavi Kumaran Asan have addressed meetings here. It underwent a massive renovation in 1999. The gracious, historic building has now become a venue for all kinds of sales and exhibitions and meetings.

BAND STAND, NAPIER MUSEUM
Band Stand holds a place of pride on the sprawling, landscaped campus of Napier Museum. The circular structure, designed more like a mandapam, with elements of traditional Kerala architecture, was built in the 19th century during the reign of Ayilyam Thirunal Rama Varma. Records state that Robert Chisholm, the architect of the Museum, designed the stand as an ornamental focal point of the upper garden or the Botanical Garden. It hosted the band of the Travancore Nair Brigade on all Fridays and later, till the 80s, the police band used to perform here, on Saturdays. The structure has special acoustics with eight speakers concealed above the stone pillars. That helped when broadcast of programmes of Akashavani began. It continues even now, from 5 pm to 9.30 pm daily. Until a few years ago, the venue had seen performances of Koodiyattam and Nangiarkoothu, especially those organised by the Kutiyattam Kendra. That has been discontinued for the time being. However, now that the structure has been renovated, the space can once again become a performance space.

Under current law, state inspectors are required to examine the condition of dams, but don’t have specified timelines. Last year, after strong rainfall across Northern California, the Oroville Dam reached capacity and its main spillway was severely damaged. The threat of the spillway’s failure led to a sudden evacuation order due to fear of flooding and levee failures for miles around the dam.","Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox linked gay people with “transvestites,” polygamists and people who have sex with animals at a presidential debate more than a decade ago.",2018-02-13T00:05:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Latimes.com'}","GOP candidate for California governor John Cox once linked gay rights to polygamy, bestiality",http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-gop-candidate-for-california-governor-1518478473-htmlstory.html,http://www.latimes.com/resizer/f2pf_w_qelVjTDsq0F9ystFQy7I=/1200x0/www.latimes.com/resizer/Og0zr9Xpx1Owy0llIs3vuFCduBQ=/1400x0/www.latimes.com/resizer/w7a7jXCZlB3Wi6fid1NXnyg2j-c=/1400x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5a726738/turbine/la-lb-media-cox-pic-20180131-170241/900,,Latimes.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(CNN) - Heavy flooding continued in Nebraska Friday, and the state along with other states in the Midwest are gearing up for days and even weeks of water-logged misery.
""As snow and rain pass, many communities have experienced devastating flooding. This could last for quite some time,"" Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said Friday.
At least 37 people were rescued from flood waters Thursday and rescues continued Friday, said Nebraska National Guard Adjutant General Daryl L. Bohac during a Friday afternoon briefing. No fatalities have yet been reported.
Nebraska and other parts of the Midwest are coping with heavy flooding this weekend in the wake of a powerful ""bomb cyclone"" as well as from the natural snow melt during spring thaw, forecasters said.
Communities in that state as well as others in Iowa and South Dakota remain under a flood warning for rain and snow melt Friday.
""Nebraskans should watch the weather and waterways in their communities closely in the coming days, and be prepared for historic levels of flooding even if it has not hit their community yet,"" Ricketts said. "" As Nebraskans know, conditions can change quickly, and everyone needs to be prepared.""
Historic floods draw comparisons to 2011
Bohac stated that in some ways, the flooding being seen across Nebraska is dangerous than historic flooding the state experienced in 2011.
""If you think about to 2011, just to give you a contrast, the National Guard operations were putting soldiers and airmen on the levees to monitor their stability and other issues. We did not run one rescue operation in that flood,"" Bohac said. ""This is a different environment than we experienced in 2011. More complex and in some ways more dangerous.""
The 2011 summer flood left five dead, caused more than $2 billion dollars in damage and flooded out 4,000 homes, according to CNN affiliate WOWT-TV. The flood of 2011 spanned the entire summer, WOWT reported, causing problems all along the Missouri River.
Omaha Fire Chief Dan Olsen said Friday the Nebraska National Guard has deployed Black Hawk helicopters to a couple of rescues across the state. Chief Olsen said multiple pieces of equipment, boats, helicopters, large vehicles and even tractors are being used to navigate flooded roads. Along with aerial support from the National Guard, Chief Olsen urged residents who are told to evacuate to leave their homes, and not to wait before it's too late.
Omaha rescue crews have transported several people suffering from hypothermia as a result of the flooding, Olsen said.
Olsen also said that while there are dive team members on standby and other emergency rescue members are being deployed ""into very serious and dangerous waters,"" they can only do so much.
""There comes a point where it's very possible, although we'll do our absolute best and risk our all to try to get to you, there may be instances where it's just not possible for us to do that,"" he said.
Levees fail and nuclear plant prepares to shut down 
The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency opened a State Emergency Operation Center after an emergency declaration on Tuesday in response to the flooding and blizzards.
Omaha, which expects the Missouri River to crest at 33.7 feet on Sunday, has been working to make sure the city is protected.
""Omaha has 13 miles of flood control on the Missouri River. The levee is safe and the river is not expected to compromise the levee. The levee is being monitored as a precaution,"" Mayor Jean Stothert said Thursday.
The Cooper Nuclear Station near Brownville, about 80 miles south of Omaha, is taking additional precautions to ensure safety at the plant, Mark Becker, spokesman for the Nebraska Public Power District told CNN Friday.
The plant issued a notice to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Friday morning of an unusual event as the water levels along the Missouri River reached the procedural limit.
Becker expects the water to rise another foot or so, and at that point additional safety precautions will be put in place like sandbagging doorways to protect equipment. The plant has already placed sandbags in key external sites.
The National Weather Service predicts the Missouri River will crest at 2 a.m. Saturday morning, and if it reaches the predicted level the reactor will shut down at the power plant. Becker told CNN personnel will remain at the plant to ensure safety.
""We've had a very cold winter, the ground is frozen, there's currently between 8 inches to a foot of snow melting, followed by rains and additional snow. A lot of rivers in Nebraska are flooding, which is creating this issue,"" Becker said.
Olsen said ""rescues are ongoing"" in the area, including National Guard helicopter missions, and some evacuees have been transported to the hospital.
Olsen and other authorities who briefed reporters at the Douglas County Emergency Management office are concerned that people staying in their homes too long may be difficult to evacuate.
Earlier Friday, a levee failure in east-central Nebraska spurred a flash flood emergency as forecasters urged citizens to '""move to higher ground now.""
The emergency is for areas around Valley, west of Omaha, between the Platte and Elkhorn rivers after a levee failed on the Union Dike, the National Weather Service said.
The Omaha-Valley weather service office said it was evacuating its personnel.
""This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation,"" the weather service said. ""Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.""
Nebraska Game and Parks Commission employees used a fan boat to rescue residents in Gretna. The Mead Fire Department was helping people near Horseshoe Lake. The Columbus Police Department warned residents to stay away from the Black Bridge. One person is believed to be missing in Boyd County when a dam collapsed and a house was washed downstream.
State of emergency declared in Wisconsin 
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency Friday due to statewide flooding.
""Rapid snowmelt and rain have caused flooding that has impacted homes, businesses, and cities and towns across Wisconsin,"" Evers said in a tweet. ""Today I declared a State of Emergency to provide additional personnel and resources as needed to assist in emergency response and recovery operations.""
About 300 people have been evacuated in Wisconsin, Lori Getter of the Wisconsin Emergency Management told CNN Friday. No fatalities have been reported.
Southern Wisconsin towns battled high waters and a flood warning in effect till Saturday morning. The region is experiencing road closings as a result of flooding caused by the snow melt, rainfall, frozen ground and ice jams, the weather service said.
In Fond du Lac, flooding was occurring on the Fond du Lac River due to an ice jam, forecasters said, while other areas affected included Lodi in Columbia County, Darlington in Lafayette County, Prairie du Sac in Sauk County and DeForest in Dane County.
""Things have calmed down, we still have some flooding going on, but rivers are leveling up and water is receding,"" Getter said.
The problem with the snow, Getter said, is that when it melts the water has nowhere to go.
""This is going to take a while to clean because winter or spring flooding is different from any other flooding. We still have to keep an eye on the snow that continues to melt,"" Getter said.
'Bomb cyclone' heads north to Canada
The intense bomb cyclone that brought blizzard conditions to the region was moving into Canada on Friday.
Dangerous weather conditions were expected for millions who are under some sort of watch, warning or advisory as it heads east and then north.
A bomb cyclone occurs when there is a rapid pressure drop, with a decrease of at least 24 millibars -- a measure of atmospheric pressure -- over 24 hours. This storm dropped 33 millibars from Tuesday into Wednesday.
""Although the focus of the bomb cyclone was clearly on the blizzard side, the area east of the low picked up significantly heavy rains on top of existing snowpack and frozen ground that was unable to absorb any of the rain and water runoff,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.",Parts of Midwest face heavy flooding after 'bomb cyclone' Channel3000.com - WISC-TV3 Flash flood emergency forces evacuations in areas west of Omaha CNN 'Bomb cyclone' hits Midwest after paralyzing Colorado (with photos) Globe Gazette The March 2019 'bomb cyc…,2019-03-15T14:58:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Channel3000.com'}",Parts of Midwest face heavy flooding after 'bomb cyclone' - Channel3000.com - WISC-TV3,https://www.channel3000.com/weather/parts-of-midwest-face-heavy-flooding-after-bomb-cyclone/1059776389,https://static.lakana.com/mmm-global-us-east-1/photo/2019/03/15/Nebraska%20flooding.jpg_37754028_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg,,Channel3000.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel Yang,"Journalist Connie Chung penned an open letter supporting Christine Blasey Ford, while for the first time publicly sharing her own experience with sexual assault. Chung addresses the letter, published Wednesday in the Washington Post, to Ford, who gave testimony on Thursday to the Senate that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school in 1982. While Ford’s assault happened 36 years ago, Chung says her trusted family doctor molested her 50 years ago and she “kept my dirty little secret to myself.” “The exact date and year are fuzzy. But details of the event are vivid — forever seared in my memory,” Chung writes. “Am I sure who did it? Oh yes, 100 percent.” She says the assault happened in the 1960s when she was in college, when she went to the doctor for birth-control pills, an IUD, or a diaphragm. What started as a routine gynecological examination — Chung recalls getting on the examination table and feeling the cold iron stirrups — became traumatizing. “While I stared at the ceiling, his right index finger massaged my clitoris. With his right middle finger inserted in my vagina, he moved both fingers rhythmically. He coached me verbally in a soft voice, ‘Just breathe. Ah-ah,'” mimicking the sound of soft breathing. ‘You’re doing fine,’ he assured me,” Chung says. “Suddenly, to my shock, I had an orgasm for the first time in my life. My body jerked several times. Then he leaned over, kissed me, a peck on my lips, and slipped behind the curtain to his office area.” Chung recounts that she couldn’t even look at him, and quickly dressed and went home. She says she isn’t sure if she told one of her sisters, but she definitely did not report the incident to her parents or the authorities. It was years later that she told her husband. “It never crossed my mind to protect other women. Please understand, I was actually embarrassed about my sexual naivete,” Chung says. “I was in my 20s and knew nothing about sex. All I wanted to do was bury the incident in my mind and protect my family.” The doctor died almost 30 years ago in his 80s, Chung writes. Yet, she refused to look at his home when she drove past it many times; she “freaked out” when she saw the address on Google Maps. However, when recent stories in the New Yorker and the New York Times broke the levee of sexual harassment accusations, they gave Chung the courage to share her story. “My dirty little secret reared its ugly head and I told anyone who would listen,” she says. It was far from easy for Chung — “Christine, I, too, am terrified as I reveal this publicly. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. Can you? If you can’t, I understand. I am frightened, I am scared, I can’t even cry,” she writes. However, even though she’s worried her “30-plus years” in journalism will be reduced to a “She Too” story, Chung says it’s precisely her reporting background that makes her want to come forward. “I don’t want to tell the truth. I must tell the truth. As a reporter, the truth has ruled my life, my thinking. It’s what I searched for on a daily working basis,” Chung says. Her words echo those of Ford, who during her Senate testimony on Thursday said she was present not because she wanted to be, but because she felt it was her “civic duty” to tell the truth about Kavanaugh. Chung’s letter comes a day after another reporter, CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers, said she felt compelled by Ford to share her own sexual assault that occurred when she was 15. “Bravo, Christine, for telling the truth,” Chung writes, closing the letter. Chung herself received support from fellow journalists as well as men and women in the entertainment industry after her essay was published.","Journalist Connie Chung penned an open letter supporting Christine Blasey Ford, while for the first time publicly sharing her own experience with sexual assault.

AP Author,"MCALLEN, Texas - Federal authorities have awarded a $145 million contract to a Texas company to build 6 miles (9.5 kilometers) of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said Friday that SLSCO, based in Galveston, will begin construction of an 18-foot (5.5-meter) reinforced concrete levee wall in February in the agency's McAllen Station region. The company will also increase the height of existing fences. It will be the first section of President Donald Trump's border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The government recently completed construction of a 2-mile (3-kilometer), 30-foot tall (9-meter) section of fencing along the border in California. Trump has been ramping up anti-immigration rhetoric heading into Tuesday's midterm elections and has ordered troops to the border to meet a caravan of Central American migrants slowly traveling through Mexico.

Nicole Karlis,"The Parisians know how to curate a unique art experience—even in the year 2018. CNN reports that earlier this month, Palais de Tokyo in Paris, invited guests for a clothing-free event. Indeed, visitors were allowed to peruse the gallery naked for the day. According to the report, guests arrived clothed, but had the option to check their clothing at the cloakroom. In order to keep from startling other visitors, the naked affair took place before the museum opened to the public. Staff, fully clothed, were reportedly available to answer any questions that the naked visitors had. The event is significant because it was the first time a Paris museum welcomed nudists. It is unclear if other famous museums like The Louvre Palace will follow, but last summer in Paris city officials reserved a space for naturists to enjoy themselves in an open grassy space in the Bois de Vincennes park. It was open daily from August 31 to October 15, 2017. Like anything involving nudity and art, the symbolism behind the event was much more than simply wanting to go to a museum naked. “Putting on clothing, or an armor, it’s a statement,” Vincent Simonet, a 42-year-old singing teacher who attended the event, told the New York Times. “Today, nudism is seen as a statement, but really it’s the opposite, it should be seen as a pure state.” As for the New York Times’ reporter, Thomas Rogers suggested, being nude was a little bit of a distraction from the art. “As for me, I was inclined to revisit the exhibition, especially its more political works, in a clothed context, when I wouldn’t have to worry about feeling insensitive,” he wrote. The most uncomfortable part of the experience for him was feeling cold though, not exposed. “A half-hour into the first nudist tour of the Palais de Tokyo, a contemporary art museum in Paris, I had gotten used to the feeling of exposure, but I hadn’t acclimatized to the cold air circulating through the cavernous galleries,”Rogers wrote. In the U.S., checking your clothes at the door in the name of art has become a form of protest. In June 2017, over one hundred people went to Times Square, took off all their clothes, and painted a unique message across each of their chests to promote various messages of body acceptance. “I think that human expression is something that is so important and it’s lacking in society today. It helps us to be together and to feel connected as a community, but there aren’t a whole lot of opportunities to do it,” said Matthew ""Levee"" Chavez, the creator of Subway Therapy, which gained national popularity after the election and inspired the naked event in Times Square. Nudism does appear to be making a comeback around the world. The American Association for Nude Recreation is hosting a Nude Recreation Week from July 9 - 14 this summer, and the first ever International Skinny Dip Day on July 14.",Visitors had the opportunity to take in the museum’s paintings and sculptures without clothes,2018-05-12T20:29:35Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Salon.com'}",Paris museum welcomed nudists for a day,https://www.salon.com/2018/05/12/paris-museum-welcomed-nudists-for-a-day/,https://media.salon.com/2014/12/sculpture_beauty.jpg,,Salon.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project will support a revitalisation of the central business precinct, extending it beyond the main street to the river. © Simon Wood The space acts as a kind of ‘public living room’ for the community, reactivating an unused part of town and drawing locals back to the river that is a fundamental part of Maitland ’s heritage, whilst bringing tourists and visitors to the town. In recent years, rural Maitland ’s town centre had turned its back on the river, disconnecting it from its main commercial and community activities. A series of devastating floods meant locals no longer see the river as an asset, but as a threat to the community. Working with McGregor+Coxall, CHROFI identified an opportunity to help reframe that dynamic, then worked closely with Maitland City Council to find buildings which could be purchased and redeveloped to act as pivot for the revitalisation of the centre of town. © Simon Wood Floor plans © Simon Wood The building unites Maitland ’s two key assets for the first time - its architecturally rich High Street and the environmental amenity of the Hunter River - providing a greater experience for tourists and locals. The building is expressed as a ‘sculptural gateway’ that frames views to and from the Hunter River and attracts people to pass through the space. The timber and brick arch frames a covered space for the community use, reactivating an underused part of town. The building also houses a café and restaurant as well as public amenities. Site Section The architecture has a strong civic presence in a street full of historic buildings and is a landmark when viewed from the river. The precise angles of the walls, ceiling and ground plane frame a ‘public living room’ that offers a comfortable place to sit, a mobile library, high quality public amenities and a café/restaurant all of which can be transformed into an outdoor cinema or theatre for special events. Handmade brick was chosen as the primary building finish to complement the heritage brick and sandstone textures of the town. The warmth and texture of clay bricks works at the urban scale and at the interior human scale to provide an enduring finish. Unique brick corners help the monolithic brick walls bend at unlikely angles giving the material a razor-sharp, abstract quality. © Matt Abbott Parliamentary Secretary for the Hunter, Scot MacDonald MLC says ‘It is important that we continue to invest in community infrastructure such as The Riverlink to enrich our regional cities. It is an inspiring space that I’m sure will see many opportunities for people to utilise, whether for events or spending time in the city’s heart.’ © Simon Wood Maitland Mayor, Cr Loretta Baker said ‘The Riverlink Building is a wonderful addition to The Levee and it will really strengthen the city’s historic relationship with the Hunter River, whilst adding to The Levee’s development as Maitland ’s premier lifestyle precinct. It’s a beautiful building that we are very proud of and that our community will use for generations to come’. © Mark James Five years in the making Maitland ’s Riverlink Building is the work of award-winning Architectural firm CHROFI and extends a legacy of place-making public architecture including New York City’s celebrated TKTS, Times Square, The Goods Line in Ultimo and the forthcoming Ian Potter National Conservatory in Canberra. “As a practice, we have always been focused on high impact public projects that resonate with the local culture and community”, said CHROFI Director, Tai Ropiha. “We are thrilled that the building has been well received and is changing how the Maitland community engage with the river.”","Completed in 2018 in Maitland, Australia.

Jim Geraghty,"Construction crews install a new bollard wall on the U.S.-Mexican border in El Paso, Texas, September 26, 2018. (Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters) Mile by mile, 18-foot bollard fencing goes up but is it big and beautiful? C ongress is preparing for one last spending fight with Republicans controlling the House. Senate Republicans are aiming for an additional $5 billion for a border wall, while House Republicans are hoping for as much as $25 billion. There are two not-quite-accurate claims about President Trumps vision of a wall on the southern border. The first is that nothings been done, or that Trumps vision of a border wall remains mythical. The other is that the wall — or at least the 32-foot-high concrete barrier that Trump described early in his presidency — is being built. What is more accurate is to say that under previously passed legislation, U.S. Customs and Border Protection continues to pay contractors to replace sections of spotty or insufficient fencing with 18-foot-tall bollard walls tall steel bars with gaps in between them so that Border Patrol officers can see whats going on on the other side. In May, Chief Patrol Agent Aaron A. Hull of the Border Patrols El Paso sector described the advantages to the bollard walls. The current fence and the mesh that we have here further east is a deterrent to illegal entry; the problem is it’s easy to breach, it’s easy to scale, and it’s expensive and time-consuming for us to repair, Hull said at a press briefing announcing the start of the Santa Teresa wall project in New Mexico. The wall that we’re replacing this fencing with is going to be durable. It’s going to be here for a long time. It’s going to be harder to get over, harder to get through, harder to get underneath. It’s going to have a five-foot anti-scaling plate at the top, which is going to make it very hard for entrance — even if you can get to the top. In late September, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that work had begun in Texas on replacing a four-mile section of existing chain-link and expanded-metal fence beginning just west of the Paso Del Norte international crossing and extending east to the Fonseca Road area. An 18-foot-high steel bollard wall will be constructed in its place. The construction project is expected to be completed in late April 2019. The project is estimated to cost $22 million. At the beginning of the month, CBP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded a contract to construct approximately six miles of a levee wall system along the Rio Grande near McAllen, Texas. The plan will build a reinforced-concrete levee wall to the height of the existing levee, install 18-feet-tall steel bollards atop the concrete wall, and remove vegetation along a 150-foot enforcement zone. When completed, the enforcement zone will also include new detection technology, lighting, video surveillance, and an all-weather patrol road parallel to the levee wall. Finally, on Wednesday, CBP and the Corps awarded a contract to construct another approximately eight miles of levee-wall system in five segments located south of Alamo, Donna, Weslaco, Progreso, and Mercedes, Texas. Similar 18-foot steel bollard fencing will be installed atop the levees. This project is estimated to cost $167 million. In October, the U.S. Border Patrol completed construction on a little more than two miles of new border wall near downtown Calexico, Calif., roughly 120 miles east of San Diego. Workers recently completed 20 miles of border barrier in Santa Teresa, N.M., and six and a half miles of barrier has been upgraded along the San DiegoTijuana border. The total length of the U.S.Mexico border is 1,954 miles; as of February 2017, 705 miles have at least one of four kinds of barriers pedestrian, secondary, tertiary, and vehicle. Regions near cities and communities get more anti-personnel fencing; more rural areas get more anti-vehicle fencing. Its fair to debate whether the bollard walls are close enough to what President Trump promised and described on the campaign trail. Before and shortly after he was elected president, Trump said the southern border needed 1,000 miles of wall, and on several occasions Trump insisted, Its not a fence. Its a wall. Whether or not the public perceives the new structures as the presidents wall, the upgraded barrier in Calexico featured a plaque declaring, This plaque was installed on October 26, 2018 to commemorate the completion of the first section of President Trumps border wall. It remains to be seen whether the new fencing will make a significant change in the number of individuals attempting to cross the border illegally. Shortly after President Trump took office, the number of apprehensions on the Southwest border by the CBP dropped dramatically from 58,000 in December 2016 to 15,798 in April 2017. But the numbers of apprehensions steadily increased, month by month. According to Border Patrol data, the agency apprehended about 416,000 individuals in fiscal 2017, a significant drop from the previous years 553,000. But in the following year, the total rose back up to 521,000. October was the first month of fiscal 2019, and the agency caught 60,745 individuals not the worst ever, but high by the standards of the past five years. The recidivism rate the percentage of individuals apprehended more than one time by the Border Patrol within a fiscal year declined slightly from 2016 to 2017, from 12 percent to 10 percent.","Mile by mile, 18-foot bollard fencing goes up — but is it ‘big and beautiful’?",2018-11-16T11:30:04Z,"{'id': 'national-review', 'name': 'National Review'}",The ‘Wall’ Continues to Be Built...

"Samantha Nelson on AUX, shared by Samantha Nelson to The A.V. Club","A woman walks into a private investigators office with a case. Shes not from around here, and shes clearly trouble, but the investigator takes the job anyway. It wont stay professional, of course. The two will wind up romantically entangled even as the job brings up parts of the investigators past that hed rather stay buried. The plot of Jonathan Lethems The Feral Detective sounds like classic noir, except rather than following the detective, its about the woman offering the title character a job. And thats a problem. The Feral Detective While there has been a constant stream of nonfiction written about the Trump administration, The Feral Detective might be the first major novel to explore the impact of his election. The story feels born from the first Saturday Night Live cold open following Trumps victory, where Kate McKinnon performed Leonard Cohens Hallelujah as a eulogy for both the recently passed singer-songwriter and Hillary Clintons campaign. Following the election, The Feral Detective s Phoebe Siegler, an embodiment of the shocked liberal elite, quits her job at The New York Times to try to track down her friends missing daughter, Arabella. Phoebe believes Arabella has traveled to California to visit the Mt. Baldy Zen Center, but gets no answers from the local police. So she brings the case to Charles Heist, whos known for his ability to find people among the areas communities of homeless individuals and hippies living off the grid. Like the election itself, Phoebes story feels like a failure of feminism. Phoebe tries to get involved in every aspect of Heists investigation. She even uses a stolen portable toilet to try to fortify a homeless settlement against a coming flood in hopes that it will earn her enough goodwill to get answers about Arabella. But shes regularly sidelined, stuck waiting in her hotel room, or drinking wine in a mountain bar, or helping hippies collect sagebrush while Heist does the investigative work. A good noir always has a sense of mystery, and not really knowing what Heist is up to does produce that, but it comes at the cost of action and excitement. The pages are instead filled with Phoebes inner monologue as she frames even the most harrowing moments of her journey with Heist as another entry in the series of soul-searching pilgrimages liberal journalists made to Trump country following November 2016. One part of my brain was still busy composing the red-state tell-all op-ed, the career Id salvage from the ruins, my triumphant return to New York with surefire viral content, Phoebe thinks. Lethems last detective novel, Motherless Brooklyn, now nearly 20 years old and whose film adaptation is set to be released next year, had touches of the self-aware and absurd, but both elements are laid on far more thickly here. Phoebe narrates the clichés that are in place when she first visits Heists office, wondering as he listens to her if hes about to reach into a drawer for a gun or bottle of whiskey, only to be surprised when he emerges with an opossumthe Feral Detective moniker comes from his affinity with animals and a pair of off-grid tribes dubbed the Rabbits and Bears. But lamp-shading tropes doesnt help if theyre just played straight. Phoebe seems to fall for Heist because the genre demands it, first coming onto him after a booze-heavy dinner in the mobile home the gruff man shares with three tracking dogs. Id go home with a California story or two in my back pocket. No, sorry, I didnt ever set eyes on the ocean or the Hollywood sign, but did I tell you the one about the porta-potty levee? The trailer park blowjob? Oh, what a Manic Pixie Am I ? she muses. Later she reflects on her complicated relationship with Heist: I had the distinct impression that I was kissing a sculpture, an odd and interesting statue, the interior of which was solid to the core, and inaccessible. I felt us as two topographies, abutting, yet lonely inside. But for all that, hey, it wasnt bad. When Lethem fully embraces the absurd, the story is a lot more entertaining. The book explores how politics can simultaneously matter a great deal and not at all as Phoebe brings her priorities to a realm where the tribal divisions are even more literal than those between Americans who vote red or blue. Her feelings of being out of her element in the California desert and bewildered with her country bubble over spectacularly in a rant given to the audience of a ritual battle for leadership of the Bears: DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON, YOU STUPID FUCKING ASSHOLES? DID YOU FUCKERS EVEN VOTE? Because Phoebe exists on the periphery of the plot, Lethem offers few answers about the motives and stories of the other main characters or the methods that Heist uses to uncover them. This journey-over-destination approach to mystery is deeply unsatisfying. Phoebe might find what she went West looking for, but readers wont get a worthy detective story.","A woman walks into a private investigator’s office with a case.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | Updated: July 16, 2018 10:37:06 am An aerial view shows local residents seen on the roof of submerged house at a flooded area as they wait for a rescue in Kurashiki, southern Japan. (Reuters photo) When Isao Akutagawa moved to the sleepy riverside town of Mabi in western Japan 45 years ago, it seemed like the perfect suburb to raise his children. Land was cheap and he could drive to his job in nearby Kurashiki City. As he built his home next to rice paddies 2 kilometres from the Odagawa river bank, he heard stories about a flood the year before, but didn’t pay much notice until local politicians began warning residents it could happen again. “They told us years ago that the Odagawa river levees might break,” said Akutagawa, 79, as he mopped muddy water out of his living room. His home was submerged in a sudden flood earlier this month when heavy rain caused multiple levees to break. Torrential rains across western Japan this month triggered floods and landslides that killed more than 200 people and left over a dozen missing in Japan’s worst weather disaster in 36 years. Mabi, which merged with Kurashiki in 2005, was one of the hardest hit, accounting for most of the 51 killed in Kurashiki. More than a quarter of it was inundated, with floodwaters reaching as high as 4.8 metres (16 feet) in some neighbourhoods. Interviews with more than a dozen residents, officials and experts show how multiple failures increased Mabi’s death toll: flood-control plans were delayed for decades; residents often didn’t understand warnings about the risks; and an evacuation order for the worst-hit area came just minutes before confirmation that a levee had failed. “We had our local politicians working for years to change the flow of that river,” Akutagawa said. A flood control project finally won approval in 2010 and construction was set to start this autumn. “If they had started earlier, even four or five years earlier, we wouldn’t have this,” he added. Kurashiki City officials said they had asked Japan’s land ministry to start work on the project every year since at least 2005. But it was not deemed high enough priority. However, officials in the city’s emergency management office said they did not blame the central government for the delay. “The land ministry has to make their decision after seeing all the requests sent in from around the country. Every area, not just ours, make these requests hoping that our river gets picked,” said Hiroshi Kono, an emergency management officer at Kurashiki City. “Of course, it would have made us very happy if ours had been selected sooner.” Hiroshi Yamauchi, an official at the land ministry’s Chugoku Regional Development Bureau in Hiroshima, told Reuters his agency had “followed proper procedures,” but that it was common for large-scale river projects to take years to complete. An elderly couple looks at a flooded area after heavy rain in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture, Japan. (Reuters photo) Competition for a dwindling budget was partly behind the delay, as was an environmental impact study, said Kairyu Takahashi, head of the prefectural legislature, and a member of a committee that discusses regional public works projects. “I feel powerless that I wasn’t able to make the government take action,” he said, choking up with emotion. “If we had somehow completed it in time, this may not have happened.” At a news conference on Friday, Keiichi Ishii, who heads the ministry of land, infrastructure and transport, which oversees flood prevention projects, declined to address whether the high death toll in Mabi was a preventable “human disaster” or who was responsible. “We recognise that there’s a need to look into steps we can take to reduce the damage from disasters like this even a little bit,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a separate news conference last week as the regional death toll mounted. DECADES OF DELAY Many people moved to Mabi after the floods of 1972 and 1976 as flatlands next to two main rivers were developed into a bedroom town. Mabi grew to be a quiet district of about 23,000 people. Elderly residents said they knew about flood risks, but had never seen waters rise much higher than knee-level. Still, calls to improve flood control date back decades. Early proposals, dating as far back as 1968, called for a river bypass and a weir, or small dam, to supply water to farms and reduce flood risks. Resistance from residents on the southern side of the Odagawa river over being cut off from groundwater stalled the plans, Takahashi said. And in the last 20 years, public works spending has declined sharply, falling about 60 percent nationwide from a peak of 14.9 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending in March 1999 to about 6 trillion yen in the current fiscal year, government data show. In 2014, 28 billion yen was allocated for a 30-year plan that included a bypass between the Odagawa and Takahashi rivers. Work on that 10-year project was scheduled to get under way later this year. MAPPING DISASTER Kurashiki City, like all municipalities across Japan, was required under a 2005 law to create “hazard maps” outlining areas at high risk of flooding, landslides and other disasters, and the locations of evacuation centres. Two years ago, Kurashiki City drafted its own colourful hazard maps. The maps were accurate; large swathes of Mabi marked as risky areas on the maps almost perfectly match the areas overrun by gushing floodwaters. But there were two problems: the city assumed a pattern of prolonged rain over a wide area rather than an intense concentrated downpour as actually occurred, according to online planning documents, and residents say they paid little attention to the maps. A near-record 138.5 millimetres of rain fell on July 6 in Kurashiki, second only to the 183.5 millimetres recorded on Sept. 3, 2011, according to weather agency data. Early the next morning, waters broke through levees on the Odagawa and Takamagawa rivers, unleashing flood waters. Some residents said they had simply ignored the hazard maps; after all, rainfall is relatively rare in Okayama Prefecture, which is known as the “Land of Sunshine.” “To me, it was just another routine document from the public office,” said Shigezo Kaneko, 80, who was rescued by boat after waters came close to the first-floor ceiling of his two-story house. “I guess I wasn’t really vigilant.” ‘NOT IN TIME’ In 2015, Japan’s Central Land Ministry came up with a policy to better cope with disasters, which included training local authorities on when to issue warnings. But advisories and orders to evacuate are left up to local authorities. Kurashiki Mayor Kaori Ito announced the first evacuation order, for the area south of the Odagawa river, at 11:45 p.m. At 1:30 a.m. the next day, using loudspeakers, mobile phone alerts, and television and radio messages, the city ordered residents in the heavily populated area north of the river to seek shelter. That order came just four minutes before confirmation of the first levee failure, on a small Takamagawa river. Ito, asked about the timing at a news conference, expressed regret but said she had gone by the book. “It (the order) was issued based on the condition of the river and in line with standards (for issuance),” she was quoted as saying by domestic media. Reuters was unable to reach Ito last week for further comment about the decision. Although his family escaped, Atsushi Yamashita, 63, could not persuade one of his neighbours, a man in his 90s, to leave his house just 30 metres from the Odagawa river. The man was later found dead. “Something similar might happen again in a few years,” said Yamashita as workers slowly cleared a mound of rubble in front of his home. “My wife says she doesn’t want to live here anymore.” For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App",Torrential rains across western Japan this month triggered floods and landslides that killed more than 200 people and left over a dozen missing in Japan's worst weather disaster in 36 years.,2018-07-16T05:05:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}","In Japan’s flood-ravaged Mabi, delays and lack of awareness magnified death toll",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/in-japans-flood-ravaged-mabi-delays-and-lack-of-awareness-magnified-death-toll-5261340/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/07/japan-floods-7591.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stephanie Pappas,"When record rains mingled with spring snowmelt in the lower Mississippi River Basin in April 2011, liquid disaster flowed southward and forced some hard choices: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blasted a hole in a levee in the river system to save the city of Cairo, Ill., from inundation—at the expense of more than 100,000 acres of farmland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in Memphis, where floodwaters lapped at historic Beale Street. Officials opened two spillways in Louisiana to protect New Orleans and Baton Rouge, sacrificing farms and coastal oyster beds. The crisis would ultimately cause $2.8 billion in damage, according to the Corps. And it is one of many recent examples of the way the restless river has pummeled surrounding communities. Unusual floods struck throughout the basin during winter 2015–16, and more swamped parts of Illinois, Arkansas and Missouri after torrential rains in 2017. Snowmelt swells the Mississippi every spring, but the river reached flood stage in Memphis a month earlier than usual in 2018 due to heavy February rains. Now a new study raises the possibility much of the effort humans have put into trying to control the mighty river has paradoxically made its large floods more destructive. The magnitude of so-called 100-year floods—massive inundations defined as having a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year—has increased 20 percent in the past five centuries on the lower Mississippi, researchers reported this month in Nature. The bulk of the increase has been in the last 150 years, when human engineering of the river has been most intense. “We’ve channelized the river, we’ve straightened it,” says Samuel Muñoz, lead author of the new study and an assistant professor of marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern University. “We’ve made the gradient steeper, and we’ve encased the river in concrete mats and lined it with levees.” The resulting physics is straightforward, Muñoz explains. With little leeway to meander and limited floodplain to spread over, the waters of the Mississippi in places are corralled into a relatively narrow chute, making peak flows higher than they would be otherwise. Muñoz and his colleagues estimate about 75 percent of the increase in 100-year-flood magnitude is due to river engineering, with the rest attributable to natural climate cycles. The study was not able to factor in the influence of anthropogenic climate change effects, though, leaving open the question of how much rising flood levels are driven by engineering and how much by a warming climate. MAGNIFIED FLOODS If left to its own devices, the Mississippi follows a sinuous and impermanent path. The river has “whipsawed” back and forth over the last 10,000 years, changing course when the sediment it deposits blocks its route, says Craig Colten, a geographer at Louisiana State University who was not involved in the new research. If not for Herculean human efforts, he says, the river would likely have switched its outlet during major flooding in 1973 and would empty into the Atchafalaya River—not the artificial route it now flows through before hitting the Gulf of Mexico. Human control of the Mississippi has caused obvious problems along the Louisiana coast. Damming upstream, for example, traps sediments that would otherwise build up the river's delta; this makes the coast more prone to rapid erosion. But a natural-running Mississippi would devastate much of the economic activity that depends on the river, says Clinton Willson, a civil engineer at L.S.U. who also was not part of the new study. The river is a crucial shipping route, Willson notes, and big barges could never navigate natural meanders. Since a historic flood tested the Corps’s nascent taming of the river in 1927, Colten says, the three overarching goals of river engineering have been to protect navigation, New Orleans and the petrochemical industry along the lower Mississippi’s banks. As much as humans have made over the Mississippi, there is a lack of understanding of how it behaved before we started mucking with it, Muñoz says. The oldest depth gauge records cover a mere 150 years, a period that started after human engineering began. Muñoz and his colleagues have attempted to extend this record back to roughly 1500 by sampling bottom sediments from three oxbow lakes in Mississippi and Louisiana. Oxbow lakes are former river channels that were cut off by sediment; they retain all the sands and silts the river carried when the now-lakes were still part of its main channel. Sediment layers left by floods stand out because faster flows carry and deposit larger grains of sediment, Muñoz says. To more precisely date floods that occurred before formal record-keeping began, the team also turned to another data source—trees. Certain types including oak show cellular-level damage when swamped, and which is visible in the trees’ growth rings, providing an annual record of when the river overflowed. The researchers also pulled in data from written records kept since the late 1800s. Taken together, their results showed 100-year floods in recent decades have been about 20 percent larger (in terms of cubic feet of water per second) than 100-year deluges 500 years ago. That increase in flood discharge, or the volume of water flowing past a given point, is “what hydrologists sometimes call ‘flood magnification,’” Muñoz says. “You’re taking what could have been a moderate event and turning it into a larger event.” Teasing apart the factors that magnified the floods has been the tough part of the new research. WHERE DOES CLIMATE CHANGE COME IN? Along with the infrastructure humans have added to the river since the 19th century, climate also affects flood severity. Two natural ocean-temperature cycles influence moisture in the Mississippi Basin, but the team’s modeling found these could explain only 25 percent of the increased flood magnitude. Human engineering explains the rest, Muñoz says. But that leaves out any role that global warming—and accompanying changes in precipitation—might be having on flood levels, says Scott St. George, a paleoclimatologist who wrote an editorial in Nature accompanying the new study. Some research has attempted to untangle these climate threads. A study led by Utah State University meteorologist Simon Wang, published in 2017 in Geophysical Research Letters, found the precipitation that caused major flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016 may have been 20 percent heavier than it would have been without warming that has occurred since 1985. A 2016 paper in Hydrology and Earth System Sciences showed warming over the past century has likely increased the chance of that flooding by a factor of at least 1.4. But how any global warming–fueled changes in precipitation affect flooding along the vast span of the Mississippi depends on when and where those changes happen, Wang says. Most of the river’s floods happen during spring when rains combine with snowmelt. So more or less spring rain or winter snow could affect flood levels. And where those precipitation changes occur—in the upper or lower Mississippi, for example—affects where the water enters the river, as well as which areas are likely to flood. Climate scientists are still trying to pick out these seasonal and regional precipitation trends. At the same time that rainfall patterns might be shifting, rising temperatures could be affecting evaporation from soils and transpiration of moisture from vegetation, St. George says, affecting how much water ultimately makes it into the river and its tributaries. Humans have also been impacting that influx of water through changes in land use and agricultural practices, he says. “I think [the new study’s] explanation is plausible—and it’s possible,” he adds. “But I think it’s also true that we need some more information to really sort out whether human modification—river engineering—is the only thing that may have pushed the Mississippi River floods to be more severe.” The uncertainty over these factors kept Muñoz and his colleagues from addressing the climate change question in this study, but he says they hope to do so in future work. One way to approach this, St. George says, is to look toward the upper reaches of the Mississippi, which are subject to less management. If flooding has increased significantly over long time periods on the river’s northern stretch, it would point to climate as the bigger driver, he notes, whereas minimal change would implicate river engineering. Whichever turns out to be the main culprit, the Mississippi’s levees, spillways and other human-made structures are not likely to go away anytime soon—particularly because there is still excess capacity to handle high water flows—Colten says. The Morganza Spillway in Pointe Coupee Parish, La., for example, has only been opened twice: once in 1973 and again in 2011. Until that excess capacity is exhausted, Colten says it is unlikely the state or the Corps will fundamentally alter their approach to the river. “Decisions about managing the river are very much a human undertaking,” he says. “We have to know the size, we have to know the hydrology and the physics of rivers, but…those decisions are financial and political and regional, and don’t have a lot to do with the science.”","Human meddling with the river is blamed for most of the rise in flood levels, but the role of climate remains unclear -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-04-10T10:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Taming the Mighty Mississippi May Have Caused Bigger Floods,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/taming-the-mighty-mississippi-may-have-caused-bigger-floods/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/6AB41048-9FEF-4A17-B4A149AF52C8B8C8_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ed Leefeldt,"Almost half of the country lives near a levee, and 12 have already failed during spring flooding 
Critics blame Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA for broken levees flooding the Midwest
The levees ""were set up to fail,"" says flood insurance expert
The small town of Hamburg, Iowa was submerged this week when its levee – the earthen barrier protecting it from the raging Missouri River – broke, forcing its 1,100 residents to flee their homes. But luck was on their side: No one died. And now this same raging river is rushing toward Kansas City, Missouri.
The Army Corps of Engineers warned during a Thursday briefing there could be other flooding as snow begins to melt along the upper regions of the Midwest. The states most likely to be affected: Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri.
""The runoff will be more than expected,"" John Remus, chief of the Missouri River Basin Water Management Division confirmed during the briefing. Twelve levees have already been breached, others have been ""overtopped."" And still others are in danger. ""The public needs to remain vigilant.""
""The whole thing is trashed,"" said Pat Sheldon, who is president of a regional ""levee district"" that extends from Iowa to the Missouri border. He predicted that doing a ""total rebuild"" of his levee system alone could cost ""several billion dollars.""
Repairing levees damaged by Midwest flooding could cost billions
There are nearly 100,000 miles of levees across the country, protecting almost 150 million people, and when they fail, it can be disastrous.
Others who've witnessed the misfortune of a levee rupturing weren't so lucky. The biggest tragedy occurred in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when a dike that was supposed to protect the city gave way and 1,300 people died. And a recent Christmas flood in 2015 set records for water height all along the Mississippi.
These disasters haven't gone unnoticed. In 2016, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional watchdog, scolded the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for making ""little progress"" in ensuring the safety of the nation's levees. The Corps of Engineers, which inspects just a small portion of these earth and gravel barriers, said at least five percent were at very high risk of flooding.
The Corps of Engineers controls just 15 percent of the nation's levees, while the rest are under state, local and tribal jurisdiction. But mistakes have been made regarding the levees the Corps of Engineers controls. When Hamburg built up its levee, Army officials ordered it be lowered. The flood water easily overwhelmed the lowered barrier wiping out the town. In New Orleans, the Corps of Engineers helped create a shipping channel dubbed ""Mr. Go,"" but it ended up funneling Katrina's flood water into the city.
And it's unlikely anything will change when the current flooding ends. ""Extreme weather events linked to climate change are causing flooding that strains aging infrastructures and produces even more damage,"" says Executive Director Amy Bach of United Policyholders, a consumer insurance advocacy group. ""Repairs don't garner attention because they aren't showy. There's no ribbon cutting.""
""You can't continue to maintain these levees on a shoestring,"" says John Dickson, a flood expert with Aon, an international insurance brokerage and consulting firm. ""They were set up to fail.""","There are 100,000 miles of earth and gravel levees across the U.S. and at least 5% are at very high risk of flooding",2019-03-22T14:39:05Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}",Midwest's ruptured levees could cost billions to repair,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flooding-in-the-midwest-ruptured-levees-along-missouri-river-could-cost-billions-to-repair/,https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/20/1b69a829-6475-47a3-ad36-076b80d49b3c/thumbnail/1200x630/2b69fbfd493e4512d9a7d4eccd04579a/nebraska-flodding.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael Snyder,"In October, while I was on a trip in southern Mexico, reporting on the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, my grandfather had a stroke. About a week later he was dead. Because I was still waiting on my Mexican residency permit and couldn’t leave the country without permission from the immigration office, I didn’t make it home to Baltimore in time to see him. He’d slipped toward death with unusual speed. He was a wonderful man, but never a patient one. He left behind a dinged up 12-year-old Toyota Highlander, which my grandmother offered, very generously, to give me. This, I figured, might be my best chance to populate my new home in Mexico City with the detritus of my previous ones; I guess this is what you call settling down. So in the first week of January, I packed my things into my grandfather’s truck—a cargo heavy with over-determined symbols—and started the long drive south from my parents’ place in Baltimore to Mexico City, where I’d moved about 18 months before after just shy of five years living in India. Friends in Mexico told me this was the most American thing they’d ever heard, both sentimental and cinematic, which they did not seem to mean as an insult. A friend in Los Angeles said the whole thing sounded like a post– Almost Famous Cameron Crowe movie, which I took as an insult whether he meant it that way or not. Skirting the eastern edge of the Appalachians, I stopped in Damascus, Virginia, where I feasted on wild venison and farm-raised vegetables, prepared by excessively generous friends of friends of a friend, and fired a crossbow for the first time. I stopped outside Asheville for breakfast at a place called Hickory Nut Gap Farm and when I asked if getting sausage and sausage gravy was too much, the woman behind the counter said, “Absolutely—but you should go for it.” (I did. It was too much. It was great.) In Atlanta I was moved by the Buford Highway Farmers Market, where that foundational American myth, the Melting Pot, manifests with unexpectedly in the beautiful banality of a grocery store, its aisles divided by region and country, each one populated by people from everywhere. In Oxford, Mississippi, I visited Faulkner’s leaf-strewn grave and, at chef Vish Bhatt’s Snackbar, ate one of the best restaurant dishes I’ve eaten in recent memory: collard-wrapped catfish griddled crisp and served under a drizzle of curry leaf-butter, a perfect Keralite pollichattu rendered in the flavors of the Deep South (Asha Gomez would adore it). The dish was a one-two punch of Proustian nostalgia and total surprise; it tasted like India—like home—and like the American South, a foreign country. I ate hot tamales smothered in chile and a physics-defying lemon meringue pie in the Delta. I ate thin fried fish, crunchy as chicharrón, at a seafood joint called Middendorf’s on the edge of Lake Maurepas. In New Orleans, where a friend and colleague from Mexico City, Felipe Luna, met me for the rest of the drive south, we ate po’boys that were basically banh mi, goat cheese–stuffed King Cake, hulking free happy-hour oysters, and drank a half-dozen frozen Irish coffees despite the weirdly frigid weather. In a place called Donner, we stopped at Chester’s Cypress Inn for shatteringly crisp fried chicken, frog legs, and gizzards, and took directions from a guy who told us that Whiskey River Landing in Henderson, Louisiana was the place to be for live zydeco and dancing on a Sunday evening. Leaving Donner, we followed a road that ran parallel to the Atchafalaya River. We must have driven past the bar three or four times before realizing that, to get there, we’d have to drive up over the levee that separated us from the gray, moss-dripping swamp on the other side, framed in Whiskey River’s windows like a Dalí: miniature and strange and vaguely sinister. Whiskey River is essentially a plywood box built out over the bayou and might well be, based on what little I’ve seen, the most perfect bar in the U.S. Couples spun across the dancefloor, like tall, angular Jody and her serious, pint-sized dance partner, evidently—at least to me, the visiting homosexual—the resident queer person (think Truman Capote at the rodeo); like lovely, radiant Kimberley and her bear-like boyfriend, who moved more gracefully than anyone else there. Smoking was allowed inside and beer was somehow both cheap and good. Every time a customer left a tip, the bartender rang a bell. Whiskey River adds a lot of wings to heaven. Standing at the edge of the dance floor—the Mexican and the Gay, surely the setup for some kind of joke—Felipe and I were approached by a guy in a camo hat and cowboy boots. I flinched and slouched onto a stool, weakened by the weight of my mid-Atlantic suspicions, made heavier by my years in India, where my sexual orientation was, at least in theory, punishable with jail time. He asked where we’d come in from. I said Baltimore. “That far?” he wondered. Felipe answered, “Mexico City.” He looked at us incredulously and asked, “Where in the hell is that ?” Felipe explained. The guy in the hat flashed a smile and nodded, said it was cool for us to have come so far, and told us to have a good night and a safe trip. I stood up from my stool, happy and a little ashamed, and thanked him. The whole night was like that, punctuated by clichés that turned in on themselves as they played out to the tune of accordions and stomping feet. Clichés like my ugly gut reaction to the guy in the camo hat, and the surprise that none of us ended up being the punchline of his joke. Clichés like Kimberley and her impossibly graceful boyfriend, the very picture of a former high school romance well on its way to happily ever after. Surprises like the only time all night that he stepped away from her, only to take our Cowboy Capote in his burly arms and swing him gorgeously over the floorboards. Bells were ringing left, right, and center. It was, Felipe said, the sort of place that could make you believe in Hollywood love stories, sentimentality and all. As soon as we left the bayou, Mexico emerged on the horizon, like the plains laid out below the crest of a hill. It was there in Houston’s taco trucks (though not in the ice storm that we brought in from the east), in the big flat expanse of East Texas, and, when the weather cleared, in the hot bright sun that bore down on us like a flashlight. “ Every time a customer left a tip, the bartender rang a bell. Whiskey River adds a lot of wings to heaven. ”  Share Even still, Felipe and I both heaved sighs of relief as soon as we entered Laredo. After days of silent towns without a soul in sight, of houses shuttered against gray skies and cars sealed tight as though pedestrianism were an airborne contagion, it was a joy to be in a place where families—some white, mostly Latinx—filled the streets, where speakers blared banda, where evening brought everyone out for beer and food and conversation about adolescent nights across the border in Nuevo Laredo and how rapidly things had changed there in the last decade, courtesy of the drug war—not, it goes without saying, for the better. It felt good to be in a place where life took place in public rather than behind closed doors. It felt like the world coming out of hibernation. We left Laredo at dawn the next morning. Entering Mexico, a border agent inspected the car and my paperwork and, seeing that the vehicle was registered in my name, eyed me as incredulously as the guy at Whiskey River. She declared everything "" muy legal "" before waving us through. It was embarrassingly easy given the horror of crossing the other way. We drove over the deep concrete trough that cradled the slow-moving Rio Grande, which, at least in the dry chilly winter, wasn’t very grande at all. Like most land crossings, it was, culturally and geographically, if not politically, a formality. Mexico had begun many miles earlier and the U.S., with its malls and guns and sun-blitzed industrial optimism, wouldn’t end until many miles later. When people write about planes, they write about how flying truncates distance, but almost never about how it invests borders with meaning they don’t, or shouldn’t, have. Flying makes travel an event, as sudden and dislocating as moving to a new city or the death of a person you love. Driving gives time physical features, makes it legible, not as a unit of currency, broken into hard, discrete coins, but as a rate of change, gradual rather than seismic. When you travel by land, arrival happens in gradients, in brands of beer and the texture of frying batter and subtle shifts in the light. Time and place, home and away, exist on continua, connected by the pulse of white lines on asphalt, not divided by borders. Three days after leaving Laredo we reached Mexico City, driving in over the volcanoes as a heavy storm cloud opened and showered us with a spasm of unseasonable, unexpected hail—the same bad weather I’d brought from Baltimore down through New Orleans and Houston. The sun went down and the lights came up in the valley and I was surprised, as I always am, by how good it felt to be home, wherever the hell that might be.","In October, while I was on a trip in southern Mexico, reporting on the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, my grandfather had a stroke.

Jeff Wise,"It was 20 minutes into the scheduled flight from New York City to Dallas that disaster struck Southwest Flight 1380. The jet suffered an engine failure at 32,500 feet over eastern Pennsylvania. Debris went flying and some of it punched out a window, partially sucking out a passenger. Fellow passengers were able to pull her back inside, but she died of her injuries. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Things could have been a lot worse were it not for the plane’s captain, Tammie Jo Shults, a former Navy fighter pilot and one of the first women to fly the F/A-18. She calmly steered the plane to safe emergency landing at Philadelphia, where passengers praised Shults’ “nerves of steel.” Here's what she was dealing with. One Engine Down In the immediate aftermath of SWA 1380’s engine failure, the flight crew had essentially two problems: the lack of thrust from the failed engine, and the loss of air pressure due to the punctured cabin. In the case of the engine loss itself, the problem was not all that dire. In fact, airliners can fly quite well on just one. The Boeing 777 is certified to fly up to five and a half hours with one engine out. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below With less power, a plane will be unable to maintain its maximum altitude, and so might drift down somewhat into thicker air. Otherwise, airliners can fly safely without suffering a great loss of performance. And mid-flight engine failures aren't entirely uncommon. In February, a United Airlines 777 and a Delta A330 made emergency landings on the same day because of engine problems. The second problem with Southwest Flight 1380 is where things got bad. Puncture Problems While losing an engine sounds scary, it was the loss of air pressure that placed the plane in greater peril. Human beings can't survive long without air, and passengers’ drop-down air masks provide only enough oxygen for about 12 to 20 minutes. When the jet lost pressure, Shults’ focus would have been getting the aircraft down to 10,000 feet as quickly as possible. At that level, the air is thick enough that it’s possible for people to maintain consciousness without pressurization. (In mountainous areas like the Rockies where terrain can be higher than 10,000 feet, pilots aim for the minimum safe altitude.) The Boeing 777 is certified to fly up to five and a half hours with one engine out. The standard operating procedure in this case is for the flight crew to call air traffic control, declare an emergency, and begin a rapid descent, with the thrust lever for the remaining engine set to idle and thin plates known as spoilers extended above the wings to increase drag. To prevent blacking out, Shults and her copilot would have donned full-face masks supplied by a pressurized oxygen tank. In the case of Southwest 1380, the descent from 31,684 feet took about five minutes—a brisk rate, but perhaps not “precipitous” as one passenger later described it. Once having reached 10,000 feet, the flight crew would have removed their oxygen masks and continued to fly the plane normally, which the Southwest crew did until their emergency landing in Philly. Worst-Case Scenarios They could have had it worse. There have been a handful of cases on commercial flights in which an emergency has knocked out both engines. In such cases, a good flight crew can still use the plane’s altitude as an energy source and glide safely to a runway. The pilots of Air Transat Flight 236 did this in 2001, when they ran out of fuel over the Atlantic, 75 miles from the nearest airstrip, but managed a safe landing in the Azores. If lacking enough altitude to reach a runway, a skilled pilot could aim for a level stretch of ground like a levee (as TACA Flight 110 did near New Orleans in 1988) or a body of water (as Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger so famously did in 2009). In this case of Southwest 1380, all the plane’s systems were working except for one engine, which was effectively redundant anyway. In the moment of crisis, Shults was called upon to follow her training—which she did admirably.","With less power, a plane will be unable to maintain its maximum altitude, and so might drift down somewhat into thicker air.

Richard Campanella,"B elow sea level. It’s a universally known topographical factoid about the otherwise flat city of New Orleans, and one that got invoked ad nauseam during worldwide media coverage of Hurricane Katrina and its catastrophic aftermath in 2005. Locally, the phrase is intoned with a mix of civic rue and dark humor. It’s also off by half. Depending on where exactly one frames the area measured, roughly 50 percent of greater New Orleans lies above sea level. That’s the good news. The bad news: It used to be 100 percent, before engineers accidentally sank half the city below the level of the sea. Their intentions were good, and they thought they were solving an old problem. Instead, they created a new and bigger one. Three hundred years ago this spring, French colonials first began clearing vegetation to establish La Nouvelle-Orléans on the meager natural levee of the Mississippi River. At most 10 to 15 feet above sea level, this feature accounts for nearly all the region’s upraised terrain; the rest is swamp or marsh. One Frenchman called it “Nothing more than two narrow strips of land, about a musket shot in width,” surrounded by “canebrake [and] impenetrable marsh.” For two centuries after the establishment of New Orleans in 1718, urban expansion had no choice but to exploit this slender ridge—so much so that many patterns of local history, from urbanization and residential settlement geographies to architecture and infrastructure, spatially echoed the underlying topography. New Orleans and its vicinity in 1863. The developing city tightly hugs the ridge nearest the Mississippi River. (Wells, Ridgway, Virtue, and Co. / Library of Congress) This might seem paradoxical to anyone who’s visited the Crescent City. What topography? In one of the flattest regions on the continent, how can elevation matter so much? But that’s exactly the point: The lower the supply of a highly demanded resource, the more valuable it becomes. Unlike most other cities, which may have elevational ranges in the hundreds of feet, just a yard of vertical distance in New Orleans can make the difference between a neighborhood developed in the Napoleonic Age, the Jazz Age, or the Space Age. Understanding how these features rose, and why they later sank, entails going back to the end of the Ice Age, when melting glaciers sent sediment-laden runoff down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Starting around 7,200 years ago, the river’s mouth began pressing seaward, dumping sediments faster than currents and tides could sweep them away. The mud accumulated, and lower Louisiana gradually emerged from the Gulf shore. Areas closest to the river and its branches rose the highest in elevation, because they got the most doses of the coarsest sediment. Areas farther from the river got just enough silt and clay particles to rise only slightly above the sea, becoming swamps. Areas farthest out received scanty deposition of the finest particles amid brackish tides, becoming grassy wetlands or saline marsh. The entire delta, under natural conditions, lay above sea level, ranging from a few inches along the coastal fringe to over a dozen feet high at the crest of the Mississippi River’s natural levee. Nature built lower Louisiana above sea level, albeit barely—and mutably. Native peoples generally adapted to this fluidity, shoring up the land or moving to higher ground as floodwaters rose. But then European imperialists came to colonize. Colonization meant permanency, and permanency meant imposing engineering rigidity on this soft, wet landscape: levees to keep water out, canals to dry soil, and in time, pumps to push and lift water out of canals lined with floodwalls. A ll this would take decades to erect and centuries to perfect. In the meantime, throughout the French and Spanish colonial eras, and under American dominion after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, New Orleanians had no choice but to squeeze their booming metropolis onto those “two narrow strips of land” while eschewing the low-lying “canebrake [and] impenetrable marsh.” Folks hated every inch of that backswamp, viewing it as a source of miasmas, the cause of disease, and a constraint on growth and prosperity. One observer in 1850 unloaded on the wetlands: “This boiling fountain of death is one of the most dismal, low, and horrid places, on which the light of the sun ever shone. And yet there it lies under the influence of a tropical heat, belching up its poison and malaria... the dregs of the seven vials of wrath... covered with a yellow greenish scum.” Only later people would learn that it was not miasmas but the invasive Aedes aegypti mosquito, brought in by transatlantic shipping, that caused diseases like yellow fever; that it was urban cisterns and poor sanitation that enabled mosquitoes to breed and feed on human blood; and that the “dismal, low” terrain actually aided the city by storing excess water, be it from the sky, the Mississippi River, the bay known as Lake Pontchartrain, or the Gulf of Mexico. It was not “horrid” but propitious that nobody lived in the backswamp, and that the technology to drain it was not available. And most importantly, that the “yellow greenish scum” lay above sea level. Understandably, given the incompatibility of natural deltaic processes with urbanization, New Orleanians began erecting embankments along the river and digging drainage ditches within a year of the city’s foundation. One colonist described how settlers in 1722 were “ordained [to] leave all around [their city parcel] a strip at least three feet wide, at the foot of which a ditch was to be dug, to serve as a drain.” Outflow canals were excavated to speed drainage back toward the swamp, and in nearby plantations, ditches were dug to control soil water or divert river water to power sawmills. Gravity was the main source of energy for these initial water projects, but in the early 1800s, steam power came into the picture. In 1835, the New Orleans Drainage Company began digging a network of urban ditches, using a steam-driven pump to push the runoff back out of Bayou St. John—with limited success. A similar pumping system was attempted in the late 1850s, only to be disrupted by the Civil War. In 1871, the Mississippi and Mexican Gulf Ship Canal Company dug 36 miles of ditches, including three major outfall canals, before it too went bankrupt. It was becoming clear that draining New Orleans would best be stewarded by the public sector instead. Municipal engineers in the late 1800s cobbled together the extant network of gutters and ditches and, with the propulsion of some steam-driven pumps, were able to expel up to one-and-a-half inches of rainfall per day into surrounding water bodies. That wasn’t nearly enough to drain the swamp, but it was enough to begin permanently altering the New Orleans’s land surface. We know this because in 1893, when the city finally got serious and funded expert engineers to figure out how to solve this problem, surveyors set out to map local elevations as had never been done before. The resulting topographical map of New Orleans (1895) would inform the engineering of what would become a world-class system. Contour map of New Orleans, produced as part of the city’s 1895 effort to finally solve the drainage problem (Courtesy of the New Orleans Public Library) The 1895 map also revealed something curious: The rear precincts of one downtown faubourg had, for the first time, dipped slightly below sea level. The sinkage would not bode well for things to come. W hat was beginning to happen was anthropogenic soil subsidence—the sinking of the land by human action. When runoff is removed and artificial levees prevent the river from overtopping, the groundwater lowers, the soils dry out, and the organic matter decays. All this creates air pockets in the soil body, into which those sand, silt, and clay particles settle, consolidate—and drop below sea level. Construction of the new drainage system began in 1896 and accelerated in 1899, when voters overwhelmingly approved a two-mill property tax to create the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board. By 1905, 40 miles of canal had been excavated, hundreds of miles of pipelines and drains had been laid, and six pumping stations were draining up to 5,000 cubic feet of water per second. System efficacy improved dramatically after 1913, when a young engineer named Albert Baldwin Wood designed an enormous impeller pump that could discharge water even faster. Eleven “Wood screw pumps” were installed by 1915, and many are still in use today. By 1926, over 30,000 acres of land had been “reclaimed” via 560 miles of pipes and canals with a capacity of 13,000 cubic feet of water per second. New Orleans had finally conquered its backswamp. The change in urban geography was dramatic. Within a decade or so, swampland became suburbs. Property values soared, tax coffers swelled, and urbanization sprawled onto lower ground toward Lake Pontchartrain. “The entire institutional structure of the city” reveled in the victory over nature, wrote John Magill, a local historian. “Developers promoted expansion, newspapers heralded it, the City Planning Commission encouraged it, the city built streetcars to service it, [and] the banks and insurance companies underwrote the financing.” The white middle class, eager to flee crumbling old faubourgs, moved into the new “lakefront” neighborhoods en masse, to the point of excluding black families through racist deed covenants. And in a rebuke of two centuries of local architectural tradition, new tract housing was built not raised on piers above the grade, but on concrete slabs poured at grade level. Why design against floods if technology has already solved that problem? Design plans for a Wood screw pump ( U.S. Patent 1,345,655 ) The change in topographic elevation was more subtle, but equally consequential. A city that had been entirely above sea level into the late 1800s, and over 95 percent in 1895, had by 1935 fallen to about 70 percent above sea level. Subsidence continued even as more and more people moved into subsiding areas. While the vast majority of New Orleans’s 300,000 residents lived above sea level in the early 1900s, only 48 percent remained above the water in 1960, when the city’s population peaked at 627,525. That year, 321,000 residents lived on former swamp, over which time they dropped into a series of topographical bowls four to seven feet below sea level. The average New Orleanian of this era perceived being below sea level as something of a local curiosity. Then as now, most folks did not understand that this was a recent man-made accident, or that it could become hazardous. But streets increasingly buckled and buildings cracked. When Hurricane Betsy ruptured levees and flooded the bottoms of four sunken urban basins in 1965, the curiosity became more of a crisis. Soil subsidence made frightful headlines in the 1970s, when at least eight well-maintained houses in a suburban subdivision exploded without warning. “Scores of Metairie residents,” The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported, “wondered whether they are living in what amounts to time bombs.” The affected subdivision, low-lying to begin with and positioned on an especially thick layer of peat, had been drained just over a decade earlier. With so much “wet sponge” to dry out, the soils compacted rapidly and subsided substantially, cracking slab foundations. In some cases, gas lines broke and vapors leaked into the house, after which all it took was a flicked light switch or a lit cigarette to explode. The emergency was abated through ordinances requiring foundational pilings and flexible utility connections. But the larger problem only worsened, as gardens, streets, and parks continued to subside, and those neighborhoods that abutted surrounding water bodies had to be lined with new lateral levees and floodwalls. Many of those and other federal structures proved to be under-engineered, underfunded, and under-inspected, and all too many failed in the face of Hurricane Katrina’s storm surge on August 29, 2005. The rest is topographic history, as seawater poured through the breaches and filled bowl-shaped neighborhoods with up to 12 feet of saltwater. Large-scale death and catastrophic destruction resulted, in part, from New Orleans having dropped below sea level. A LIDAR elevation model of New Orleans shows areas above sea level in red tones (up to 10 or 15 feet, except for the artificial levees) and areas below sea level in yellow to blueish tones (mostly ranging from -1 down to -10 feet). (Richard Campanella / FEMA) What to do? Urban subsidence cannot be reversed. Engineers and planners cannot “reinflate” compacted soils if city dwellers have built lives upon them. But they can reduce and possibly eliminate future sinkage by slowing the movement of runoff across the cityscape and storing as much water as possible on the surface, thus recharging the groundwater and filling those air cavities. The Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan, conceived by a local architect, David Waggonner, in dialogues with Dutch and Louisiana colleagues, lays out a vision of how such a system would work. But even if executed fully, the plan would not reverse past subsidence. This means that greater New Orleans and the rest of the nation must be committed to maintaining and improving structural barriers to prevent outside water from pouring into “the bowl.” To a degree, those resources arrived after Katrina, when the Army Corps of Engineers fast-tracked the design and construction of a unique-in-the-nation Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk-Reduction System. Costing over $14.5 billion and completed in 2011, “The Wall,” as folks call the sprawling complex, aims to keep those living inside secure from flooding from storms computed to have a 1 percent chance of occurring—not the level of security needed, but an improvement nonetheless. Y et, history shows that “walls” (that is, levees, embankments, floodwalls, and other rigid barriers) have gotten New Orleans into topographical trouble, even if they have also been essential to the viability of this 300-year-old experiment in delta urbanism. The city cannot rely on them alone. The biggest and most important part of assuring a future for this region is to supplement structural solutions with nonstructural approaches. Louisiana’s coast has eroded by over 2,000 square miles since the 1930s, mostly on account of the leveeing of the Mississippi River and the excavation of oil, gas, and navigation canals—not to mention rising sea levels and intruding saltwater. Slowing that loss requires tapping into the very feature that built this landscape, the Mississippi River, by diverting its freshwater and siphoning its sediment load onto the coastal plain, pushing back intruding saltwater and shoring up wetlands at a pace faster than the sea is rising. Restored wetlands would serve to impede hurricane storm surges, reducing their height and power before reaching “The Wall,” and thus lessening the chances that they break through and inundate “the bowl.” A federally backed state plan by the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is now complete and approved, and some projects are underway. But the larger effort is a moonshot, costing at least $50 billion and possibly double that. Only a fraction of the needed revenue is in hand. Meanwhile, inhabitants will have to raise their residences above base-flood elevation (a requirement to qualify for federal flood insurance). If finances allow, they might opt to live in the half of the metropolis that remains above sea level. Collectively, they might consider advocating for the Urban Water Plan, supporting coastal restoration efforts, and understanding the larger global drivers of sea-level rise. They can also forswear draining any further wetlands for urban development. Let swamps and marshes instead be green with grass, blue with water, absorptive in the face of heavy rainfall, buffering in their effect on storm surges—and above sea level in their topographic elevation. When it comes to living being below sea level, New Orleanians have little choice but to adapt.","Engineering put the Crescent City below sea level.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | Published: July 17, 2018 8:33:03 am Mabi, which merged with Kurashiki in 2005, was one of the hardest hit, accounting for most of the 51 killed in Kurashiki. (Reuters photo) When Isao Akutagawa moved to the sleepy riverside town of Mabi in western Japan 45 years ago, it seemed like the perfect suburb to raise his children. Land was cheap and he could drive to his job in nearby Kurashiki City. As he built his home next to rice paddies 2 kilometres from the Odagawa river bank, he heard stories about a flood the year before, but didn’t pay much notice until local politicians began warning residents it could happen again. “They told us years ago that the Odagawa river levees might break,” said Akutagawa, 79, as he mopped muddy water out of his living room. His home was submerged in a sudden flood earlier this month when heavy rain caused multiple levees to break. Torrential rains across western Japan this month triggered floods and landslides that killed more than 200 people and left over a dozen missing in Japan’s worst weather disaster in 36 years. Mabi, which merged with Kurashiki in 2005, was one of the hardest hit, accounting for most of the 51 killed in Kurashiki. More than a quarter of it was inundated, with floodwaters reaching as high as 4.8 metres (16 feet) in some neighbourhoods. Interviews with more than a dozen residents, officials and experts show how multiple failures increased Mabi’s death toll: flood-control plans were delayed for decades; residents often didn’t understand warnings about the risks; and an evacuation order for the worst-hit area came just minutes before confirmation that a levee had failed. “We had our local politicians working for years to change the flow of that river,” Akutagawa said. A flood control project finally won approval in 2010 and construction was set to start this autumn. “If they had started earlier, even four or five years earlier, we wouldn’t have this,” he added. Kurashiki City officials said they had asked Japan’s land ministry to start work on the project every year since at least 2005. But it was not deemed high enough priority. However, officials in the city’s emergency management office said they did not blame the central government for the delay. “The land ministry has to make their decision after seeing all the requests sent in from around the country. Every area, not just ours, make these requests hoping that our river gets picked,” said Hiroshi Kono, an emergency management officer at Kurashiki City. “Of course, it would have made us very happy if ours had been selected sooner.” Hiroshi Yamauchi, an official at the land ministry’s Chugoku Regional Development Bureau in Hiroshima, told Reuters his agency had “followed proper procedures,” but that it was common for large-scale river projects to take years to complete. Competition for a dwindling budget was partly behind the delay, as was an environmental impact study, said Kairyu Takahashi, head of the prefectural legislature, and a member of a committee that discusses regional public works projects. “I feel powerless that I wasn’t able to make the government take action,” he said, choking up with emotion. “If we had somehow completed it in time, this may not have happened.” At a news conference on Friday, Keiichi Ishii, who heads the ministry of land, infrastructure and transport, which oversees flood prevention projects, declined to address whether the high death toll in Mabi was a preventable “human disaster” or who was responsible. “We recognise that there’s a need to look into steps we can take to reduce the damage from disasters like this even a little bit,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a separate news conference last week as the regional death toll mounted. DECADES OF DELAY Many people moved to Mabi after the floods of 1972 and 1976 as flatlands next to two main rivers were developed into a bedroom town. Mabi grew to be a quiet district of about 23,000 people. Elderly residents said they knew about flood risks, but had never seen waters rise much higher than knee-level. Still, calls to improve flood control date back decades. Early proposals, dating as far back as 1968, called for a river bypass and a weir, or small dam, to supply water to farms and reduce flood risks. Resistance from residents on the southern side of the Odagawa river over being cut off from groundwater stalled the plans, Takahashi said. And in the last 20 years, public works spending has declined sharply, falling about 60 percent nationwide from a peak of 14.9 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending in March 1999 to about 6 trillion yen in the current fiscal year, government data show. In 2014, 28 billion yen was allocated for a 30-year plan that included a bypass between the Odagawa and Takahashi rivers. Work on that 10-year project was scheduled to get under way later this year. MAPPING DISASTER Kurashiki City, like all municipalities across Japan, was required under a 2005 law to create “hazard maps” outlining areas at high risk of flooding, landslides and other disasters, and the locations of evacuation centres. Two years ago, Kurashiki City drafted its own colourful hazard maps. The maps were accurate; large swathes of Mabi marked as risky areas on the maps almost perfectly match the areas overrun by gushing floodwaters. But there were two problems: the city assumed a pattern of prolonged rain over a wide area rather than an intense concentrated downpour as actually occurred, according to online planning documents, and residents say they paid little attention to the maps. A near-record 138.5 millimetres of rain fell on July 6 in Kurashiki, second only to the 183.5 millimetres recorded on Sept. 3, 2011, according to weather agency data. Early the next morning, waters broke through levees on the Odagawa and Takamagawa rivers, unleashing flood waters. Some residents said they had simply ignored the hazard maps; after all, rainfall is relatively rare in Okayama Prefecture, which is known as the “Land of Sunshine.” “To me, it was just another routine document from the public office,” said Shigezo Kaneko, 80, who was rescued by boat after waters came close to the first-floor ceiling of his two-story house. “I guess I wasn’t really vigilant.” ‘NOT IN TIME’ In 2015, Japan’s Central Land Ministry came up with a policy to better cope with disasters, which included training local authorities on when to issue warnings. But advisories and orders to evacuate are left up to local authorities. Kurashiki Mayor Kaori Ito announced the first evacuation order, for the area south of the Odagawa river, at 11:45 p.m. At 1:30 a.m. the next day, using loudspeakers, mobile phone alerts, and television and radio messages, the city ordered residents in the heavily populated area north of the river to seek shelter. That order came just four minutes before confirmation of the first levee failure, on a small Takamagawa river. Ito, asked about the timing at a news conference, expressed regret but said she had gone by the book. “It (the order) was issued based on the condition of the river and in line with standards (for issuance),” she was quoted as saying by domestic media. Reuters was unable to reach Ito last week for further comment about the decision. Although his family escaped, Atsushi Yamashita, 63, could not persuade one of his neighbours, a man in his 90s, to leave his house just 30 metres from the Odagawa river. The man was later found dead. “Something similar might happen again in a few years,” said Yamashita as workers slowly cleared a mound of rubble in front of his home. “My wife says she doesn’t want to live here anymore.” For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App",Torrential rains across western Japan this month triggered floods and landslides that killed more than 200 people and left over a dozen missing in Japan's worst weather disaster in 36 years.,2018-07-17T03:03:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}","In Japan’s flood-ravaged Mabi, delays and lack of awareness magnified death toll",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/in-japans-flood-ravaged-mabi-delays-and-lack-of-awareness-magnified-death-toll-5262682/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/07/japan-floods-7591.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,levee,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tyler Durden,"While many have repeatedly warned over the past year that the record gains in credit are simply too good to stay - especially in Europe where yields and spreads have collapsed largely thanks to the ECB's relentless purchases of corporate debt, with the central bank announcing on Monday it held a record €127.7bn in bonds under its CSPP program - few are as bearish on credit as Morgan Stanley, which today issued ots 2018 US Credit Outlook which is, in a word, ""dire."" In the report titled ""When the Levee Breaks"" strategist Adam Richmond list the three biggest headwinds for credit as follows: ""Fed policy should become a material headwind, markets seem very late cycle, and valuations look extremely rich"" and details each below: An unprecedented central bank unwind... We think there is way too much complacency regarding what is a notable and growing shift in central bank policy globally. Remember, monetary policy has been massive in this cycle, and extremely supportive for credit markets. The Fed is now tightening in an untested way, through the balance sheet, while also pushing rates near restrictive territory. Markets expect a seamless unwind. We do not....with markets late cycle, and very dependent on ultra-easy liquidity... It is not a coincidence that fundamental problems are becoming more apparent in one sector after the next, as the Fed withdraws liquidity. In fact, we see late-cycle risks popping up all over the place, and as is often the case near a top, these risks are mistakenly (we think) being rationalized as purely 'idiosyncratic' problems. Defaults should remain low in 2018, but that is expected. Credit markets anticipate defaults one year ahead of time, and we think a cycle turn is closer than many believe....and valuations very rich: Spreads are near all-time tights, adjusting for the quality deterioration in the indices over time. Yes, the technicals have been strong, but that may change as the Fed's balance sheet shrinks faster. We note, a recession is not necessary to see negative excess returns, especially in the second half of a cycle, and particularly late in a Fed tightening cycle. Credit markets have not experienced three straight years of positive excess returns in over 20 years. Looking at the technicals, Morgan Stanley echoes what we said last month when he showed the collapse in spreads to 2007 levels, and warns that ""credit spreads are very rich nearly any way we slice the data. Spreads adjusted for leverage are back to 2007 levels in high yield, and 1997 levels in IG."" Exhibit 20 shows our fair value model for IG, HY and loans. In short, we estimate that IG, HY and loan spreads are 41bp, 197bp, and 111bp rich to fair value, respectively, using long-term default, downgrade, and risk-premium assumptions. And as we show in Exhibit 21 below, if we adjust for the deterioration in quality of the IG index over time, we find spreads are only 9bp wide of the all-time tights. One of the main reasons for Richmond's bearishness, is the ""complacency"" about the Fed's tightening, which of course is applicable to all asset classes. He explains: More than anything else, we firmly believe that central banks have been THE driver of credit in this cycle, stimulating markets like never before. Now they are attempting to tighten in a completely untested way, and yet credit is pricing in a seamless unwind. At the least, we expect a bumpier 2018, with a tougher setup anyway we slice it. Growth will decelerate, while the Fed continues tightening into a low-inflation environment, driving a completely flat yield curve (per our rates forecasts). Additionally, the year is beginning with booming confidence, as hopes for tax cuts rise, thus the bar to positively surprise is high, while ""Goldilocks"" is firmly in the price across most risk assets. We would not rule out the scenario in which financial conditions could tighten materially next year as the Fed withdraws stimulus in this unprecedented way, especially if growth expectations decline at the same time, pushing us from late cycle to end of cycle (though not our economists’ base case). And for those expecting the Fed to come to the rescue any time volatility picks up, remember that, with the balance sheet now effectively set on ""auto-pilot,"" reversing course, in our view, is a last resort. Taking a step back, per our forecasts, the Fed will hike 3 times in 2018. While gradual on the surface, this rate-hike cycle needs to be put in context. In other words, as we show in Exhibit 3 this time around, the Fed began hiking much later in an expansion, when GDP growth was weaker and corporate leverage higher vs. the start of past rate-hike cycles. In fact, given the drop in the neutral real Fed funds rate over time, monetary policy is already not that far from restrictive territory As a result, we believe markets can withstand less tightening than a low absolute level of rates might suggest (exhibit 4). And remember, this is a unique rate-hike cycle. One, tightening began not when the Fed first hiked rates in December 2015, but when they began tapering in early 2014. In this regard, the Fed has arguably already tightened policy by a similar amount as in past cycles (Exhibit 5), a point when credit spreads tend to widen on average (Exhibit 6). Two, along the same lines, the Fed is continuing to tighten, not just by hiking rates, but also through reverse QE. In fact, we believe investors are focused primarily on the ""gradual"" pace of rate hikes, treating the balance sheet as an afterthought. But the numbers are large. For example, the Fed will shrink its balance sheet by ~$400bn in 2018 alone. In our view, credit investors underestimated the tailwind from QE in this bull market. Similarly, they may now be underestimating the headwind from reverse QE. And while global central banks will still be adding liquidity next year, even they will be doing so at a slower pace, with the ECB cutting their purchases in half in 2018 and likely ending QE altogether around September of next year, while the BOJ hikes their long-term rate target in 3Q18. We see ""quantitative tightening"" as a clear catalyst for weaker technicals – i.e., fixed income demand needs to rise to absorb the additional supply or prices have to adjust somewhere (supply/demand 101). Why not expect the opposite of what happened when the Fed was expanding its balance sheet in this cycle (one-way flows into US credit), as the Fed begins its unwind, at least at the margin ? Assessing rate risk, MS says that while the Fed may in fact be successful at threading the needle, an outcome that is likely already priced into markets. However, the bank warns that ""at the least we can be certain that as the balance sheet shrinks more rapidly, so will the ""liquidity buffer"" in markets, which should magnify any negative catalyst that pops up along the way."" Another major risk factor for Morgan Stanley is that the US economy is now very late in the cycle, to wit: Markets are very late cycle, in our view, and if anything these risks have risen compared to this time last year. That we are in a late-cycle environment is a consensus view, but ""late cycle"" can mean different things to different people. To be more specific, we think there is a good chance that markets peak for the cycle in 1H18 and price in rising defaults in a bigger way throughout the year. But even if our timing continues to be too early, remember, late-cycle environments are often not great for credit returns regardless, with equities often outperforming. (Note, as we discuss further below, we believe the very late-cycle signal where credit/equities diverge is already happening, focusing on CCC-rated HY credit.) A recession is not necessary for credit spreads to widen late in a cycle. In fact, credit markets have not had three straight years of positive excess returns since 1996. Here Richmond takes offense with the argument that weak growth for much of this cycle has prevented ""excesses"" from building, and hence an already long cycle can last even longer. As he says "" we disagree and see excesses all over the place, driven in part by years of ultra-low rates."" He notes the following specific details: Credit markets have grown by 116% in this cycle, and leverage is at unprecedented levels for a non-recessionary environment. Low quality BBB issuance was 44% of total IG supply in 2017, a record as far back as we have data, and B rated or below loan issuance is now two thirds of total loan supply. LBOs levered over 6x are now a higher percentage of new LBO loans than in 2007. Covenant quality is considerably weaker than pre-crisis, while the debt cushion beneath the average loan is much lower. Investors have reached for yield in fixed income in this cycle in a massive way. Foreign flows have flooded into the asset class, arguably treating US credit as a rates product, while liquidity needs have risen, with mutual fund/ETF ownership of credit now over 19% vs. 11% pre-crisis. Excesses are apparent even outside of corporate credit, with underwriting quality deteriorating in auto lending in this cycle, while non-mortgage consumer debt is at a high, and CRE prices are ~25% above prior-cycle peaks. Stock-buyback activity has been substantial in this cycle, credit valuations have rarely been richer, and consumer confidence has not been this high since 2000. Summarizing, and ""cutting through the details"" Morgan Stanley says that it has high conviction in the following two points: Excesses have to be out there, given what central banks have done in this cycle – i.e., rates near or below zero for nearly a decade and round after round of QE globally, and the excesses are always difficult to spot as markets are rising, and then become obvious after the turn (how did I miss that?). We think this time is no different. To be clear, excesses are not everywhere. For example, credit quality did not deteriorate in places like housing and US financials in this cycle. However, this simply tells us that the problems of the last cycle will not be the same as the problems of the next. As a result, 2018 is when the critical mass of excesses finally spills over, or, to reuse the title, ""the levee finally breaks"": While the excesses may be out there, that has arguably been the case for a while. The difference, we think, is that more cracks are now forming under the surface, which in our view, means a turn is closer than the consensus believes. For example, outside of corporate credit, we have seen signs of weakness and tighter credit conditions in places like commercial real estate. Consumer delinquencies are rising across products (i.e., autos, credit cards, and student loans). And in corporate credit, one sector after the next is exhibiting ""idiosyncratic"" problems (e.g., Retail, Telecom, and Healthcare to name a few). All of this is consistent with a late-cycle environment where the yield curve is flattening, correlations in markets are dropping, the economy is at (or arguably through) full employment, the Fed is well advanced in its tightening cycle (we think), and equity multiples are expanding. To Richmond, these dynamics are ""late-cycle 101. Problems pop up early on in the areas that experienced the most severe deterioration in fundamentals in the bull market. Investors initially treat those issues as ""idiosyncratic."" The problems then spread when credit conditions tighten more broadly. And along these lines, we think it is not a coincidence that weaker-quality high yield credits are underperforming, as the Fed is hiking faster and quantitative tightening is now being set in motion."" If that wasn't enough, Morgan Stanley highlights two further risks: one having to do with the incremental impact of tax cuts, should they pass... And as a side note, tax cuts would not extend the cycle in our view – they risk doing the opposite. Very simply, credit markets will benefit from anything that keeps the cycle going – modest growth and a patient Fed. Tax cuts that come when the unemployment rate is 4.1%, which drives an overheating labor market, forcing a more aggressive Fed, if anything could cut off the cycle sooner.... and the inevitable rise in default intensity: We think there is a high likelihood that defaults will start rising again late next year and into 2019. Without going into the details here, in our view, CCC HY bonds are already ""sniffing out"" these budding default risks with their recent weakness. This should continue as tighter central bank policy exposes the fundamental challenges in the asset class (the problems are easier to hide when markets are flooded with liquidity). And the fundamental issues are broad-based. Not only is leverage high across sectors, but we also estimate that almost 30% of the HY market is either in secular decline or has clear operational challenges (Exhibit 16), with declining revenue growth over the past five years. Thinking about it more quantitatively, as we show in the default section below, based on the lag between when the cycle indicators we track have turned historically and when defaults have subsequently spiked, as well as the status of those metrics today, 2019 could be a year of materially higher defaults. Wrapping up the above, Morgan Stanley's conclusion is the following: Adding everything up, we see three key challenges in 2018: 1) Credit markets have been hugely reliant on central banks in this cycle, and now the Fed is withdrawing liquidity in an unprecedented way. We think markets are underestimating the risks of a mistake. 2) This liquidity withdrawal is happening while late-cycle risks (we think) are popping up all over the place. 3) Investors are buying credit at valuations that almost guarantee poor long-term returns, with the assumption that they will be able to time when to get out before the turn.... or stated even simpler, "" get out now.

JEAN LAFITTE, La. — From a Cessna flying 4,000 feet above Louisiana’s coast, what strikes you first is how much is already lost. Northward from the Gulf, slivers of barrier island give way to the open water of Barataria Bay as it billows toward an inevitable merger with Little Lake, its name now a lie. Ever-widening bayous course through what were once dense wetlands, and a cross-stitch of oil field canals stamp the marsh like Chinese characters. Saltwater intrusion, the result of subsidence, sea-level rise and erosion, has killed off the live oaks and bald cypress. Stands of roseau cane and native grasses have been reduced to brown pulp by feral hogs, orange-fanged nutria and a voracious aphid-like invader from Asia. A relentless succession of hurricanes and tropical storms — three last season alone — has accelerated the decay. In all, more than 2,000 square miles, an expanse larger than the state of Delaware, have disappeared since 1932. Out toward the horizon, a fishing village appears on a fingerling of land, tenuously gripping the banks of a bending bayou. It sits defenseless, all but surrounded by encroaching basins of water. Just two miles north is the jagged tip of a fortresslike levee, a primary line of defense for greater New Orleans, whose skyline looms in the distance. Everything south of that 14-foot wall of demarcation, including the gritty little town of Jean Lafitte, has effectively been left to the tides. The Drowning Coast This three-part special report about the ecological crisis facing Louisiana’s vanishing coast, and the people who live there, is the product of a partnership between The New York Times and NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. Jean Lafitte may be just a pinprick on the map, but it is also a harbinger of an uncertain future. As climate change contributes to rising sea levels, threatening to submerge land from Miami to Bangladesh, the question for Lafitte, as for many coastal areas across the globe, is less whether it will succumb than when — and to what degree scarce public resources should be invested in artificially extending its life. One sweltering evening last July, almost everyone from around Lafitte gathered near dusk at the bayou’s edge to celebrate the expenditure of nearly $4 million of those scarce public resources. There were shrimpers and crabbers, tug captains and roughnecks, teachers and cops. All had come for the ribbon cutting for a grand new seafood pavilion, the latest gambit by the longtime mayor, Timothy P. Kerner, to save the town from drowning. Free beer sloshed in plastic cups as folks ambled about the cavernous, open-sided shed, sampling shrimp rémoulade and alligator-stuffed mushrooms. Once the politicians had finished flattering one another from the podium, a Cajun band, fronted by a fiddler in a shimmery blue dress, cranked up a rollicking fais-dodo. Amid the celebration, a fireplug of a man in crisp jeans and a starched white shirt cheek-kissed and bro-hugged his way through the crowd. This was Timmy Kerner’s party. In his third decade as mayor, Mr. Kerner had managed to persuade the parish, state and federal governments to pay for his signature showcase at the entry to town. It might seem counterintuitive to keep building on land that is submerging. But Mr. Kerner did not see it as his job to take a 10,000-foot view. In the years since Hurricane Katrina, he had grown weary of being rebuffed in his quixotic campaign to encircle Lafitte with a tall and impregnable levee. He could rhapsodize all he wanted about preserving his community’s authentic way of life. The cost-benefit calculus — more than $1 billion to protect fewer than 7,000 people — always weighed against him. So he had set out to change it. His strategy was to secure so much public investment for Jean Lafitte that it would eventually become too valuable to abandon. In a decade, he had built a 1,300-seat auditorium, a library, a wetlands museum, a civic center and a baseball park. Jean Lafitte did not have a stop light, but it had a senior center, a medical clinic, an art gallery, a boxing club, a nature trail and a visitor center where animatronic puppets acted out the story of its privateer namesake. Some of the facilities had been used sparingly, and many at the grand opening questioned whether the seafood pavilion would be much different. To the mayor that was largely beside the point. What mattered was that the structure existed, that its poured concrete and steel beams made Lafitte that much more permanent. “Do we lose that investment, or do we protect it?” Mr. Kerner asked, barely audible above the din. “I hope people will see that, hey, not only are we fighting hard to exist, but, you know, maybe this place is worth saving.” The sky began to dim over the bayou. “It’s such a beautiful place, and it’s getting prettier by the day,” he said, ticking off his improvement projects. “This is just another step at building the community. It sends a message that we’re not going anywhere. “No matter what, we’re not leaving.” Louisiana’s “working coast” is dotted with communities that, like Lafitte, may not outlast the people who currently live there: Cocodrie, Delacroix, Dulac, Grand Isle, Isle de Jean Charles, Kraemer, Leeville, Paradis, Pointe-aux-Chenes, Venice. A fourth of the state’s wetlands are already gone, with heavy losses tallied from 2005 to 2008, when the coast was battered in succession by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike. In 2011, the federal government retired 35 place names for islands and bays and passes and ponds that had simply ceased to exist. State planners believe another 2,000 square miles, or even double that, could be overtaken in 50 years as the land sinks, canals widen and sea levels rise because of climate change. Recent studies show that glacial melting is accelerating in Antarctica and Greenland, driving sea level rise on the Gulf Coast. Although the recession of Louisiana's coast has slowed somewhat this decade, a football field’s worth of wetlands still vanishes every 100 minutes, according to the United States Geological Survey. That is one of the highest rates on the planet, accounting for 90 percent of such losses in the continental United States. The Gulf Restoration Network, a nonprofit conservation group, calculates that there are currently 358,000 people and 116,000 houses in Louisiana census tracts that would be swamped in the surge of a catastrophic hurricane by 2062. The Geological Survey predicts that in 200 years the state's wetlands could be gone altogether. “It is the largest ecological catastrophe in North America since the Dust Bowl,” declared Oliver A. Houck, a professor of environmental law at Tulane University in New Orleans who has written extensively about land loss in the state. In addition to the effects of climate change, human engineering has contributed broadly to the losses. Since the early 18th century, the construction of levees on the Mississippi and the closing of its distributaries have altered natural hydrology and stifled land-building silt deposits from spring floods. Property owners and government regulators have allowed the degradation of swamp and marshland, first for farming and cypress-logging and then, more insatiably, for oil and natural gas exploration. Since prospectors first discovered oil in Louisiana 117 years ago, 57,465 wells have been drilled in 10 coastal parishes, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. Thousands of miles of canals have been dredged through marshes for access. They broaden each year from erosion caused by boat traffic and storm currents, even as their spoil banks block natural water flow. A 50,000-mile thicket of pipelines connects rigs to refineries and tank farms across the state. After years of laissez-faire regulation, some consequential finger-pointing has begun in the courts, where parish governments and private landowners are for the first time suing energy companies to rebuild their land. To date that burden has fallen mostly on taxpayers, even when the property being repaired is owned by oil and gas interests, an examination of state records shows. The impact extends far beyond Louisiana’s shoreline. The slender coastal zone, stretching west from Breton Sound across the mouth of the Mississippi to Sabine Pass, contains 37 percent of the estuarine marsh and the largest commercial fishery in the contiguous 48 states. Its ports support 24 percent of the nation’s waterborne commerce and a fifth of its oil supply. The coast provides winter habitat for five million migratory waterfowl. Along with man-made levees and flood walls, it is the buffer that keeps the Gulf of Mexico from draining into New Orleans, much of which sits below sea level. Last year, Louisiana officials acknowledged for the first time that even with a vast restoration program, even with tens of billions of dollars they do not have, they no longer believed they could build land fast enough to offset the losses. Plotted on a map, their projections show 40-mile swaths, encompassing Jean Lafitte and everything below it, splashed in red to denote that, without action, they will disappear within decades. The crisis has become existential, with policymakers confronting choices about which communities they can afford to rescue. In the starkest illustration, a $43 million federal grant is being used to relocate the nearly 100 residents of Isle de Jean Charles, a narrow spit in lower Terrebonne Parish that has lost 98 percent of its land over 60 years. In a national experiment, the money will be used to buy land and build homes for those willing to move to higher ground on a sugar farm near Houma, about 40 miles north. To dramatize the state’s plight, Gov. John Bel Edwards last year declared the entire coast in “a state of crisis” and successfully lobbied the White House to expedite permits for restoration projects. “The sense of urgency has only magnified,” Mr. Edwards said in an interview. “We are literally in a race against time.” Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, insists that his state is “not in full retreat mode,” that “the science shows there is a window of opportunity” to sustain portions of the coast. But in a state not known for fiscal oversight, concerns linger about whether good money will be thrown after bad. “People argue that if you make the investments appropriately it will be fine, and it could be,” said Mitch Landrieu, the outgoing mayor of New Orleans. “But nobody really ever has the appetite to have a conversation about cutting off your arms so you can still walk.” The sputter and thrum of boat motors announces the morning along Bayou Barataria well before sunup. Burly men in rubber boots load ice and bait into trawlers moored behind their houses and prepare to push off in the dark. On a clear day out on the Pen, a four-mile lake that was farmland a century ago, the silhouettes of New Orleans office towers and the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery are visible to the north and east. Lines of crab traps stretch across the flat water, buoyed with floats painted in their owners’ signature colors, like jockeys’ silks. Alligator snouts skim the surface of nearby canals, and a boat’s approach sends a blue heron flapping into labored flight. Jean Lafitte, the pirate and smuggler, patrolled nearby waters before helping to defend New Orleans in the War of 1812, earning a pardon in exchange. Many here trace their lineage back to his day or to the 18th century Acadian settlers whose cuisine and dialect still prevail (although the Frenchman might be confused to hear locals call their home G ene Lafitte). The people of Lafitte have lived off the water for generations — trapping and skinning muskrats and other marsh dwellers, fishing, crabbing, oystering, building and repairing boats, ferrying workers and supplies to offshore rigs. Many accept the irony that the water may eventually destroy the economy it built. As it is, cheap imports and domestic farming of shrimp and fish have depressed prices and made it all but impossible to turn a profit. The global oil glut has reduced drilling activity on the coast by almost two-thirds since 2014. Recent graduates of Fisher High are as likely to seek careers in a casino or pharmacy as on a Lafitte skiff, the iconic fan-tailed fishing boats designed here. Jean Lafitte is laid out for six linear miles along a two-lane road that curves around the east bank of the bayou. Newer houses on land subdivided from a 19th-century sugar cane plantation were built atop six-foot mounds to keep the water at bay. Many older structures have been elevated hydraulically and placed on pillars 10 feet or higher, a process that can cost nearly as much as the house is worth. While government programs pick up some of the expense, there is not enough funding, and some homeowners cannot afford their share, which often exceeds $100,000. Yet many cannot imagine living anywhere else. They complain that the bloodless cost-benefit formulas determining which communities get protection give little weight to the qualities that make Lafitte desirable (the name Lafitte is used to refer to the town and its adjacent unincorporated areas). Children, they point out, still spend barefoot summers tubing and fishing and training bird dogs to leap off docks. And when they graduate from high school, three-fourths will have been together since prekindergarten. The policymakers “don’t place value on anything but the money, not the longevity of these communities, not the culture,” said Tracy Kuhns, 64, a longtime resident of the Barataria community across the bayou from Jean Lafitte. “One of the problems in this country is that people don’t have any connection to where they live. People really want that. Why would you take it away from people who already have it?” Ms. Kuhns, the president of Louisiana Bayoukeeper, an advocacy group for water quality and clean fisheries, pointed out that she did not lock her door (which flies open all day as her 17 grandchildren come and go). There have been but two murders in Jean Lafitte in the past 20 years, compared with 3,829 in New Orleans. At the center of town sits St. Anthony Catholic Church, which sponsors the Blessing of the Fleet Festival when brown shrimp season opens each spring. The first catch fills the freezers of cousins and neighbors before anything left is sold to Nunez Seafood and other dockside wholesalers. After a long day on the water, some may wet their whistle with $2.75 Budweisers at Mitch Martin’s Welcome Inn, where a swamp-pop band plays on Wednesday nights and gray-haired ladies line dance. The tavern is run by Timothy and Thomas Wiseman, brothers better known as White Boy and Zabo. Almost everybody in Lafitte has a nickname, some more self-explanatory than others: Skinny Boy, Sandbags, Lunch Meat, Pink Cow. When Tom Wiseman, 52, was a child, someone decided he looked like another guy nicknamed Zabo. “Forty years it has followed me now,” he said. The Wisemans find that the absence of levee protection reinforces the sense of Lafitte as a place apart, for better and worse. “We’re outside the line, and they don’t care about us,” Tim Wiseman, 54, said. “It’s always been like that.” “Now we just expect water and damage every five years,” his brother said. “It’s a way of life.” “And you know what? It still does not make us want to leave,” Tim said. “Are we economically feasible? Hell no. But this place will survive. If we end up living on rafts, there will be people living here.” Although only two feet above sea level, Lafitte rarely experienced significant damage from hurricanes until 2005. That year, Katrina’s 120-mile-per-hour winds stripped roofs off houses; a month later, Rita sent enough water coursing through lower Jefferson Parish to dislodge whitewashed tombs from graveyards. Homeowners in Lafitte found skulls and an artificial hip among the debris. Together, the storms forced the demolition of more than 150 houses. There would be more of the same with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, Tropical Storm Lee in 2011 and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. With only 2,000 residents, the Town of Jean Lafitte racked up $9.3 million in federal flood insurance payments in the eight years after Katrina, according to an analysis by Rui Hui, a researcher at the University of California, Davis. (Statewide, the program has paid out $19.5 billion in claims since 1978, or 30 percent of the national total, including $1 billion for properties that have flooded repeatedly, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.) “The first time, I sat on the sofa and just watched it come in,” remembered Chris Dufrene, 73, whose house flooded three times before he had it elevated eight feet three years ago. “Worst feeling I’ve ever had. Nothing you can do about it.” Shrimpers and guides had been noticing astonishing changes out on the water for years. Shambles of fishing cabins sat stranded on pilings, more distant from shore each season. Duck blinds had dissolved into muck. Land bridges no longer bridged. “I’ve been out here since 1981, and the beaches are eroding, the salt water’s intruding and all the islands in Barataria estuary that were protecting the land are washing away,” said Troy Schultz, 54, who trawls and crabs with his son, Troy Jr., 28. “Big Island is gone. Cat Island is gone. St. Mary’s Island is gone. They were miles long. Now it’s so open that every time you get squalls and storms it pulls up the marsh grass.” These days, the main road through Jean Lafitte floods almost any time a gusty storm blows in from the south. A mere sideswipe from Tropical Storm Cindy last June pushed several feet of water into streets and yards. The merciless hurricane season of 2017, with Harvey followed by Irma, Maria and Nate, made clear that the town’s days may be numbered. After Katrina left 1,833 dead in 2005, local, state and federal governments spent more than $20 billion to redesign failed and inadequate levees and pumps for metropolitan New Orleans. Even those improvements may not be sufficient to spare the area’s more than 1.3 million residents from another monster storm. But in Lafitte, only 25 miles south, the hurricane defense system consists mainly of Mr. Kerner and whichever men he can employ to sling tens of thousands of 25-pound sandbags, often for days on end. The mayor feels the threat viscerally, like many with deep roots here. His family settled in Lafitte in the early 1800s. He married a local girl at 18 (Darla Kerner was 16), and worked as a commercial fisherman, barkeep and tax collector before assuming his place as heir to one of the country’s most enduring political dynasties. Mr. Kerner has been mayor for 26 of his 58 years. With a gap of only eight years in the 1950s, a Kerner has held Lafitte’s top office since 1888, when his great-grandfather became justice of the peace. His father, Leo E. Kerner Jr., spearheaded the effort to incorporate Jean Lafitte in 1974 and became its first mayor, serving 17 years. Leo Kerner had been a welterweight champ in the Navy, and taught his boys how to spar, in politics as in the ring. The current mayor is known in Jefferson Parish, Baton Rouge and Washington as a single-minded scrapper who fights best from a defensive crouch. He can be quick to lose his temper when he feels Lafitte is being disrespected, but is also fast to apologize and hug it out. “He’s like a big teddy bear,” said Susan H. Maclay, president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority — West, which maintains levees on the west bank of the Mississippi. “It’s hard to tell him no when he needs help.” Mr. Kerner, a self-described Kennedy Democrat, has made a career of going hat in hand to Republican administrations. He has little choice, as Jean Lafitte’s operating budget hovers around $2 million. Legislative audits show that virtually all of the $27 million amassed by Mr. Kerner for construction since Katrina came from federal, state and parish grants. He has lobbied for scores of millions more for bridge and road improvements. Paradoxically, perhaps, some of the funding — including about a third of the cost of the seafood pavilion — has come from federal recovery grants that flow south each time the town is bludgeoned by a storm. As the water creeps closer, Mr. Kerner has increased the value of Jean Lafitte’s physical plant sevenfold in a decade. And yet, on his central mission to ensure his town’s future, he considers himself a failure. “When I ran for this office,” Mr. Kerner said, “I ran to provide a levee. That was my dream. I guess I haven’t done a very good job so far, because we don’t have one.” If Lafitte has a chip on its shoulder, it is not without cause. When the Army Corps of Engineers first mapped out Louisiana’s hurricane protection system in the 1970s and 1980s, it drew the footprint just north of Lafitte. The priority was to protect New Orleans, its booming West Bank suburbs and Louisiana’s ports (the state has five of the country’s 12 largest ). Feasibility studies repeatedly concluded that extending the levee to defend Lafitte was “not economically justifiable.” That left Mr. Kerner to devise his own plan, and find a way to pay for it. His concept was to phase in the construction of a chain of 10 linked ring levees, 65 miles in all, that would enclose each populated sector of Lafitte. Cost dictated that the walls of dirt, steel and concrete would be seven-and-a-half feet high at the outset, enough for protection from modest storms but not from a major hurricane. A levee of at least twice that height is typically needed to meet the standard of “100-year protection,” meaning it should withstand flooding from a hurricane with a 1 percent chance of occurring in a given year. For a while, the corps encouraged the mayor to pursue small federal grants to build segments of the system. In 2003, with about $10 million, construction began on the first link, which will eventually contain the town’s schools and municipal buildings. Then came Katrina, producing storm surge that overwhelmed portions of the New Orleans-area levee and flood wall system. In addressing the damage, Congress raised standards for the height and strength of the levees that the Corps of Engineers would build, effectively disqualifying the Lafitte project. Mr. Kerner also found little support locally, where the regional levee authority with jurisdiction over Lafitte was focused on protecting areas closer to New Orleans. In 2007, David J. Bindewald Sr., then the president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority — West, told Mr. Kerner explicitly that there would be no money for his levees. Instead, he sent Mr. Kerner a letter offering “several thousand un-filled sand bags and sand sufficient to fill the bags” along with “a quantity of shovels.” The furious mayor figured he could do better than that on his own, and persuaded allies in the Legislature to create the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District. Funded by a small property tax, the levee authority pays Mr. Kerner $12,000 a year as its president, on top of his mayoral base salary of $79,538, according to legislative audits. Mr. Kerner’s power play did not instantly change the essential dynamic. In 2009, after Hurricane Gustav, the corps began studying options for a new levee that would span a stretch of the lower coastal zone. Only one of several routes under consideration would have protected Lafitte. But at a levee board meeting in 2011, corps officials announced their determination that none of the proposed alignments could be justified economically. “What do you suggest we do?” an exasperated Mr. Kerner asked Mark Wingate, the corps engineer managing the project. Mr. Wingate said he suggested studying nonstructural options, including relocation. “You’re reading my mind,” Mr. Kerner responded, “because when I saw that map the first thing I thought was that I wanted to relocate your jawbone.” He nodded at Mr. Wingate’s two associates. “And your jawbone and your jawbone.” In the parking lot after the meeting, the corps officials stiffened when they saw the pugilistic mayor striding purposefully toward them. But he was only coming to apologize. Bruised but not defeated, Mr. Kerner thought there might be another way. Four months after Katrina, the State of Louisiana had created the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to centralize planning. The authority was tasked with devising a master plan for the coast, which it did for the first time in 2007, and with updating it every five years. Science, not politics, was to control its deliberations about the most cost-effective ways to protect people and property. The ambitious 2012 update pledged to use “every tool in the toolbox” to improve flood protection “in every community in coastal Louisiana.” It proposed a $50 billion buffet of projects — marsh creation, barrier island restoration, oyster shell reefs, river sediment diversions — that it asserted could start to neutralize land loss over the next 23 years and outpace it by year 30. There also would be billions for house elevations and flood walls — including $870 million to build Mr. Kerner’s ring levees at full “100-year” height: 16 feet. Over the past decade, the authority has grabbed money from a bag of sources to undertake 135 projects at a cost to the state of more than $2.4 billion (with another $2 billion budgeted for the next three years). Sixty-five square miles of land have been built or improved, along with 297 miles of levee and 60 miles of barrier islands and berms, according to the authority. The coast these days is awash in ambitious engineering projects. Near Jean Lafitte, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of marsh have been created in and around Bayou Dupont in an $82 million state-managed project that pumped sand from the Mississippi up to 13 miles away. Where open water stood in 2009, there is now walkable land, thick with saplings and shrubs. But before money could be appropriated for the Lafitte levees, the master plan’s authors adopted far more pessimistic forecasts of the impact of climate change. They effectively doubled their previous 50-year projections for likely sea level rise to more than two feet, the highest rate in the country, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That made the worst-case scenario in the 2012 master plan the best case for 2017 and led to a startling reversal: Louisiana could slow the submergence of the coast, but not arrest it. Even if the plan was somehow fully funded, and the state succeeded in adding or maintaining 800 square miles of wetlands over 50 years, there would still be a net loss of at least 400 square miles and possibly as many as 3,300. That recalibration necessarily shifted the state’s approach. “Once you accept the diagnosis that much of south Louisiana is going to disappear, you still have to have a strategic retreat,” said David Muth, director of the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program. “How do you plan this shrinking of the footprint, which is complicated by socioeconomics and by real questions about how fast sea level will rise and how fast you can build wetlands?” Torbjörn E. Törnqvist, a Tulane geologist who is an authority on subsidence, warned that decisions about places like Lafitte would be “a piece of cake compared to what’s coming — because a little down the line we’re going to be talking about communities not of 2,000 people but of much bigger things.” And then there’s the matter of where to find the master plan’s aspirational $50 billion — twice the entire state budget. To date, the only dependable financing model has been catastrophe, namely the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. BP and its drilling partners agreed to pay $7.1 billion over 15 years to settle litigation by the state, and the money has been earmarked for coastal restoration. Mark Davis, director of Tulane’s Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy, analogizes that to “paying for a gym membership by winning pie-eating contests.” The state and its coastal parishes have been counting on about $176 million a year from federal offshore oil leases under a revenue-sharing law passed in 2006. But steep declines in prices and drilling have lowered those projections. All told, even under the rosiest circumstances, the $50 billion master plan, which many experts consider inadequate, lacks at least $30 billion in revenue. “All of us believe our citizens deserve more than probably we can deliver,” said Bren Haase, the authority’s chief of planning and research. For its 2017 revision, the authority split its theoretical budget between hopeful restoration efforts, like rebuilding marshes and barrier islands, and defensive risk-reduction projects like raising levees and elevating houses. It re-evaluated proposals with a refined formula that weighed each project’s cost against the flood damage it would avert. The price tag for the Lafitte ring levees had risen to $1.2 billion, equating to more than $170,000 per resident. Despite Mr. Kerner’s efforts to rebalance the cost-benefit calculus, the annual savings amounted to less than a tenth of that, placing it near the bottom on the state’s list. When the authority published its draft in January last year, the mayor found that his ring levees, his lifeline for Lafitte, had been discarded. The mayor and his constituents felt betrayed once again. “It just makes all your fears justified,” said Ray Griffin, the manager of Cochiara’s Marina. “When they make a decision like that they just basically slap you in the face and say bye.” In an ecosystem as multifaceted as the Louisiana coast, the protection of one habitat may pose a mortal threat to another, or at least be perceived that way. Flood control is a zero-sum game. The water has to go somewhere. So there is natural suspicion in Lafitte about the most audacious engineering proposal in the state master plan, the $1.4 billion Mid-Barataria sediment diversion. The experimental project, which is under design, would carve a gap in the levee on the Mississippi’s west bank just southeast of Lafitte. When the river is high, floodgates could be opened to redirect sediment-rich water into adjoining marshland at up to 75,000 cubic feet per second. This occasional freeing of the river may build land more gradually than the continual pumping of dredged sand. But environmental groups argue that it will do so in a self-sustaining way at comparatively low cost. The state estimates that the diversion will deposit enough sediment over 50 years to fill the Superdome more than 22 times. “We know we need benefits now,” Mr. Haase said, “but if we’re not doing anything to fundamentally change the causes of our land loss, then we’re perhaps not investing our dollars wisely.” In Lafitte’s fishing community, there is deep concern, with some scientific backing, that flushing fresh water into brackish marshes and bays will imbalance the salinity needed to nurture shrimp, oysters and crab. Scientists argue that salinity will change with or without the diversion, but seafood industry groups have threatened to sue if it is built. “It will completely kill these fishing communities,” said Clinton Guidry, a Lafitte resident who once presided over the Louisiana Shrimp Association. “Is that the trade-off you want? If you lose shrimp fishermen for one generation, they’re gone forever.” For Tim Kerner, the Mid-Barataria diversion provided a bargaining chip. After his 100-year levees were axed from the master plan, he continued to push for funds to complete the ring system at lower height. The state owed Jean Lafitte, he argued, because the diversion would make the town even more vulnerable. Things came to a head in January last year when Mr. Kerner made his case, loudly, at a meeting with state officials. Seated nearby was his great benefactor in Baton Rouge, State Senate President John A. Alario Jr., a soft-spoken power broker whose district includes Lafitte. “You know,” Mr. Kerner told Johnny Bradberry, the chairman of the Coastal Pro",,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have projects all along the coast, and this area, where the Senate president is from, you have nothing but a sediment diversion that nobody really wants.” He reminded the officials of all of the money the state had been spending in Lafitte — the bridges, the civic center, the seafood pavilion. “It’s so inconsistent for C.P.R.A. to say we’re not worth saving when other government agencies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. “It’s throwing away the investment of tax dollars you already put in this place.” When the final master plan was presented to the Legislature in June, language had been inserted that the state and the Lafitte levee authority would be “focused on securing nearly $308 million” for the lower tidal protection levees and flood walls. The plan also called for spending $200 million in Lafitte over 30 years to elevate 1,237 houses,0, the master plan calls for spending a theoretical $6 billion over 50 years to elevate, improve or buy out 26,200 properties.) The question now is how quickly money will materialize. Mr. Kerner believes the levees can be completed for considerably less than the $308 million estimate. Regardless, the state has budgeted only $35.5 million for them over the next four years. “Those 2,000 folks down there would like very much for us to be committed to a $1 billion ring levee,” said Mr. Edwards, the governor. “Well, we just can’t do that. But we haven’t given up on them either.” Prospects seem dim for a federal bailout to shore up Lafitte and the rest of Louisiana’s coast. Preserving the state’s wetlands is a tough political sell because many Americans do not appreciate the magnitude of their self-interest there. Increasingly, Louisiana faces competition from more populous coastal zones that also are at grave risk, like South Florida, metropolitan New York and the Texas Gulf. The only other pockets deep enough to fill the financial gap belong to oil and gas. Even in a time of retrenchment, the energy industry remains among Louisiana’s most vital employers, revenue generators and civic and political donors. But with drilling in decline and the BP oil spill a fresh memory, Louisianans seem newly receptive to holding the industry accountable for the consequences of its activities. In a recent poll of 565 Louisianans by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune, 72 percent said the oil and gas industry should help pay for coastal restoration along with the government. (Mr. Kerner happens to agree.) Another 18 percent said the industry should bear the cost alone. Only half said they were willing to pay higher taxes to redeem the coast. In 2013, with the political landscape shifting, the levee authority charged with flood control in New Orleans sued 97 oil and gas companies, presenting a novel claim. “Everybody understood that the industry was responsible for a significant part of the damage and had placed an increased burden on those responsible for protecting the population from storm surge,” said John M. Barry, the New Orleans author who spearheaded the litigation as vice president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority — East. “So it seemed clear there would have to be some avenue to get them to accept their liability.” Over the prior 20 years, plaintiffs’ lawyers had won judgments and settlements in Louisiana cases demanding the cleanup of oil field contamination. The flood protection authority hired one of them — Gladstone N. Jones III of New Orleans — and constructed arguments evocative of those used 30 years earlier against Big Tobacco: Energy companies had known for decades that they were destroying the marsh but ignored legal and contractual obligations to repair it, at great cost to taxpayers. There is considerable documentation of advance knowledge. Scientists and conservationists have sounded alarms since the 1920s about the loss of land to oil exploration. Documents uncovered through discovery show that the industry’s own studies began making the connection nearly 50 years ago. In 1972, a report commissioned by oil and gas transmission companies estimated that pipelines decimated up to two square miles of marsh a year and that access canals destroyed at least that much. Seventeen years later, a study of aerial photographs for the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, which represents major producers, concluded that “the direct and indirect effects of canal development tend to be the overwhelming cause of wetland losses.” In 2000, a study sponsored in part by the Gas Research Institute estimated that the industry bore responsibility for 36 percent of Louisiana’s coastal land loss between 1932 and 1990. More recent research links the industry to subsidence — the compaction and sinking of sediment. “Rapid subsidence and associated wetland loss were largely induced by extraction of hydrocarbons,” concluded a 2005 study of the Mississippi Delta plain by the Geological Survey. It added that the collapse of Louisiana’s marsh “appears to be unprecedented and not repeated in the geological record of the past 1,000 years.” And yet, some Louisiana lawmakers, both in Congress and the State Legislature, do not support efforts to regulate what may be the most lasting environmental legacy of fossil fuels: climate-driven sea level rise. Among them is Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, whose district includes Lafitte. Mr. Scalise, a Republican, applauded Mr. Trump’s announcement in June that the United States would withdraw from the global Paris accord to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The state’s leadership initially viewed the levee authority lawsuit as a direct assault. The Republican governor at the time, Bobby Jindal, demanded that it be withdrawn and removed Mr. Barry and others on the authority. He orchestrated passage of a law that would have invalidated the litigation had a state judge not declared it unconstitutional. “It’s that old saying — you don’t bite the hand that feeds you,” said Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, also a Republican. “I don’t say they have no effect, the canals, but I think it’s a money grab against an industry that has been very good to Louisiana.” In 2015, a federal judge dismissed the levee authority lawsuit, primarily on grounds that the agency lacked legal standing. That ruling has been upheld on appeal. But the original lawsuit was followed quickly by scores of others, some filed by private landowners and a total of 43 by six different parish governments (the equivalent of counties). In August, a different federal judge ruled that pipeline companies must repair erosion that had occurred since 1953 along canals on 20,000 acres of privately owned wetlands in Plaquemines Parish. The first of the lawsuits filed by the parishes is scheduled to be heard in state court in Plaquemines in 2019. The parishes, all represented by the Baton Rouge firm of Talbot, Carmouche &amp; Marcello, claim that oil and gas companies violated state permitting laws in the dredging of canals, as well as regulations requiring production sites to be “cleared, revegetated, detoxified and otherwise restored as near as practicable to their original condition upon termination of operations.” The suits seek actual restoration of degraded land in addition to monetary damages. In 2016, when the governor’s office changed parties, Mr. Edwards reversed Mr. Jindal’s stance and intervened in support of the parish cases. “Oil and gas is a huge component of our economy, and we want them to be successful,” Mr. Edwards said. “But we also want them to act responsibly when they explore for and produce hydrocarbons.” Oil and gas industry leaders acknowledge that their potential exposure is substantial. They warn they will not roll over to trial lawyers who they believe are extorting them for a global settlement. “We’re going to fight every single last issue because we don’t believe we’ve done anything wrong,” said Gifford Briggs, vice president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, which represents independent producers and service companies. Chris John, a former Democratic congressman who presides over the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said the lawsuits failed to recognize numerous other causes of coastal degradation and would not be settled. He said that “the energy industry has conducted its operations in accordance with government-issued permits and applicable federal, state and local regulations.” Mr. Briggs echoed that defense. “Yes, if you dig a canal or build a slip, is there technically a loss of marsh or land? Sure,” he said. “But that’s done through permit. That doesn’t mean there’s any additional liability or responsibility beyond fulfilling the obligations of the permit.” As it is, taxpayers have spent at least $588 million to repair oil-and-gas-related damage in coastal Louisiana, according to an analysis of state records. That accounts for 84 percent of the money spent on more than 200 projects over three decades by the federal Coastal Wetlands, Planning, Protection and Restoration Act. Enacted in 1990, the program is funded by taxes on fishing gear, imported watercraft, boat fuel and motors. Because petroleum interests own or lease much of the coast, those taxpayer-funded restoration efforts often benefit the very industry that shredded the marsh in the first place. In Terrebonne Parish, for instance, $39 million was spent to repair breaches in a land bridge across north Lake Mechant caused by erosion and oil access canals. Much of the property is owned by Apache Corporation and Louisiana Land and Exploration, both major oil and gas companies, parish records show, and operators have included ConocoPhillips, Texaco and Humble Oil (a precursor of Exxon Mobil). Jean Lafitte has not yet reached the tipping point when bankers and insurers perceive that the lifetime of their loans and obligations could exceed the lifetime of the town. Indeed, real estate values are relatively high, if only because there is so little to be had. But there are early signs of an exodus, particularly among younger residents. The population of the area declined by 21 percent between 2000 and 2010, although estimates suggest it has rebounded slightly this decade. Enrollment at the two public schools dropped 27 percent from the peak before Katrina and Rita, but has risen by 10 percent since. Mr. Kerner believes the declines reflect temporary dislocations. But some, like Buttercup Mancuso, have left for good. She, her husband and three of their children evacuated their rental house in lower Lafitte before it flooded during Hurricane Isaac in 2012. They returned to find mold sprouting two feet up the walls. The family abandoned their belongings except for their photographs. “Losing everything once was enough for me,” Ms. Mancuso,43, said. “I just couldn’t do it again.” They moved to the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, and eventually to North Carolina. Travis Johnson,70, a retired Army and commercial helicopter pilot who moved to Barataria in 2000, said that at his age he would gladly take a government buyout for his waterfront house. “I drove out of here during Hurricane Rita with water flowing over the hood of my Jeep,” he said. “Should one delay evacuation, it is not possible to escape. I don’t want a lot of complications.” But Lafitte’s lifers, for the most part, seem resigned to wait things out. The centuries spent fishing and trapping have built a resilient and self-reliant culture. More than 250 years since the Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia, there remains a deep resistance to another forced exile. “People that don’t understand it say, ‘Why don’t you just move away?’” said Ms. Kuhns, the Louisiana Bayoukeeper president, who refuses to join her daughter, Ms. Mancuso, on the other side of the levee. “The people who are connected to these communities don’t think that way. It’s a whole culture that’s connected to the earth and the water. You can’t replicate it.” And so the men sandbag. Last hurricane season, they stacked them by the thousands in anticipation of Tropical Storm Cindy, then unstacked them when the floodwater receded. They did it again for Hurricane Harvey and once more for Nate. The mayor supervises up and down the road from his white Ford Expedition, crossing himself as he passes the Catholic church. He pitches in long enough to let his back start aching, then carps that it’s because the young guys today don’t know how to properly swing and catch. He remembers each storm as a fight, tallying them as wins and losses. In the old days, they would stack 200,000 sandbags. “It was like being in a war zone,” Mr. Kerner said. “We wouldn’t go to bed for two or three days at a time.” With sections of two of the ring levees complete, the men got by with only 20,000 sandbags when Nate narrowly missed Lafitte last October. “Each time you just have to be ready and fight it as if it’s going to be the worst thing that ever happened,” Mr. Kerner said. “And then you may have to do it again a week later.” The mayor has developed a sixth sense for the telltale signs of whether Lafitte will flood. As Cindy moved in last June, he watched the tide rising near the Goose Bayou bridge: “That water won’t quit,” he cursed. “Look at the whitecaps. That’s what I don’t want to see.” Soon the water was lapping at his tailpipe. Four months later, on the night Nate landed near Biloxi, Miss., he divined better news from the bayou’s outward flow, indicating that the leading edge had curled in harmlessly from the north. “That’s it,” he said. “It’s over.” As he drove home, eyelids drooping, Mr. Kerner could not help feeling annoyed that the town had expended so much effort for no reason. Then he remembered that no one had been hurt, no one had been washed out of his or her home or stranded in distress. “Such a relief,” he thought. He eased into bed, bone-weary and sore, like an aging boxer, and lost himself in reveries of shiny new buildings and 16-foot levees — whatever might spare Jean Lafitte from the water," for now.""","Left to Louisiana's Tides, a Village Fights for Time New York Times sea than when — and how much the public should invest in artificially extending its life.

Victor Reklaitis,"Washingtons border-security deal provides $1.375 billion to build about 55 miles of border barriers, setting up government contractors to compete for their piece of that money.
While the level of funding falls short of what President Donald Trump has demanded for his long-promised wall, its still a sizable amount that Democrats and Republicans have agreed to spend in two areas of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. 
The bipartisan deal allows for the use of any barrier materials previously used, such as steel slats or levee wall systems. It bars the use of new designs, such as the concrete prototypes commissioned by the Trump administration, which continues to push for an extensive border wall but faces legal and congressional challenges after the president declared a national emergency to build it.

And see:How Trump wants to pay for the border wall after invoking a national emergency
The new 55 miles of barriers in Hidalgo and Starr counties likely will get built by companies with previous experience in this type of work, and these companies range from a privately held Texas firm to publicly traded Israeli contractors, according to experts. The firms have a history of giving money mostly to Republican politicians.
Galveston contractor SLSCO is building some of the current sections in the RGV. If I had to guess, they would be likely to get future contracts as well, said Reece Jones, author of the book Violent Borders and a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii.
SLSCO, founded by brothers Todd, Billy and Johnny Sullivan, scored a $166.8 million contract for a border-security project in December, as well as a $145 million deal in November.
Montana-based Barnard Construction Co., given its past experience, also could get a chance to build some of the 55 miles of barriers, according to James R. Phelps, a consultant, author and professor who teaches courses on homeland security at universities such as Nova Southeastern in Florida. Barnard in November won a $172 million contract to build 32 miles of replacement wall in Arizona. 
Firms such as SLSCO and Barnard could be go-to companies for Customs and Border Protection, the agency that will award contracts for the work, Phelps said. They know what theyre doing. They can get it done relatively quickly, he said. CBP is expected to have companies compete for contracts for the 55 miles of barriers, as happened for past border projects. The agency declined to comment, and SLSCO and Barnard didnt respond to requests for comment.
SLSCOs three founders contributed significant amounts to individual Republican candidates committees or groups tied to the GOP during the 2018 election cycle, giving about $68,000 in total, according to Federal Election Commission filings. One of the founders, Johnny Sullivan, also donated $2,700 to longtime Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lees campaign committee. 
Meanwhile, Barnard Construction founder Tim Barnard contributed about $82,000 to individual Republican candidates committees or groups tied to the GOP during the last cycle, according to FEC filings. He also gave $6,000 to three trade groups political action committees.
Roles for tech companies and concrete
Companies focused on high-tech border security look particularly well positioned, said Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at investment adviser Veda Partners.
Thats probably the only place where money is going to actually be rolling out the door, and thats a huge boon to the companies who are concentrating there, she said. Democrats appear inclined to keep funding investment in video surveillance, drones and other smart tools, and the Trump administration has been promoting high tech, Treyz added. 
Such companies include Elbit Systems of America, which has built high-tech border towers in Arizona. The U.S. subsidiary of Israel-based Elbit Systems Ltd. 
ESLT, -0.28%
 last month said its eager to construct towers in Texas and other border states, according to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram report. In the 2018 cycle, Elbit Systems of America CEO Raanan Horowitz contributed about $12,000 to individual Republican candidates committees or groups tied to the GOP, along with $1,000 to Illinois Democratic Rep. Brad Schneiders committee.
Israel-based Magal Security Systems 
MAGS, -1.51%
 , which provides perimeter intrusion detection systems, also might get involved. Magal Security has built much of Israels Gaza wall and has been mentioned as a possible contractor for the U.S. wall, the University of Hawaiis Jones said. The company, listed in Israel and the U.S., has talked up building a smart fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, and its shares rallied after Trumps election but have since pulled back. 
The six companies that constructed wall prototypes in 2017 still might end up involved in upcoming border projects given theyve gone through a traditional bid process and have the feel of vetted, secure builders, said Treyz of Veda Partners. They probably would propose different barriers than weve seen thus far, in part because their designs all reportedly failed key tests, she added. Those six companies were Texas Sterling Construction Co., Fischer Sand &amp; Gravel Co., KWR Construction Inc., Caddell Construction Co., W.G. Yates &amp; Sons Construction Co. and ELTA North America, whose parent company, Israel Aerospace Industries, is on track to have its stock floated on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
Concrete companies such as Texas-based U.S. Concrete Inc. 
USCR, -0.25%
 , Alabama-based Vulcan Materials Co. 
VMC, -0.85%
 and North Carolinas Martin Marietta Materials 
MLM, -0.98%
also might get business from the 55 miles of barriers, even if the barriers are largely made of steel slats or pipes, said Phelps, the professor of homeland security.
The pipes are actually set in concrete, he told MarketWatch. While we may not put a concrete wall above ground, you cant just stick pipes in the ground and tamp the dirt in around them.
U.S. Concrete, Vulcan and Martin Marietta didnt respond to requests for comment. In 2017, U.S. Concrete CEO Bill Sandbrook signaled that his company was interested in bidding for wall-related work.
Related:How the Trump Wall gets built U.S. Concretes CEO explains
Bernstein Research in 2016 predicted that CemexCX, -0.20%
 , a big seller of cement, concrete and other materials, was best positioned to benefit from Trumps proposed wall. Phelps, however, was downbeat on the Mexican heavyweights prospects when it comes to the $1.375 billion promised for new barriers. 
Trump has been adamant about keeping money in the United States, he said. Even though Cemex has a huge U.S. component to their business, the fact is theyre a Mexican company.
The U.S. provides 25% of Cemexs annual revenue, above Mexicos 22% and more than any other country.
The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, a trade group whose leadership includes executives from U.S. Concrete, Vulcan, Martin Marietta and Cemex, contributed about $433,000 to federal candidates or party committees during the 2018 election cycle, with Republicans receiving 89% of the money.
Thats according to data from OpenSecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics thats run by a nonpartisan research group, the Center for Responsive Politics. Vulcan and its affiliates contributed about $390,000 to candidates or party groups, with 58% of that going to the GOP and 42% to Democrats, while OpenSecrets.orgs figures show zero or minimal donations by the other two U.S. concrete companies. Cemexs PAC gave $289,000 to federal candidates, with 83% of that going to Republicans and 17% to Democrats.

"Justin Rohrlich, Heather Timmons","The chair of the House Appropriations Committee has introduced a bill to keep the US government open (pdf) that bumps up the overall Homeland Security budget and includes just $1.4 billion for border barricades.
The word wall is not used once in the entire bill, which runs 1,159 pages. It budgets $3.3 billion less than the $5.7 billion Donald Trump demanded for construction of a wall on the border with Mexico before shutting down the government for a record 35 days.
The House is to vote on the bill today (Feb. 14) at 8pm US eastern time and the Senate could take it up immediately after that. Trump, who has said he is not happy about the deal negotiated by Democratic and Republican lawmakers, is still expected to sign the legislation tomorrow, ahead of a midnight deadline for another government shutdown. On the floor of the Senate today, Chuck Grassley, the Republican from Iowa, said Lets all pray that the president will have wisdom to sign the bill so the government doesnt shut down.
Included in the massive bill are everything from a $174,000 payment to the widow of late congressman Walter Jones to updated inspection guidelines for poultry imports. Yet he actual language about border barriers is minimalthe word barrier appears just four times in the bill.
Heres a look at what the bill says on the subject of border construction:
Bollard gets one mention (p. 33):
The amounts designated in subsection (a)(1) shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (Public Law 115-31), such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.
(The subsection referred to above earmarks $2,370,222,000 for US Customs and Border Protection to spend on fencing, inspection equipment, humanitarian needs, and facility improvements.)
The word fence does not appear once. The word fencing appears seven times in the bill: six times in regard to the border fencing the $1.4 billion is earmarked for, and once in reference to materials for general use by the Secret Service (p. 33).
$1,375,000,000 is for the construction of primary pedestrian fencing, including levee pedestrian fencing, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector;
None of the money can be used to build fencing:
within the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge
within the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park
within La Lomita Historical park
within the National Butterfly Center
within or east of the Vista del Mar Ranch tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge
Before construction begins on any physical barriers within a citys limits, the Department of Homeland Security must meet first to discuss (p. 34) and reach mutual agreement regarding the design and alignment of physical barriers within that city. The public will then have at least 60 days to comment (p. 35) on whatever plans are made.
This has been an issue, most recently in Nogales, Arizona, where local officials say federal authorities did not contact them before installing top-to-bottom concertina wire along a border fence that runs through the citys downtown.
The word drugin relation to prescription-drug safety regulations, the US Food and Drug Administration, and one mention of drug kingpins (p. 3)appears in the bill 103 times. Illicit drugs are mentioned once; narcotics, 29 times; and trafficker, three. 
There is one use of the word caravan (p. 31), but it is in reference to vehicular caravans that transport protected government witnesses, not the Central American caravans of asylum seekers that Trump contends are an element of a national emergency at the border.

Adele Peters,"When the oldest restaurant in San Francisco was built in 1861, it sat on the waterfront of a creek, serving seafood caught in the neighborhood. The restaurant hasn’t moved, but the creek was buried underground in a culvert nearby, and the marsh that once surrounded the area has been developed, built on debris from the 1906 earthquake. The building now sits on Bayshore Boulevard, a street with several lanes of traffic, sandwiched between two freeways and across from a gas station and a parking lot. The neighborhood is one of the parts of the Bay Area most at risk from flooding from rising sea levels and severe storms and from earthquakes. It’s also one of nine areas reimagined by teams of architects and designers in a year-long competition to create a “blueprint of resilience” for the region (largely focused on climate change and sea level rise, but focused on earthquakes, as well). The proposal for the area, located in an industrial corner of southeastern San Francisco, suggests partially uncovering the creek, both to better deal with flooding and to bring green space to a part of the city that lacks it. The competition, Resilient by Design, was inspired by the Rebuild by Design challenge held in New York City after Hurricane Sandy, and funded largely by the Rockefeller Foundation, which also helped fund the work in New York. “We thought, can we do something similar, but before we have a big natural disaster?” says Amanda Brown-Stevens, managing director of Resilient by Design. “Can we proactively think about bringing in design in a creative way to help us reduce flood risk in the future?” Billions of dollars’ worth of property in the Bay Area is at risk from rising sea levels, including infrastructure like San Francisco’s international airport. As some parts of the city sink, one recent study found that even more land is at risk than previously thought. The low-lying communities that are most at risk as the water rises also tend to have other challenges, including poverty, asthma, and other health issues from pollution, and an increased risk of earthquake damage, especially in areas that were built on rubble on former marshes. The designers looked at resilience holistically–not just how infrastructure might reduce flooding, but how communities could become stronger to bounce back when floods inevitably happen. They also looked at solutions beyond simple seawalls, which can’t prevent flooding if part of the problem is coming from stormwater and high groundwater. Here are their ideas: San Francisco, by Big+One+Sherwood In southeastern San Francisco, the restored creek could absorb millions of gallons of stormwater each year, while the banks could become new public spaces. Right now, the creek ends in a channel near a freeway off-ramp and rail tracks; the naturalized creek would be accessible for the low-income, majority-black neighborhood. Because sea level rise in the area could reach as much as six feet by 2100, the designers propose relocating low industrial buildings away from the water’s edge and made taller and denser. The wholesale produce market could add urban farming and a culinary school. Sprawling parking lots could disappear. Highway 280 could become a ground-level boulevard. New floating buildings could be moored by the shoreline. South San Francisco, by Hassell+ In South San Francisco–a small city with a giant 1920s-era hillside sign proclaiming itself “The Industrial City,” the sea level could rise 55 inches by the end of the century. To help deal with floods that already happen regularly, the designers propose a plant-filled “living levee” that would restore wetlands, and an expanded channel for a local creek with plant-filled walls that can double as public space (and provide a place to cool down as heat waves become more common). A bike-pedestrian bridge could cross rail lines and a highway to provide new access to parks for a community that’s currently disconnected from the bay. A new nursery for native plants below the bridge could also treat stormwater runoff and hold floodwater. Restored wetlands could do the same. The designers suggest that a network of new open spaces around the Bay Area could serve as both collection points for water and connection points where communities can gather in emergencies; creeks and streets could help guide both water and people to the bay. North Richmond, by Home Team North Richmond, pinned between a Chevron refinery and a landfill and surrounded by rail lines, freeway, and industry, already deals with widespread poverty, pollution, systemic racism, and chronic flooding. As sea levels rise, it will have to deal with more. The designers suggest building new small houses and creating a community land trust to help more people in the community become homeowners. They also suggest new green infrastructure, including wetland restoration as the current marsh drowns from sea level rise, and 20,000 trees planted to help filter both air and water pollution. Vacant lots could be densely planted with trees to become “air quality parks.” A new overpass would let pedestrians cross the highway to reach the bay; park access could be one way to help deal with the chronic stress of climate change impacts. Fremont, Union City, and Newark, by Public Sediment Alameda Creek once meandered through the East Bay, but after repeated floods, the creek was encased in a concrete channel, and the suburbs of Fremont, Union City, and Newark were built up around it. With the water trapped in the channel, sediment that used to flow to the marsh and mudflats near the shoreline–building up the land–is now also stuck in the channel, and the land is subsiding. The team of designers proposes “unlocking” the creek, making it wider and deeper, bringing back plants, and selectively breaching the levee to let sediment flow out and rebuild marshes. The design would give new public access to the creek for the diverse communities living around it. South Bay, by Field Operations In the heart of Silicon Valley, from Santa Clara to Mountain View, this design suggests creating the “South Bay Sponge”–a network of wetlands, marshes, wider creeks, mudflats, and other natural areas that can soak up water during storms and then slowly release runoff. (The whole region once acted as a sponge for the Bay Area, but 85% of wetlands have been lost.) The designers also recommend building differently ; a typical low office building with a sprawling parking lot could be built higher, with a park in front and a green roof on top to soak up water. Neighborhoods can become denser farther from the water’s edge, while the low-lying shoreline adds new space for recreation. San Pablo Bay, by Common Ground Highway 37, which sits on top of a levee next to San Pablo Bay, struggles both with traffic and increasing floods. The levee, like others in the area, cuts off the tidal flow and has caused the land to subside. The designers of this project suggest converting it into an elevated scenic highway, including a bike and pedestrian path, that leaves room underneath for the marsh to return to its natural state. The design also considers better options for transit, including rail. San Rafael, by Bionic The low-lying parts of the city of San Rafael, built on mudflats next to the bay, are already at risk from flooding. Though some might think traditional infrastructure could help, such as raising levees or blocking off local creeks, the designers suggest taking a new approach. New development could be concentrated on higher ground and make use of underutilized space. Existing housing in vulnerable areas could be transformed to become more resilient to flooding and earthquakes. A new constructed reef along the shoreline could protect from waves, provide a nursery for marine species, and provide new recreation. East Oakland and Alameda, by ABC San Leandro Bay was once a shallow bay surrounded by marshes and mudflats that helped provide flood resilience further inland, but in the 1870s, a canal was cut through the area–isolating the city of Alameda–and coastal wetlands were filled in with urban rubble and sand. Both East Oakland, a low-income, mostly black community that struggles with pollution and housing loss, and Alameda are now at risk from flooding as the sea and groundwater rise. The design team proposes creating a network of ponds, expanded streams, and other green space that can absorb and filter water. New affordable housing would help residents stay in the community; some of that housing could include prefab floating homes on tidal lagoons. A new transit hub could provide more connections to work. Marin City (and everywhere), by P+SET Rather than proposing a design for a specific location, this team suggested a new social design process that could be used anywhere. Some of the communities most at risk from sea level rise are also dealing with poverty, racism, stresses like food insecurity, and the threat of displacement. “Engaging” a community typically happens in a limited way, but in this new process, the community helps lead–creating a vision for the neighborhood, assessing current assets and problems, and devising strategies and a timeline to implement solutions. The designers tested the process with community members in Marin City, a small, low-income, diverse community at the bottom of a watershed that frequently floods. Sea levels in the area are already eight inches higher than they were 100 years ago. Unlike in New York, where disaster recovery funds were available for new designs–and seven projects are moving forward, though because of the complexity, none have yet broken ground–it’s not yet clear how Bay Area cities and counties will use the concepts. But the intent is to help build the ideas into plans for replacing outdated infrastructure. After the teams present their final ideas this week, a group of stakeholders will meet to talk about how to begin making the suggestions reality. No one idea will “win” the competition; each of the teams, initially selected by a jury in order to participate, has put forth designs that could potentially be implemented. “Everything we’re trying to do is focused on building interest and support for local governments and agencies to move these forward,” says Brown-Stevens.","These nine proposals offer a vision of how San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and the surrounding communities can rethink their landscape to prepare for rising sea levels and other dangers of our changing climate.

"El Paso Times, Daniel Borunda and Aaron Martinez, El Paso Times","His appearance in El Paso on Wednesday, March 27, 2019, came as a temporary satellite processing center was set up under the Paso Del Norte International Bridge.
 Mark R Lambie and Aaron Martinez and Samuel Gaytan, Wochit
U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said the border has hit it's ""breaking point"" during a visit to El Paso.
A huge influx of Central American migrants has made the El Paso Sector the second-busiest location on the U.S.-Mexico border.

McAleenan spoke Wednesday morning along the border in the Chihuahuita neighborhood in Downtown El Paso. 
The immigration system ""breaking point has arrived this week,"" McAleenan said.
""CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our Southwest Border and nowhere has that crisis manifested more acutely than here in El Paso,"" McAleenan said. 
In the past two mornings, border officers took more than 12,000 migrants into custody along the border, McAleenan said.
""A high number is 4,000 6,000 is crisis level,"" McAleenan said. ""Twelve thousand is unprecedented. On Monday, we saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in years, with over 4,000 in a single day.""

He continued, ""We are now on pace for over 100,000 apprehensions and encounters with migrants, with 90 percent  90,000 crossing the border illegally between ports of entry. March will be the highest month in over a decade.""
Last SlideNext Slide
The number of migrants detained in El Paso is not as large as in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, but the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector has seen the biggest growth along the border.
McAleenan said that Congress needs to come up with legislative solutions to expedite political asylum claims made by migrants.
The surge numbers are just overwhelming the entire system,"" McAleenan said.
He said that 10 to 15 percent of migrants have legitimate asylum claims, but it will take years for those claims to be heard in court.
""Economic migration"" from impoverished Central American nations is overwhelming the legitimate asylum system, McAleenan said.
While 65 percent of border crossings are families and children surrendering to agents, the rest are adults trying to evade capture, including some with criminal backgrounds, McAleenan said.
The Border Network for Human Rights, an El Paso immigrant advocacy group, said that the government should invest in staff and infrastructure ""to make our asylum system in ways that uplift our values and humanity of all persons.""
In a statement, the group accused McAleenan of painting migrants as criminals.
Asylum seekers are not criminals, the group stated. Asylum is a lawful process and migrants need to have an ability to claim asylum. Denying migrants the ability to claim asylum at ports, as our laws are designed to work, may force them to cross without authorization but does not make them criminals or undermine their asylum claims in any way.
The group added that they ""invite Commissioner McAleenan to tell the Irish of the 1840s or the Italians of the 1890s that poverty and starvation are not reasons to come to seek the opportunity, welcome, and grace of these United States.""
Hundreds of migrants are being held beneath the Paso Del Norte International Bridge in El Paso as U.S. Customs and Border Protection has run out of space to process the asylum seekers. Above, two boys look out from the fence at the bridge as protestors demand their release.

Bridge waits may grow as CBP officers sent to help Border Patrol
There could be longer waits to cross the border at the ports of entry because 750 CBP officers are being shifted to help Border Patrol, McAleenan said.
""El Paso knows what those six bridges mean in the daily commerce with Mexico,"" McAleenan said. ""We need those officers now, though, to help Border Patrol agents to care for migrants.""
CBP officers will help the Border Patrol with processing, transportation and hospital watch duties involving detained migrants, McAleenan said.

""There will be impacts to traffic at the border,"" McAleenan said. ""There will be a slowdown in the processing of trade. There will be longer wait times in our pedestrian and passenger vehicle lanes.
""We know that we have Semana Santa, Holy Week, approaching, but this is required to help us manage this operational crisis,"" he added.
Holy Week is a popular vacation period in Mexico and a busy time for border travelers.

Number of Central American immigrants continues to rise in El Paso
El Paso leaders have accused federal authorities of not doing enough to assist and deal with problems in Central America pushing migrants in what they described as a ""humanitarian crisis.""  
The numbers of migrants from Central America and other countries has been rising since last year.
The arrival of migrants is straining immigrant shelters across the border in Juárez, Mexico, where the city opened a shelter inside a gym.

In a practice known as ""metering,"" CBP officers stand at the borderline at the middle of international bridges in El Paso and tell asylum seekers to wait because of a lack of space at CBP facilities.
Other migrants cross the Rio Grande often in groups of hundreds of men, women and children to surrender to El Paso Border Patrol agents on U.S. soil on the river levee next to the tall, metal border fence.
Border Patrol officials have said the agency is averaging about 570 migrant apprehensions a day in the El Paso Sector, mostly in the El Paso metro area.
More than 36,000 migrant families have arrived in the El Paso border region in fiscal year 2019 compared with about 2,000 at the same time last year, according to CBP data.
Statistics show that the number of unaccompanied children jumped from more than 1,300 last year to more than 5,000 this fiscal year. The federal fiscal year begins in October.
About 1,000 migrants were taken into custody in El Paso in one day on March 6 with large groups walking across the Rio Grande to turn themselves in.
The number of migrants is far fewer than decades ago, but the demographics have changed, Border Patrol officials said.
More than a decade ago, El Paso area Border Patrol agents were dealing with mostly adult Mexican males, which means detainees could be arrested, processed and returned to Mexico within hours, officials said.
In a development sparked by the surge in migrants, Border Patrol highway checkpoints in the El Paso Sector have been closed to shift agents to duties dealing with the influx.
Also, a new immigration processing center will be built in El Paso to help address the large number of migrants crossing the Southwest border, CBP officials said.

Migrant shelters strained
The large number of migrants also is straining the network of temporary migrant shelters at churches and charities in the El Paso-Las Cruces area.
Migrants stay in the El Paso area from one to three days before traveling to sponsors or relatives in other parts of the United States.
McAleenan said he met with El Paso Mayor Dee Margo. McAleenan said CBP will continue to work with the city and El Paso County, as well as nonprofit immigration shelters, such as Annunciation House.
El Paso immigrant advocates described 2018 as their ""busiest year ever"" but current trends could surpass last year. 
Immigration historically increases in the spring months of March, April and May as the weather gets warmer.

Nomaan Merchant,"HIDALGO, Texas (AP) As President Donald Trump travels to the border in Texas to make the case for his $5.7 billion wall, landowner Eloisa Cavazos says she knows firsthand how the project will play out if the White House gets its way.
The federal government has started surveying land along the border in Texas and announced plans to start construction next month. Rather than surrender their land, some property owners are digging in, vowing to reject buyout offers and preparing to fight the administration in court.
You could give me a trillion dollars and I wouldnt take it, said Cavazos, whose land sits along the Rio Grande, the river separating the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. Its not about money.
Trump is scheduled to visit the border Thursday in McAllen, a city of 143,000 on the river.
Congress in March funded 33 miles (53 kilometers) of walls and fencing in Texas. The government has laid out plans that would cut across private land in the Rio Grande Valley. Those in the way include landowners who have lived in the valley for generations, environmental groups and a 19th century chapel.
Many have hired lawyers who are preparing to fight the government if, as expected, it moves to seize their land through eminent domain.
The opposition will intensify if Democrats accede to the Trump administrations demand to build more than 215 new miles of wall, including 104 miles in the Rio Grande Valley and 55 miles near Laredo. Even a compromise solution to build steel slats, as Trump has suggested, or more fencing of the kind that Democrats have previously supported would likely trigger more court cases and pushback in Texas.
Legal experts say Trump likely cannot waive eminent domain which requires the government to demonstrate a public use for the land and provide landowners with compensation by declaring a national emergency.
While this is Trumps first visit to the border in Texas as president, his administrations immigration crackdown has been felt here for months.
Hundreds of the more than 2,400 children separated from their parents last summer were detained in cages at a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. Three tender-age facilities for the youngest children were opened in this region.
The president also ordered soldiers to the border in response to a wave of migrant caravans before the November election. Those troops had a heavy presence in the Rio Grande Valley, though they have since quietly left. A spokeswoman for the border security mission said they closed their base camp along the border on Dec. 22.
But Trumps border wall will last beyond his administration. Building in the region is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security because its the busiest area for illegal border crossings. More than 23,000 parents and children were caught illegally crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley in November more than triple the number from a year earlier.
Homeland Security officials argue that a wall would stop many crossings and deter Central American families from trying to migrate north. Many of those families are seeking asylum because of violence in their home countries and often turn themselves in to border agents when they arrive here.
The number of families has surged. DHS said Wednesday that it detained 27,518 adults and children traveling together on the southern border in December, a new monthly high.
With part of the $1.6 billion Congress approved in March, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced it would build 25 miles (40 kilometers) of wall along the flood-control levee in Hidalgo County, which runs well north of the Rio Grande.
Congress did not allow construction of any of Trumps wall prototypes. But the administrations plans call for a concrete wall to the height of the existing levee, with 18-foot (5.5 meters) steel posts on top. CBP wants to clear 150 feet (45 meters) in front of any new construction for an enforcement zone of access roads, cameras, and lighting.
The government sued the local Roman Catholic diocese late last year to gain access for its surveyors at the site of La Lomita chapel, which opened in 1865 and was an important site for missionaries who traveled the Rio Grande Valley by horseback.
It remains an epicenter of the Rio Grande Valleys Catholic community, hosting weddings and funerals, as well as an annual Palm Sunday procession that draws 2,000 people.
The chapel is a short distance from the Rio Grande. It falls directly into the area where CBP wants to build its enforcement zone.
The diocese said it opposes a border wall because the barrier violates Catholic teachings and the churchs responsibility to protect migrants, as well as the churchs First Amendment right of religious freedom. A legal group from Georgetown University has joined the diocese in its lawsuit.
Father Roy Snipes leads prayers each Friday for his chapel to be spared. Wearing a cowboy hat with his white robe and metal cross, hes known locally as the cowboy priest and sometimes takes a boat on the Rio Grande to go from his home to the chapel.
It would poison the water, Snipes said. It would still be a sacred place, but it would be a sacred place that was desecrated.
The Cavazos familys roughly 64 acres (0.25 square kilometers) were first purchased by their grandmother 60 years ago.
They rent some of the property to tenants who have built small houses or brought in trailers, charging some as little as $1,000 a year. They live off the earnings from the land and worry that a fence would deter renters and turn their property into a no mans land.
On the rest of the property are plywood barns, enclosures for cattle and goats, and a wooden deck that extends into the river, which flows serenely east toward the Gulf of Mexico. Eloisas brother, Fred, can sit on the deck in his wheelchair and fish with a rod fashioned from a long carrizo reed plucked from the riverbank.
Surveyors examined their property in December under federal court order. The family hasnt yet received an offer for their land, but their lawyers at the Texas Civil Rights Project expect a letter with an offer will arrive in the coming weeks.
Everybody tells us to sell and go to a better place, Eloisa Cavazos said. This is heaven to us.","HIDALGO, Texas (AP) — As President Donald Trump travels to the border in Texas to make the case for his $5.7 billion wall, landowner Eloisa Cavazos says she knows firsthand how the project will play out if the White House gets its way.

The Associated Press,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Rivers are expected to flood in eastern and central Montana in coming days, even as water levels fall in western portions of the state after hitting their highest mark in a century. The Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone near the small community of Edgar is expected to crest late Thursday at the highest level ever recorded, National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Tesar said. Records for the river about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Billings date to the 1920s. “It’s not a big community but there will be some areas impacted and maybe a few homes impacted,” Tesar said. A Billings man was swept to his death in a boating accident Monday afternoon on the swollen waters of the Smith River near Great Falls. In central Montana, the Musselshell River was above or approaching major flood stage. Flood warnings also were issued for the Big Hole River near Melrose and the Jefferson River near Three Forks. Driving the widespread flooding is a combination of rainfall and melting snow. Up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain were expected in southeastern Montana in coming days. Higher temperatures later in the week could accelerate the melting of a deep winter snowpack. The Clarks Fork is a different river than the Clark Fork River in Missoula, which crested earlier this month and has now started to recede. Missoula County search and rescue crews were scheduled to begin surveying damage to flooded homes on Tuesday. Crews shored up a levee near Missoula that was damaged by erosion, Jess Jordan of the Army Corps of Engineers said. The levee protects homes and various utilities, including pipelines and power lines. The situation no longer poses a hazard to the public although work will continue for the next week to further stabilize the levee, Jordan said. However, officials warned that high water along the Clark Fork continues and the danger of additional flooding is not over yet. ___ This story has been updated with the correct spelling of Brian Tesar’s last name in the second paragraph.","BILLINGS, Mont.

KOLNKGIN,"The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency confirms there has been one fatality in the floods in Platte County. 
The mayor of Columbus said the person was a farmer who was out on a tractor trying to rescue someone else when he was swept away by the floodwaters. 
A longtime family friend tells 10/11 NOW the farmer who died is James Wilke of rural Columbus.
In a Facebook post, family friend Jodi Hefti said, ""James got on his tractor like he has 100s if not 1,000s of times before and he headed down the road. This time would end differently though, he would never return home. With the guidance of emergency responders James drove his tractor over the Shell Creek bridge on the Monestary Road and the bridge gave out. James and the tractor went down into the flood water below. James body was recovered later in the afternoon along the creek bed close to their home. Those who know James know it was his way of telling his wife, family and friends goodbye and that he is home.I for one am a better person because I knew James .""

Agence France-Presse,"It is an unremarkable wall a stone’s throw from the White House, barely noticed by tourists and locals alike. Yet officials hope this updated but never-used levee system will protect downtown Washington from the wrath of Hurricane Florence. The barrier sits on the National Mall, the famous grassy stretch between the Lincoln Memorial and the US Capitol, and in the coming days it could be put to the test as the capital city braces for potentially catastrophic flooding. Three meters (ten feet) high in places, the stone wall seems to blend into the landscape just north of the Tidal Basin, the picturesque reservoir surrounded by monuments near the Potomac River. But its role is suddenly a hot topic as city leaders declared a state of emergency and waters on the swollen Potomac surged past flood stage this week following recent heavy rains. Washington, built on a swamp, is now bracing for what could be a devastating glancing blow from Florence, which is forecast to barrel ashore along the Carolina coast, some 300 miles (480 kilometers) south of the capital, delivering life-threatening winds and flooding. The Washington wall bisects 17th street, meaning there is normally a gap in the defenses. But the dam can be tightly sealed in a matter of hours, should a flood threat emerge. “The levee was completed in 2014. We’ve erected it four times since then” on annual training exercises, National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst told AFP. – Assembly within hours – The levee system has existed for several decades, but after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, Washington’s system was deemed insufficient, and the Army Corps of Engineers was charged with building a more permanent structure. While Litterst currently sees “no indication” of a need to use the levee system, which was designed to protect the White House and nearby neighborhoods and federal properties, authorities are at the ready. “With Florence coming in and her path still uncertain, and depending on how much rain we get given that the system is already saturated, we’ll continue to monitor” water levels, Litterst said. The equation is simple. If the water is measured to be 12 feet (3.6 meters) above normal gage level, an alert is triggered, and the large concrete slabs to plug the gap in the wall will be trucked in and installed. “It’s a three- to four-hour process,” Litterst said. At last survey, the Potomac’s water level was at five feet (1.5 meters) above normal, with a peak of nine feet reached on Tuesday. Flood stage is six feet above normal. Washington has become water-logged in recent days, with particularly soggy soil after heavy rains and little sun. While Florence does not have Washington in its direct sights, the spectacular forecast of up to 40 inches (one meter) of rain in some parts of the Carolinas could translate to dangerous rain levels for Washington — and put the city’s levee system to an unprecedented test.","It is an unremarkable wall a stone’s throw from the White House, barely noticed by tourists and locals alike.
