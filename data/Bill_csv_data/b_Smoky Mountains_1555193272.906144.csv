WLWT Digital Staff,"GATLINBURG, Tenn. — A Cincinnati woman who disappeared while hiking in Great Smoky Mountains National Park was found dead Tuesday afternoon, according to the park's public affairs office. They said Mitzie Sue ""Susan"" Clements, 53, was found by search crews two miles west of the Clingmans Dome parking area, where it was said she disappeared, and less than a mile south of the Appalachian Trail. She had been missing for a week. Clements' body was found off-trail late Tuesday afternoon, in a rugged, heavily wooded area of the Huggins Creek drainage, approximately two miles from Clingmans Dome parking area and three-fourths mile south of the Appalachian Trail. The cause of death is under investigation, however foul play is not suspected at this time. Our deepest condolences go out to the family, friends, and co-workers of Susan during this difficult time, said park superintendent Cassius Cash. We are grieving with the family and hope that yesterdays recovery helps provide some closure as they begin their own grieving process. I am inspired by, and extremely grateful for, the tireless work of our park staff, as well as the generous assistance provided by dozens of agencies and well-trained search and rescue organizations. The family of Susan Clements provided this statement to share with the public: I want to specifically thank the National Park Service for their incredible efforts. The cooperation shown between more than 50 agencies was amazing, comforting, and very supportive. Every piece of the operation, including the scientific fronts, logistical parts, and the emotional support provided to us was very impressive. The children, her sisters, and I want to especially thank Jared St. Clair (Chief Ranger), Joe Pond (Incident Commander), James Latendresse (Operations Chief), and Florie Takaki (Family Liaison) for their dedication and support. We also want to thank the countless other people who helped look for Susan. This includes the ground searchers, pilots, drone operators, dog trackers, technicians, EMS providers, the many teams of tactical climbers and rescuers, and the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The kids, her sisters, and I greatly appreciate the intense work they performed for us, and we will be eternally grateful. An estimated 175 personnel assisted in the complex search operation of some of the most rugged terrain found in the park. ""Our hearts are with the family and friends of Ms. Clements. The park would like to extend our appreciation to the many agencies and organizations that participated in the search effort,"" park officials said in a news release. Clements was hiking with her daughter on the Forney Ridge Trail, near Andrews Bald, when the two separated, officials said. The case was considered unusual because most searches are resolved in a day, national park officials said. Trained searchers and logistical support teams work in shifts to cover the rugged terrain, officials said. More than 30 state and local agencies are assisting the national park in this search. Clingmans Dome Road remains closed to allow staff time to remove the infrastructure brought in to help manage and support the search operation. The road and Clingmans Dome parking area are expected to reopen by Thursday morning. Search crews WLWT talked with were emotional and determined. They said they wanted to bring closure to Clements' family. ""Every day gets harder. You learn more about her. You see the family. You see how heartbroken the family is,"" Chelesi White said. Dense fog and heavy rain didn't help the search. ""Those first couple of days with a lot of rain, unfortunately, prevented us from finding many tracks, impeded the dogs and being about to pick up a scent and so having that rain right after someone went missing added certainly a layer of difficulty,"" said Julena Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld said Clements worked for the Metropolitan Sewer District. He said the city manager is staying in touch with Clements' family. Her family did not want to speak with WLWT in an interview but said she is a great mother to three children. They did provided a link for a GoFundMe to help pay for her funeral.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","All the trees cut and land lost due to surface mining in Central Appalachia. GIF: Courtesy of SkyTruth Coal has completely transformed the landscape in Central Appalachia. This region’s rich history of coal mining dates back to the 18th century. Surface mining, however, is a more “modern” form of extracting the dirty fuel source that requires clearing forests and sometimes blowing up mountains to reach the rich coal underneath. A new study out Wednesday in PLOS ONE maps how these mines have converted the region’s mountainous lush forests into desolate landscapes of destruction. From 1976 to 2015, strip mining and mountaintop removal contributed to wiping out about 1.5 million acres of forests across 74 counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. For reference, that’s three times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The study was authored by researchers from Duke University as well as SkyTruth and Appalachian Voices, environmental nonprofits that oppose surface mining. They conducted the study by looking at satellite images, identifying active mines by analyzing the normal amount of vegetation in the region and looking for areas where tree cover was low or nonexistent. Their algorithms excluded any regions that were not within a mine permit boundary and likely to be forested. They also removed any tiny parcels of land unlikely to be an actual mine. In addition to looking at land use change, they also found that current coal production could help predict the amount of land converted into active mining five years later by comparing the results with federal mine production data. For every metric ton of coal a company produces, roughly 129 square feet are mined. This is a dramatic increase compared to the less than 10 square feet required per every metric ton of coal that a 2013 study found. The expansion of the Hobet Mine in West Virginia from 1985 to 2015. GIF: Courtesy of SkyTruth Given the reliance on satellite images, however, there’s a chance some non-mines were included because the model couldn’t distinguish a general site with low vegetation from one that’s actually a mine. Cloud cover also meant they had to ditch some satellite imagery, adding another layer of uncertainty to the analysis. This new study sheds light on the ways surface mining has changed the landscape in an iconic part of the U.S., which now has valleys higher in elevation and mountain ridges that are broader and lower in elevation, per an analysis in 2013. This messes with the way plants grow and, well, the animals that rely on them, too. Mining also messes with people’s health, too. The region is now dealing with a recent uptick of black lung disease from mining. And then there’s that whole climate change thing. Coal isn’t the industry that it used to be with production and prices dropping across the board. That hasn’t stopped the industry from stripping land of its other natural resources, though, as this new study clearly shows. Every time a surface mine is excavated, that means ecosystems are cut apart, wildlife loses habitat, and water is threatened by pollution, per the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s why these two groups behind the study are against mining. Instead of creating new mines for this antiquated fuel source, they suggest putting coal miners to work reclaiming the abandoned mines. That’s one way to leave the destruction behind for good.","Coal has completely transformed the landscape in Central Appalachia.

"Kate Bernot on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Regional Mexican cuisine is, thankfully, beginning to break free of its overgeneralized reputation. A new set of ambitious, young chefs are calling attention to the regional variations within Mexican cooking, while the hard work of some pioneering U.S. restaurants are finally convincing diners that Mexican food isn’t synonymous with fast-food burritos or slushy margaritas. Chief among the regional cuisines lately getting their due is the food and drink of Oaxaca, one of the 30-plus states that make up the country of Mexico. Located in the southern portion of the country, Oaxaca boasts a varied topography that includes mountains, lowlands, coastal areas, and its largest metropolis, Oaxaca City. It’s impossible to talk about the flavors of Oaxaca without first talking about its range of geography and ethnic groups. To better understand the culture (and agriculture) behind Oaxacan cuisine, I turned to chef Hugo Ortega. Oretega was born in Mexico City and is the James Beard Foundation award-winning chef behind four Houston restaurants (Backstreet Cafe, Hugo’s, Caracol and Xochi) and is the author of two cookbooks. Though he was born in Mexico City, his grandmother lived in a 500-person village in the Oaxacan region of Mixteca while he was growing up, and Ortega vividly recalls trips to her candlelit home. He tells me that members of 16 of Mexico’s 21 ethnic groups live in Oaxaca and speak more than 200 dialects. Despite Spanish colonial presence, many pre-Hispanic cultural traditions have survived and mingled with outside influences. “It’s pristine, still,” Ortega tells me. “It’s so difficult to get there and that’s what’s helped maintain what it is today.” Despite some formidable mountains, the capital city is located in a rich equatorial valley perfect for many types of agriculture including corn, chocolate, and chili peppers. Even in the mountains, succulent wild mushrooms are plentiful, while the coastline provides excellent seafood and sea salt. “Oaxaca is the belly of Mexico,” Ortega says. “And as far as I’m concerned, it can be the belly of the world.” If the region is known for any dish, it’s mole. Oaxaca is dubbed the Land of Seven Moles, for seven regional variations on the dish, though most people outside the country are probably familiar with mole negro, the red chili-chocolate version that can contain a few dozen ingredients or more. “You put 20 cooks and you give them chilis, 20 cooks will cook mole differently,” Ortega says. “There’s no such thing as a standardized recipe.” Andres Padilla, culinary director for Rick Bayless’ Frontera Restaurants, describes mole as a hyper-regional dish that most home cooks prepare from their own blend of ingredients and spices. All of it starts, of course, with the red or green chili peppers that flourish in Oaxaca. From there, cooks can add aromatics such as onion and garlic, chili seeds, tomatillos, tomatoes, cacao, spices, and broth or water. “You’re making this really complex flavor that’s not of any one ingredient,” Padilla says. “It’s all the ingredients coming together which is like their indigenous cultures coming together with a lot of Spanish culture, too. You can think about it that way.” Behind mole, mezcal is likely Oaxaca’s most famous culinary export. It’s similar to tequila in that both are made from agave plants, but tequila is only made from one type: the agave tequilana weber plant. Mezcal can be made from dozens of types of agave, so in fact tequila is just one subset of mezcal. Tequila lacks mezcal’s smoky character because its agave is typically steamed rather than roasted in pits. Both spirits are protected by Denominación de Origen (DOC) regulations. As global demand for the spirit grows— AdWeek reports its sales volume doubled between 2012 and 2016—larger, commercial producers are muscling in on what has for centuries been a highly artisanal, individualized practice of mezcal-making. “As you go up in the mountains, they do it in a more organic, rustic way. It’s not commercial-side. People have 20 plants where they do 50 bottles of that particular mezcal and every little village does their own,” Ortega says. “Some companies have commercialized this. They buy the land, plant the agave they want to grow; but overall it’s still very untouched.” Besides claiming some of the best chili- and cacao-growing soil in the country, Oaxaca is also the birthplace of the crop most central to Mexican cuisine: corn. Ortega says Oaxacans cultivate around 200 types of heirloom corn, which can be ground into the masa that forms the base of much of the region’s cuisine. One of the best places to experience the flavors of heirloom corn is at the markets, where vendors, usually women, sell tlayuda. Tlayuda is heirloom corn pressed into a giant tortilla and baked on a clay comal or griddle until crispy, with a flavor like rich popcorn. You can buy them by the stack, but Padilla says they’re best eaten as a base for a snack of creamy black beans blended with the leaves of a wild avocado plant, which lend an anise-like flavor. Topped with queso oaxaca, fresh tomato and avocado, it’s about as good a breakfast as you can find, Padilla says. Also important to the markets are the meat vendors, especially in Oaxaca City’s Mercado Benito Juarez where an entire corridor of stalls fills with the aromas of smoke and cooking meats. The most common trio of offerings are Oaxacan chorizo (made with red chilis, vinegar, and spices); cecina, a super thin-cut pork that’s salted and marinated with a red chile adobo and grilled over a wood fire; and tasajo, accordion-cut, super thin beef that’s salted, cured overnight, and cooked over a fire. “Order your meat by the quarter-kilo and they’ll throw it on the grill for you with knob onions. Then go down to the end of the hall where the ladies make tortillas, and order a dozen. Other people have the fresh salsas and salads. You basically build yourself this little taco platter,” Padilla suggests. “That’s a must for anyone who goes to Oaxaca City.” Above all, he and Ortega stress the importance of this first-hand experience, of going to Oaxaca. They worry that the nuanced culture and food there gets lost in translation to America at times, and that the voices and traditions of the people who’ve made this style of food for generations aren’t being heard. “It worries me when it comes to commercialization, when we as cooks don’t do our homework and go learn firsthand,” says Ortega. “You get satisfied just to serve that something you have not spent your time with; I think that should not happen. Anyone can do Mexican food but it’s our job to study and appreciate what these wonderful people have done for us.”","Regional Mexican cuisine is, thankfully, beginning to break free of its overgeneralized reputation.

"Asheville Citizen Times, Karen Chávez, Asheville Citizen Times","Over 900 people descended on the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Gatlinburg, Tennessee to experience the synchronous fireflies
 Asheville Citizen Times
GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK Synchronous fireflies the hottest ticket outside the flashing lights of Broadway are about to get the party started.
The chance to see Photinus carolinus, a firefly species whose males display synchronous flashes to attract mates, is so hotly anticipated and so rare, that the National Park Service had to limit the hordes of humans and now holds a lottery for tickets to the show.
The lottery for vehicle passes will open at 9 a.m. April 26 and close at 8 p.m. April 29, said park spokeswoman Dana Soehn.
But exactly when the flashy bugs will strut their stuff is still a mystery, and one that park entomologist Becky Nichols has been hard at work to predict.
The tiny insects usually light up the night for about two weeks in late May or early June in the Elkmont area of the Smokies.
Synchronous fireflies light up the forest in Smoky Mountains National Park Jun. 7, 2018. 984 people from places as far as Alaska line a road at Elkmont Campground in Smoky Mountains National Park in Gatlinburg, Tennessee Thursday, June 7, 2018, to experience the synchronized flash patterns of the synchronous fireflies which peak during a two-week period in late May to mid-June. 1,800 parking permits were granted to some of the 22,000 people who entered the lottery. An estimated 800-1,000 people are expected at the campground each night.

Tricky business of predicting brilliance
The park used to announce the same dates to the public each year, but one year was particularly warm, and the fireflies emerged early, so many people missed out on the mesmerizing phenomenon where countless bugs light up the pitch-black forest.
Since 2013, Nichols said, the park has been using scientific data collection and analysis to predict the synchronicity.
Starting March 1, Nichols sets out two tiny devices in Elkmont called ibuttons, also known as temperature loggers. About the size of a watch battery, they log the temperature hourly.

One she attaches to a tree to log air temperature, and one she places slightly underground, to mimic where firefly larvae hang out.
Once we have the high and low temperatures up to the day before I have to make a prediction (April 22), I plug it into a formula called a degree day model, Nichols said.
Basically anything over 50 degrees, there will be some growth of the larval stage. The model allows us to predict, based on temperatures, how far along they are in that process in any particular year. So if its 80 degrees every day, they will grow faster. They will go through pupation phase and emerge much earlier than if it were colder.
Last year was tricky, she said, since March was colder than usual. The synchronous fireflies did not start their mating rituals until the second week in June. So far, March has been warm, with good moisture levels. Drought conditions can cause a decrease in firefly numbers, Nichols said.

The golden ticket
All lottery applicants will be notified May 10 if their application was successful and are awarded vehicle parking confirmation, or unsuccessful and were not awarded a parking spot.
Why are parking spots so important? Because thousands upon thousands more than 6,000 people last year will descend over the course of a week upon the Little River Trail, where there is usually an abundance of synchronous fireflies.
The only place to park is at the Sugarlands Visitor Center, where visitors will then ride trolleys (buses spruced up like trolleys) to the viewing area. The visitor center can accommodate only so many cars and vans at once, so shuttle service was introduced in 2006 to reduce traffic congestion while minimizing disturbance to the fireflies during the critical two-week mating period.

Last year 22,000 people entered the lottery and 1,800 passes were given out, which will be the same number awarded this year, Soehn said.
Entering the lottery is free, but lottery winners must pay a $25 reservation fee (up $5 from last year) to help with costs of awarding parking confirmation, viewing supplies, and nightly personnel to manage the crowds at Sugarlands Visitor Center and Elkmont, Soehn said.
The trolley rides from Sugarlands to Elkmont are $2 per person.

If youre lucky enough to snag one of the 220 campsites at Elkmont Campground, then you can avoid the traffic and simply walk to the Little River Trail. However, campsites can be reserved six months in advance on recreation.gov, and the site is showing that the campground is completely booked for late May and early June.
Synchronous fireflies are one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in the Smokies, Nichols said.
They are one of only a few species in the world known to synchronize their flash patterns. This insects' reproductive display occurs for a couple of weeks every year throughout its range in the Southern Appalachians.
Only the male fireflies flash as they fly between 2-6 feet above the forest floor, signaling to the female that they are the right species for mating, Nichols said. The female firefly does flash, but its very faint from where shes crawling on the ground. The females dont fly.

Its believed the period of darkness in the male flash pattern is to allow them to see the female flashes, Nichols said. It's a brilliant, yet brief life.
""The adult stage fireflies only live during the flashing period two-three weeks,"" she said. ""They do their flashing, they mate, the females lay eggs and then they die."" 
Visitors come from across the country and the world to see these flashing bugs.
Last year, Sloane Mouser, 8, came with her family from Louisville, Kentucky, just to see the fireflies.
It was so cool, the way they first lighted up, then poom, then poom, then poom! she said. It was like a humongous Christmas tree. My favorite part was when they lighted up together. Ive always liked fireflies but I like them even more now.

"Knoxville News Sentinel, Amy J. Vellucci, Knoxville News Sentinel","An inside look at part of the Foothills Parkway that is from Walland to Wears Valley and it is not open to the public yet.
 Kelly Kennedy, Knoxville News Sentinel
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, already the nation's most-visited national park, welcomed a record 11.4 million visitors in 2018.
The slight growth of about 0.7 percent over 2017 came from the November opening of the new section of the Foothills Parkway between Walland and Wears Valley, according to a news release from park officials.
Nearly 200,000 visitors experienced this new park opportunity in just about two months, resulting in record-setting visitation in November and December.
Tourists must have been missing the 'Missing Link' 
Last fall, pedestrians had the opportunity to trek along the 2-mile stretch between Walland and Wears Valley, experiencing the series of bridges that connect the 1.65-mile section known as the ""Missing Link"" before it opened to motorists and cyclists on Nov. 10.
The new section of the Foothills Parkway is a spectacular scenic driving destination and were pleased that so many people have already enjoyed it, said park Superintendent Cassius Cash. We hope that people take the time to explore it across the seasons.

Overall, park visitation remained relatively stable as compared to 2017 with the highest visitation numbers in July, followed by June and then October.
However, records for monthly visitation were set during June, September, November and December, according to park officials.
Visitors spent nearly 400,000 nights camping in the park, which was down 3 percent from 2017, but within the five-year average. The park offers nine front country campgrounds and 100 backcountry campsites for visitors.
In 2016, park visits were 11.3 million and, in 2015, 10.7 million.
Sen. Lamar Alexander's role in completion of 'one of the prettiest drives in America'
U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said the Foothills Parkway has been a priority for him since he was governor in the 1980s and the state Department of Transportation took the lead on a section of the parkway between Carrs Creek and Wears Valley. 
The parkway is considered ""one of the prettiest drives in America,"" Alexander pointed out in a news release from his office. ""The scene is so magnificent that it surprises even those of us who have grown up admiring the Smokies.""

As senator, he included $17.5 million for the parkway construction in the 2005 federal highway bill, according to the release. Since then, he worked with his colleagues in Congress to help provide the funding necessary to complete the missing link and open it to the public. In 2016, the Tennessee Department of Transportation submitted a grant application for federal funds to complete this 16-mile section of the Foothills Parkway.
According to his office, Alexander urged the department to approve the $10 million TIGER grant request, which it did on July 26, 2016. The state of Tennessee committed an additional $15 million in funding to complete the project. The National Park Service Federal Lands Transportation Program provided the remaining funding necessary to finish the 16 miles. Alexander attended the groundbreaking ceremony on Nov. 9.
A little national park history
The Smokies are named for the blue mist that hangs around the peaks and valleys, according to the park service. The Cherokee called them shaconage, (shah-con-ah-jey) or place of the blue smoke. 
The minimum number of acres was acquired to officially qualify for park development in 1936. Some 17 years after the initial idea, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was dedicated at Newfound Gap on the borders of Tennessee and North Carolina.
The acquisition of lands needed totaled over $12 million. ""By todays standards, the market value is immeasurable. However, the value then or today cant be compared to what has been created and preserved in the form of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"" according to the park's website. 
The park includes more than 1,500 species of plants, abundant wildlife including deer and bears, trout streams, 800 miles of hiking and horse trails, beautiful valleys such as Cades Cove and high peaks such as Mount LeConte.

Associated Press,"SEATTLE – Poor air quality will be common across parts of the Pacific Northwest this week as winds push smoke from surrounding wildfires into the region, forecasters and regulators said. Air quality alerts are in effect for much of Washington state through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Smoky, hazy conditions are making a return to the Puget Sound region because of wildfires in British Columbia and the Cascade Mountains, according to the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. Smoke could worsen into unhealthy levels by Monday, the agency said. An air quality alert is also in place across eastern Washington and north Idaho. Smoke from fires in British Columbia drifting into Washington and Idaho will cause unhealthy air levels through Tuesday, the weather service said. On Sunday afternoon, several monitors in north-central Washington state showed air quality at hazardous levels. Two women's college soccer matches scheduled at Gonzaga University in Spokane and Eastern Washington University in Cheney were canceled Sunday because of the poor air quality, university officials said. Air pollution can be a particular concern to sensitive groups such as the elderly, children and those with respiratory conditions. But high levels of pollution can affect everyone. Environmental regulators also issued a pollution advisory for southwest Washington, Portland and much of the Willamette Valley. The air quality level is expected to reach into unhealthy for sensitive groups. Conditions are expected to get worse Sunday night and last through Wednesday.

"Knoxville News Sentinel, Andrew Capps, Knoxville News Sentinel","The Chimney Tops trail was one of the most popular hikes in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park before the 2016 wildfires that left the peak inaccessible. Now, it offers visitors a chance to experience fall in the Smokies. Andrew Capps, USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee One of the rock pinnacles of the Chimney Tops is seen from the trail's new viewing area. (Photo: Andrew Capps) When the Chimney Tops 2 fire tore through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in November 2016, it forced a 10-month closure of one of the park's most popular hiking trails. The fire was first spotted near the summit of the Chimney Tops trail on Nov. 23, 2016, but over the next week it spread until it had engulfed some 2,400 buildings and had taken the lives of 14 people in Gatlinburg. In October, the trail reopened with a new viewing platform and shortened route, but the iconic pinnacles that had made the trail so popular with the parks thousands of annual visitors remained off-limits due to extensive burn damage that made the trail unsafe. Nearly a year later, the trail has re-emerged as one of the parks most popular attractions. Park spokesperson Jamie Sanders explained the trail remains popular among hikers despite the closure of the iconic pinnacle area. It was one of our iconic trails, and it still is, Sanders said. Only the upper portion of that trail was closed, and were still hopeful that one day well be able to open access to that back up, but its all going to be dependent on how the Chimney Tops themselves heal. The geologic area is still unstable up there, and so at this point in time its still too unstable for us to allow access up there. Breathtaking fall color The Smokies have long been known for their breathtaking displays of fall color, and the varied elevations throughout the park make for an extended viewing season, giving visitors plenty of opportunities to see a broad palette of autumn leaves. Elevation and temperature play a big role in determining when the colors will peak and where, Sanders said, but the next couple of months should offer visitors plenty of chances to see the autumn display. With our forest, at pretty much any given time between mid-September and early to mid-November, somewhere in the Smokies there are beautiful fall colors, and it just really depends on the elevation range and the location, she said. The color change is all weather based, so depending on how cold the temperatures are, and there will be certain areas that will just have a little bit of a better recipe for better color. Higher elevation trails like Andrews Bald near Newfound Gap or Charlies Bunion are good options for early fall, and Sanders recommended any of the parks mid-elevation waterfall trails, like Rainbow Falls, for prime colors during October. Last Slide Next Slide Chimney Tops and more The Chimney Tops trail is between 3,300 and 4,800 feet in elevation, which makes late October the ideal time to enjoy the changing colors of the trails leaves. The trails new viewing platform faces the east, giving hikers a view of the now-inaccessible pinnacles and the surrounding ridge lines, which, thanks to their higher elevations, could see their leaves turn color as early as mid-October depending on the weather. The Chimney Tops trail runs close to 3.8 miles total, but its short length belies a genuine challenge as hikers face hundreds of stairs en route to the new viewing point. While the first mile of the trail climbs a reasonable 500 or so feet in elevation, the last 0.8 miles to the summit sees an elevation gain of close to 800 feet before reaching the turnaround point. The trails frequent crossings of Road Prong Creek, abundant shade and swift climb into cooler elevations keep the hike breezy and comfortable, even as the steep stairs test your endurance. The high in Knoxville was 91 degrees when I went in early September, but the water at the trailhead and the wind on the ridge had me wishing for a jacket at times. In addition to its role in making the hike bearable even in hot weather, Road Prong Creek also offers hikers a handful of beautiful bridge crossings and dozens of chances to watch the water pour over rocks and logs and rush around boulders. The sound of the water follows hikers well into the journey, though it is occasionally interrupted by the sound of a nearby motorcycle during warmer weather. While the new viewing point does offer a sweeping panorama of the valley to the east and the nearby peaks, it falls short of the breathtaking scene that makes the Chimney Tops one of the most popular trails in the park. The new viewing area is far more accessible than the steep, rocky structures that hikers would almost universally scale to reach the previous peak, but its a small consolation for losing one of the best views in the Smokies. Still, Sanders said, the trail remains one of the most popular trails in the park. The trail itself is absolutely incredible, without even getting to the Chimneys, and now with the observation platform there you can still get an incredible vista looking over to the Bullhead and Sugarland Mountain area, she said. Its still an incredible vista so Im sure its still getting a lot of visitation.

Kaitlyn Schallhorn,"It happens every year for just a couple of weeks. Deep in the Congaree National Park, as the sun disappears, the sky will light up as hundreds -- if not thousands -- of male fireflies flash in sync. The phenomenon, which typically occurs for about two weeks in the South Carolina national park in mid-May or early-June, is a mating ritual for male fireflies competing for the attention of females before their short lives come to an end, Jon Manchester, a park ranger at Congaree National Park, told Fox News. As the male fireflies, which remain close to the ground, light up together with their flash patterns, the national park looks like “a big Christmas tree with a ton of blinking lights out there on the forest floor,” Manchester said. It’s more difficult to see the females during this time, Manchester said, as they tend to remain up in the canopy of the trees. Every so often, those watching the fireflies might see one start to travel up toward the trees. That means he’s been selected and “summoned” by a female, Manchester explained. This great show marks the near end of the fireflies’ lives, Manchester said. Once the lightening bugs reproduce, they will soon die -- as they have “fulfilled their purpose.” “The beautiful animals do have a really short lifespan, and it serves a purpose to what they do,” Manchester said. Only specific species of fireflies engage in the synchronous ritual, such as the Photuris frontalis species that reside within the Congaree National Park and the Photinus carolinus fireflies near Elkmont, Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains. The fireflies in Elkmont, near Gatlinburg, are a part of one of the densest populations of synchronous fireflies, Dana Soehn, a 27-year veteran park ranger in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, told Fox News. The fireflies in her region are a little different. The females stay near to the ground, emitting faint flashes of light undetectable to humans, while the males hover several feet ahead. “What is synchronous is not the individual flashes themselves, but the period of flashing and period of darkness,” Soehn explained. “You have the males flying … that flash for five to eight seconds quickly. All at once, they stop, and it’s pitch black. That lasts another eight to 10 seconds. During that time is when the females are emitting their flash.” The darkness created by the synchronizing could help the males find the females easier, Soehn said. So many people hope to see the synchronous fireflies that the Great Smoky Mountains National Park require visitors to make a reservation through a lottery system. This year, she said about 21,000 people registered for the 1,800 passes (which admits six people per pass) available. The fireflies aren’t particularly active until it’s very dark, around 9:30 p.m., Soehn said. A trolley system can take about 1,000 visitors per night to see the unique display. “It’s a pretty magical night,” Soehn said. Soehn predicted the synchronous fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains will peak with their light show around June 7. Aside from these, there are about 18 other species of fireflies in the region, she said. Congaree National Park has designated a specific trail for those who hope to see the unique ritual. Onlookers can traverse the quarter mile trail lit with red lights to observe the occurrence. However, once in the designated area, the park will provide a blue filter for peoples’ flashlights so as not to disturb the fireflies. While less visited than the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, thousands of people headed to the Congaree National Park to observe the fireflies last weekend, Manchester said. Besides South Carolina and Tennessee, synchronous fireflies can also be spotted in the U.S. this summer in the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania.

CH Contributor,"We visit Oaxaca to discover the alchemy behind the brand and its gracious smoky flavor Gem & Bolt founders Adrin Adrina and Elliott Coon shared a childhood in a community of creators in the mountains of Virginia, where plant medicine was part of everyday customs. Long before their life in Mexico, they made damiana elixirs as a way to “share herbal knowledge through the celebratory door,” says Coon. Both artists and alchemists, the duo wanted to be at the crossroads of art, plants and celebration. They learned that there couldn’t be a better place to bring this vision to life than in mezcal country. “ Oaxaca embraces the connectivity between these realms,” she adds. “People across generations and walks of life come together to honor art and community, making their own booze for enjoyment and medicinal purposes as well as a wild proliferation of creativity throughout.” by Tansy Kaschak Upon arrival to the city they began to host gatherings with the intention of connecting with the community and reciprocally sharing culture, methods, artistry and spirit. At first, they did not make their own mezcal, but would buy from local producers and infuse the spirit with damiana to serve to houseguests. As the story evolved, and Gem & Bolt officially launched as a brand, they developed a mastery of the production process from beginning to end. In turn, their events — particularly the annual Day of the Dead festivities — became attractions for creatives from all over the world. Both Coon and Adrina highlight that with these bashes there is an opportunity to channel funds to various causes, including aiding infrastructure in small towns during the rebuild efforts after the two consecutive earthquakes in 2017. by Tansy Kaschak When visiting their agave fields and distillery, it’s fascinating to see how rooted in the ancient tradition the entire process is. To start, the espadin agave is pollinated by bats at night. It then takes about nine years to be harvest-ready, and every single drop of rain and ray of light it absorbs will impact the final product’s characteristics. When the time comes, a jimador, using a sharp coa de jima, will hand-harvest the massive plants, slashing all spikes off until the core looks like a piña, Spanish for pineapple or, in this case even more appropriate, like a gem. by Kristina Bakrevski The cut agaves are slow roasted in a rock-lined conical pit for 72 hours, which brings smokiness to the flavor. They are then crushed and fermented for seven days or more, depending on the climatic conditions. At this step water is added to the mixture, and its quality is extremely important to Gem & Bolt’s distinct taste. “The water in our well is soft, sweet, not heavy in minerals, and it makes the mezcal soft as well,” shares Vicente Reyes, head of production at Gem & Bolt. by Tansy Kaschak The distillation process occurs in two phases: first in a traditional copper still where it rests for two or three months; then in a second custom still made with a combination of stainless steel and copper, where damiana is added. The delicate herb is known for its aphrodisiac powers and is the perfect ingredient to achieve the balanced, round flavor that Gem & Bolt is known for—it seduces devotees across the globe. As Adrina makes clear, “W e want to rewrite the conversation around spirits and alcohol, the way people imbibe, the way people celebrate.

"Ruth Graham, Ruth Graham","Evangelist Billy Graham addresses the audience from the stage during the Billy Graham Library Dedication Service on May 31, 2007, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ruth Graham died in 2007 when I was about to embark on a daylong hike in the Great Smoky Mountains. Browsing a rack of newspapers on a coffee run before heading into the woods, I was jarred to see my own name in the headlines. Feeling uncharacteristically superstitious, I called my dad to let him know where I was going and what time I’d be back. I felt a similar shiver of affinity on Wednesday morning when I read that Ruth’s husband, the legendary 20 th -century evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham, had died at age 99. I’m not related to that Graham family, but they have hovered over my whole life in more ways than our not-uncommon last name suggests. I am the granddaughter of a theologically conservative Protestant pastor and a woman named Ruth Graham. My childhood bedroom overlooked the cupola of the Billy Graham Center, a large building that opened the year after I was born. When I was 18, I moved a half-mile across the tracks to that same campus, Wheaton College, Billy and Ruth Graham’s alma mater. And I’ve spent much of my career reporting on evangelical culture, where Graham is revered as a lion of the faith. Being Ruth Graham has nudged me to periodically re-evaluate the evangelical world I was raised in. At times, my shadow identity has generated some funny mix-ups. Just a few weeks ago, a publicist helping me set up a time-sensitive interview with a different prominent evangelical accidentally sent the interview details to Graham’s daughter—yet another Ruth Graham—leading to a minor comedy of errors. In college, a woman emailed me at my wheaton.edu address to thank me for my ministry during a particular crusade decades earlier. On a campus where Graham’s name loomed so large, I fielded questions at least weekly about whether Billy was my grandfather. This was the evangelical equivalent of being constantly mistaken for the granddaughter of the pope. Since then, my name has broken the ice during countless interviews, and been the subject of biting and bemused comments online about my work. Though I’ve never misrepresented myself, I have to suspect the name has at least gotten my emails opened by church secretaries and Christian PR reps. After all, what if ? But being Ruth Graham has meant more to me than an occasional laugh or frisson of reflected glory. It has nudged me to periodically re-evaluate the evangelical world I was raised in, and which Billy Graham presided over unofficially for decades. Having to clarify that I’m not biologically related to Graham means I’ve had to do a lot of thinking about whether I might be spiritually related to him anyway. These days I no longer consider myself an evangelical. I’m not an “ex-evangelical,” I just don’t believe it anymore—no drama! But as far as I’ve drifted from the fold, I have to admit that I still reflexively view Graham’s style of Christianity as the one against others are measured. He emphasized a personal relationship with Jesus, a literal Heaven and Hell, and other basic tenets of theologically conservative Christianity. For as much as his legacy in the secular world rests of his political influence, the theme he returned to over and over was the saving grace of a loving God. I winced, then, as I scrolled through the dismissive burns proliferating online after Graham’s family announced his death this week: The big news today is that Billy Graham was still alive this whole time. Anyway, have fun in hell, bitch. — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) February 21, 2018 Billy Graham is dead and in hell with Scalia — Alice in Blockchains (@jephjacques) February 21, 2018 It’s not that I could blame them, exactly. I can’t defend Graham’s tone-deaf forays into LGBTQ issues, though he wasn’t nearly as concerned with the issue as many of his peers. He was arguably ahead of most white pastors on the racial conflicts of the 1950s and 1960s, but certainly no crusader. He was caught on tape denigrating Jews in the Oval Office during the Nixon administration. Ninety-nine years on Earth provides a lot of time for growth and self-reflection, and Graham eventually apologized for these moral errors. But he never flipped around and became an activist with sustained attention to social justice. No one is obligated to forgive him. That said, many of his critics this week seem to be conflating him with the generation of politically aggressive conservative Christian leaders who rose in the late 1970s and ’80s, including Jerry Falwell and, later, Falwell’s and Graham’s sons. It was a problem he anticipated. “It would be unfortunate if people got the impression that all evangelists belong to that group,” he told Parade magazine in 1981. “I don’t wish to be identified with them. I’m for morality. But morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice.” He supported contraception as early as the 1950s, and after Roe v. Wade, he convened a meeting to “determine a proper Biblical response to abortion-on-demand”— meaning abortion for any reason rather than just due to, say, rape or incest—suggesting a relatively nuanced approach. He preached to American evangelicals about global poverty and advocated for an expansion of foreign aid in the 1950s. He visited South Africa in 1973 under the condition that his gatherings be fully integrated. He said in 1997 that “ we’re closer to Islam than we really think we are.” And he didn’t promise wealth or health in return for piety or donations. A low bar, perhaps, but his cultural stature outlived the sleazy televangelists and GOP minions who competed for the attention of the faithful in his era. Outlived until now, that is. When President Obama tweeted his respects on Wednesday, his mentions lit up with rebukes for honoring a “monster” like Graham. Decency, respectability, civility—lately it feels like these qualities are sometimes read as code words for a failure to speak truth to power. Indeed, it’s tempting to daydream about what theologically conservative Christianity might look like in 2018 if Graham had been just slightly more willing to afflict the comfortable. Instead, he was a natural moderate who had the misfortune to die in a moment in which fence-sitting has fallen out of favor. Perhaps that’s for the best, at least for this moment in history. But I believe something will be lost if Graham is remembered warmly only by his fellow theological conservatives. Call it self-interest, but I hope his good name endures.","Ruth Graham died in 2007 when I was about to embark on a daylong hike in the Great Smoky Mountains.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"Ojai, about 90 miles northwest of Los Angeles, has long been a haven for nature lovers, spiritual seekers, artists, stressed-out urban exiles and Hollywood celebrities, all of whom felt protected by the pleasant valley surroundings and pure air. But for the last few days, Ojai has been at the center of the largest of several wildfires ravaging Southern California. The Thomas Fire, which has resulted in at least one death, has chewed through more than 140,000 acres in Ventura County, fanned by unpredictable winds that have battered coastal areas and inland communities like Ojai. Firefighters have been straining to contain blazes that have surrounded this town of 7,600. It has destroyed an unknown number of structures, including some of the multimillion-dollar homes in Upper Ojai. At night, fires in the distance have glowed like jack-o’-lanterns in the hills. By day, they have been barely visible from downtown Ojai, which has been enveloped in smoke. Few of the art galleries and spas that line the downtown streets have been open. Drivers turn their headlights on in the daytime. Ash has coated the pavement and cars like snowflakes. “If it weren’t so smoky, it’d be like a snowy day in New York, nice and gray,” Mr. Niglio said. Photo Rene Munoz, Lupe Borjas and Ramon Herrejon, from left, hand out free N95 masks and water in Ojai. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times People began to venture out on Friday as the smoke cleared slightly. They streamed into the post office, a few open restaurants and supermarkets, donning masks. Bart’s Books, where shelves lining the exterior of the store have titles like “Conversations with God” and “Where Do Bastards Go to Die,” was closed. But you could still pick up a book and throw coins in a slot in the door for the amount marked on the book. “To see my most beloved place on the planet broken like this is heartbreaking,” said Robert Lamarche, who makes “wearable art masks” and hand-sews Renaissance-period costumes. Mr. Lamarche, a Canadian artist with a Santa Claus beard, settled here 20 years ago and said he was received with “open hearts and arms” by gallery owners. His house in the mountains was not damaged but the power was still out. Just five minutes down the road, gutted homes and cars looked like something out of a “Terminator” movie. Mr. Lamarche and others knew that even if their homes were standing, they were savoring a false sense of security, because the Santa Ana winds were expected to intensify on Sunday and could bring more havoc to the heart of Ojai. “These are the worst fires I’ve ever seen in December,” said Jake Portillo, captain of a team of firefighters from Corona, in Riverside County, which had come to the aid of local crews. He said his team had battled blazes where entire blocks of homes had been decimated. Ojai’s name is derived from the word “nest” in the language of the Chumash people who originally settled here. It flourished in the early 1920s as a destination for people with respiratory illnesses. Among those who sought its healing power was Jiddu Nityananda, an ailing young man from India. He arrived in 1922 with his brother, Jiddu Krishnamurti. Mr. Nityananda died of tuberculosis a few years later. But his brother, the anointed messiah of the spiritual organization called the Theosophical Society, remained in Ojai and transformed it into a mecca for New Age pilgrims. It is often said locally that Ojai was the setting for a scene in the 1937 Frank Capra movie adaptation of “Lost Horizon,” which depicted the fictional Shangri-La. Whether the shot was taken in Ojai is a matter for debate, but regardless, it has helped burnish the town’s reputation as a real-life Shangri-La. Photo Downtown Ojai was cloaked in smoke on Friday, though it was spared from the flames. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times According to more local lore, Ojai boasts the most spiritual centers and massage therapists per capita of anywhere in the world. Typical of the old-timers is Lori Farrar, manager of Bonnie Lu’s Country Café on East Ojai Avenue, the town’s main thoroughfare. A crystal pendant hangs on a chain around her neck. From her pocket, she produced five stones — including an amethyst and a ruby — “to give me good energy,” she said. As the haze subsided Friday, Bonnie Lu’s filled with evacuees who had returned to check out their homes. Among them were Judy and Steve Quilic, a retired teacher and aerospace executive who moved to Ojai 15 years ago from Los Angeles. The couple had spent one night in a livestock center at the local fairgrounds, where the temperature inside had dipped into the 40s, they said, before springing for a hotel up the coast. Also returning to town was Henrietta Purcell, a former model who once appeared on the cover of a book by the photographer Helmut Newton. She has worked as a masseuse in Ojai for 20 years. “When I came into Ojai today, I was crying,” she said. “This town is in a haze right now.” She had returned to an ash-covered house. “I have to hose this off.” Continue reading the main story","Mary-John Hart, left, picked up groceries at Rainbow Bridge, an organic store in Ojai, Calif., that remained open despite the heavy smoke and threat of the Thomas Fire on Friday.",2017-12-09T15:36:22Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Ojai, Calif., Ringed by Flames, Is an Ash-Covered Shangri-La",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/california-fires-ojai.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/us/10ojai/09ojai_3-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Smoky Mountains,0

Mark Kaufman,"The consequences of America’s swelling wildfire problem are traveling well beyond blackened, ashy forests. They're now tainting the air in cities and towns over vast regions of the western U.S. Since the mid-1980s, fine bits of air pollution that have been repeatedly linked to heart and lung diseases have diminished in a good portion of the United States — except in an expansive zone of the western part of the country. In this region, which extends north from Utah to Montana and west from Oregon to Wyoming, the most polluted days — when the air quality is at its most harmful — are getting even worse. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The culprit, say atmospheric scientists in a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study published Monday, is expanding wildfires, which are burning considerably more land than they were three decades ago. “It’s not just a rural thing anymore,” Anthony Wexler, director of the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center who took no part in the research, said of the bad air. The red area shows the zone in the U.S. where the worst days of particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5) are getting worse. Image: Image adapted from McClure C.D. and Jaffe D.A/PNAS Wexler, speaking from smoky Aspen, Colorado, near where blazes had recently charred the Rocky Mountains, noted these tiny particles — which at their largest are still 30 times thinner than a human hair — don’t just transform blue skies into unsightly hazes. “It’s also a killer,” said Wexler. A recent 10-year-long Environmental Protection Agency study observed some 6,000 people and found exposure to this particulate matter, known formally as PM 2.5 (for particulate matter less than 2.5 microns across), accelerated the build-up of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels, which leads to heart attacks, strokes, and even death. A size comparison of Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) pollution versus human hair and sand particles. Image: epa “Lots of people have been predicting that this [harmful air pollution] would be happening in the next decades — but we’re starting to see it now,” Dan Jaffe, a study coauthor and University of Washington atmospheric researcher, said in an interview. The worst polluted days, when this tiny pollution is at its highest, comes out to around seven extremely unhealthy days a year. “At high levels, it affects everybody,” said Jaffe, even people in fine health. “In short, it’s harder to breathe.” And wildfires aren’t expected to diminish anytime soon. They’re a result of a hotter climate, which parches the land and provides fires with more fuel. The recent return of large blazes to California’s wine country, for example, were largely stoked by hot temperatures, turning abundant vegetation to tinder. “We’re right in the middle of climate change,” Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab who had no involvement in the study, said in an interview. A wildfire burns in southern Colorado on June 28. Image: Uncredited/AP/REX/Shutterstock “There’s yet another record, and yet another record, and yet another record,” said Pfister, referring to the increased frequency of record-breaking heat as average temperatures continue to climb. “Climate change is definitely not getting better.” All three atmospheric scientists, however, pointed out that that climate change certainly isn’t the only culprit in increased wildfires over the last few decades. The U.S. government’s historic mismanagement of forests, specifically by not allowing fire-prone underbrush to burn away in typical fires, has given large fires more fuel to burn, and an upper hand. But higher temperatures are simply the elephant in the room. “It’s hotter than it used to be,” said Wexler. And this heat, unfortunately, helps drive a vicious cycle of more heat. As more forests burn, they don’t just release bounties of tiny bits of matter into the air; they also fill the atmosphere with more carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes “substantially to the global greenhouse effect,” according to the U.S. Forest Service. And more greenhouse gases mean more trapped heat in Earth’s atmosphere. “It’s a circle,” said Pfister. A plane dumping fire retardant near Idaho's 2016 Pioneer Fire. Image: U.s. Forest Service/Kari Greer As the planet continues its accelerated warming trend, this means government air quality warnings in communities long distances from burning forests will likely become more frequent, she said. “Take it seriously. Stay indoors,” said Pfister. “Sometimes it’s pretty healthy to be a couch potato."" Bad air may make for a grimmer future, but there is the ever-conspicuous solution: Slashing the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere – which requires the transformation of how nations generate electricity and fuel transportation. “We can do something about it by addressing climate change,” added Pfister. Though in the short term, the West will burn, like it is this summer. “It’s going to be a tough season,” said Pfister.","The consequences of America’s swelling wildfire problem are traveling well beyond blackened, ashy forests.

Nicoletta Richardson,"Yes, it might technically still be summer, but Starbuck's PSL announcement does not lie: fall is upon us. With autumn comes the thought of foliage—the crisp, vibrant swirl of colors that are short but sweet. And while we have a while longer before the hues actually shift, Smoky Mountains National Park is giving leaf peepers a head start to plan their fall adventures accordingly. The team just released their annual interactive foliage map, updated for 2018. The tool uses a complex algorithm that predicts a hyperlocal forecast of the precise moment when fall peak will occur, taking precipitation, temperatures as well as historical and observational trends into consideration. And this year, the Smoky Mountains crew decided to create a secondary interactive graphic that focuses on regional and state data related to temperature variations. This was created based off of feedback from former fall foliage map users, mentioning that they wanted to understand the data-driven process more. ""The temperature data supplied by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is one of the most important factors and now leaf map users can easily visualize the impact of regional precipitation on peak fall dates,"" says co-founder of SmokeyMountains.com Wes Melton. When comparing this year's map to one in 2017, it looks like the temperatures will remain higher and peaking will occur later on in the fall season. However, while the predictions are as accurate as possible, unexpected rainfall might change the foliage outcome. ""Although simply entering rainfall, temperature data, elevations, and other data points into a model will never be 100% accurate, this combined with our proprietary, historical data drives our model to become more accurate each year,"" says Melton. ""However, unexpected rainfall that falls well outside of expected trends can always change the peak foliage dates and brilliance."" Curious about your own region's foliage?

"Katia Hetter, CNN","Katia Hetter, CNN • Updated 21st April 2018 (CNN) — Yosemite National Park has almost everything a nature lover could desire in an outdoor destination : Glorious waterfalls, spectacular meadows and valleys, groves of ancient sequoias and the wildlife that call the park home. Of course, Half Dome looms large for visitors. Each year, thousands of seasoned hikers make it to the summit 8,800 feet above sea level, climbing the last 400 feet on metal cables installed to allow hikers to reach the peak without rock climbing gear. The round trip takes most hikers 10 to 12 hours and permits are required. But as seasonal ranger Kirsten Randolph can attest, the park offers many stunning settings beyond this granite dome. Yosemite National Park exists because President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill creating the Yosemite Land Grant on June 30, 1864. The legislation, which included Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, marks the first time the federal government had set aside a piece of land purely for preservation. That act is generally believed to mark the worldwide birth of the national parks idea. Yosemite National Park was officially created in 1890, although the Valley and Mariposa Grove were still managed by the state of California at that time. These two areas were ceded to the federal government in 1906, creating the park much as it exists today. Park stats : Yosemite National Park is the third most visited national park in the countr y with 3.8 million visitors last year (behind Great Smoky Mountains and Grand Canyon national parks). The park encompasses nearly 1,200 square miles. The location: The Sierra Nevada mountain range in eastern California. If you go: The park entrance fee is $20 per private car, van, pickup or RV. The fee is $10 a person if arriving on foot, horseback, bicycle, motorcycle or noncommercial bus. Visitors 15 and younger can enter for free. Campground fees vary and reservations for campgrounds that require them go fast and are strongly recommended. Meet our ranger: Park ranger Randolph didn't grow up watching television or playing video games. Instead, Randolph played outside with her sister and family in Spokane, Washington, visiting Olympic National Park and other national parks for their vacations. ""I thought how neat it would be to live and work in a national park someday,"" said Randolph, 26. ""The rangers at all the parks seemed to be pretty cool."" She started at Yosemite as an intern, working on young visitor programming. After interning and volunteering for a full year, she got hired as a seasonal park ranger. She doesn't see herself leaving anytime soon. ""Yosemite provides a unique opportunity to enjoy nature and wildlife and have interaction with visitors,"" she says. ""I love witnessing how a first-time visitor connects with this place."" For a day trip, don't miss: Cook's Meadow. You can take the one-mile Cook's Meadow Loop through the meadow. Then make make your way to the base of Yosemite Falls on the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail. Take a drive to see the iconic view at Glacier Point to see how large Yosemite is and catch an impressive view of Half Dome. During the summer, drive along Tioga Road, where the habitat is very different because you're so high in elevation. Head into one of the sequoia groves, such as Mariposa Grove or the less visited Tuolumne or Merced groves. Favorite less-traveled spot: Take the free park shuttle to stop 16 (at Happy Isles) and walk to a marshy meadow called the Fen. ""There's a little bit of a spring underneath that keeps it green all year round,"" says Randolph. ""It's possible to see wildlife all year around this green meadow near Glacier Point."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Cook's Meadow is where Randolph saw her first bear on the job and where she spotted a rare Virginia rail bird. Even though it's in the middle of everything, ""animals are still drawn to it around sunset or at night,"" she says. ""Our wildlife don't like to be out in the hot sun any more than we do."" Most magical moment in the park: No surprise that it's Cook's Meadow (again) for this ranger: Two months ago, that's where her fiance, a park law enforcement officer, proposed to her in the lush green grasses growing in spring. ""Yosemite Falls and Half Dome were in the background,"" she says. Favorite other park to visit: Pinnacles National Park (California). Set aside as a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, Pinnacles National Monument was elevated to become the nation's 59th national park (and California's ninth national park) on February 11, 2013. If you visit, you might see endangered California condors, as Randolph did when she and her fiance went camping there last fall. That's because the 27,000-acre park is home to 63 California condors and is one of four condor release sites in the country. What is your favorite national park or national park site and why?

Katia Hetter,"(CNN) — Yellowstone, Yosemite and the entire country of Switzerland would fit inside the United States ' largest national park, a 13.2 million-acre expanse in Alaska. And it would take about 2,400 of the smallest of the 60 headliner national parks to fill the biggest park's pristine, mountainous terrain. Elsewhere in Alaska, climbing North America's tallest peak takes trained mountaineers two to four weeks, round trip, while visitors to the world's hottest spot -- which is also North America's lowest and driest spot -- are advised to ""travel prepared to survive."" The world's longest contiguous cave system isn't yet completely explored, and it may never be. All these wonders are protected within 417 national park sites spanning more than 84 million acres, all overseen by the US National Park Service in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In honor of the National Park Service's centennial on August 25, 2016, CNN explored 10 record-setting spots, now protected because of legislation passed 100 years ago to preserve the nation's natural and cultural treasures for current and future generations. 1. Largest national park site Wrangell-St. Elias National Park &amp; Preserve, Alaska Yellowstone National Park, the world's first national park and a UNESCO World Heritage site, is enormous. But the 2.2 million-acre Yellowstone doesn't even come close to the nation's largest national park, the remote Wrangell-St. Elias National Park &amp; Preserve in Alaska. It would take six Yellowstones to fill Wrangell-St. Elias' 13.2 million acres. Wrangell-St. Elias is also home to the nation's largest glacial system, nine of the 16 highest US peaks, North America's largest piedmont glacier and longest tidewater glacier and the world's longest interior valley glacier. More than 25% of Wrangell-St. Elias is covered by glaciers, which could explain why this park 200 miles east of Anchorage hosted just 80,000 visitors in 2015. The best time to visit is summer. Snow often arrives in the park by late September, and the two state roads into the park are not regularly maintained during winter. 2. Smallest national park site Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas Hot Springs is the smallest of the 60 national parks in the country. The Arkansas park is so small -- just 5,550 acres -- that it could fit into Wrangell-St. Elias National Park nearly 2,400 times. It would also likely melt its Alaskan cousin: That's due to the park's 47 hot springs coming out of Hot Springs Mountain at 143° Fahrenheit (62° Celsius). It was first protected as a reservation in 1832 because of the popularity of its geothermal spring water for therapeutic bathing. Many businesses set up around Hot Springs to provide access to the waters, and the urban park protects the historic bathhouse structures as well as the waters. Visitors can soak in the traditional Buckstaff Baths (a park concessionaire) and the more modern Quapaw Baths &amp; Spa. Both are on Bathhouse Row, as is the park visitor center in the old Fordyce Bathhouse. 3. Longest cave system in the world Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky Called a ""grand, gloomy and peculiar place"" by early cave guide Stephen Bishop, a slave who eventually gained his freedom, the world's longest known cave system earns its name honestly. Located in the hill country of south-central Kentucky, Mammoth Cave National Park has more than 400 miles of explored and mapped caves, and more are being documented every year. Much of the early credit goes to enslaved and eventually free African-Americans, who explored and led tours through the caves throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Frozen Niagara is one of a few guided tours to welcome small children, the elderly and people who can only walk short distances, while others are more challenging. 4. Tallest monument in the United States Gateway Arch in St. Louis It's known more famously as the St. Louis Arch, but the 630-foot monument that anchors the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial is officially called the Gateway Arch. And yes, it's taller than the 555-foot-tall Washington Monument in the nation's capital. The Gateway Arch marks the role of St. Louis in the country's westward expansion in the 19th century. Although named for President Thomas Jefferson and his role in expanding the young country, the park is also a memorial to the enslaved man Dred Scott, who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom in the Old Courthouse. World renowned architect Eero Saarinen, who had collaborated with his architect father on several projects, entered the 1947 memorial competition independently and won. It was his first major success, but certainly not his last. A tram ride to the top of the arch's observation deck delivers a spectacular view of the city. 5. Deepest lake in the United States Crater Lake National Park, Oregon Stack up about three Gateway Arches and you've got the depth of the United States' deepest lake. For hundreds of thousands of years, volcanic eruptions here built up Mount Mazama. Nearly 8,000 years ago, an eruption removed so much material from the mountain's internal chamber that the mountain collapsed. The remaining caldera, now 1,943 feet deep, is the deepest lake in the United States and the ninth deepest in the world. The 1.1-mile hike descends 700 feet down to the lakeshore, which is the only spot where visitors can swim. It's chilly, though. The average summer surface temperature is just 55°F to 60°F (13°C to 16°C). If that's not cold enough, the average temperature below 300 feet deep is 38°F (3°C). 6. Tallest peak in North America Denali, Denali National Park &amp; Preserve, Alaska Climbing Denali is not for the faint of heart. At 20,310 feet high, the highest peak in North America dwarfs Mount Whitney at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks by 5,900 feet. It's not as strenuous as the hike to the world's highest peak, the 29,029-foot-high Mount Everest in Asia, but climbing Denali is no easy feat. Hiking for days in arctic conditions, carrying backpacks weighing up to 70 pounds while pulling heavily loaded sleds to summit this Alaskan peak for expeditions lasting up to four weeks are all par for the course. Once known as Mount McKinley, the official name of the highest peak in North America was restored in 2015 to Denali, the Native Athabascan name it held for thousands of years. Ohio-born President William McKinley never visited the mountain, which most Alaskans, native and non-native alike, have always called Denali. The summit often disappears behind clouds but is occasionally visible while driving along the 92-mile Denali Park Road, the only road in the park. 7. The lowest spot in North America Death Valley National Park, California The lowest point in North America -- 282 feet below sea level -- is also the hottest spot in the world. Death Valley National Park logged a record 134°F (57°C) in 1913, and the park hasn't cooled down much since then. High temperatures are expected to range from 100°F to over 120°F (49°C) in August, which is a normal summer for this long narrow valley walled in by mountain ranges. And there's no water to spare. The park is also the driest spot in North Ameica, with an average annual rainfall of less than 2 inches That's much less than what other deserts receive. Sometimes the park warns against summer hiking after 10 a.m. due to the heat. Even before the cutoff time, ""travel prepared to survive,"" warns the park. Lots of water and sunscreen are in order for visitors heading to Badwater Basin in the Furnace Creek area, where the park drops to 282 feet below sea level. Too extreme? Spring and winter are supposed to be nice. 8. The world's largest living tree (by volume) General Sherman, Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks, California Among the renowned groves of massive giant sequoias, one tree stands out. The largest tree in the world by volume (over 52,500 cubic feet), the General Sherman Tree is the main attraction in Sequoia National Park. Its circumference at the ground is a whopping 102.6 feet and the largest branch has a diameter of nearly 7 feet. The General Grant Tree, located about 30 miles away in Kings Canyon National Park, is the world's second largest tree by volume, measuring over 46,600 cubic feet. (The two national parks are managed together.) They're the largest, but not the tallest. That honor goes to the redwood trees. 9. Highest continuous paved US road Trail Ridge Road, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado Intrepid motorists are richly rewarded on Rocky Mountain National Park's Trail Ridge Road, the highest continuous paved road in the United States. Topping out at 12,183 feet, the byway snakes through fragile alpine tundra, giving visitors a chance to witness the unique ecosystem without the huffing and puffing of high-elevation hiking. Eleven miles of the 48-mile route traverse wide-open expanses above the treeline, where at 11,500 feet evergreen forests give way to 200 species of ground-hugging alpine plants. Yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, pika and summering elk go about their business as breathless tourists open their car doors at the Alpine Visitor Center, the highest visitor center in the park system, to blasts of cool air. Temperatures at the road's blustery summit are usually 20 to 30 degrees lower than they are at the road's bookends in Grand Lake and Estes Park. 10. Busiest national park Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina The half-million acre park, split fairly evenly between the states of North Carolina and Tennessee, is home to flora and fauna found in both the northern and southern states. Northern animals and vegetation can be found at the park's higher elevations, while their Southern brethren are represented at the lower elevations. Many hikers on the Appalachian Trail walk the border between the two states on the trail through the park. Some prefer to catch the view from Clingmans Dome at 6,643 feet or hike up one of the 16 mountains with peaks taller than 6,000 feet. At more than half a million acres, there's plenty of room to spread out. And if you're looking for something a little less discovered, there are still 412 other National Park Service sites to explore.

"Knoxville News Sentinel, Tyler Whetstone, Knoxville News Sentinel","The plight of one furloughed federal government worker's family recently got the attention of former NFL quarterback Ryan Leaf.
Taylor Futch, a Gatlinburg, Tennessee, mother of two, first made news with a pre-Christmas tweet about the hardships of the partial government shutdown. The tweet went viral, liked some 58,000 times.
“My husband is a Park Ranger in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and he had to sign his furlough papers,” it read. “We have a 4 yr (sic) old and a 4 month old, and we don't know when his next check will come. Mortgage is due, Christmas 2 days away. #ShutdownStories.”

In response, she received hundreds of tweets, a lot of thoughts and prayers, a couple packs of diapers in the mail and a few offers of money.
This included a check covering their January mortgage from Leaf, who saw her original tweet and reached out to her.
“You don’t know me, but my grandfather was a game warden in Montana and we spent our vacations going to our 2 (sic) national parks,” Leaf tweeted. “Anna, and my son McGyver &amp; I would love to help with your mortgage if you will allow. #MerryXmas.”

— Ryan D Leaf (@RyanDLeaf) December 24, 2018
Futch graciously accepted. Leaf, the No. 2 overall pick of the 1998 NFL draft who played only 25 career games in three seasons, wouldn’t take no for an answer..
The shutdown was triggered by President Donald Trump’s demands for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and Democrats' refusal to give him the money.
Wednesday, she said she wasn’t trying to ask for help, but wanted to tell their story and show how the shutdown was impacting families preparing for Christmas.
Her husband is a park ranger at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where he specializes as a wildlife biologist. She asked his name not be in the story to prevent him from receiving backlash from park officials. Park employees have been directed not to speak to the media during the shutdown, she said.
“I mean, he’s got a 401(k), but we shouldn’t have to go cash that out to pay our mortgage,” she said. “We are the people who are suffering because of this.
“Just open the damn government and fight about what you want to fight about later,” she said.

"Story by Emanuella Grinberg, CNN
Photographs by Lyric Lewin, CNN","Story by Emanuella Grinberg, CNN Photographs by Lyric Lewin, CNN • Published 23rd November 2017 (CNN) — For far too long barbecue, grits and cornbread have defined outsiders' perceptions of the American Southerner's diet. There will always be room at the table for these staples, but Southern food is both evolving and returning to its roots as it redefines its center. Chefs from the South are training abroad and returning stateside to bring their skills to bear on the region's rich agricultural resources. Transplants from across the US and around the world are blending culinary traditions. The farm-to-table movement has whetted appetites for seasonal dishes from crops that flourish in the South's humid subtropical climate. Chef Whitney Otawka prepares squash blossoms for a dish. To many Southern chefs, grandma's kitchen remains their guiding light as they navigate the evolving landscape. We spoke earlier this year to to four acclaimed chefs at the 2017 Atlanta Food and Wine Festival who are putting their own stamp on quintessential Southern fare. They invited us into the kitchen at the festival's annual women's-only dinner and shared their methods. Katie Button, executive chef and co-owner of Cúrate Tapas Bar and Nightbell, Asheville, North Carolina Katie Button gave up a prospective career in biomedical engineering so she could work her way up from a server in José Andrés' American restaurants to the kitchen of Ferran Adrià's world-renowned elBulli in Spain. She returned to the South eager to draw from its agricultural bounty for her first restaurant, Cúrate Tapas ( 13 Biltmore Ave, Asheville, NC 28801; +1 828-239-2946 ). Button starts each dish with a protein. Ideally, it's from a local purveyor near her base of operations in Asheville, a bustling hub in the Smoky Mountains where hippies flex their entrepreneurial muscles. For this dinner, she asked her friends at Heritage Farms Cheshire Pork what they had in surplus and she ended up with pork cheeks. To balance the pork's richness she took advantage of an abundance of two more local favorites in season: tomatoes and peanuts. Boiled peanuts are a treasured roadside snack in gas stations and bootleg food stands across the South if you can get past their wrinkled appearance. Button used boiled peanuts in place of almonds or hazelnuts to form the base of the classic Spanish-Catalan romesco sauce. Add pickled tomatoes to the romesco-braised pork cheeks and the peanut takes on a bold flavor, she says. ""When you taste the sauce on its own it's peanut-forward. But with the rest of dish it come together and the acidity from the tomatoes and the richness of pork bring out a new flavor,"" she adds. ""The romesco ends up the star even though it started with pork cheeks."" Annie Pettry, executive chef and owner of Decca, Louisville, Kentucky Southern dishes rarely appear on the menu at Decca ( 812 East Market St. Louisville, KY; +502 749 8128 ), Annie Pettry's French bistro in Louisville, Kentucky. So, when she gets the chance to celebrate Southern fare, she strives for its apex. Case in point: hush puppies with pimento cheese and hot pepper jelly. ""I just want to do a really good hush puppy by capturing its essence,"" she says. To Pettry, nailing the fried cornmeal fritter's essence means getting the perfect batter. She uses melted butter instead of cold chunks to ensure maximum fluffiness, adding it to medium ground cornmeal and bits of onion. ""A really good hush puppy has good corn flavor and pieces of onion or it's not going to hit the spot for me."" And, it has to be light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, a balance achieved by deep-frying it to just the right deep golden color. But let's face it, even the best hush puppy borders on bland depending on your palette. To spice things up, Pettry chose a family favorite: the cheese log covered in pepper jelly, and deconstructed it into pimento cheese and hot pepper jelly to complement the hush puppies. For the pimento cheese she didn't have time to roast red peppers from the garden and, like her mother would have, place them in plastic wrap to loosen the charred skin. She used her own recipe of fresh ingredients for the cheese and the pepper jelly to create what she calls a ""Southern powerhouse in one bite."" Rebecca Masson, chef and owner, Fluff Bake Bar, Houston, Texas Pastry chef Rebecca Masson says she wants all her cakes to taste like Grandma's, but ""on steroids."" Chef Rebecca Masson, center, and her assistant from Fluff Bake Bar work alongside Chef Whitney Otawka, left. Masson, the owner of Houston's Fluff Bake Bar ( 314 Gray St, Houston, TX 77002; +713 522 1900 ), takes a Texas-sized leap of faith to combine seemingly incongruous flavors. Like Button, she chooses a central ingredient and builds on it with seasonal elements. For this meal, she started with pound cake just like her grandmother used to make for Masson as a child growing up in Wyoming. For her version, Masson added pistachios to the mix, yielding an electric green sponge cake that makes the perfect canvas for a deliciously Instagrammable dessert. ""You can add almost any flavor to pound cake, it goes with so many things,"" she says. ""It helps to start with a familiar base and build on it."" She dressed up the cake with candied pistachios, fennel confit and caramelized white namelaka, a creamy Japanese chocolate sauce formed into lattice-like adornments. ""Everyone loves pound cake. I use it whenever I can,"" she says. ""It's almost like salad in its versatility."" Whitney Otawka, culinary director, Greyfield Inn, Cumberland Island, Georgia Toward the back of the kitchen, Whitney Otawka peeled white Georgia shrimp while her husband pressed mini hot dog buns on a grill for a Southern twist on a lobster roll. Otawka is the name and face of their partnership, having built her reputation on ""Top Chef"" Season 9 and stints in Hugh Acheson's restaurants. Now, she's culinary director of the historic Greyfield Inn ( 4 North 2nd St, Cumberland Island, GA 32034; +1 904-261-6408 ), a dreamy retreat tucked into dense oaks and pine forests on Georgia's Cumberland Island. On most mornings she wakes up and walks out to the inn's garden to see how their crops are faring. She sources most of her ingredients from the garden and the island, using seasonal produce and fresh catch to create meals that reflect the moment. To Otawka, eating locally and in season is a way of life. It gives you a sense of place, she says. Take, for example, the shrimp from coastal Georgia in her rolls. They feed and give birth in the marshes of Georgia's barrier islands, and the grass gives them a sweet taste. ""You don't have to manipulate as much when you have pure, fantastic ingredients,"" she says. ""If we learn to identify the things that grow well in our regions I think we can have a better impact on the way food is served.""","Chefs from across the South are training abroad and returning stateside, to serve up a delectible fusion of new and old traditions.",2017-11-23T10:33:51Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Chefs are blending culinary traditions across the South,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/southern-cuisine/index.html,https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170616141646-05-atlanta-food-wine-festival-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Smoky Mountains,0
David Kushner,"Everybody is searching for something. Paul Ashby’s search began with an unexpected phone call on July 8, 2017. It was a Saturday night in Townsend, Tennessee, a small town just outside Great Smoky Mountains National Park. An affable Army vet with gray hair, a goatee, and wire-frame glasses, Paul worked as a concierge at a rustic event space called the Barn. He was dressed in his usual top hat and coattails that night, greeting guests who were attending a wedding. Paul had lived in Townsend, off and on, since 1974. In 1990, he separated from his wife and moved with their 4-year-old son, Eric, into a mobile home, then a small hilltop house nearby. He turned the modest two-bedroom home into a hippie retreat, teaching himself to make artisan cheese and hanging a purple sign with his favorite quote by the front door (“There is no path to peace... The path IS peace”). He’d often take his son trekking through the nearby hills and rafting down the Little River. Paul had raised Eric mostly on his own, struggling to relate to his son’s fascination with computer games and anime. Eric would carry his laptop a quarter mile down the hill to a telephone pole in an attempt to speed up his internet. “He’d be sitting down there at 1 o’clock in the morning,” Paul recalls. Eric was grown now—31 years old—but still had that headstrong streak. He had recently developed a singular obsession: an epic treasure hunt in the Rocky Mountains devised by an enigmatic art mogul named Forrest Fenn. In 2016, Eric had moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to devote more time to the hunt, which involves deciphering the clues in a cryptic poem, and on June 28, 2017, he told friends he had solved Fenn’s puzzle and was going to retrieve the treasure. Paul didn’t know much about the treasure hunt, but he was happy to hear his son was out hiking and rafting as he had as a boy. That day, Eric posted on Facebook. “I hope today turns out to be the success I’ve hoped for,” he wrote. “Wish me luck.” Ten days later at the Barn, Paul received a call from an unknown number. “Mr. Ashby?” said a young woman on the other end of the line. “Yes?” Paul replied. “Your son is dead. He fell out of a raft and drowned.” Paul figured his son was up to some kind of joke. “Tell Eric now is not the time to be playing pranks,” Paul replied. “I’m in the middle of a wedding.” “No, Mr. Ashby, you don’t understand,” the woman said. “Eric is dead.” Then she hung up. Paul clutched his phone as the wedding party swirled around him in what felt like slow motion. He tried calling the number back but no one answered. When he dialed Eric’s phone, the call went straight to voicemail. Who was the unknown caller? Where was his son? And why would Eric risk his life for an eccentric old man’s game? Part of Forrest Fenn's art collection. Forrest Fenn doesn’t own a watch, a cell phone, or a GPS. “I am not ready for the 21st century,” he told me. When I visited him one sunny afternoon last April, he didn’t seem to be much like a man for the 20th century either. He’s 87, with wispy white hair and inquisitive eyes. His favored outfit is blue jeans, a belt with an ornate turquoise buckle, and Hush Puppies shoes. He lives on a couple acres of land in a sprawling home on the Santa Fe Trail. American Indian artifacts and Western curios line his walls: buffalo skulls, arrowheads, moccasins, and original paintings by the masters of the frontier. “Ralph Lauren came here and tried to buy that headdress,” Fenn said, pointing to one in a feathered row hanging in his study. As with most of Fenn’s stories, it’s hard to know what to believe. As he admits in his self-published memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, “one of my natural instincts is to embellish just a little.” Fenn grew up in Temple, Texas, and still carries the soft twang of the Lone Star State. Though his father was the headmaster of his grade school, he sometimes played hooky, hunting for arrowheads in nearby creek beds. “When the sun was out, the smell of freedom was more than I could resist,” he wrote in his memoir. He spent his summers working as a fishing guide in West Yellowstone, Montana, where his family had a cabin. After graduating from Temple High School in 1947 and marrying his high school sweetheart, Peggy Jean Proctor, he joined the Air Force. He flew hundreds of missions in Vietnam and was twice shot down, earning a Silver Star and Purple Heart. Fenn returned home on Christmas Eve, 1968, and retired from the Air Force two years later. He had been interested in American Indian artifacts since childhood, and he decided to make himself into an art and antiques dealer. In 1972, using the $12,000 annual stipend he received as retirement pay, Fenn moved his family to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and bought an adobe home, where he turned the ground floor into a gallery. Fenn made up for his lack of experience with a showman’s streak. Noticing that competing galleries took out small black-and-white ads in local newspapers, he spent $3,000 on a full-page color notice in Architectural Digest. His brash marketing methods worked, and wealthy collectors began visiting his gallery. “I’m a great schmoozer,” he told me. Before long he was among the top-selling art dealers in town, he claims, earning up to $1 million a year. He transformed his modest gallery into a lavish, two-acre homestead featuring three guest houses, a rapturous garden, and a pond containing two alligators named Elvis and Beowulf. Fenn says politicians and celebrities including former president Gerald Ford, Robert Redford, Cher, and Steve Martin made pilgrimages to Santa Fe to purchase his exotic goods and attend his legendary parties. Jackie Onassis once left behind a bottle of brandy, Fenn adds. He offered me a sip from what he claimed was the same 36-year-old bottle: “Shut your eyes and imagine you’re drinking it with her.” In 1988, at the age of 58, Fenn was given a diagnosis of kidney cancer. Two years earlier, his 81-year-old father, William, was told he had pancreatic cancer, Fenn says. After 18 months, William killed himself by taking 50 sleeping pills, according to his son. “I respected him for having the courage to go out on his own terms,” Fenn recalls. After being racked by chemotherapy and an unsuccessful surgery to remove the cancer, he says, he was given a 20 percent chance of surviving three years. As Fenn tells the tale, he decided to follow in his father’s footsteps—but with his own swashbuckling twist. He would fill a treasure chest with gold and jewels, he thought, and carry it to a special place in the Rockies. Then he would swallow a bottle of sleeping pills and die beside his riches. But first, he would write a poem containing clues to the treasure’s location. “Take the chest,” read an early draft of his poem, “but leave my bones.” The “problem” with the plan, Fenn says, is that he recovered. Over the next several months, then years, he slowly grew stronger, and in 1993 he was declared cancer-free. After being homebound by his disease for years, Fenn was overcome with a renewed appreciation for nature and an urgent sense of purpose. “We need to get off the couch, out of the game room, and away from our electronic gadgets,” he says. He now saw his hunt as a way to entice people into the wild. Late at night, alone in his artifact-­laden study, he tweaked and revised his poem. Finally, in 2010, long after he first hatched the idea, he was satisfied. He acquired a 10- by 10-inch bronze treasure chest and filled it with emeralds, rubies, diamonds, and gold coins he’d collected over the years at gun shows and auctions. He added two gold nuggets from Alaska, “as large as chicken eggs,” he says, as well as an old Navajo bracelet with 22 prehistoric turquoise disc beads inlaid in silver. One summer afternoon that year, Fenn drove into the Rockies—for how far and how long, he won’t say—with the chest and the treasure in the trunk of his sedan. He made two trips to his destination. First, he loaded the empty, approximately 20-pound bronze box into a backpack and lugged it into the mountains, breathing heavily. He stashed it in a spot dear to his heart. Then he returned with the gold and jewels and filled the chest. “I was entering into strange territory in my mind,” he recalls. He walked back to his car feeling giddy about what he’d done. “I said in a loud voice, ‘Forrest Fenn, did you really do that?’ ” he says. “No one was around, and I started laughing.” In the fall of 2010, Fenn commenced the treasure hunt with the publication of The Thrill of the Chase, which includes his completed poem. The 24 lines contain nine clues to the chest’s location, “in the mountains somewhere north of Santa Fe,” he says. Fenn originally printed just 1,000 copies of his memoir and stocked them at Collected Works, an indie bookstore in Santa Fe. In 2013, Hemispheres magazine ran a story on his treasure hunt. Soon after, the Today show aired a series on Fenn, and his slim, 150-page book became an overnight sensation. Thousands of buyers from as far as Italy and Ecuador flooded Collected Works’ website. (First prints of The Thrill of the Chase can now fetch more than $750 on Amazon.) Despite Fenn’s intent to lure people away from their devices, his hunt had all the ingredients—a cryptic puzzle, a tantalizing fortune, an intriguing mastermind—to go viral. News coverage followed, from national TV broadcasts and local newspapers throughout the Southwest. What started as one man’s quirky swan song became a real-life Ready Player One. Fenn achieved Wonka-like status among the self-described Searchers, the online community that cropped up around his legend. Lovers of riddles and outdoor exploration converged to form a dedicated network of blogs, message boards, websites, and Facebook pages devoted to the hunt. Toby Younis, a retired digital media executive who cohosts a Fenn fanatic YouTube show, A Gypsy’s Kiss, says the internet helps them “crowdsolve” the puzzle. Searchers espouse theories in Fenn forums and detail their quests in YouTube testimonials. Dozens of Searchers meet in Santa Fe each June for Fennboree, an annual fanfest. But despite the hive mind enthusiasm of the Searchers, others grapple with doubts about the truth of Fenn’s tale. They imagine an 80-year-old man—or even a young, healthy person—carrying a bronze chest across his back. What kind of terrain—steep, wooded, rocky—could he traverse without tripping over tree roots and stones? Though a handful of Fenn’s family and friends claim they saw him filling the chest, there’s no way to prove what was inside, let alone what it could be worth. And, barring its discovery, there is no way to prove that he actually hid it. Given the more than 100,000 square miles of mountains where the box could be located, it seems unlikely that even the most intrepid Searchers will find it anytime soon, if ever. Still, over the past eight years, the possibility that the bounty does exist has been enough to spur treasure hunters into the red canyons of the high desert and wild rivers of the Rockies. Fenn claims he receives more than 100 “treasure emails” from eager seekers every day. He told me that 350,000 people have looked for the treasure, an estimate he bases on his always-full inbox. For devout Fennheads, the appeal isn’t just the money, it’s “matching wits with Forrest,” says 64-year-old Cynthia Meachum, who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Since retiring from her job as a semiconductor engineer in 2015, she’s devoted her life to looking for Fenn’s treasure, first in a remote valley near Taos, New Mexico, and now near Yellowstone National Park. The hunt tends to attract people with technical backgrounds, Meachum says. “We’re probably the most egotistical group of treasure hunters, because we all think, ‘I use logic every day in my job. I use flowcharts. I use schematics. How hard can this be?’ ” she muses. “Well, none of us have found it.” Over the years, Fenn’s poem has inspired Talmudic interpretation. One Searcher on the website Fenn Clues posits that, based on the first line, “We are almost surely looking for a location that satisfies ‘alone.’ So, a Solitary Geyser or a Lone Indian Peak would fit the bill.” Other determinations are more arcane. A Searcher nicknamed the White Knight insists the “blaze” in the 13th line refers to a turtle-shaped tattoo on the chest of a character in Marvel’s illustrated version of the 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans. How that translates to the modern-day landscape is unclear. Since publishing his treasure riddle in 2010, Forrest Fenn has doled out about a dozen additional hints in interviews, books, and TV appearances. Though Fenn occasionally stokes the frenzy with interviews, he regards online sleuthing as unnecessary. “There is no reason for anyone to use the internet or social media when going to search for the treasure,” Fenn told me. “All they need is a map, a plan, good health, and a buddy to go along for safety reasons.” Perhaps inevitably, determined Searchers have disregarded his advice. In January 2016, Randy Bilyeu, a 54-year-old man from Broomfield, Colorado, disappeared with a raft while hunting for the treasure near Cochiti Lake in New Mexico. The news devastated the Searchers, who, for the first time, had lost one of their own. Bilyeu was embedded in the Fenn community: He was friendly with Dal Neitzel, who runs one of the most visited Fenn treasure websites, and he once met Fenn at a book signing in Santa Fe. Disturbed by the news, Fenn paid for a helicopter to carry a search party. Six months later, Bilyeu’s remains were found on the banks of the river. In June 2017, Jeff Murphy, an alleged Searcher from Batavia, Illinois, died of an apparent fall near the 7,000-foot Turkey Pen Peak in Yellowstone National Park. The same month, Paris Wallace, a pastor from Grand Junction, Colorado, died near the Rio Grande. The deaths have only garnered more publicity for the treasure hunt, spurring stories by Nightline, The New York Times, CBS News, and others. The Searchers aren’t the only ones at risk. Fenn and his family have found strangers digging in his backyard for the treasure, he says. One woman wandered up the driveway to pray. In April 2017, Fenn sought a restraining order against a 55-year-old Texan who showed up at his home taking photos. Despite all this, Fenn insists it would be wrong to halt the hunt. “If I called off the search, what would I say to the 350,000 people who have had wonderful experiences hiking in the mountains with no ill effects except but a few mosquito bites?” he says. “An average of 12 people die each year at the Grand Canyon. There is a risk in nearly everything we do.” Paul Ashby in the former bedroom of his son, Eric, at his home in Townsend, Tennessee. After graduating from high school, Eric Ashby started cooking in restaurant kitchens around Townsend, nursing dreams of becoming a professional chef. With a wave of dark hair, mischievous eyes, and a ready laugh, he made friends easily. He never had much money, according to Heather Britt, a friend of his, but he didn’t seem to care about material things. Then, in 2014, a motorcycle accident left Eric with a gangrenous leg. He told his dad that a doctor prescribed him oxycodone for the pain, and he got hooked. Though Eric fully recovered from the accident, “he couldn’t get away from the pills,” Paul recalls. Later, Eric took a swing at a plainclothes police officer who had pulled him over. He was convicted of assault and sentenced to seven years’ probation. Eric first heard about Fenn’s treasure hunt in early 2016. He immediately geeked out over the riddle. As a child, Eric had immersed himself in fantasy books and sci-fi shows like The X-Files, and Fenn’s puzzle had a similar allure. Tempted by the mystery and still struggling to overcome his oxy habit, in April 2016 Eric moved to Colorado Springs, where he had some friends. He knew he was violating his probation but thought that if he stayed in Townsend he’d end up back in jail anyway. The change of scenery was just what he needed. He kicked the pills, his friends say, and found a job as a server at Edelweiss, a kitschy German restaurant. He lived in his car for a while to save money and started dating Jamie Longworth, a local medical marijuana grower. By early 2017 Eric had become consumed by Fenn’s treasure hunt, talking about it incessantly. He often stayed up late after waiting tables, smoking weed and compiling clues on his laptop. He tracked possible locations for the treasure on maps, homing in on Royal Gorge Park an hour away. Often he’d call Longworth to tell her how close he was to decoding Fenn’s clues. Eric wasn’t driven by money, she says. He enjoyed the intellectual puzzle of it all. “He was one of the smartest guys I ever met,” Longworth recalls. “He would say his goal in life was to be fascinated by a blade of grass.” One day last spring, Eric met up with a group of friends and declared, “I know where Forrest Fenn’s treasure is,” says David Gambrell, who was there that day. According to Longworth, he believed the area where the “warm waters halt,” as the poem describes, was the Arkansas River. He connected another clue, “put in below the house of Brown,” to the home of a local physician, Dr. Brown, who had lived in the Gorge. And he deduced that the “blaze” Fenn cites referred to a fire that had happened nearby. When Eric described the precise location—nearly 60 miles southwest of Colorado Springs near Sunshine Falls, along the Arkansas River—Gambrell’s gut tightened. He urged Eric to take precautions. “Make sure somebody’s with you,” Gambrell told him. Eric replied that he’d already made a few trips to that area, but bad weather and high waters had prevented him from reaching his destination. When he told Longworth where he was headed, she urged him to reconsider. “I was completely convinced it was unsafe,” she recalls. “I didn’t want him going.” On June 28, Eric went anyway. Ten days later, Paul received the anonymous call while he was greeting wedding guests. When he couldn’t reach his son, he called the Fremont County sheriff’s office in Colorado Springs. They told him there had been a reported drowning, but no body had been found, so they couldn’t identify the victim. A few days later, he was contacted by detective Sterling Jenkins, a stocky, goateed officer who specialized in marijuana enforcement. Jenkins couldn’t find a missing person report for Eric Ashby. It wasn’t unheard of for people to vanish in the rivers and mountains around Colorado Springs, but it was unusual for the disappearance not to be reported. Paul later told Jenkins that he believed his son had been out searching for Fenn’s treasure, but the detective had never heard of the hunt. “I didn’t know if it was an accident,” Jenkins says. “I didn’t know if it was foul play. It could be a hoax.” The detective vowed to find out what had happened. Paul Ashby holds a copy of the contract drawn up by his son on the day he disappeared. The document stipulates that Eric will split the treasure among those hunting with him, should it be found. Word of Eric’s disappearance soon spread across Searcher blogs and message boards. But unlike Bilyeu, who had attended Fenn book events and was immersed in the Searcher community, Eric was unknown to other treasure hunters. Though he had spent hours poring over their theories and tips, Eric wasn’t an active participant in Searcher forums. He rarely shared his hunches online, and he often went treasure hunting alone. As details about Eric’s checkered past emerged, some in the close-knit Searcher network viewed Eric’s disappearance with skepticism. One faction pushed to distance the Fenn community from Eric’s case, arguing that his rumored drug use would cast the hunt in a negative light. Others questioned whether Eric was looking for Fenn’s treasure at all when he went missing. When I asked Neitzel about Eric’s case, he bristled and refused to answer. “Let’s move on,” he said gruffly. Eric, they seemed to say, wasn’t one of them. Without the aid of the Searchers, Eric’s friends and extended family dissected Fenn forums and Facebook pages for possible clues that might lead to him. “We called ourselves the Investigators,” recalls Britt, his friend from Townsend. Lisa Albritton, Eric’s half-sister on his mother’s side, led the family’s efforts from her home in Largo, Florida. Though she and Eric had grown up in different states, she in Florida and he in Tennessee, the siblings were in touch often. In truth, it didn’t take long to find out what had happened to Eric. Shortly after Paul received his mysterious phone call, Albritton went to Eric’s Facebook page and posted a query on the growing thread of comments from Eric’s concerned friends: “Does anybody know the names of the people my brother was with?” she wrote. “Please feel free to message me, add me, I don’t care I just need answers.” A friend of Eric’s in Colorado Springs quickly replied with a profile picture of a smiling, twentysomething woman with shoulder-length blond hair, dark eyebrows, and a fashionably shredded pink shirt, along with a name: Becca Nies. “Can somebody tell me what role she plays in this?” Albritton replied. Longworth offered an answer: “She was with him, as well as her boyfriend Jimi Booker, when he ‘drowned,’ ” she posted. She then provided a screenshot of a Facebook message that Nies, who had worked with Eric at Edelweiss, had sent her on Saturday, July 8, just hours after Paul got his mystery call, and 10 days after Eric had gone missing. Nies said that she was with Eric and three of her friends that day. “On wednesday june 28th,” Nies wrote, “we went on that treasure hunt. Eric drowned in the river unfortunately. Im sorry to tell you like this, you deserve to know.… Very sorry.” “If I called off the search, what would I say to the 350,000 people who have had wonderful experiences hiking in the mountains with no ill effects except but a few mosquito bites?” The note from Nies should have put an end to the sleuthing, but it only seemed to spark new clues and paths to investigate. “How does she know he drowned if he hasn’t been found?” one of Eric’s friends replied on the Facebook page. “Sounds like some bs to me,” offered another. The police weren’t giving any information, and Eric’s body had not been found. In that vacuum, and in the heated detective atmosphere of the treasure hunt, rumors flew: It was a fight that landed Eric in the water, a scheme to steal the treasure from Eric and leave him behind. The most vexing question remained: If four people had watched a man disappear underwater, why did they wait 10 days to tell anyone? That delay stoked its own conspiracies. “Something strange is going on it seems like with no one wanting to talk to anyone!!” one Investigator posted. “They really aren’t gonna like it when a bunch of people from Tennessee show up on their door step!!!” “Exactly!” Britt replied, “And that’s what it’s gonna take!” That July, Albritton launched a GoFundMe page hoping to raise money to drive to Colorado. Eric’s family continued to check in with Jenkins, but as far as Albritton could tell, the sheriff’s office was making little progress. She pleaded for help in finding her brother. To her surprise, she received $3,500 from a single donor: Forrest Fenn. Word about Eric’s disappearance had spread across Searcher blogs and message boards, eventually reaching the Wizard of Oz himself in Santa Fe. Albritton and a cousin made the drive from Florida to Colorado in four days. They arrived in Colorado Springs and checked in to a hotel. Days later, they went to Nies’ apartment. Eric’s red Mercury Cougar was still out front, where he left it the day he disappeared. Albritton cued up Facebook Live as she approached the car, video streaming—just in case anything happened. “We’re going in the car, and I’m just going to try to grab everything I can,” she narrated, her voice tense. In the back seat, Albritton found her brother’s backpack. Heart pounding, she grabbed it and sprinted back to their car. Back at their hotel, Albritton dumped out the contents of Eric’s bag: some moldy sandwiches, two cell phones, and a notebook. When she flipped the book open, she found a handwritten contract between Eric, Nies, and her friends agreeing to share whatever treasure they might find—51 percent for Eric and 49 percent to be split among the others. Albritton held the contract with a shaky hand. “Eric Ashby will be the executor of the selling and distribution (documented) of assets regarding said Quest,” the contract read. There was nothing treacherous in the document itself, but stoked by the hours she’d spent unspooling conspiracy theories among Investigators online, her mind reeled: Had there been a plot to kill her brother and steal the treasure? She reported what she had found to the Colorado Springs detectives. Alarmed, Paul flew to Colorado Springs to search for answers. He met with Jenkins, who took him out to the spot on the Arkansas River where Eric had last been seen. Jenkins told him that two photographers had been taking pictures of whitewater rafters that day and called 911 after witnessing a possible drowning. But there was no way of knowing if the person had been Eric—the victim was unidentified and no body had been found. The people who were with him had been questioned, but Jenkins had not yet reached any conclusions. Desperate and sleepless, Paul called his brother, an Army specialist, for advice. If no one else could find his son, then Paul wanted to search the rapids himself. “Can we go get him out of the river?” he asked. “Paul, don’t even bother,” his brother said, “If the river is ready, the river will give him back to you.” On the Arkansas River near Sunshine Falls—where Eric was last seen—the rapids are unpredictable. On July 28, a body was discovered by a Colorado Parks and Wildlife officer several miles down the Arkansas River. A Fremont County coroner later identified the victim as Eric Ashby. After several weeks of investigating—questioning Nies and her friends Jimi Booker and Anthony Mahone, as well as the two photographers who had witnessed the incident—Jenkins and his team pieced together what had happened that day in June. Eric had driven to Nies’ apartment, where the group drew up a handwritten contract. They set off toward the river in an old green Jaguar sedan, stopping along the way to buy a cheap, two-person raft. They wound along mountain roads to a parking lot near Royal Gorge Park, where a suspension bridge hovers nearly 1,000 feet above the Arkansas River. Eric led the group a few hundred yards through piñon pines to the edge of Sunshine Falls, a churning, boulder-strewn section of the river. As they watched rafts of tourists careen by, Booker told Jenkins, the current roared higher and faster than they had expected. Sunshine Falls is known for violent Class IV-V rapids, powerful enough to hurl rafters into the choppy water. Eric, who said he had been to the same spot on previous excursions, assured the others that it was still passable. “When he saw the river, he seemed OK with it,” Booker told me on Facebook Messenger, but “he said he had almost died on this hunt before.” (Nies and Mahone did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story.) Eric told them he believed the treasure was on the other side of the river. He planned to float across in the raft, retrieve the box, and bring it back. Despite his insistence that he had plenty of experience whitewater rafting, Eric had taken no helmet or life vest. He tied one end of a rope around his body and gave the other end to his companions on the river’s shore. “We weren’t prepared,” Booker told me later. “We had seen whole teams of rafters ride by with maybe six or seven people on large rafts, and they were still having a hard time riding the current with a professional guiding them.” “They’re absolutely negligent. A life was lost. People watched it happen.” Midway across the river, Eric’s flimsy raft started pitching uncontrollably in the froth, and he fell into the rapids. (Nies and Booker told the sheriff’s office he jumped out of the raft.) The rope slipped free from his waist as he was swept away in the fast-moving current. He attempted to make it to the other side but plunged underwater. When he hit the next set of rapids, known as the Sledgehammer, he went under again. This time he emerged facedown. He was carried away by the current. From their post a short way downstream, the photographers looked on in horror as the body floated by. They frantically called 911 for help. Booker claimed that he and his friends searched along the shore of the river for half an hour, but the water was too violent. They returned to their car and drove away without waiting for the police to arrive. One of the photographers later told the police that he was troubled by the witnesses’ behavior, given the circumstances. “He told me it appeared as though they were not concerned with the unknown male’s well-being and had not bothered to attempt to assist the individual when he was in the river,” deputy Jeffery Moore wrote in his report. Booker told me they took off because they knew the photographers had already called for help and felt there was nothing they could do. “I felt so powerless that it kills me inside,” he wrote me, “because my natural instinct would have been to jump in that water, but I know I wouldn’t have made it.” Nies told Jenkins that she knew Eric had left Tennessee while on probation and didn’t report his disappearance to the authorities because she didn’t want to get him in trouble with the law. She said she wasn’t sure whether Eric was dead or alive. But by not giving the sheriff’s office Eric’s name, no one—including his family and friends—had known what had happened to him. “They’re absolutely negligent,” Jenkins says. “A life was lost. People watched it happen.” On a rainy weekend in March, I attended an event for Eric at the Barn in Townsend, where Paul still works as a concierge. Paul had his son’s body cremated and brought back to the hills of Tennessee. Pictures of Eric hiking and cooking lined a table alongside a box bearing his cremains. Local country singers performed ballads on the small stage. Now Eric’s family wants to make sure such negligence doesn’t happen again. They’re working with Colorado and Tennessee legislators to pass Eric’s Law, a “duty to report” mandate that requires any witness who sees someone’s life in danger to notify 911. Paul hopes the law ensures that “no one walks away,” he says. He originally blamed Fenn for Eric’s death. “I wanted to see him hung out to dry,” he says. He’s since made his peace. Jenkins places responsibility on the Searchers. “As an adult,” he says, “if you make a decision to look for this treasure, you need to be prepared.” When I talked to Fenn, he had distanced himself from Eric’s death. “I told myself that he was on drugs and had nothing to do with the treasure,” Fenn says. He continues to encourage the treasure hunt. In a recent interview with a blog called Mysterious Writings, Fenn wrote that his “gut feeling is that someone will find it this summer.” In fact, he reveals, a Searcher recently came within 200 feet of it. “Someone told me exactly where they were,” he tells me, “and I knew they were close.” He declines to say more, wary of tipping off the Searcher. His prediction, of course, will likely only spur more Searchers to return to the wild. With each new death, the stakes of the search grow higher. Fenn continues to urge his followers to avoid putting themselves in life-threatening situations. (After all, he cautions, he was already 80 years old when he hid the treasure; there’s no need to assume feats of endurance.) This summer, thousands will take to the Rockies’ tributaries and trails, racing to glimpse the glint of a bronze chest in the wilderness. If it is discovered, many Searchers admit, it won’t just be the lost fortune they’ll miss—it will be the l",,,,,,,,,Smoky Mountains,0

Calls to close the countrys national parks are increasing amid reports that three people have died since the start of the government shutdown, reports the Washington Post. Among the dead is a 14-year-old girl who fell 700 feet down a canyon in Arizona. A man also died at Yosemite National Park on Christmas, and two days later a woman was killed by a falling tree at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although deaths and national parks are hardly uncommonan average of six die each week in the park system, according to a spokesmanthe series of deaths does shine a spotlight on the decision by the Trump administration to keep them open even as staffing has been kept to a bare minimum, if there is any at all.
The move to keep the parks open differentiates this shutdown from most in the past. In 1995 and 2013, for example, the parks were shut. And while the parks did stay open last year, that shutdown only lasted three days. Now the shutdown has entered its third week and many are saying its time to close the parks. Trash is piling up, sure, but many experts also say the safety of visitors is compromised with fewer staff members present. I think we all know that not having bathrooms is a nuisance. What I think people forget is, not having adequate sewage treatment can be dangerous, Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, said. When you bring people together, running these parks is like running a small city.
Ryan Zinke, who recently stepped down as the secretary of the Interior Department, says everyone needs to pitch in to keep the parks clean. But its clear many visitors are also not being the most thoughtful when it comes to visiting parks during the shutdown. At Joshua Tree and Yosemite, impacts from human waste is a concern, which includes people relieving themselves in public places, such as behind buildings [and] on roadsides, said Andrew Muñoz, a park service spokesperson.
Volunteers are teaming up with nonprofits and state governments across the country to try to keep parks safe and clean, but some are warning that these makeshift operations were not set up to last more than a few days. Trump said on Friday the shutdown could last months or even years. Even some who have long advocated to keep parks open say enough is enough. Its really an awful situation to be in, but our primary job is to protect park resources and the safety of the public, said Phil Francis, the chairman of the Coalition to Protect Americas National Parks. I hate it. I always advocated for keeping the parks open and finding a solution, but when youre unable to protect the park resources and protect the visitors, it changes how you have to look at it.

Evan Malachosky,"A spirit that shines from first glance to final drop In the world of spirits, the contents take precedence—if whatever is inside is merely no good (or, sadly, in an abundant of cases, horrid) then stellar packaging cannot save it. Same goes for beer or wine or any other consumable good. But, when that rare moment arises, the instance that something happens to both look and taste good, we cherish it dearly—and praise it so that it pushes the bar a bit higher for competitors. Sugarlands Distilling Company has done just that. Their newest release, Roaming Man Tennessee Straight Rye Whiskey, is a 122.8-proof, cask strength pleasure. From the reflective copper packaging—that envelops the box and highlights the bottle—to the thick wax cap that’s almost ceremonious to cut, the thought that went into each aspect of this whiskey is impressive. It is a product that clearly resonated with avid drinkers and collectors alike—their last run of stock (only just over 800 bottles) was sold out in 24 hours. But it wouldn’t sell if it were just well packaged. The whiskey is damn good, too. With unmissable notes of pepper and rye—and, subjectively, emulsified cherries—on the nose and heavy hits of cherrywood on the tongue, the three-year-old whiskey excels in its category. It has a serious warmth to it and a potency that’ll excite even the most seasoned whiskey drinkers. The excitement about this one isn’t limited to a novice audience, either. This particular batch won five gold medals in various exhibitions last year—including the Los Angeles International Spirits Competition and the New York World Wine and Spirits Competition to name a few.

Kraig Becker,"This stunning video of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park just might be the next-best thing to actually visiting the park in person. Stretching out across 400 square miles of rugged backcountry, RMNP is home to dozens of towering peaks, countless alpine meadows, and hundreds of miles of hiking trails. All of this makes it one of the most popular national parks in the United States, drawing millions of visitors on an annual basis. The video was created as part of the More Than Just Parks project, which is the brainchild of filmmakers Will and Jim Pattiz. The two brothers share a love for America’s national parks and have made it their mission to use their short films to introduce others to these iconic places too. Their ultimate goal is to help preserve and protect these wild space for future generations to enjoy. To do that, the filmmakers are hoping to create short films of all 59 of the parks in the U.S. system. So far, in addition to Rocky Mountain National Park, they have also documented Joshua Tree, Olympic, Zion, the Great Smoky Mountains, and half a dozen others. In took several years of planning and filming to produce the spectacular video above. The journey first began in the northwest corner of RMNP near a town called Estes Park. From there, the brothers spent the better part of two weeks backpacking and camping within the park itself, covering more than 200 miles of backcountry along the way. When it was all said and done, they captured more than 30,000 photos and videos, filling 3 terabytes of digital storage space in the process. When they returned home, those photos and videos were meticulously assembled to create this video, which captures Rocky Mountain National Park during all four seasons. In it you’ll find breathtaking timelapse shots of snowcapped peaks, lush forests, rushing streams, and tranquil alpine lakes. You’ll also catch a glimpse of some of the wildlife that resides within the park as well, including elk, big horn sheep, and marmots. If you’re in need of an escape to the Rocky Mountains today, this video will certainly provide your fix. Nothing can quite compete with actually being there of course, but with this short film, the Pattiz brothers have come close.","Experience Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park in all its glory with this beautiful video, which was shot at 8K resolution, giving viewers a stunning look at the alpine landscapes that are found there.",2017-11-25T16:15:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Digitaltrends.com'}",Rocky Mountain National Park looks simply stunning in this 8K video,https://www.digitaltrends.com/outdoors/rocky-mountain-national-park-8k/,https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/rocky-mtn-8k-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg,,Digitaltrends.com,Smoky Mountains,0

Erin Carson,"This is part of our Road Trip 2018 summer series "" Taking It to Extremes,"" which looks at what happens when people mix everyday tech with insane situations. The trunk of my rented Camaro looks too small to fit a 5-foot-tall saguaro cactus. It's a bit after 7 in the morning, and I'm at Saguaro National Park, outside Tucson, Arizona, where the temperature's already pushing 100 degrees. I'm surrounded by cacti ranging from a few inches high to more than 40 feet tall, and wondering how anyone manages to pull off a cactus theft. Because apparently, that's a thing. You'd need shovels and a truck and definitely something like a heavy tarp to keep the needles away from your puncturable skin. People do steal cacti, though. Saguaro cacti are particularly prized on the black market, where they can fetch anywhere from $500 to $2,000 a piece. Eight years ago, rangers came across a trailer parked along a road in the park and found eight saguaro cacti inside. The rangers arrested the would-be poachers and even got convictions. ""That led to a whole conversation about the fact that most people who'd steal cactus from the park wouldn't be so brazen or dumb,"" says Ray O'Neil, chief ranger of the park. The thing about national parks is that they belong to everyone — but that doesn't mean they're yours or mine to raid. Pick a park, and there's probably something the National Park Service is trying to keep people from stealing. In 2012, someone used power saws to chisel out four Native American petroglyphs, each about 3,500 years old, from Volcanic Tablelands in central California. Last year, thieves made off with ancient fossil footprints from Death Valley National Park. Then there's the case of John Laroche -- better known as the orchid thief from Susan Orlean's 1998 book of the same name -- who became obsessed with the extremely rare ghost orchid. He stole the orchid of his desire from Florida's Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve with the idea of cloning it and, you know, making money. For some reason, people feel compelled to grab something from our nation's parks and national monuments, whether it's prehistoric petrified wood, arrowheads, archaeological artifacts, wild ginseng roots or, as mentioned, cacti. The NPS tracks crime reports by categories, including one called Resource/ARPA violations, which is what cactus and fossil theft fall under. In 2017, the agency tallied 1,459 such violations, but that doesn't mean it's an accurate count. After all, who could know exactly how many ginseng plants there are in Great Smoky Mountains National Park? ""In the scheme of the 330 million people who visit our parks every year, taking arrowheads, redwood burls, ginseng and petrified wood is a small but serious problem,"" says NPS public affairs officer Jeffrey Olson. Small but serious can escalate, though. If you've never heard of the Fossil Cycad National Monument, that's because it no longer exists. Located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, the park had the largest deposit of a fossilized, fernlike plant called a Cycad. But so many people lifted the fossils that the park was decommissioned as a national monument in 1957. It's why national parks across the country have been devising ways to protect their unique resources. Here's a look at what Saguaro National Park, Petrified National Forest, Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Joshua Tree National Park are doing to keep their natural and historic treasures safe for new generations — and out of car trunks. Tag! A saguaro cactus, particularly for someone who didn't grow up around them, could hardly look more foreign. They've been known to reach nearly 80 feet tall, sprouting arms at unexpected angles that, in turn, sprout smaller arms and nubs. They grow slowly. An inch-and-a-half-tall cactus might be 10 years old — and reach its full 45-foot height when it's 200 years old. That means I could be standing in front of a plant that got its start when James Monroe was president of the US. Inserting a microchip into a saguaro cactus. Erin Carson/CNET The saguaro is also iconic — this is the cactus of Western lore. ""It's a prized landscape item, and they're expensive so it becomes a target for unscrupulous people,"" Kevin Dahl, senior program manager at the National Parks Conservation Association, tells me over the phone when I ask why someone would steal a cactus. Poachers who manage to dig up a saguaro stand to make a big chunk of change. The average black market value for a saguaro is $100 a foot, plus another $50 to $100 for each arm. A shady landscaping company could just dig up a cactus by some out-of-the-way roadside and pocket the money it would have paid a reputable nursery, Dahl says. I wonder who gave Arizona the right to be so beautiful. This is totally illegal, according to the Arizona Native Plant Protection Act. If you're caught breaking the law, you can end up with fines or jail time. But back to that trailer full of dug-up saguaros: It gave rangers the idea of tagging cacti the way you'd tag your pet. It costs about $7 to tag a cactus. I watch district ranger Jeff Martinelli show me how they do it. It starts with a thin, pill-shaped microchip that's barely a half inch long. No batteries needed. Martinelli loads the PIT Tag (Passive Integrated Transponder) in a large needle attached to a yellow gun, presses it into the side of the cactus and pulls the trigger. That pushes the tag into the flesh of the cactus. Each tag has a corresponding number that's kept in a database with GPS coordinates. When Martinelli waves a gray, paddlelike scanner over the cactus, it beeps. If a nursery were doing this, they'd know the cactus came from Saguaro National Park. ""If poachers know it's going to be difficult to sell them at nurseries because the nurseries are either calling us or have scanners of their own, it makes it more difficult for them to make money,"" he says. Saguaro cacti rise in value with the more nubs and branches they have. Erin Carson/CNET Sometimes rangers will find a hole in the ground and check it against Google Earth to see what used to be there. The tags are mainly a deterrent since it wouldn't be feasible to tag all the estimated 1.9 million saguaro cacti in the national park. (So many that I wonder what would happen if they ever became sentient and rose up against their human oppressors.) Rangers mainly go for the ones they know will appeal to poachers based on the cactus' location and physical attributes. They're hopeful some poachers won't want to run the risk of stealing a chipped cactus. Rock out Next up is a four-and-a-half-hour drive to the second stop on my tour of Parks People Steal From: Petrified Forest National Park, in northeastern Arizona. The national park is home to the world's largest collection of petrified wood, artifacts of an ancient forest buried beneath a river system approximately 225 million years ago, during the Triassic era. At the visitor's center, I meet with Bill Parker, chief of science and resource management, and museum curator Matt Smith. A side-by-side comparison of old photos with newer ones shows how things have -- and haven't -- changed inside Petrified Forest National Park. NPS/Petrified National Forest The park's been battling something of a PR problem. Stories about people picking the park clean were hurting its reputation. That got Parker wondering just how much of the fossilized wood — which looks like multicolored jewelry Mother Earth might wear -- had been carried off by light-fingered visitors. He knew that petrified wood occurs only in certain rock layers, which means it never would have been found across all of the national park's 230 square miles. Were some areas getting an undeserved rap? The only way to know for sure was to do some time traveling. ""How can we go back in time and see where there was wood?"" says Parker. ""The obvious choice was photography."" The first photos of the area were taken in 1880. Going through the park's archives, Parker and others were able to match locations and vantage points with old photos -- many of them taken by conservationist John Muir in 1905 and 1906, when he and his daughter lived nearby. The tree's rings are still visible in this fossilized log, once part of a prehistoric forest from the Triassic era. Erin Carson/CNET It turns out, the theft problem wasn't as bad as they'd thought. In his office, Parker shows me side-by-side photo comparisons— old black and white images and newer photos from roughly 2007, showing more or less the same arrangements of petrified logs. But that doesn't mean theft isn't a problem. Park caretakers often catch people in the act, sometimes tipped off by other park visitors. In 2015, the podcast, Criminal, interviewed Smith and park protection officer Melissa Holes about the issue. Holes described confronting a woman who had stuffed fossilized wood down her shirt. The park also knows that people are stealing because some guilty parties mail back the jewel-like fossils with apology letters. Some folks returned them simply because they felt bad. Others thought they'd been cursed and recounted the terrible things that had happened to them. Smith received one on jail stationery. ""Ultimately, they're from people trying to right a perceived wrong and are trying to do the right thing,"" Smith tells me. You need to connect an identity with the actual crime. The returned petrified wood (detailed in the book, "" Bad Luck, Hot Rocks "") are put in something called a conscience pile that's now squirreled away at the south end of the park. The wood ends up there because putting it back would compromise archaeological and geologic research. Jeanne Swarthout, board chair of Friends of Petrified Forest National Park, explains that when the rocks are removed from their original location, they become pretty useless. ""Without knowing where they came from, we can't put them in the context of the scientific study,"" she says. ""Whether you return them to us or not, we've lost that provenance and we'll never get that back. We lose a story."" Jewel tones I'm eager to see some petrified wood for myself, which means driving 20 miles through the Painted Desert and the Blue Mesa to the Crystal Forest, which all sound like destinations in video games. Not that I play video games. At the Painted Desert, a little boy tells his family, ""This is like Mars!"" It might as well be. Every time I pull over, the view bowls me over. Fifth-grade geography terms prove insufficient and, for a rare moment, I have no idea how to describe the things I'm seeing. Later I find out that some giant mound-thingies with colorful blue, red, and gray striations are called the Tepees. Many park visitors can't seem to keep their hands off the jewel-toned petrified wood. Erin Carson/CNET But when I finally overcome my need to pull over every few yards and wonder who gave Arizona the right to be so beautiful, I spot the first pieces of petrified logs, casually laying out in the sun. I'm parked at the Crystal Forest, a roughly 1-mile-long trail with petrified wood scattered everywhere. It reminds me of my folks' backyard in Tennessee just after tornado season, when my father has diced up fallen cedars into 2- and 3-foot-long chunks with a rented chainsaw. Tourists lumber down the trail, toting water bottles and cameras, yelling at their kids to get off the logs and stay on the path. You really have to pause and imagine how this place could ever have supported a prehistoric forest. And that maybe, just maybe, a Coelophysis stopped to pee on the log you're looking at. Looking closely at some of the wood, you can catch orange, blue, purple and red striations. You can still see the tree rings. Root out crime Not everything in danger of being stolen is historic. In Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which lies along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, poachers are after the wild American ginseng that grows there. A pound of good, dry ginseng can go for $600, with prices climbing as the season wanes. Ginseng purportedly lowers blood pressure, boosts energy and helps ease digestive problems. Buyers are after the wild stuff, which tends to be more gnarled than the slender, homegrown variety. Asia drives much of the demand, but there's local demand too, says district ranger Joe Pond. In Appalachia, folks even stick it in moonshine. A ranger applies an orange powder to ginseng roots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The roots absorb the dye, which glows orange under a blacklight. North Carolina Department of Agriculture The park's been trying to ward off poachers for years. They can't put a number on how much ginseng gets stolen every year, but they've noticed that the plants they're confiscating keep getting younger, in the 3- to 5-year-old range, as opposed to decades old. Ginseng can live upward of 30 or 40 years. That leads them to worry that the more mature plants are becoming scarce. ""If they harvest that root during that time period, then they've not only killed that particular plant, but it can't perpetuate itself,"" Pond says. A plant that's picked too young hasn't had time to produce berries with the seeds that will grow into new plants. To deter and prosecute poachers, the park's been using science in the form of marking roots. Every year, the park's service staff and folks from the State of North Carolina go on a ""marking blitz."" They'll push aside dirt and expose roots of plants in certain patches, and spray them with an adhesive. They then apply an orange powder made from dye and silicon-coated chips. The dye gets absorbed into the roots, and glows orange when examined under a blacklight. That makes it hard for some guy to claim he's just passing through the park with ginseng he dug up from his uncle's yard. When tech isn't an option It's easy to see technology as a cure for all ills. There are situations, though, where it just doesn't work. Take Joshua Tree National Park, located about an hour outside of Palm Springs, California. The park, which has plenty of natural attractions plus a slew of old mines and homesteads abandoned by prospectors more than 100 years ago, battles both vandalism and theft. Park-goers have been known to tag boulders and walk off with artifacts— maybe a tin can found at an old homestead. And as much as park law enforcement would like to toss up sensors everywhere, they can't, says cultural resources branch chief Jason Theuer. Theuer worked in Petrified Forest National Park from 2007 to early 2011 and can compare the two. Petrified Forest has one main road. You can't camp there and you can't just wander off. Petrified Forest also has sensors placed strategically along gated sideroads, so rangers know when people have strayed where they don't belong. Joshua Tree has far fewer restrictions. Visitors can pretty much go wherever the spirit takes them. ""We are also the size of the state of Delaware, so response time is a little tricky,"" Theuer tells me over the phone. Size isn't the only challenge. Say you put up a trail camera— a fairly common tool for national parks— and catch someone looting an archaeological site. You've got a picture but not a name. That means you also need cameras in parking lots and at entrances so you can capture images of cars' license plates and the faces of people riding in them. ""You need to connect an identity with the actual crime,"" Theuer says. And don't even think about microchipping everything in the park. ""We have 2,000 archeological sites. Hundreds of thousands of artifacts. Are we going microchip every artifact? That's crazy."" A ranger examines a tree damaged by burl poachers in Redwood National and State Parks. NPS So when tech doesn't pan out, group psychology can sometimes do the trick. In late 2011, for example, vandals began scratching graffiti into Barker Dam, built by ranchers in 1900. Visitors saw that as a license to vandalize. Within three years, people's names were spread across into the dam's walls — Ashley, Adam, Derek, the Desert Sun reported. Friggin' Derek. Nearly the entire surface of the dam was covered in graffiti. ""Once a few people saw that one person had done it, it was OK for them to do it, too,"" Theuer says. He even caught a couple in their late 50s mid-scratch one day. The park needed to stop people's urge to scratch. To do that, it started a process called in-painting – dabbing dots of acrylic paint, the same shades as the surrounding areas, inside the scratches. The graffiti is almost invisible. They haven't seen any more graffiti since. Up near California's border with Oregon, rangers at Redwood National and State Parks are trying to stop poachers from carving out the trees' valuable burls – essentially the outgrowth of a single bud that failed to develop into a branch, which then divides and redivides until it forms a bulge. Poachers can sell the burls to dealers and shops where they get turned into bowls, plates, clocks, coffee tables. (What is it with coffee tables?) Visitors to Joshua Tree National Park can wander practically anywhere in the 1,235-square-mile area. James Martin/CNET In 2013, poachers felled a 400-year-old tree to get their hands on a 500-pound burl that was 60 feet up. It was one of 18 known cases of burl theft in the park. The next year, thieves carved out 21 burls from four trees. Things get complicated when you realize this is an old-growth forest, with redwoods that live, on average, for 500 to 700 years. About 96 percent of the original old-growth coast redwoods have been logged, and Redwood National Park contains 45 percent of California's remaining protected old-growth redwoods. The burls are essential for reproduction. New trees grow from the burls when the parent tree dies. In 2017, researchers made a series of recommendations, including installing closed-circuit TVs and listening devices that could detect the sound of a chainsaw. None of the recommendations have been actionable, says Leonel Arguello, joint chief of resource management and science at Redwood National Park. ""The roads are not gate-able,"" he tells me over the phone. ""There's no existing technology and/or staffing to keep people out 100 percent of the time. ""There is really nothing that can help us other than good old forensics,"" he says, explaining how they match the grain of a burl to a tree that's been damaged, or compare chainsaw marks. Those techniques can help them get convictions, but they're can't prevent the destruction. You can't take it with you Back at the visitor's center at Saguaro National Park, I hang around for a few minutes to mooch off the air conditioning. One of the folks behind the desk announces the next screening of a short, informational film that talks about the cacti and their relationship with Native Americans. When it ends, the projector screen slowly rolls up into the ceiling and the curtains open to reveal an unobstructed view of the land. For a split second, before people start reaching for their backpacks and purses: reverence. Click here to see more Road Trip adventures. Antonio/E+/Getty Images In less 48 hours, I'll be on a plane headed back to my pocket of the universe— an ivy-covered porch and an inch-tall barrel cactus, legally purchased. It bends the mind to experience lands like this and just walk away. I think of the future parade of visitors who will have their own personal experiences that are, in a way, not their own at all. So I pay $3.99 for a magnet showing some cowboys and saguaro, get in the Camaro and drive away. All legal and guilt-free.

Flora Carr,"Winter Storm Toby, the fourth Nor’easter in less than three weeks, is set to wallop the storm-ravaged East Coast with a fresh blanket of snow just in time for the first day of spring. The good news is Winter Storm Toby is not expected to be as powerful as previous Nor’easters earlier this month, according to The Weather Channel. But it still could bring more than a foot of snow to various major cities along the East Coast like New York City. As of Tuesday morning, Winter Storm Toby was already wreaking havoc on the south — bringing hail, heavy winds and tornado warnings to Florida and Georgia. It will make its way up the East Coast Tuesday night, with the brunt of Winter Storm Toby happening during the day Wednesday. Airports are already bracing for the bad weather — with many airlines cancelling flights and waiving change fees due to Winter Storm Toby. Here’s what you need to know about when Winter Storm Toby will hit and how much snow is expected from the Nor’easter: What’s the difference between a ‘Winter Storm Watch’ and a ‘Winter Storm Warning’? Winter storm warnings for Storm Toby have been issued for a broad swath of the East Coast ranging from eastern Massachusetts to the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina; (that area includes the cities of Boston, Providence, Hartford, New York City, the Tri-State area and Philadelphia.) Winter storm warnings are upgrades from winter storm “watches,” which have been issued in Washington D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. There are three types of winter warnings issued by the National Weather Service : watches, warnings and advisories. Warnings and advisories are both upgrades in severity from the initial “watch.” A “warning” is the most severe of the three, indicating expected heavy snow of 6 inches in 12 hours or 8 inches in 24 hours, and blizzard conditions for “at least three hours,” according to the NWS’s website. An advisory indicates between 3 to 5 inches of snow within 12 hours. Winter weather advisories have currently been issued from parts of Indiana and Kentucky to western Pennsylvania and West Virginia, according to The Weather Channel. How will Winter Storm Toby affect New York City? The National Weather Service New York predicted Winter Storm Toby will take effect after midnight on Tuesday, with the potential for up to 14 inches of snow in some areas. Strong winds are expected, in addition to “heavy wet snow,” according to the NWS New York Twitter account. The storm is expected to linger throughout the day Wednesday, and be done by roughly 8 a.m. Thursday morning. How will Winter Storm Toby affect the South? Tornado watches have been issued for much of Florida and parts of Georgia in the wake of Winter Storm Toby, as those areas prepare for hail and violent winds. The Weather Channel issued a tornado watch for the Southeast Tuesday morning. “Tornado watch issued for parts of northern/central Florida and far southeast Georgia until 7 pm EDT,” a Weather Channel spokesperson tweeted.",Just in time for the first day of spring,2018-03-20T15:51:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A Fourth Nor’easter Is Moving Up the East Coast.

Government spokesperson Andrew Munoz said the investigation is taking longer than usual because of the partial government shutdown, and the park didn’t send a press release about the death because of the shutdown as well.
The third death happened Dec. 29 at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee when a tree was knocked down by high winds and hit 42-year-old Laila Jiwani.
On average, about six deaths happen per week across the park system, National Park Service spokesperson Jeremy Barnum told the Washington Post.

National parks have remained open with less staff during the shutdown, and the Park Service estimates up to 16,000 of its 19,000-person workforce is furloughed due to the shutdown, the Post reports.
In January 2018, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke decided to keep national parks as accessible as possible in the event of a shutdown.
It was a change of policy from the two previous shutdowns in 1995 and 2013 under former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama respectively. They both had parks closed to visitors to protect their safety, but Obama received criticism from Republicans for closing the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Parks were open during the last three-day shutdown.
People have been rushing to the parks to take advantage of the lack of entrance fees, but this has resulted in a build-up of trash and human waste, a potential hazard.
Diane Regas, president and CEO of the Trust for Public Land, wrote a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, urging him to close parks to “protect the health and safety of park visitors and to protect park resources.”

"USA TODAY, Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY","Last Slide Next Slide Key West, Florida, is the No. 13 top market to buy a vacation rental. Modern Rendezvous is a two-bedroom home with a private pool near Higgs Beach, fishing piers and the Key West Nature Preserve. (Photo: Vacasa) Owning a vacation rental can be lucrative. A growing number of travelers are opting out of hotels and seeking condos or apartments that make them feel like they are living temporarily like a local. Vacasa, a vacation rental property management company, has for the first time ranked the top 25 markets for buying a vacation rental in the USA. The “Insider’s Guide to the Top 25 Markets for Buying a Vacation Rental” comes as the company launches Vacasa Real Estate, a network that connects buyers and sellers of vacation homes with licensed real estate agents across the country. Vacasa also offers a Vacation Rental Estimator for prospective buyers to determine the earning potential for a specific property. To come up with the list, the company analyzed home sales data in vacation markets throughout the country. It then overlaid that with the actual performance data for more than 500,000 vacation rental properties. From there, it compared each region’s net operating income with the cost of buying a home to come up with the market’s cap rate. The rankings were based on that cap rate. “Not only is it important to consider the earning potential of the home to ensure the return on investment is on par with expectations, but also the factors that could draw guests to the area,” says Eric Breon, founder and CEO of Vacasa. Nearly half of the top 25 markets are concentrated in the southeast part of the county with the Forgotten Coast of Florida ranking No. 1. Florida dominated the list, with nine of its communities making the cut. The Smoky Mountains of Tennessee ranks No. 2, and Kissimmee, also in Florida, made it to No. 3. Rounding out the top five are two South Carolina communities: Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head Island. Representing the west coast are Sunriver, the Central Coast, and the North Coast of Oregon; Lake Chelan and Leavenworth in Washington; and Coachella Valley and Big Bear in California. Hawaii made the list with North Kona. See the 25 top markets to buy a vacation rental in the slideshow above.

The great American road trip is still one of the best ways for families to relax and reconnect with one another, said Stacey Barber, executive director, AAA Travel Information &amp; Content. This is quickly shaping up to be another busy year for family travelers.""
Pro tips from AAA: Plan ahead and research your destination(s). Bring snacks for kids and carry emergency equipment like a flashlight, first-aid kit and extra water. And one thing you should definitely remember to pack during busy summer travel periods: your patience. 
Here are the top five road trip routes for 2019, per AAA member routing data:

Toby Nwazor,"Hotels are great but there's something they cannot give -- a home away from home. The good news is that makes a great selling point for vacation rental entrepreneurs. However, there’s a challenge -- now thousands of homeowners are competing for rental guests, too. Just take a look at listings like Airbnb, HomeAway, Arrived or FlipKey to see for yourself! The winning team is the one that knows just what to do to make itself stand out from the rest of the pack. To do that you need to know exactly how to market your property. Here are three super, easy steps that you can take right away to get started. 1. Lay the foundation. Effective vacation rental marketing needs legs to stand on. There’s a lot that has to be done in the background that will attract travelers to stay at your property. However, most times it’s the minute details that vacation rental entrepreneurs miss. How your property looks, the amenities available, and the overall experience your property provides your guest play a huge role in your marketing strategy. You have to be sure you make a good impression from the get-go. Perfect the aesthetics. A picture says a thousand words. And for potential guests who are trying to decide if the property is the best fit for them, your pictures say a lot more to them in your vacation rental listings. The closest potential guests can get to your property are the pictures they see on your listings. Investing in a great photographer to take quality pictures of your property will be money well spent. But don’t stop there. According to Alan Egan, founder of Rent More Weeks, rental staging is vital. “Rental staging is a method of marketing where we add props to dress a scene before taking a photograph.” In other words, it’s taking pictures strategically. It helps potential guests imagine themselves on holiday at your property. Plug in things that will make the experience memorable. You want your guests to be enthralled with your property. To keep them coming back and drop a great review of your property, you need to make sure that your property plays the part. Let’s be honest. You won’t be able to take alluring pictures of your property if it is in bad shape. Related: 10 Tips to Renovate your House Beautifully yet Economically Clear out the outdated décor, broken items, old paint and give your property the needed facelift. The aim is to make sure that you are able to give your potential guests a memorable experience -- a good one, of course. The same goes for providing amenities as well. Get the Wi-Fi up and running (if that’s the kind of service you want to provide), get cable, and make sure that the facilities are working. Remember, it’s the little details that matter. 2. Build a brand. David Angotti of Smoky Mountains encourages homeowners and managers to leverage the power of storytelling to offer their potential guest a worthwhile experience. In the process, you earn more than just bookings; you win their hearts. Your story matters, and it can do a lot for your marketing. Tell your story. Being a vacation rental entrepreneur is much more than just renting out your property; it’s about the people behind the property. People want to know about you, your property and the stories of those who have stayed there before. Related: Success Begins by Being Able to Tell Your Own Story There are so many ways you can incorporate storytelling to market your property. The easiest way to share your story is to document your journey on how you were able to bring the property to where it is, what made you fall in love with the property in the first place, and what you want your guests to experience while they are there. Where can you share your story? Blogs, social media, and emails to your mailing list subscribers are excellent platforms. In essence, you are marketing your property with your story. Leverage your expertise. Don’t let the word expertise scare you. You know a lot more than you think. Keep a blog where you can talk about how your guests can enjoy their stay at your property and in its locality. It’s a great way to give value. People are looking for more than just a place to spend the vacation. They also seek additional information on how they can make the best of their stay. They need tips on how it can be memorable and guides to the places to hang out. Related: A Killer, Hyper-Targeted, Local Marketing Campaign... and Its Only Kryptonite As you give value through your blog or social media posts, more people will get to know more about your property, and you’ll build an audience in the process. Consequently, the chances that guests would like to stay at your property grow. 3. Promote and then promote some more. List your property on as many vacation rental listings as you can. But don’t limit yourself to listings alone. Post about your property on social media. If you have a marketing budget, invest in ads. But most of all don’t slow down in your outreach. Keep at it, and stay consistent.","The rental entrepreneur is selling a wonderful short-term experience. But to get the booking requires an eye for beauty, an ear for storytelling and a head for promotion.",2018-05-22T14:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",3 Simple Steps to Turn Your Rental Into a Vacationer's Favorite Memory,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/313443,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180521193751-GettyImages-664662029.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,Smoky Mountains,0
Leslie Harvey,"There are few travel experiences more distinctly American than a visit to a national park. Generations of families have piled in the station wagon (and now its modern cousin, the SUV) to road trip through iconic destinations like the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite or the Great Smoky Mountains. One of the nation’s most popular parks, Zion National Park in Utah. Image by Leslie Harvey. National parks in the United States can be some of the most rewarding destinations for family travelers to visit. Whether you have a toddler or a teen, national parks offer a wide variety of travel experiences from the educational to the more adventurous. It’s no wonder the parks are often called “America’s best idea.” America’s national parks can be fairly inexpensive travel destinations. Of course, their growing popularity has raised prices, along with increasing crowds, especially during peak seasons. For family travelers looking to keep travel costs down, there are many ways to make a national parks vacation more budget-friendly. Don’t worry, I’m not going to say you need to sleep in a tent to save money although camping can surely save some cash, too. The Sliding Sands Trail in Haleakala National Park. Image by Leslie Harvey. Whether you are a beginner to national parks travel, or a veteran looking to cross even more parks off your bucket list, here are the easiest ways to save money when visiting America’s national parks. 1. Take Advantage of Your Fourth-Grader for a Free Pass If you have a fourth-grader in your traveling family, you should apply right now for the “Every Kid in a Park” pass. Valid from the beginning of the school year through the summer following fourth-grade, this pass allows fourth-graders and their families free access to all the National Park Service sites and many other federal lands. The Every Kid in a Park program is fairly new, started in 2015 in anticipation of the National Park Service’s centennial year. As a result, many families simply haven’t heard of it yet. The application process is incredibly simple. Go to the official website and have your child complete a few questions. A digital copy of the pass is then available for printing and can be traded in for a more permanent pass at many parks, if you prefer. My fourth-grade daughter just applied and received hers in the mail last week so we are prepared for a year of even more park adventuring. 2. Buy an Annual Pass Even if you don’t have a fourth-grader, annual passes at national parks are still a great deal for family travelers who plan to visit multiple park sites. The standard America the Beautiful annual pass is just $80. With per-vehicle fees to enter some of the most popular national parks, such as Yosemite and Yellowstone, as high as $35 per visit, you’ll more than break even if you plan to visit even just a few sites in a single year. Yosemite, one of the most majestic parks, is now also one of the most expensive. Image by Leslie Harvey. The annual pass is valid to enter more than 2,000 federal recreation sites, from national parks to national forests and a variety of public lands. My family was pleasantly surprised to find that our pass was even valid at a site like Red Rock Canyon outside of Las Vegas, which is a National Conservation Area managed by the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management. One quirk of the pass is that it’s good for the month in which you purchase it and then 12 months after that. So, it’s possible to squeeze nearly 13 months of value out of a pass when timed properly. If you don’t plan to visit enough different parks to justify an America the Beautiful Pass, consider park-specific annual passes that are available in many locations. A few of these passes even cover more than a single location. The Crater Lake National Park Pass, for example, also includes admission to nearby Lava Beds National Monument in Northern California. 3. Make it a Multigenerational Vacation A multigenerational national park adventure at Bryce Canyon National Park. Image by Leslie Harvey. If you vacation with grandma and grandpa, they can also help you get into national parks for less. The America the Beautiful Lifetime Senior Pass is just a one-time fee of $80 and is good for life. While the price did recently increase last year, it’s still an amazing bargain. Seniors are eligible to apply at age 62, so many active seniors will often get decades of value out of a pass. Having visited several national parks with my children and my parents together, I also can highly recommend the multigenerational national parks experience. Getting outdoors in the natural beauty of the parks is a great way for children to bond with grandparents and learn something along the way. There can be practical benefits as well. My husband and I, for example, have been the lucky recipients of grandparent baby-sitting for our younger child when we wanted to take our older child on a few more challenging hikes. Hiking a waterfall trail too challenging for her little brother in Zion National Park. Image by Leslie Harvey. Just remember that most national parks charge entrance on a per vehicle basis. If your multigenerational group plans to drive two cars into a park, you’ll need two passes. 4. Visit on Fee-Free Days The National Park Service has several days a year where all national parks are entirely free to enter. Take advantage, especially if you are new to national parks but looking to dip your toe in the water. Hiking among the iconic cacti of Saguaro National Park in Tucson, Arizona. Image by Leslie Harvey. The fee-free days in 2018 included January 15 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day) and April 21 (First Day of National Park Week) and also will include September 22 (National Public Lands Day) and November 11 (Veterans Day). The number of fee-free days has contracted in recent years, down to only four in 2018 compared to 10 offered in 2017, and 16 offered in 2016. As a result, you’ll need to plan a bit more in advance to take advantage of these freebies. Of course, the fee-free days can also be some of the most crowded at many national park sites. The earlier you can arrive on a fee-free day, the easier it is to park and dodge the crowds. 5. Visit Fee-Free Sites While many parks charge entrance fees, a majority of sites managed by the National Park Service and related agencies don’t charge a dime. Many travelers don’t realize the extent of the free offerings. I highly recommend spending a few minutes on the National Park Service website and looking for free parks near your home or where your next vacation will take you. Sunset from Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a national park that is totally free to visit. Image courtesy of Wray Sinclair via Getty Images. For example, the nation’s most visited national park, Great Smoky Mountain National Park, is still completely free to enter. Two other national parks within easy driving distance of millions of Americans Cuyahoga Valley in Ohio and Congaree in South Carolina are both free as well. Additionally, most National Monuments don’t charge entrance fees. 6. Vacation in Shoulder Season The national parks have become increasingly popular in recent years. Demand for lodging greatly outstrips supply in some places, inflating prices during the high season for everything from hotels to activities. For example, expect to pay well over $200 a night for very basic hotels 30 to 45 minutes outside of the Yosemite National Park gates if you visit in July. Budget-conscious families should strongly consider shoulder season visits to find more reasonable prices. As an added bonus, you’ll also dodge crowds while saving some cash. Because the shoulder season is different in every park depending on its location, geography and weather, chances are good that you can find a national park destination that works any time of year. Try Yosemite during the early fall once the Labor Day crowds have cleared, Death Valley in the late fall before the winter rush starts or Bryce Canyon for spring break while the last snows there are melting. Bryce Canyon still has a bit of snow in early April but is very hikeable. Image by Leslie Harvey. 7. Cash in Hotel Points to Stay Near National Parks Last but certainly not least, hotel points can be an important part of a budget national park experience. After all, if I’m promising that you don’t have to camp, lodging is often the largest percentage of the cost of a national parks trip. National park vacations may not be as obvious of a choice for using hotel points compared to a major city or tropical resort getaway, but there is value to be found around many popular national parks for the careful planner. Zion Park Lodge is an historic property and the only lodging located within the park. Image by Leslie Harvey. Most of the lodging within the boundaries of national parks are managed by national parks concessionaires such as Xanterra Resorts and Delaware North. Ordinary chain hotels are nowhere to be found. These accommodations can, however, be excellent uses for some flexible points currencies like those available with credit cards like the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard or Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. In addition to having superior locations, many of the in-park hotels are historic lodges teeming with unique offerings. I always recommend cashing in for authentic national parks experience whenever possible. Sometimes these historic lodges are too pricy, or more often, just sold out. In those situations, there are values to be found near many national parks with the major hotel points programs too. At Zion National Park, for example, the town of Springdale is just steps outside of the park. Springdale has a number of chain hotels where points travelers can redeem points without sacrificing location. The Holiday Inn Express Springdale – Zion National Park Area, for example, charges 40,000 points a night and is one of the best-rated hotels in the area. It could be a great use of the free night certificate awarded every anniversary from the new IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card. And when rates soar to more than $250 a night (which they often do in high season), redeeming IHG points can be a good value as well. Staying in Jackson Hole near the Grand Tetons affords a few options on points such as the newer SpringHill Suites Jackson Hole bookable for 35,000 Marriott Rewards points per night. This means you could use an annual 35,000-point Marriott Rewards certificate awarded with various co-branded SPG and Marriott Rewards credit cards. If you have the Starwood Preferred Guest® American Express Luxury Card, that awards an annual 50,000 point Marriott Rewards certificate, you can book the SpringHill Suites very close to the entrance of Zion National Park.

Trevor Mogg,"Sierralara/Shutterstock Many city dwellers tired of subjecting their auditory systems to the jarring noises of urban life block out the noise by sticking some earphones in and losing themselves in their favorite music. But for a more soothing experience, how about transporting yourself to one of the country’s many national parks? Celebrating the National Park Service’s 102nd birthday, the National Park Foundation — the official charity partner of the service — recently released a soundtrack comprising 12 minutes of audio collected from many of the nation’s parks. ParkTracks, which can be streamed online for free, is described by the foundation as “an innovative audio experience to help counter the hustle and bustle of city life, and tap into the trends of tranquility and mindfulness.” The relaxing sounds of nature were captured by the foundation’s Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division with the aim of transporting you from your noisy subway ride to Yellowstone or Yosemite or the Great Smoky Mountains. “America’s national parks contain many cherished treasures,” the Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division says on its website. “Among them are captivating natural sounds and awe-inspiring night skies. The joy of listening to the quiet symphony of nature and the wonderment of seeing the Milky Way stretching overhead are unique experiences that can still be found in many of our national parks.” It also talks about how each of America’s national parks has its own unique soundscape. Dig deeper into its website and you’ll find individual recordings from Rocky Mountain National Park that are divided into soundscapes from throughout the day, environmental soundscapes, and weather soundscapes. Many studies over the years have suggested that the sounds of nature can have a beneficial effect on your well-being, even if you’re not able to easily leave the city to enjoy them in person. A detailed study conducted last year by U.K.-based researchers, for example, found that natural sounds had a more positive effect on internal human processes compared to artificial sounds. The study’s lead author, Dr Cassandra Gould van Praag, said : “We are all familiar with the feeling of relaxation and ‘switching-off’ which comes from a walk in the countryside, and now we have evidence from the brain and the body which helps us understand this effect. [This research] has produced results which may have a real-world impact, particularly for people who are experiencing high levels of stress.” Looking for more ways to relax?

"USA TODAY, Joel Shannon, USA TODAY","A government shutdown could have an impact on everything from your passport application to your trip to a national park.
 USA TODAY
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park at sunrise. During the federal government shutdown, the National Park Service says it will not update social media. Some national parks will be accessible, but their availability could change, the agency says.
(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)
A partial government shutdown affecting hundreds of thousands of federal employees started immediately Saturday morning, prompting many shuttered government organizations to announce their indefinite departure from social media.
Nine federal departments and several smaller agencies ran out of money as Congress failed to pass continued funding amid a raging debate about funding for border security. The closure puts more than 380,000 federal workers on furlough and will force another 420,000 employees to work without pay.
Among those to announce their shutdown on social media: the U.S. Small Business Administration.
""Due to the lapse of government funding, SBA will remain inactive until further notice. We apologize for any inconveniences and we look forward to assisting you when we return.""
Not all impacted government organizations will take a total social media hiatus, as many operations deemed ""essential"" will continue during the shutdown:
The NWS will continue to operate 24x7 through the government shutdown to provide reliable forecasts and warnings. Our social media posts will remain as close to normal as possible, but we will be limiting posts/replies to subjects that are directly related to ongoing weather.
— NWS WPC (@NWSWPC) December 22, 2018
But many other departments and agencies, including the National Park Service and US National Archives, flatly said the shutdown would shutter their organization and their social media presence indefinitely:
Due to the government shutdown, we will not be posting any new updates or responding to questions until normal operations resume. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

"Evan Urquhart, Evan Urquhart","The burned-out remains of a home in Redding, California, July 27, 2018. We probably should have known when the midday sunlight turned an eerie red that it was really happening, we were going to have to evacuate. At 12:30 on Saturday we noticed this strange reddish light, and went outside together, to take in the smoky sky and the odd, apocalyptic feel of our town, Lakeport, CA, about a hundred miles north of San Francisco. Although we couldn’t see it, we knew the River Fire (part of the Mendocino Complex) was raging a few miles to our west. Our 17-year-old foster, whom the law requires me to avoid naming in print, tried to get some video, hoping to share the odd light and odder feeling with the friends he keeps in his ears, via oversized headphones, nearly 24/7. We felt restless and tired of waiting for news, and so we decided to take a trip through the McDonald’s drive-thru, something to do while we waited to hear news. As my wife reached for the bag of burgers we heard her phone buzz with a text alert—residents of Lakeport, CA were being advised to evacuate. Ash was falling from the sky like light snow as we pulled up to our house, so we ate quickly, then packed the cars. The kid joked about wanting to stay and loot the houses, pretending to be hard. He also found a half-packed backpack (containing my baby blanket and the Icelandic sweater I’d gotten on my honeymoon) and rescued it just before I pulled away and left it behind. Before all that, in the early morning, Cassie and I had woken to news that the fires near Hopland and Route 20—two of the three roads out of town—had grown overnight and were moving in our direction. They were just a few of the 20 or more fires now burning across California. Cassie and I began an evacuation plan while the kid and Mandy, Cassie’s girlfriend, slept. We accepted a kind offer to stay with a friend in Oakland. We talked about what we’d take (our new microwave, the gaming systems, everything the kid moved in with) and what we’d have to leave behind (the television, the crock pot, the kid’s new bike). Cassie would drive the Corolla with Mandy, the kid, and our two dogs. I’d take the Prius with the cats, whom our friend couldn’t accommodate. If necessary I’d take them to shelter before going on to Oakland, but we’d try to find a friend of a friend to take them on. But that wasn’t the beginning—far from it. The red light of wildfire has colored our life in northern California, in this town we’ve grown to love, from the day we decided to move there for my wife’s work. The director of the Lake County Mosquito Control District insisted Cassie come and interview in person because, she said, the remoteness of Lake County had led others who’d taken positions to leave almost as quickly as they came once the reality sank in. We were having lunch in a restaurant on Main Street whose walls held remembrances of the Valley Fire, where four people died and nearly 2,000 structures were destroyed. Wildfires in California have been worsening, along with drought, and reminders of both were unavoidable even on a three-day trip during the rainy winter of 2017 with our future looking bright. The work was exactly what my wife was looking for, a chance to direct her own research into mosquitoes and other pest insects, and at a higher salary than either of us had ever made. We weren’t bothered that Lakeport was rural and remote; we’d already fallen in love with the fairytale beauty of the mountains and the lake. Still, we agreed, better to rent than to buy property here. We wouldn’t want to buy our first house only to have it burn down. It took some looking, but we found a three-bedroom house to rent for roughly what a one-bedroom apartment in Boston would have been, walking distance from Main Street and Cassie’s new workplace. It had space for Mandy to have her own bedroom, and a fenced-in yard for the dogs to play. Lakeport is a town of fewer than 5,000, and so everyone knows when you’re new in town. “Why on earth did you come to Lakeport?” was a question we grew used to fielding as soon as people understood we weren’t just visiting, and when we answered we found that everyone knew the Mosquito Control District Office where my wife worked. The people in and around Lakeport are like people everywhere, except perhaps a little prouder, a little sadder, and a little more willing to help a neighbor in need. One of my wife’s co-workers is far-left feminist; another has an NRA sticker on his truck. Our being both queer and polyamorous is certainly a novelty, but not one that’s been met with any real hostility on the locals’ part. Last winter the rains didn’t come, and we knew then the pleasant sunshine foretold a dry tinderbox surrounding us in the summer months. But no one knew we’d have weeks of unrelenting heat with highs of 107, hot weather so intense we’d hide inside, day after day, going out only during the cool of the early mornings or at night. Fire has been with us through the drought, formally declared for Lake County in May, and in the record setting heat. It’s been out there on the tawny dried-grass hills all summer, only waiting for a spark to let it loose. In our first summer fires raged in neighboring Mendocino County; a couple months afterwards we drove through Middletown and saw burned-out cars, foundations where houses once stood, a husk of a gas station: the corpse of a town. A few hours to our north is the much larger town of Redding, where Mandy and I go to see a doctor who’ll treat transgender patients. Redding is burning now, and five people have died. As the acreage of the Mendocino Complex grows, we know that Lakeport may be next. On Route 20 north, the one remaining way out of town, we were joined by our neighbors and friends as we all scattered to other towns, other cities, unsure whether Lakeport will still be standing when we come back. It’s one of a million rural towns that no one knows, and no one seems to want to know. Maybe it was even dying already, but people, including us, still call it home.

"USA TODAY, Katharine Lackey, USA TODAY","After a tour group came too close to a bison in Yellowstone National Park, a woman was gored by the animal. Buzz60 A herd of bison crosses a bridge at Yellowstone National Park in March 2017. The free-ranging herds often cause minor traffic delays for park visitors who find their vehicles temporarily surrounded. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyoming – YOLO, FOMO, selfies: They are among the greatest dangers to visitors trying to get that perfect photo or video. People are getting too close and personal with wildlife, putting at risk not only their own lives but those of park creatures. “People are in the YOLO today: you only live once, ‘I’m going to grab this one shot, this is my one chance,’” said Julena Campbell, spokesperson at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Gatlinburg, Tenn., the most popular national park, with 11 million visitors a year. “We’re in that Insta gram. We’re thinking of the instant and the moment, not how this is going to affect things down the line.” As both the number of visitors to national parks and wildlife populations have increased in recent decades, humans and animals too often find themselves in close proximity, causing headaches for park officials eager to keep the wild in wildlife. “When you interfere with wildlife... sometimes those animals have to be put down and that's really sad,” said Vanessa Lacayo, public affairs specialist for the National Park Service Intermountain Region, which includes Grand Canyon, Zion, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Glacier national parks.

(Photo: Alan Rogers /The Casper Star-Tribune via AP) Yellowstone: Epicenter of bear and bison jams Visitors getting too close to wildlife is especially pervasive in Yellowstone, the country’s first national park, where bison and bear jams routinely clog roadways and attacks by wild animals make national headlines every year. ""We’ve got more people and more animals sharing a landscape than any other park,"" said Neal Herbert, Yellowstone spokesperson. ""We’ve got thousands of bison, thousands of elk, hundreds of grizzly bears all in a completely unfenced area where you can run into these animals at any time."" In Yellowstone, which averages 4 million visitors a year, bison injure the most people, at least one every year and five in 2015 alone. More mishaps may occur but ""many things go unreported,"" Herbert said. Kirsten Leong and fellow scientists who combed through reports about people injured by bison found visitors are getting ever closer. ""Selfies may have something to do with it,” said Leong, a former National Park Service social scientist who now works for NOAA Fisheries. Viral video: Man who taunted was on national park crime spree What happens when you crowd animals: Bison gores woman who got too close at Yellowstone Another Yellowstone attack: Elk kicks Texas woman in the head in 2nd Yellowstone incident in 3 days When you take a selfie, “you're up close to a wild animal that you might be provoking and you're turning your back on it,” Leong said. Selfies aren’t the only danger. In June, a bison gored a woman in Yellowstone when a group of visitors approached within 15 feet of the animal, prompting it to charge. The attack followed two close encounters with elk the same week that also resulted in injuries. People who purposefully get too close to wildlife face fines and jail time that vary by park but can be as high as $5,000 or six months behind bars, Lacayo said. A herd of bison create a ""bison jam"" in Yellowstone National Park in May 2012. (Photo: Maxine Park/USA TODAY) A vicious cycle A single person dropping food or getting too close to wildlife can set off a chain reaction. “They start to learn that people aren't the threat and so then they stop reacting and so this then causes a feedback loop where people think, ‘Oh, this animal's letting me get up close. It's kind of tame. It's okay. It's safe for me to get close,’” Leong said. “It might still be stressed out even though it's not physically running away or physically showing you any signs that there's anything wrong.” Humans also introduce new foods, either through direct feeding or as trash, that can make the animals more susceptible to disease. “I love Snickers bars but if all I ate were Snickers bars I’d be in really bad shape,” said Mark Biel, Natural Resources Program manager at Glacier National Park in Montana, which averages 3 million visitors a year. The bad behavior is contagious. Visitors think “If there are other people around me doing it, I’m not going to get injured,” said Katie Abrams, assistant professor of journalism and mass communications at Colorado State University. “There’s... a little FOMO (fear of missing out) going on there.” Animals frequently crowded by humans are more likely to lash out, increasing the chances they have to be put down. “There’s a whole bunch of bad things that happen once they start going down that road,” Biel said.

(Photo: Neal Herbert/Yellowstone National Park via AP) ‘Don’t make it awkward, we bearly know each other’ Glacier National Park deploys a unique, four-legged ambassador to teach visitors about keeping a safe distance. Gracie, a 4-year-old border collie, chases wildlife away, particularly near parking lots and roadways where they're more likely to encounter people. “It opens up that conversation – ‘What are you doing up here?’ ‘Oh, that’s such a cute dog’ – in a way that human-to-human conversations wouldn’t go,” said Lauren Alley, spokesperson at the park.

Biel, NPS) Great Smoky, where on average one person is injured each year by a bear, uses a novel way to get its message across: posters in bathroom stalls, where there’s a “captive audience,” Campbell said. In a lighthearted way, the ""Bears need privacy, too"" signs remind visitors to give the carnivores space. Abrams and her team created a similar campaign in partnership with the park service in four locations – Grand Canyon National Park, Assateague Island National Seashore, Rocky Mountain National Park and Shenandoah National Park. The messages focused on making staying a safe distance from wildlife seem desirable. This sign, which is placed in bathroom stalls throughout Great Smoky Mountains National Park, reminds visitors to remain a safe distance from wildlife in a lighthearted way. (Photo: Julena Campbell, NPS) The campaign used a bus length as a visual marker for how far people should stay away from specific animals and paired it with basic photography tips, catchy slogans like, ""Don’t make it awkward, we bearly know each other,"" and tips on where to view wildlife from a safe distance. “One of they key things we try to do in our campaign is to remind people of the experience they want to have in national parks,” Abrams said. “You can see animals up close at a zoo, but this is national park, a place that’s really special and unique and you came there for those reasons.” The campaign succeeded in three of the parks by increasing the proportion of visitors who kept a safe distance from animals by 16 percent. In Grand Canyon, with more than 6 million visitors a year, it didn’t: Visitors stayed farther away, but not far enough. Katie Abrams, assistant professor of journalism and mass communications at Colorado State University and her team created a campaign in partnership with the park service in four locations that shares messages focused on making staying a safe distance from wildlife seem desirable. (Photo: Safe Wildlife Distance Campaign) Efforts to stop people from getting too close to wildlife is a reversal of experiences in Yellowstone in the 1960s, when visitors headed for open-pit garbage dumps in the park that attracted grizzly bears, which also regularly begged for food on the side of roads. “Now if you said let’s go feed the bears, hopefully 90 percent or more of the people would say, ‘Hey that's a bad idea,’” Biel said. An elk lays down in the sun in Yellowstone National Park on Aug. 4, 2018. (Photo: Katharine Lackey, USA TODAY) A little help from the Internet Technology has its upside for the park system: People can do research to better plan their trips, get those safety messages before they hit the road and share their experiences on social media, Lacayo said. When someone posts a close-up bison selfie, others often post comments that it is inappropriate and unsafe, Lacayo said. “People love the selfie and it's really hard to make sure that they're keeping a safe distance from wildlife in pursuit of that,” Lacayo said. “Safety over selfie is probably a No. 1 goal.” Most importantly, visitors need to remember these are wild spaces, Leong said. “It's not a zoo. It's not a garden. It's a national park,” she said. “Give these animals space, respect that it's their habitat. You're a visitor in their home.” Last Slide Next Slide Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vWsJg4","As both the number of visitors to national parks and wildlife populations have increased in recent decades, humans and animals too often find themselves in close proximity, causing headaches for park officials eager to keep the wild in wildlife.",2018-08-20T11:12:29Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",‘Safety over selfie’: National park visitors can't seem to stop getting too close to wildlife,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/08/20/national-park-visitor-safety-wildlife-selfies/973656002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/08/15/USAT/e1413028-0c2d-4724-af35-ab9282e2213c-XXX_XX-yellowstone-Hughes_548.JPG?crop=2994,1684,x105,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds",usa-today,USA Today,Smoky Mountains,0
Talia Avakian / Travel + Leisure,"Each of the National Park Service’s 417 locations, from national parks and monuments, has unique sights and activities — that can be best appreciated with a few insider tips. To help travelers get the most of out their next visit to one of the sites, Travel + Leisure spoke to National Park Service representatives for the inside scoop on 26 locations. From the hidden gems you won’t want to miss, the best time of year to visit and the biggest mistakes to avoid, here are tips from park rangers, chiefs, and public affairs officers. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore — Michigan Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore ‘s beaches and emerald forests are great to visit in the fall, according to chief of interpretation and visitor services Merrith Baughman. That’s because the park’s beaches are full of colorful fall leaves, temperatures are still warm enough for swimming, and the park is less crowded. One hidden gem, Baughman said, is Port Oneida Rural Historic District, which is filled with turn-of-the-century farmhouses, beautiful views of Lake Michigan, and secluded beaches. Carlsbad Caverns National Park — New Mexico Those who want to see Carlsbad Caverns National Park ‘s flying bats and blooming cacti, will want to visit in the spring or summer. “Spring is fun because the desert is alive with blooming flowers and cacti — it’s gorgeous,” public affairs specialist Valerie Gohkle said of the scene. One tip: Walk the Natural Entrance Trail to descend some 750 feet down Carlsbad Cavern. Gohkle says you’ll miss 50 percent of the cavern’s beauty if you take the elevator. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park — Hawaii Created by more than 70 million years of volcanic activity, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has more than 155 miles of hiking trails, including the popular Kilauea Iki Trail, a 4-mile hike that starts in a rainforest near the volcano’s summit area and takes you on a 500-foot descent to see the Mars-like terrain of the Kilauea Iki Crater. As for views, nothing “compares to the jaw-dropping beauty of watching the sun rise over the Kilauea Caldera from the Jaggar Museum overlook, with the erupting lava lake glowing a mile and a half away, and the immense size of the caldera is revealed as the stars succumb to daylight,” Jessica Ferracane, a public affairs specialist at the park, said. While this vantage point is the busiest location in the park come sunset, get there at 5 a.m., Ferracane said, and you’ll feel as though you have the entire volcano to yourself. You’ll want hiking boots, pants, and light rain gear when visiting the park since the crater’s summit can get chilly, according to Ferracane. Olympic National Park — Washington Washington’s Olympic National Park is more like three parks in one. The space is home to forests, 70 miles of coastline, and glacier-capped mountains. Because the park has few roads that cross straight through, acting public information officer Penny Wagner said travelers should prepare for how long it takes to travel from one point in the park to another. Among the 500 trails within Olympic National Park, the 3.2-mile-long Hurricane Hill Trail will bring you past views of Mt. Olympus, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and of Vancouver Island. Lake Mead National Recreation Area — Arizona and Nevada With mountains, canyons, valleys, and lakes, the weather around Lake Mead National Recreation Area can change abruptly. If you’re planning to make use of the park’s swimming facilities in the summer, Christie Vanover, a public affairs specialist at the park, suggested wearing a life jacket, which you can get for free at stops like Boulder Beach and Cottonwood Cove, because sudden weather changes can lead to very strong winds. One of Vanover’s favorite hidden gems is the Redstone Picnic Area because of red sandstones that make the area appear like a “scene straight out of Mars.” Acadia National Park — Maine More than 3.3 million people head to Maine’s Acadia National Park each year to see the park’s mountains. The park is home to 45 miles of wide “carriage” roads created by John D. Rockefeller in the 1900s, which are used as snowshoe and skiing trails in the winter. While visiting Acadia National Park, hike the Ocean Path, which public affairs specialist Christie Anastasia said is among the most popular because of its dreamy ocean views. Great Smoky Mountains National Park — North Carolina and Tennessee The Great Smoky Mountains National Park may be named for the fog that rises over its mountains, but there are plenty of other natural attractions to admire in its backcountry trails. For those in search of quiet relief in the park, public affairs representative Dana Soehn recommended the many “quiet walkways” that line the Newfound Gap Road and Little River Road. Shenandoah National Park — Virginia Virginia’s Shenandoah National Park has flowing waterfalls, sweeping vistas, and more than 500 miles of hiking trails to explore. One of the most popular hikes, according to Sally Hurlbert, a management specialist at the park, is to the top of Hawksbill Mountain. Between the two paths there, Hurlbert recommended a 2.9 mile-hike starting at Hawkbill Gap’s parking area that takes you up the Appalachian Trail and the Salamander Trail. When you reach the summit, you’ll see Shenandoah Valley on one side and Piedmont on the other. Saguaro National Park — Arizona Visit Arizona’s Saguaro National Park in May or June to see cacti up to 50-feet tall bloom. If you can, community engagement coordinator and public information officer Cam Juárez, recommended seeing the cacti at night, when their flowers open (before closing in the morning). Those looking to hike will want to visit between October and April, Juárez said, because summer can be exceedingly hot in the area. Visitors should avoid hiking after 9 a.m. in the summer because temperatures can still be higher than 98 degrees as early on as 7 a.m., Juárez added. Assateague Island National Seashore — Maryland and Virginia Assateague Island National Seashore is known for its Atlantic beaches and hiking trails that weave around salt marches, dunes, and forests. Near the beaches, the island’s bayside offers visitors a secluded paradise complete with kayaking, swimming, clamming, and crabbing in shallow warm bay waters, according to Liz Davis, chief of interpretation and education at the seashore. Davis said to keep your eyes open from late September to early October because butterflies that migrate along the Atlantic pathway are often resting on the island. Redwood National and State Parks — California At Redwood National and State Parks, you’ll find yourself surrounded by the world’s tallest trees, which can reach more than 367 feet (or 35 stories) high. While most travelers drive straight through the park, this is a big mistake to make, interpretive park ranger Shaina Niehans said, because the side roads are where you’ll find the best of the park. For example, the largest redwoods are found off Highway 101 on alternate scenic routes, according to Niehans. Yellowstone National Park — Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming Known as the world’s first national park, Yellowstone is home to volcanic hot springs and geysers like Old Faithful. If you’re looking to visit the park for hiking and camping, you’ll want to head there in the summer. But it’s also the park’s busiest season, according to chief office of strategic communications Jody Lyle, so a trip in the fall or spring is an option to enjoy hiking in cooler temperatures with fewer crowds. Hot Springs National Park — Arkansas Hot Springs National Park is, in combination with the surrounding city, known as “The American Spa” because of its thermal springs that became popular in the 1830s. While you can’t bathe in the 143-degree-Fahrenheit springs directly, the park has bathhouses that utilize water from the area for another relaxing soak. The park is often considered the “oldest area in the national park system,” park ranger Josie Fernandez pointed out. Andrew Jackson set the hot springs aside in 1832, though the federal land wan’t instilled as a national park until 1921. Gateway National Recreation Area — New Jersey and New York Gateway National Recreation Area spreads across New Jersey and several boroughs of New York, offering swimming, bird watching, boating, hiking, and camping in places like New Jersey’s Sandy Hook and New York City’s Jamaica Bay and Staten Island. According to Daphne Yun, acting public affairs officer at the national recreation area, many visitors don’t realize the military history tied to the park. The park is home to two former Nike missile sites you’ll find at Fort Tilden, in Queens, and in Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Mount Rainier National Park — Washington Sunrise Point, highest spot in the park you can reach by car, is great for seeing Mount Rainier and the park’s meadows as well as for stargazing. Night astronomy programs are offered in the summer. During your visit, National Park Inn at Longmire and the Paradise Inn can offer a cozy place to stay. Zion National Park — Utah While there are plenty of hikes to choose from in Zion National Park, public information officer John B. Marciano recomended the Kayenta Trail, which is located within the Emerald Pools Trail. The Kayenta Trail hike takes you through the middle of a scenic canyon, where you’ll see the Virgin River and the three Emerald Pools, named for their green tint. Zion is home to popular areas like the Narrows, its east side and areas like Kolob Canyon, with miles of hiking trails that weave through 2,000-foot-high cliffs, offer a quiet reprieve that Marciano said travelers won’t want to miss. Grand Teton National Park — Wyoming Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park is a hiker’s paradise with more than 220 miles of trails that weave around the park’s lakes. While assistant public affairs officer Andrew White said each hike offers mesmerizing views, the Paintbrush Canyon Trail, Death Canyon Trail and the Phelps Lake trail often have fewer visitors than the more popular Jenny Lake and Cascade Canyon trails. Each time of the year has different draws, from wildflowers in June to skiing conditions in the winter, but White recommended travelers allow at least three days in the park to spend one day hiking, one day participating in water activities, and one day admiring the park’s wildlife. Gettysburg National Military Park — Pennsylvania Those looking for the full Gettysburg experience will want to check out Gettysburg National Military Park’s Anniversary of the Battle, according to Christopher Gwinn, chief of interpretation and education. Gwinn said that’s when the park is filled with free hikes, walks, and discussions on the historic Civil War battle. He also recommended visiting for at least two days to fully enjoy the more than 7,000 acres of historic landscapes, with the Cemetery Ridge Trail, which starts at the Museum and Visitor Center and takes you on a three-mile-loop to see some of the park’s most noted attractions, serving as his favorite hike. Sequoia National Park—California The best time to visit Sequoia National Park ‘s 3,000-year-old sequoias, Mount Whitney, and pristine glacial lakes is in the fall, because of the cooler weather before the snow hits, according to park ranger Farrah Keifer. One of the most popular hikes is the Congress Trail, which weaves through Giant Sequoias and the President Tree (the third largest tree on Earth), Keifer said. Keifer also recommended the seven-mile Trail of the Sequoias as an off-the-beaten-path hike for those who want to with nature. Yosemite National Park—California Yosemite is best known for its waterfalls, like Yosemite Falls, the tallest waterfall in North America at 2,425 feet. While its waterfalls begin to rush earlier in the year, Yosemite can also be spectacular in the wintertime. “Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and El Capitan are uniquely stunning in the winter when covered in a soft blanket of snow,” public affairs officers Jamie M. Richards and Scott Gediman said. Grand Canyon National Park—Arizona To avoid the most crowded times at Grand Canyon National Park, which saw more than 6 million visitors in 2017, you might want to visit during the winter, when hikes like the Bright Angel Trail and scenic drives are congestion free. Sightseeing and hiking conditions are good on most winter days, and dramatic storm clouds and snow create scenes that fewer travelers get to see. For travelers in search of an easy-to-hike option, public affairs officer Kirby-Lynn Shedlowski recommends the Shoshone Point Trail, a 2.1-mile-long hike that’s pet friendly, suitable for all ages and provides plenty of wildlife views. Just be sure to layer up, Shedlowski said. The inner canyon tends to be 15-20 degrees warmer than the rim so temperatures in the park will vary depending on your location. Rocky Mountain National Park—Colorado Fall can be one of the best times to visit the Rocky Mountain National Park, according to public affairs officer Kyle Patterson. During fall, elk descend from the high country and vegetation brings gold, orange and bronze hues to the area. Before you visit, however, make sure to reserve your campsite up to six months in advance, Patterson said. Timber Creek Campground typically filling up last, according to Patterson. Death Valley National Park—California and Nevada As America’s hottest, driest, and lowest national park, Death Valley is home to uncommon scenes like dry fields that often feature wildflowers in the spring. Although the flowers aren’t a guarantee, when they do bloom from February through April, they can leave the park covered in gold, purple, pink, and white flowers. You’ll want to be sure to give yourself time to admire the park in both the early morning and the late afternoon, as this is when it’s at its most beautiful, according to management assistant Abby Wines. Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area—California Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area gives you the chance to escape to the wild without having to leave city limits. The recreation area is home over 500 miles of trails and 41 miles of coastline that include tide pools at the Leo Carillo State Park and the surf break at the Malibu Lagoon. As for hiking, the Backbone Trail hike standing as the park’s most impressive, according to public affairs officer Kate Kuykendall. The 67-mile hike takes you along the spine of the Santa Monica Mountains, with her favorite section starting on the eastern side off of Sunset Boulevard at Will Rogers State Historic Park. “Hike a few miles in and you can get expansive views of the Santa Monica Mountains and downtown Los Angeles at Inspiration Point,” she said. Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area—New Jersey and Pennsylvania Those who enjoy fishing should head to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in the spring, when American Shad and brook trout start swimming in the area’s streams, according to public affairs specialist Kathleen Sandt. While many come to see the park’s trails and paddle on the river, Sandt also recommended visiting the Millbrook Village, located on the New Jersey side of the park. The area is a re-created and restored historic village where you can see crafts and trades from the 1800s with guides adorned in period costumes. Badlands National Park—South Dakota Badlands National Park has one of one of the world’s richest fossil beds and one of the largest protected mixed grass prairies in the U.S. The park has eight established hiking trails, of which Christine Czazasty, chief of interpretation and resource education at the park, recommends the Notch Trail, where you’ll find one of the best views in the park, and the Door Trail, which takes you through the Badlands wall of spires. “Though it’s a short easy trail, it really drives home the reason they called it the Badlands; you are completely surrounded by the barren desolation of the treeless slopes, bisected by countless gullies carved by the driving rains,” Czazasty said of the hike.

"Asheville Citizen Times, Karen Chávez, Asheville Citizen Times","One of the damaged concrete picnic tables at the Craggy Gardens picnic area. (Photo: Matt Burkhartt/mburkhartt@citize) BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY, N.C. — Hal and Mary Jean Herzog hike or picnic at the Craggy Gardens Picnic Area at least once a month in the spring, summer and fall, since the idyllic setting is so close to their Weaverville home. Concrete tables are nestled into a hidden-away hillside at more than 5,000 feet elevation, providing a front-row, rippling view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and in June, the sweep of bright pink Catawba rhododendron blooms. But a picnic this week left the couple with a bad taste in their mouths. “I’ve been coming here for 45 years,” Hal Herzog said. “I’ve never seen it so bad. The first table we came to, the seats were so rotted out you couldn’t sit on them. The second table, the seat was missing. My wife said the women’s bathroom was covered in mold. It’s horrifying.” Herzog said when he was at Craggy on Wednesday, he also noticed the grass was not well-mowed and the hiking trail leading to the visitor center appeared to be in need of maintenance — water was running directly down the trail instead of being diverted off with water bars. Parkway management is aware of the issues, said spokeswoman Leesa Brandon. The lack of upkeep at Craggy Gardens Picnic Area appears to be another victim of the park’s notorious half-billion-dollar maintenance backlog. MORE : Parkway, Smokies add to economy but lack funding One of the damaged concrete picnic tables at the Craggy Gardens picnic area. (Photo: Matt Burkhartt/mburkhartt@citize) According to national park conservation groups, the price tag for unmet maintenance needs across national parks has reached crisis proportions. The maintenance backlog across 417 national parks has reached $11.6 billion, according to the National Park Service. The Blue Ridge Parkway, which is the most visited unit in the park service, with 16.1 million visitors in 2017, also has one of the highest maintenance backlogs in the system at $462 million. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park has a backlog of $215 million. Most of the deferred maintenance at both parks lies in roadwork repairs. But both parks, built in the 1930s, are seeing the fallout from a stagnant budget over the past decade in historic buildings, campgrounds and picnic areas. RELATED : Clingmans Dome Tower in the Great Smokies closes for repairs Last Slide Next Slide Craggy Gardens, at Milepost 367, is about 20 miles northeast of Asheville. It has 86 tables, mostly made of concrete, with some concrete and some wooden benches. It was built in the 1940s, Brandon said. Time, harsh weather and lack of funding for upkeep are all taking their toll, she said. There are 14 picnic areas strategically placed along the 469 miles of the parkway, from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, to Cherokee at the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Craggy and Mount Pisgah are about equidistant from Asheville, allowing people to take advantage of the park’s original design to “drive a while, stop a while,” Brandon said. “A lot of people over many generations have been picnicking on the parkway. Picnicking is the quintessential parkway experience. We know it’s a longstanding tradition. But some picnic areas are showing their age,” she said. Craggy Gardens, which includes a visitor center, hiking trails, a CCC built shelter and a trail to the 5,892-foot-high Craggy Pinnacle, is one of the most popular sections on the entire parkway. “Our maintenance staff has been in the typical catch-up mode, getting everything cleaned and opened for the season, and it’s been compounded by the heavy rainy season, which has diverted some of their activities to clean up and removal of trees down across the parkway,” Brandon said. Mowing along the parkway entrance on Hendersonville Road in South Asheville is also a casualty of a maintenance backlog and over-taxed staff. Brandon said maintenance crews go through the Craggy Gardens area daily to mow, make repairs and check on bathrooms. They are aware of the disrepair of picnic tables and have been in the process of removing those that are potentially hazardous. As for the moldy bathrooms, a problem at the Visitor Center and the picnic area, Brandon said, “when you have outdoor, wet, humid conditions, you’re likely to see some of that, but our crews are cleaning any mold they might find.” One of the damaged concrete picnic tables at the Craggy Gardens picnic area. (Photo: Matt Burkhartt/mburkhartt@citize) Brandon said the parkway relies on armies of volunteer partners, for funding and labor. The Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation has donated money for improvements at the Doughton Park Picnic Area in Virginia, as well as for trail upgrades and new interpretive signs at Craggy Gardens. The bulk of volunteer maintenance work falls to the nonprofit Friends of the Blue Ridge Parkway’s Asheville chapter. Co-chair Nancy Midgette, of Montreat, said the Friends group has a work day every other Tuesday in which volunteers fix tables and fire rings and clear trails and overgrown vegetation at the Mount Pisgah Campground, plant and maintain the flower gardens at the Parkway Headquarters and Visitor Center at Milepost 384, scrub graffiti off stone bridges and overlook signs, pick up litter, clear culverts of leaves and debris, and other back-breaking work. Each fall the group makes a work plan with the Park Service to address the highest priorities. Midgette said the Craggy Gardens Picnic Area is on the list for this year, but the intense nature of the project, and cost, has held it up. “The picnic tables are really old, and are made out of concrete, which is wonderful in one way, but in another way, it’s more challenging,” Midgette said. “Once they begin to break down, like concrete will do, you can’t just replace a plank. It requires actually utilizing a special type of concrete, forming a cast, it’s a big deal. We have to have authorization from the parkway and permission to move forward. We’re waiting to hear back.” The parkway is now undergoing a major “pavement preservation” project, chip-sealing about 65 miles from the Craggy Gardens area down to Cherokee. RELATED : Blue Ridge Parkway lanes to close in Asheville RELATED : Blue Ridge Parkway reopens at Linn Cove Viaduct Starting June 18 a contractor will begin paving between Milepost 393 at N.C. 191/Brevard Road and Milepost 413/U.S. 276 area, Brandon said. During the paving, there will be single lane closures, flaggers and traffic delays. Depending on weather, this work is expected last until mid- to late-July. “Obviously the road is a safety issue and it is their No. 1 priority and I completely understand that. I know they haven’t been able to move as fast as they’d like because of the storms,” Midgette said. “The problem (at Craggy) is clearly not lack of concern. They are fully aware of what needs to be done. But there is only so much you can do if your budget is continuously cut and you don’t have enough positions to get the work done. They have to make hard choices. What is the most important, and what can we not do without more resources?” Some national park watchdog groups are calling for passage of the bipartisan National Park Service Legacy Act, introduced last year by Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio). The legislation establishes a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund to reduce the maintenance backlog through revenues the government receives for oil and natural gas royalties not otherwise dedicated to other purposes. “It reflects badly on the National Park Service for what we call the richest country on Earth to have such glorious national parks, but to have them in such shoddy shape,” Herzog said. “I think it’s endemic of other infrastructure problems across the country on a whole. I’m not blaming any one political faction, but things seem to be falling apart. It doesn’t bode well for visitors. When President Obama visited (in 2010), where did he go? He went up on the parkway. A lot of people go up there. It should be a showcase of the region.” Want to help? The Asheville Chapter of the Friends of the Blue Ridge Parkway holds work days every other Tuesday at the Mount Pisgah Campground and other areas of the parkway in Asheville.

"Asheville Citizen Times, Karen Chávez, Asheville Citizen Times","A pair of hikers make their way up to the Craggy Pinnacle at Craggy Gardens on the Blue Ridge Parkway on Thursday, June 15, 2017. (Photo: Angeli Wright/awright@citizen-ti) ASHEVILLE, N.C. — The entire 469-mile Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia and all of its facilities, visitor centers and campgrounds, except for the Pisgah Inn, were closed as of 8 p.m. EDT Friday in anticipation of high winds and heavy rains due to the remnants of Hurricane Florence, according to the National Park Service. The U.S. Forest Service has already closed all of its recreation sites and campgrounds and most roads in the Pisgah and Nantahala national forests in western North Carolina, and portions of the Appalachian Trail that run through these areas are closed. All seasonal gates will be closed to ensure no one has the opportunity to get trapped behind gates. Saturated soils in combination with high winds in these areas increase the risk of rock slides, falling trees and debris on the parkway. This closure will remain in effect until further notice, the park service said. More: Florence downgraded to tropical storm, but winds, rain still punishing Carolinas More: Hurricane Florence: Airline flight cancellations soar past 2,300 Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm Friday, but it still packed maximum sustained winds of up to 70 mph as it slowly moved inland from the Carolina coast, bringing with it the potential for torrential rain. The parkway is the most visited site in the National Park Service, with 16.1 million visitors last year. Traffic starts to pick up at this time of year as fall leaves start to turn color, especially at the higher elevations surrounding Asheville. Access to the Pisgah Inn, at Milepost 408, about 20 miles southwest of Asheville, will be via U.S. 276 only. There will be no access via the parkway from the north. ""The Pisgah Inn had reservations through the weekend, and since they have some access via U.S. 276, they want to be able to honor those commitments,"" said Leesa Brandon, parkway spokeswoman. ""I would expect if something drastically changes over the weekend, we’ll work with them to make any changes to the plan."" During this closure, all scheduled ranger programs and special events and uses are canceled. A view of the Blue Ridge Parkway from Waterrock Knob. The public is invited to an open house on planning for the future of the new recreation area. (Photo: Courtesy of Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation) During the closure order, these sections of parkway are closed to all use, including bicycling and hiking. Attempts to route around gates and barriers are prohibited. ""We’re going to see what the storm brings through the weekend and first of week and make decisions to reopen in the interest of the public and staff safety as well as parkway resources,"" Brandon said. Updates and information regarding the status of park facilities, including the road itself, will be available on the Parkway’s Real Time Road Map, the parkway’s website, and its Twitter and Facebook pages. Visitors and neighbors are encouraged to check these sites regularly for information and before heading out to the parkway. Great Smoky Mountains National Park officials are closing some facilities due to the potential for downed trees, flooding, and landslides as the rain and winds from Florence hit the park on the North Carolina-Tennessee border.

Erin Laviola,"National Park Service Mitzie Sue ""Susan"" Clements. Mitzie Sue “Susan” Clements of Ohio has been missing since Tuesday, September 25. The 53-year-old woman disappeared while hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park with her daughter. Here’s what you need to know. 1. Clements Vanished After She and Her Daughter Became Separated During a Hike Mitzie Sue “Susan” Clements was hiking with her daughter on Tuesday, September 25, in the Clingmans Dome area of the Great Smoky Mountains. Park officials say the two were hiking the Forney Ridge Trail near Andrew Bald Mountain. The national park is on the border between between North Carolina and Tennessee. Clements’ daughter told officials that she walked ahead of her mother during their hike. They were not separated for very long. When she turned around to find her mother, Clements was gone. She disappeared around 5 p.m. that day. According to the National Parks, Clements was last seen wearing a green zip-up sweater, lightweight black pants over black leggings, a clear rain poncho and white tennis shoes. 2. A Massive Search Has Not Yet Revealed Any Clues About Where Clements Could Have Gone Park officials immediately began searching for Susan Clements, near the area where she was last seen. After finding no clues, they widened the search. National Parks Service spokesperson Julena Campbell told WATE-TV that experienced hikers have even camped overnight on the Appalachian Trail, in order to maximize their chances of locating Clements. By Sunday, September 30, the search had grown to include about 125 people from more than two dozen agencies across Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. Campbell said the teams were using helicopters and drones as well as K-9 units. Clingmans Dome Road was also shut down to the public, to make room for search teams. The parking area was transformed into an “incident command post” as the search continues. 3. A Portable Cell Tower From Verizon is Being Used to Assist in the Search National Parks Service The National Parks Service made Clingmans Dome Road the base of operations as they search for Mitzie Sue “Susan” Clements. The area where Susan Clements vanished is described as a remote location with rugged terrain. Cellphone service can be difficult to come by. The National Parks Service has received some help from Verizon on this front. The company set up a portable cell tower. In a news release, officials said the cell booster is “providing the critical cell and data coverage needed to effectively manage and support the search effort in this remote location.” Clingmans Dome Road is temporarily closed for search operations. — Smokies Road Info (@SmokiesRoadsNPS) September 28, 2018 The parks service added that the team is also taking advantage of Clingmans Dome Road by turning it into a landing strip for helicopters involved in the search. 4. Susan Clements is From Cleves, Ohio, Near Cincinnati National Park Service Mitzie Sue “Susan” Clements. Mitzie Sue ‘Susan’ Clements is from Cleves, Ohio. It is a small village located about 16 miles northwest of Cincinnati. According to news outlet WCPO-TV, Clements works for the city of Cincinnati.

He and several of his coworkers have traveled to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to assist in the search. 5. Well-Wishers Have Flooded Social Media &amp; Some Have Speculated About Whether Clements Could Have Been Abducted Mitzie Sue “Susan” Clements Susan Clements was last seen on Tuesday, September 25, and the search has been gaining national attention as it stretches into a second week. The National Park Services’ facebook posts about the case have been shared thousands of times. Well-wishes and prayers have dominated the comments sections on social media; there was also speculation about whether Clements could have been abducted. However, officials have not addressed whether they are exploring that particular option. Some of the comments include: Kimberly Marie Wyatt: “Following and anxiously awaiting an update. The abduction possibility also has crossed my mind. This day and time, its not safe for anyone to hike alone, especially females.” Lisa Schutte Koester wrote: “Prayers for her family!!! But geez, what woman would hike alone, jog alone, do anything alone these days???? Unfortunately, women have become targets for the depraved, sick men who feel that a woman’s life has no value.” Dallas Abbott Avery: “Praying SO hard for her safe return and a happy ending, but am I the only one thinking its not likely at this point? I mean, I dont want to be a negative nelly, but its been SO long and sounds like Mother Nature hasnt been very nice. I just pray that she got to a safe place with food, water, and shelter, but NO communication.

WATE Staff,"SEVIER CO., Tenn. ( WATE ) -- Search crews located the body of missing Ohio hiker Susan Clements, 53, on Monday. Great Smoky Mountains National Park officials are now shedding new light on her death. Investigators said her body was found off-trail in a rugged, heavily-wooded area of the Huggins Creek drainage -- approximately two miles from Clingmans Dome parking area and nearly a mile south of the Appalachian Trail. The cause of death is under investigation. Foul play is not suspected at this time. “Our deepest condolences go out to the family, friends and co-workers of Susan during this difficult time,” said Park Superintendent Cassius Cash. “We are grieving with the family and hope that yesterday’s recovery helps provide some closure as they begin their own grieving process.” He added, “I am inspired by and extremely grateful for the tireless work of our park staff, as well as the generous assistance provided by dozens of agencies and well-trained search and rescue organizations.” Officials with GSMNP said the last time anyone saw Clements was last Tuesday in the Clingmans Dome area of the park. She was hiking with her daughter, who said the two were separated. ""Over the last couple of days, we've concentrated both on trails in this area, as well as starting to work off-trail and into some of the drainage that comes down from this mountain ridge,"" Park Spokesperson Julena Campbell said last week. ""Right now, we're really focusing on the off-trail areas since we have now kind of cleared and walked through most of the trails and haven't found her."" The rocky terrain and dense vegetation made this search particularly difficult. ""It takes a lot of people and a lot of time to just comb through that landscape to make sure that we don't find her or a clue,"" Campbell said. Several search crews were part of the effort, including dog teams, helicopters and drones. ""We're working at least 12, if not 16, hour days and we'll continue doing that as long as we need to,"" Campbell said. More than 45 agencies and volunteer search and rescue groups participated in the search for Clements. The park estimated 175 personnel helped in the search.","WKBN.com Body of missing Ohio hiker found in Great Smoky Mountains National Park WKBN.com SEVIER CO., Tenn.

WVLT News,"GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, Tenn. (WVLT) -- Rangers said foul play was not suspected in the death of a missing hiker who's body was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Tuesday, October 2. Crews discovered Susan Clements roughly two miles west of the Clingmans Dome parking area, according to a release. The seven day search ended when crews found the 53-year-old mother from Ohio 3/4 mile from the Appalachian Trail. Park officials announced the cause of death is under investigation, however foul play is not suspected at this time. ""Our hearts are with the family and friends of Ms. Clements,"" the park said in a release. ""The Park would like to extend our appreciation to the many agencies and organizations that participated in the search effort."" Clement's ex-husband and father of her children, Tim Clements, said, I want to specifically thank the National Park Service for their incredible efforts. The cooperation shown between more than 50 agencies was amazing, comforting, and very supportive. Every piece of the operation, including the scientific fronts, logistical parts, and the emotional support provided to us was very impressive. The children, her sisters, and I want to especially thank Jared St. Clair (Chief Ranger), Joe Pond (Incident Commander), James Latendresse (Operations Chief), and Florie Takaki (Family Liaison) for their dedication and support. We also want to thank the countless other people who helped look for Susan. This includes the ground searchers, pilots, drone operators, dog trackers, technicians, EMS providers, the many teams of tactical climbers and rescuers, and the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The kids, her sisters, and I greatly appreciate the intense work they performed for us, and we will be eternally grateful. Hours before crews found her body Tuesday, helicopters searched briefly in the morning while other teams focused on off trail areas and used dogs in hopes of finding Clements, who had been hiking with her daughter on the Forney Ridge Trail, near Andrews Bald, when the two separated. Park officials said the two purposefully separated with a plan to meet back at the Clingmans Dome parking lot. According to rangers, the daughter was hiking ahead and moving faster, which is why the two decided to separate. In the days following her disappearance, trained personnel from cooperating agencies in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia helped park staff in the large-scale search effort. Around 125 trained searchers and logistical support personnel from more than 30 state and local agencies and search and rescue organizations participated. Specialized search and rescue drones, operated by FAA-licensed pilots were used in some areas to help search for Clements. By closing the seven-mile Clingmans Dome Road on Thursday night, the park transformed the Clingmans Dome parking area into a field incident command post from which to manage the complex search. Infrastructure such as tents and self-contained mobile command buses served as portable offices for search personnel and provided a place for searchers to escape the elements, refuel, and receive instructions before heading back out to continue the search for Clements. Rangers even brought in a mobile cell tower from Verizon Wireless to provide wireless service to assist in search efforts. The SPOT (Satellite Pico Cell on a Trailer) featured a 30-foot antenna mast with the satellite dish on top of the trailer, which included a portable mini-satellite dish to provide additional wireless service for first responders who searched remote areas where reception could be spotty. Park officials were alerted that Clements was missing on Tuesday, September 25, and began searching the immediate area with no success.","WVLT.TV NPS: No foul play in death of missing hiker WVLT.TV GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, Tenn.

PRI's The World,"From a distance, the hemlock trees by the Wappinger Creek in Millbrook, New York, look just fine. But forest ecologist Gary Lovett knows better. He pulls back the twigs and exposes some tiny, white fluffy balls. ""These are the protective coating that's created over the top of the hemlock woolly adelgid, a tiny aphid-like insect,"" said Lovett. ""They're very tiny, so one of them won't bother the tree. But when we have millions and millions of them on a tree, it eventually kills the tree,"" explained Lovett, who is with the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, about a two-hour drive north of New York City. University of Georgia forest entomologist Tom Coleman examines a branch of hemlock infested with woolly adelgid. John Bazemore/AP Photo The hemlock woolly adelgid, native to East Asia, is slowly killing trees from Maine to Georgia. It's among the latest in a line of invasive pests slipping into the US. All it takes are a few bad pallets. So, Lovett argues for ditching wood pallets and replacing them with other materials, like recycled plastic or composite wood materials such as plywood or oriented strand board. One problem: those alternatives cost more. But according to some studies, invasive pests are costing the US economy close to $5 billion a year. Trees don't just die in forests, they die in cities and our yards.

Consider the nearby city of Poughkeepsie, New York, which has a problem with the emerald ash borer, another invasive pest native to Asia, infecting its ash trees. Hemlock woolly adelgids on hemlock tree needles are seen through a microscope at a lab in Petersham, Mass. Elise Amendola/AP Photo Poughkeepsie city administrator Mark Nelson brought up a computer map with about 300 dots, color-coded ash trees owned by the city. Red and yellow dots mean the emerald ash borer has found a new host. ""I think it's safe to say that of the city-owned trees, 90 percent are infected,"" said Nelson. The city has to pay to take the trees down, or eventually, they'll die and fall. (You could imagine the horror story lawsuits were that to happen.) So the city recently took down 50 ash trees. The cost: $82,000. That might not sound like much, but for a small city with a big deficit, Nelson said, it's a lot. Trees also improve property values and air quality and provide shade. They matter a lot to a city. Multiply Poughkeepsie's problem across thousands of communities like it.

And the answer is clearly no,"" Nelson said. Tom Remaley, left, forester with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Service, and supervisory forester Kristine Johnson, release a Laricobious nibrinus to a branch of a hemlock tree Thursday, March 23, 2006, in Cosby, Tenn. The tiny predator beetle eats the hemlock woolly adelgid and will help in the fight against the destruction of the hemlock. Wade Payne/AP Photo By the time a pest is already here, ""it's kind of too late,"" said Keri VanCamp who manages nearby Vassar College's 500-acre Farm &amp; Ecological Preserve. ""We dump a lot of resources into trying to control things that should've been prevented in the first place."" The Preserve has many dying ash trees and VanCamp is experimenting with breeding more pest-resistant trees, as well as biocontrols like importing a wasp native to Asia. ""It's a stingless wasp so you don't have to worry. It lays its egg inside the emerald ash borer egg and the larva of the wasp essentially eats the inside of the eggs,"" said VanCamp. Amazing. A couple of problems though. The wasp is only partly effective. And releasing foreign wasps on a large scale would also be too expensive, and that could potentially introduce new problems. Read more: A dangerous parasitic illness spread by bugs that bite people's faces at night is spreading in the US, doctors warn So eventually, many of the ash trees in the eastern US will die and new species will take their place. VanCamp said there's nothing wrong with change. Plant and tree species have always migrated and humans have helped with that, intentionally or not. Today, however, we're moving things at an alarming rate. ""Someone described it to me once as like a snow globe, all the species are the little flakes,"" VanCamp said. ""Humans have most recently just shaken it up and all that snow is flying and species are landing all over the place. It's creating these kinds of interactions that we don't know what the response is going to be."" And the whole ecosystem here — the animals, the birds, the fish, the soil — is built around native trees. When a ""foundation species"" tree like hemlocks disappear, everything about the forest changes. Back by the stream in Millbrook, Gary Lovett said the only way to protect our forests and urban canopies is for politicians to get tough, to prevent pests from arriving here in the first place. ""I'm not much of a politician, but this is a situation where we're getting a raw deal on trade,"" Lovett said. He said not only are some of our trading partners tipping the balance of trade in goods bought and sold, ""but they're also sending us nasty bugs along with it.""","John Bazemore/AP Photo The hemlock woolly adelgid, native to East Asia, is slowly killing trees from Maine to Georgia.

Kyla Mandel,"Three people have died while visiting national parks since the government shutdown began.
The deaths include a 14-year-old girl at Glen Canyon Recreation Area in Arizona on December 24; a man who died on Christmas day at Yosemite National Park in California; and a woman who died two days later at Great Smoky Mountains National Park along the border of North Carolina and Tennessee.
During past government shutdowns the public was barred from accessing many of the country’s national parks. This time, the Trump administration decided to leave the parks open, but largely unstaffed. That has meant radically reduced or suspended maintenance, cleaning, and emergency services.
According to National Park Service spokesman Jeremy Barnum, an average of six people die each week in the park system. This includes accidents such as drownings, falls, and motor vehicle crashes.
While deaths do occur, and the parks system is vast, drastically reducing the number of staff to nearly 3,300 out of a 19,000-person workforce means there is little help or oversight available to visitors during the shutdown.
In a statement to ThinkProgress on Saturday, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee tasked with overseeing the Interior Department (under which the National Park Service falls), noted that while it’s unclear whether these deaths were otherwise preventable, they highlight the importance of public safety.
“Any National Park Service unit where a staffing or funding shortfall has endangered public safety or put natural, cultural, or historic resources at risk should be closed for the duration of this shutdown,” Grijalva said.
He continued, “Volunteer and state-level efforts are admirable but shouldn’t be relied on as a replacement for normal federal operations. The Trump administration has forced a government shutdown and is trying to avoid its devastating impacts by pretending nothing is wrong. You can’t have it both ways.”
In Arizona, the 14-year-old girl fell to her death on Christmas eve after “racing from the lot where her parents had parked to see the Horseshoe Bend Overlook, a dramatic cliff that looks out to a peninsula of jagged rock,” the Washington Post reported.
Her parents reported her missing at 5 p.m. after a long search. Emergency responders then found her near the cliff “just before dark,” according to The Post, which meant authorities could only retrieve her body in the morning.
The following day at Yosemite, rangers responded to an emergency call at the park — a man, who remains unidentified, had died from a head wound, apparently the result of a fall.
That incident went unreported until January 4 due to the shutdown. And his death remains under investigation according to Andrew Muñoz, acting chief of public and congressional affairs for the Park Service region. The shutdown will likely hamper the speed of the investigation.
According to a ranger speaking with Outside Magazine, only 50 employees were working at Yosemite during the shutdown at the time of the man’s death. Typically, the National Park Service employs roughly 800 workers during the winter season in Yosemite.
Then, on December 27, 42-year-old Laila Jiwani died after a tree fell on Porter Creek Trail in the Smoky Mountains. A Park Service spokesman told The Post that one of Jiwani’s two children, a 6-year-old, was flown to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump had not yet acknowledged the deaths; his tweets continued to blame the Democrats for the shutdown.
At time of publishing the White House had not replied to a request for comment from ThinkProgress regarding the deadly accidents in the national parks.
“This is the first time in a long-term shutdown where the parks have remained open,” Yosemite Conservancy CEO Frank Dean told the Post. Dean previously  served as a park ranger and assistant to the superintendent in Yosemite as well as a superintendent for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
“What we’re finding now is it’s not really working, because you’ve got understaffing. As this thing drags on, you’ve got free access and no guidance.”
Despite the federal government shutdown there’s at least one site that remains staffed with National Park Service rangers: an historic clock tower at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.",Three people have died while visiting national parks since the government shutdown began.

ugc,"Fifty-two years after construction first began, the last section of the Foothills Parkway at Great Smoky Mountains National Park was finally completed. Commonly referred to as the Missing Link, the 1.65-mile section of the highway now connects both pedestrians and drivers between Walland and Wears Valley in Tennessee.
With breathtaking views of Americas cherished Smoky Mountains, the Foothills Parkway now consists of two finished sections at either end of the 72-mile corridor, states the National Park Service (NPS). The western section now extends 33 continuous miles from Chilhowee to Wears Valley, offering a new recreational experience for motorists and cyclists. The eastern section of the parkway, which offers views of Mt. Cammerer, was finished in 1968.  Cost for the highway totaled $178 million.
According to the NPS website, the Foothills Parkway was authorized by Congress as a scenic parkway in 1944 and divided into 8 sections. However, it remained one of the only parkways in the US (and the oldest) to remain unfinished. The NPS cited challenging terrain and funding starts and stops to the highways previously incomplete status. Now, the public can finally enjoy new additions to the parkway, including access to 9 bridges. 
The federally-owned Great Smoky Mountains Park contains 800-square-miles of wilderness and an impressive array of wildlife, including black bears, hundreds of species of birds, and elk. In Tennessee, visitors are also able to take a gander at 80 preserved log cabins and historic sites left over from Scotch-Irish immigrants in the early 19th century. It is Americas most visited national park with over 9 million visitors every year. 
We are grateful to the visionaries in the 1930s who conceived the idea of a parkway and to the countless people who have tirelessly worked since then to complete this spectacular section, said Superintendent Cassius Cash in a release issued on October 25, 2018.

WKRN Web Staff,"GSMNP, Tenn. (WKRN/WATE) - After 35 days of government shutdown uncertainty, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is back open.
""We're back. We're so happy to be back at work here in the national park again,"" said Lisa Nagurny, Great Smoky Mountains National Park ranger.
A re-opened government is bringing renewed seven-day coverage and a full staff back to the Smokies. 
""Trails are open. Currently, roads are open, weather permitting. We have our visitor's centers open, restrooms are open, trashcans are being picked up again as well. So, we are back to normal as far as park operations go,"" Nagurny said.
That means the people visiting this weekend are able to take in the sites and get the full Smokies experience. 
""It's beautiful and I'm just glad that I get to see it,"" said visitor T.J. Shaw.
""I love their view and I love their colors and all that stuff,"" said visitor Rori Gann.
During the partial government shutdown, the park's nonprofit partners temporarily funded some services and volunteers stepped up to help keep the park clean.
Nagurny said, ""The outpouring of support from the community has really been great for this last month.""
The park-goers we spoke to were also thankful that a resolution, even if it's temporary, finally arrived.

"Opinion contributor, Carrie Scherpelz, Opinion contributor","Firefighters near Clearlake Oaks, Calif. (Photo: Noah Berger, AFP/Getty Images) Our long-awaited trip to the Canadian Rockies this summer exceeded our expectations, but a lifetime in America's Midwest had not prepared us for the far-reaching effects of wildfires in the West. Driving north from Spokane, Washington, we first noticed the low visibility and haze in the air. More than 500 wildfires were burning in British Columbia, but so far the Canadian National Parks remained open — unlike Yosemite National Park, parts of which were closed indefinitely due to fire. Lake Louise was a must-see, we had heard. Although the surrounding mountains were mere silhouettes fading into a blue haze, our hike to the Plain of Six Glaciers Tea House was stunning. The next day lightning struck nearby, the winds shifted, and smoke from a new fire turned sunshine to twilight. Even the silhouettes of mountains disappeared, ash rained down on us, and deteriorating air quality made it impossible to stay outdoors. More: Inmates who volunteer to fight California's largest fires denied access to jobs on release If Democrats embrace socialism to get away from Donald Trump, they can kiss the midterms goodbye I came to the US because of chain migration. Is there a problem with that? As tourists, we had options that local residents didn’t have. Based on regional air quality alerts, we drove north to Jasper two days ahead of schedule — a good move because the spectacular snowy peaks along the Icefields Parkway were clearly visible. Colors sparkled. For five days, we enjoyed beautiful views and breathable air, conditions perfect for sightseeing, hiking and mountain biking. Then smoke rolled in once again. Frustrated, we asked National Park rangers, “What direction is the wind blowing fires? Where can we go now?” Convinced that Jasper would stay smoky for days, we canceled our planned but no-longer-scenic gondola ride and fled south back to Spokane a day early, taking a new route because our original route was closed by fire. By the time we reached home, after several days traveling in triple-digit heat, the west end of Glacier National Park was closed. Fires, storms and floods — the new normal All over the world, man-made climate change has helped increase the frequency and intensity of forest fires. Already, many people have been driven from their homes by climate-fueled fires, storms and floods. Thanks to our smoke-filled vacation, we soberly considered the long-term consequences that many people face because we are polluting our atmosphere with carbon emissions. In a sense, my husband and I became climate migrants packing and repacking our suitcases, moving from place to place, leaving a trail of canceled accommodations and scheduled gondola rides. For tourists like us, the fires were a minor inconvenience. For residents who depend on park tourism in Canada and the United States, wildfires are a constant threat to their lives, not just their livelihood. Many locals keep their bags packed, ready to flee a fire, but they can’t avoid another hazard — prolonged smoke exposure. Hundreds of thousands of people living in and around fire-prone areas are stuck with a new normal. Now the smoke season lasts for months rather than days, over a wider area, with serious health effects. The truth is that while you and I may be able to ignore climate change, many people are suffering right now from the consequences of a warming world. People have lost or left their homes in desperation — have even left their countries — as storms and droughts worsen. An average of 21.7 million people per year have been displaced by catastrophic weather disasters since 2008, and some experts say the number will keep growing. “In our rapidly changing world, climate change — and its potential to trigger both violent conflict and mass migration — needs to be considered as an urgent priority for policymakers and business leaders alike,” according to Environmental Justice Foundation Executive Director Steve Trent. A new Yale survey found that 51 percent of Americans say global warming is already harming people, and 70 percent worry that it will harm future generations. Why are we failing to address a crisis that scientists have warned us about for more than 50 years ? Maybe if we stand in the shoes of a climate migrant, we will realize that someday we might wear those shoes. Climate change knows no borders Even if we are not suffering ourselves, our actions likely cause others to suffer. Fossil fuel emissions harm people worldwide, because our shared atmosphere observes no borders. Ultimately, parts of our common home will become unlivable. Every nation must stop burning carbon-based fuels and focus on clean energy, efficiency and conservation — and soon. The steps we have taken to address this crisis are not enough. Congress could put a revenue-neutral fee on carbon emissions. With a financial incentive to reduce emissions, the free market will invest in technologies to build a clean and safe world for families everywhere. After our vacation, climate-fueled disasters followed us back home. Winds carried the smoke plumes from Canadian fires — now visible from a NASA satellite 1 million miles away — as far as our home state, Wisconsin. Days after our homecoming, torrential rainfall in our area caused widespread flooding, closing highways and washing out bridges. The deluge broke an all-time state record for rainfall with reports of between 12 and 15 inches. Three communities were submerged, Red Cross shelters opened, and a large rescue effort evacuated people to higher ground. Now we have climate refugees here in Madison. It’s both foolish and immoral to ignore our role in destabilizing the climate. Will we decide to save ourselves — and our neighbors, near and far?

Mark Hand,"Surface coal mining, including mountaintop removal mining, was responsible for the clearing of more than 7 percent of the land in central Appalachia — or an area about three times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park — from the mid-1970s through 2015, according to new research. A total of almost 2,300 square miles of land in central Appalachia was cleared by surface mining during this period. Mountaintop removal, the most controversial type of surface mining, relies on cutting off the peaks of mountains to access the mineral below. For decades, environmental activists have been pushing for a ban on mountaintop removal coal mining. The mining practice takes place primarily in eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. Supporters of mountaintop removal mining contend the process allows mining companies to extract shallow seams of coal they could not access through traditional underground mining. But a growing body of scientific evidence shows the practice destroys forests, fills the air with harmful dust, and contaminates nearby streams. By merging U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite imagery and the Google Earth Engine, a team of researchers created a study and dataset that shows the effects of mountaintop removal on a year-by-year basis. The researchers also used an earlier collection data, covering the mid-1970s through 1984, to come up with the 40-year total. The study was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE by researchers from SkyTruth, Duke University and Appalachian Voices. The researchers said they plan to update the data on an annual basis. The researchers estimate that between 1985 and 2015, an average of 21,000 acres was converted to bare earth and rubble in central Appalachia each year — an area about half the size of Washington, D.C. “It’s important for policymakers, scientists and the public to see and understand the full scope of landscape disruption that Appalachia is burdened with as a consequence of our persistent economic dependence on coal mining,” Christian Thomas, a geospatial analyst with SkyTruth, said Wednesday in a statement. The nonprofit SkyTruth use satellite imagery and geospatial data to create visuals and resources to inform environmental advocates, policymakers, the media, and the public. The group created a timeline of active mining for any location in central Appalachia or time period between 1985 and 2015. Reliable, up-to-date estimates of the mining industry’s footprint have been hard to find. In any given year, a mining company may be operating only within a small portion of the area shown on their mining permit. The tool developed by Duke researchers, working with SkyTruth and Appalachian Voices, reveals where mountaintop mining is underway on a finer time scale, and makes it easier to keep the data current. The study’s researchers are hoping their findings help other experts better understand the environmental and human health impacts of mountaintop coal mining. Last year, the Trump administration ordered government researchers to stop work on an independent evaluation of potential health effects from mountaintop removal coal mining. During the last year of the Obama administration, the Department of the Interior’s Office of Surface Mining commissioned research into the possible connections between certain health risks and living near current or former surface mining sites in Appalachia. But last August, the Office of Surface Mining sent a letter to the National Academy of Sciences, which it had contracted to do the independent review, asking it to stop its work immediately on the $1 million contract. The Trump administration said the suspension of the research was to give it time to determine whether the research was a responsible use of taxpayer money. Despite the Trump administration’s impeding efforts to study the impacts of mountaintop removal, Andrew Pericak, a research analyst at Duke University who worked on the study, believes the new data in the study will inform independent scientific research and provide a better understanding of the environmental and human health impacts of mountaintop coal mining. “Researchers will be able to align historic data on water quality or species distribution, for instance, with this new understanding of exactly when and where mining occurred,” Pericak said in a statement. Coal producers have not seen the same kind of progress in reducing their environmental footprint as the oil and gas sector. Oil and gas companies are now able to drill multiple wells on a single well pad, which reduces the land impact. They also can drill horizontal wells that can stretch up to two miles underground, decreasing the number of wells needed to produce the same amount of oil. Coal producers are seeing opposite results. In the 1980s, 10 square meters, or about 110 square feet, of land was disturbed per metric ton (2,200 pounds) of coal produced. By 2015, 30 square meters, or about 330 square feet, was disturbed to produce the same amount of coal, a threefold increase, according to the study. Source: Appalachian Voices The research team processed more than 10,000 individual Landsat satellite images. The team was able to identify areas with an absence of forest cover in contrast to surrounding, forested areas on a yearly basis. After excluding known roads, bodies of water, and cities, the team labeled any remaining deforested areas as likely surface mines. They were able to validate the findings by manually spot-checking the results against aerial survey photography and other imagery. Emily Bernhardt, one of the study’s co-authors, is a professor in the biology department at Duke University and is using the data to understand more precisely how mountaintop mining affects water quality, how far the effects extend downstream, and how long they persist. In a statement Wednesday he said, “Any scientist interested in studying the impacts of mountaintop mining can now see exactly where mines are in the landscape and how long those impacts have been active.”","Surface coal mining, including mountaintop removal mining, was responsible for the clearing of more than 7 percent of the land in central Appalachia — or an area about three times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park — from the mid-1970s throug…",2018-07-26T15:48:07Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thinkprogress.org'}",Researchers reveal scope of damage to Appalachia from mountaintop removal coal mining,https://thinkprogress.org/researchers-reveal-scope-of-damage-to-appalachia-from-mountaintop-removal-coal-mining-63642d5001bb/,https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Mountaintop-removal-Appalachia.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1,,Thinkprogress.org,Smoky Mountains,0

While there were signs that some government machinery was grinding back to life after a record 35 days without funding, many federal workers and their families approached the end of the shutdown cautiously, saying they were relieved they would receive paychecks again, but would continue to restrict their spending amid fears that another shutdown could happen in weeks.
""You can only be so happy because you just have to know that it could happen again,"" said Rachel Malcom, whose husband serves in the Coast Guard in Rhode Island. ""We're going to be playing catch up, so I don't want to overspend.""
President Donald Trump signed a short-term deal Friday to end the partial government shutdown, which caused 800,000 federal employees to miss two paychecks. The administration asked department heads to reopen offices in a ""prompt and orderly manner.""
Many government agencies still had notices on their websites Saturday saying they were not fully operating due to the lack of appropriations. Calls to several agencies also went unanswered, with voicemails saying the offices were closed due to the shutdown. But many parks — from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Minnesota — were glad to open their doors to weekend visitors.
John Anfinson, superintendent of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, said it felt great to tell his employees to open the Mississippi River Visitor's Center. He texted his manager and said ""Roll up the gate!""
""They were just waiting for the green light,"" he said. Park ranger Sharon Stiteler posted a video to Twitter that showed the center's gates opening with the word: ""Weeeee!""
The visitor's center, located in the lobby of the Science Museum of Minnesota, saw 180 visitors in its first hour of operation, Anfinson said, and when he stopped by, the employees had ""big smiles on their faces.""
The National Park Service said it was working on reopening all of its parks as quickly as possible, but some parks may not open immediately depending on their staff size and complexity. The Virgin Islands National Park, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the Wright Brothers National Memorial and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were among the parks that reopened Saturday.
And Yellowstone National Park officials said visitor centers would reopen there by Sunday afternoon, with the majority of staff returning Monday to begin working on a backlog of permit requests, including from those seeking to do research in the park.
Mike Litterst, chief spokesman for the National Park Service, said the nation's more than 400 parks are reopening on a rolling schedule. Some of the parks that were partially open and accessible during the shutdown are expected to get back to full operations more quickly.
""We're certainly grateful that all of our dedicated rangers and park service staff are back at work,"" Litterst said.
In the New York area, airport operations were returning to normal, just a day after LaGuardia Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport both experienced at least 90-minute delays in takeoffs because of the shutdown — which caused a ripple effect throughout the system. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration reported that flights at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport were landing and taking off Saturday morning with 15-minute delays. There were no other major delays nationwide, according to the FAA's website, which tracks flight delays.
Some parts of the government were taking a little more time to open up.
The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo in Washington planned to reopen to the public on Tuesday. Spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said until then, employees will check all audio-visual and interactive exhibits to make sure everything is working properly and curators will make a final check of the exhibits. Cafeterias will also be restocked and food shipments will resume, but full food service might not be immediately available.
Nigel Fields, superintendent of Virgin Islands National Park, said donations kept the park mostly open during its busy tourist season. But, he said, there is some anxiety about another closure. The park covers about 60 percent of the island of St. John, which was hit by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The shutdown affected the park service's ability to continue rebuilding, strengthening the coral reef and restoring native vegetation after the storms.
For families of workers, the government's reopening came with a mix of relief and fear. While those who were furloughed or required to work without pay will receive back pay, it's unclear when that will happen.
Crystal Simmons, whose husband serves in the Coast Guard in Connecticut, said it will likely take some time to process back pay, and then employees could be in the same situation again if another shutdown happens.
""I don't think I can really relax and go back to the way things were,"" she said.","'Weeeee!'

Jake Rheude,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Despite our society’s continuing move into cloud and virtual technologies, we remain bound by the physical world -- and choosing the right location for your business is a crucial harbinger for how well it will perform over time. Should you head for the state with the best tax regulations, or set up shop by a port? Is staying closer to home an advantage? There is no right answer in this search, but there is a best answer for each particular business. Getting to that most ideal location requires you to think laterally and expansively, allowing logic, risk assessment and math to overtake mere instinct. I work at a third party fulfillment business focused on ecommerce customers, so the question of location is of critical importance in our industry. After setting out on a hunt four years ago, we found ourselves setting up shop in Knoxville, TN. It turned out to be one of the best business decisions we’ve ever made, and now we’re about to open a second location in Salt Lake City. Here are the six questions we used as our mapping metrics, which brought us to exactly where we needed to be: What is the shipping reach? If you’re a B2B or B2C ecommerce business, like all our clients, there is one major thing you will need to consider: the needs of your end consumer. You need to get your product to them as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. For us as a fulfillment center, this meant having a two-day shipping reach to a majority of the US population, because two days is the standard that Amazon has set. Related: 4 Ways Omni-Channel Retailers Can Step Up Their Shipping Game As the majority of the US population lives on the Eastern side of the country, Knoxville, emerged as a major contender. We studied population densities and travel arteries; Knoxville is a major freight corridor with the intersection of I-40 and I-275. This is why the automotive industry has planted many of its production facilities here and in nearby Kentucky and Northern Alabama. Of course, every company is going to have its own considerations. If 90 percent of your business is to hospitals in New York City that require next-day delivery, you’re going to want to be within a one-day delivery time from that city. How close are the ports? You might want to think twice before taking over that warehouse in Oakland, Miami or New Jersey. Being close to ports isn’t necessarily a good thing; in fact, it can be cost-prohibitive. Outbound shipping costs tend to be a lot higher, per piece, than inbound shipping costs, so you need to look at ways to minimize your total transportation costs. In our case, we wanted to be generally accessible from the ports, but at the same time located as closely as possible to end customers because that was going to have a greater impact on our overall cost structure. Perhaps you’re an ecommerce business owner who lives in Florida and your products are delivered to the port of Miami. It may seem like an obvious solution to have a fulfillment partner in Miami; that way you can have a bit more oversight into their operation. But land does not come cheap in Miami. In addition to the inflated warehousing costs your fulfillment partner will no doubt have to pass along to you, you’re also in one far corner of the country. If your customer base is nationwide, your business is going to be hit with several more expensive shipping costs per parcel, since your average shipping zone may end up being five or six. On top of this, the increased average distance from your customers means that the average ship time may breach four days, from order to delivery. All of a sudden, Miami seems less and less appealing. What is the workforce availability and quality? The success of any business ultimately lies in its people. You want workers who are smart, agile and productive; so education and work ethic are important drivers. In terms of availability, find out what the unemployment and turnover rate is in a given city. Related: How to Relocate Your Business Clearly, you don’t want a very high unemployment rate, but you also don’t want an incredibly low unemployment rate, because that’s indicative of competition for good labor, which will drive up the wages you’ll need to offer. Use resources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics to dive into the data in areas you’re considering, and talk to staffing firms about their experiences. What's the cost of living and quality of life? Who would have thought that Knoxville would be such an awesome city to live in ? With its campus of the University of Tennessee, its nearby Smoky Mountains, great restaurants and theaters and strong pool of smart humans, it was even named by TripAdvisor as one of the “Destinations on the Rise.” Recent data shows that cities in the South and Midwest have compellingly affordable costs, so delve into these stats. You want a location that good workers will want to live in, and where you’ll be happy spending your time, but you also want an affordable cost of living. Research the locations that appeal to you, and check out Bankrate’s Cost of Living Calculator to compare costs among cities. What’s the weather like? Does the area you’re considering have frequent hurricanes, tornadoes or blizzards? Locations that are subject to dramatic weather can have significantly higher insurance costs, and such events may cause major business disruptions for some industries. This was particularly true for our company, since we’re focused on logistics: We don’t want to be situated in a place that is going to be routinely shut down by snowstorms. We even went as far as digging into the seismic risk in particular areas. If a few locations are proving to be equal contenders, why not pick the one that has the lowest amount of risk when it comes to disruption to the overall business? What are the travel costs? How important is it that clients, partners or investors can get to you, quickly and easily? This was a big question for us as we were considering the location of our second facility in Salt Lake City. As it was a secondary location from our Tennessee base, we would be traveling in and out of the city a lot, so we needed a place that would be easy for clients and our team to travel to and from. Related: 25 Cities Worth Moving to If You Want to Launch a Business By researching these six questions, we were able to draw up a winning location based on reason, data, business costs and happiness factors. The first three we termed “marketability factors”; the second three were focused on the costs of doing business. By taking a data-driven approach to location planning, we think we’ll be able to set ourselves up for long-term success in any region we grow in.","'Location, location, location' is not just for judging retail space. Every company that can should evaluate where to establish itself by both soft and hard metrics.",2018-04-06T14:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",6 Key Questions to Get You Set Up Where You Want to Be,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/310798,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180403220158-GettyImages-894681206.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,Smoky Mountains,0
Jessica Puckett,"Great Smoky Mountain National Park has its first-ever woman as its chief ranger.
In April, Lisa Hendy will take the helm of the park, which spans Tennessee and North Carolina and is the most visited in the US.
Originally from Tennessee, she has previously worked at top parks across the nation, including Yosemite National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Arches National Park, Rocky Mountains National Park and is currently chief ranger at Big Bend National Park in Texas.

Growing up in Chattanooga, Tennesse, Hendy had some of her first outdoor experiences in the Smoky Mountains, where she backpacked as a kid.
I am looking forward to returning to my home state in the park that provided my first real outdoor adventures, Hendy said in a statement. It will be a pleasure to be involved in the efforts to protect a place that was so instrumental in defining my passions and ultimately my career.
Chief rangers are responsible for wildland fire operations, emergency medical services, search and rescue operations, backcountry operations, and staff the emergency communications center.
Lisa has demonstrated incredible leadership in managing law enforcement, fire, and search and rescue operations at some of the nations busiest parks,” said Superintendent Cassius Cash. Shes built strong programs by investing in local partnerships with neighboring agencies to help make areas safer for visitors and residents. She is going to be a great addition to the parks management team.

CH Contributor,"Driving Tennessee’s infamous Tail of the Dragon in the brand's newest sedan It’s the numbers that beckon: 318 turns on an uninterrupted 11-mile stretch of road called the Tail of the Dragon that starts at the Tennessee border with North Carolina. Officially designated US 129 in 1931, the route dates back centuries, created first by animals taking the path of least resistance through this section of the Great Smoky Mountains. Native Americans, British settlers and bandits widened the path into a two-lane road but never tamed it. It’s still dangerous. At Deals Gap (a border trading post that dates to the 18 th century and marks the beginning of the run) there is a “tree of shame” festooned with bits of vehicles that haven’t survived the journey. The Tail of the Dragon would make any driver a little twitchy, but the 2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI has a calming effect. As a compact four-door sports sedan, the car is ideally sized for roads where the average SUV or pickup truck would prove unwieldy and a ground-hugging supercar would likely bottom out on the many dips. The Jetta is no stranger to American byways—as the first version of the car dates to 1984—but the 2019 Jetta GLI (which starts at $25,995) has some new tricks up its sleeve. The 2.0 liter, turbocharged engine, borrowed from the very sporty Golf GTI, offers 228 horsepower (that’s 18 more than the previous model). At Deals Gap—where the elevation is 1,955 feet and the road runs mostly downhill until Parson’s Curve where there is a steep, twisty climb to Copperhead Corner—that extra power is welcome. The road is resplendent with colorfully named sections like The Little Whip, Brake or Bust Bend, and Revenuer’s Straight near the very end. The engine is managed by either a six-speed manual or seven-speed performance-oriented, dual-clutch automatic transmission. The bulked-up powertrain is reflected in the design cues that differentiate the GLI from a standard Jetta. These include a slightly lower front bumper, larger air intakes, a wider grille with a red accent stripe and lower side-skirts. Overall, the exterior of Jetta GLI is easy on the eyes, as is a black interior with sporty red stitching highlights. Instruments are easy to read and angled toward the very comfortable driver’s seat. There are a range of safety and driver assist features, the most helpful in this instance being the blind spot detector that alerts the driver about encroaching motorcyclists and bicyclists. Uphill or down, the Jetta GLI stays firmly planted on a road intending to make most vehicles do otherwise. That’s largely thanks to a MacPherson strut suspension mated to a multi-link independent rear suspension that is unique to the Jetta GLI. The Tail of the Dragon is a road that makes you think about a car’s technical abilities as well as your own: quick hands are rewarded with a smooth ride, but the car helps a lot. The Jetta GLI is very responsive through what can be a disorienting volume of turns. The task is made easier thanks to a power steering system (also unique to the Jetta) that makes the car very agile. Still, the Jetta GLI doesn’t take the driver out of the equation. If the Tail of the Dragon offers any lesson, it’s the value of being able to live solely in the moment, focused on the turn you’re in and the next one to come.

Cristine Russell,"DUNSMUIR, Calif.—It’s hard to hide the magnificent 14,180-foot volcanic mountain that towers over this tiny town in northernmost California, about 45 miles from the fire-ravaged city of Redding. But smoke traveling north from a trio of historic wildfires did just that, shrouding Mount Shasta and surrounding mountains in an eerie grey haze that forced folks indoors to avoid the acrid, unhealthy air. The destructive Carr, Hirz and Delta wildfires have collectively dragged on for 10 weeks, torching nearly 340,000 acres and threatening lives and livelihoods in heavily wooded Shasta, Trinity and Siskiyou counties. Firefighters expect to finally contain the last remnant of these long-lasting fires by the end of this week. Despite intensive global media coverage of the Northern California wildfires, it’s hard to capture the visceral feeling of being in a smoke-filled landscape where everyday life is disrupted. The human toll hit home for me recently when I attended a high school reunion here and experienced firsthand the physical and psychological discomfort of being in fire country: irritating smoke in my eyes, throat and lungs; the need to head indoors to reduce exposure; the visual disorientation when normal mountain vistas disappear in a smoky haze; and the nagging anxiety and uncertainty about what comes next. Indeed, the unforgiving and unforgettable wave of fires here and throughout California in 2017 and 2018 has left not only an indelible footprint on the land but a long-lasting impact on the collective psyche. There is widespread recognition that more of these unpredictable, human-caused infernos are inevitably part of the state’s future—what Gov. Jerry Brown calls “the new normal” of a changing climate. That means greater health and safety risks for not only for those directly in harm’s way but for larger numbers of people affected by harmful smoke carried long distances from the source. “The fog of fire is like being in a different world. I started feeling like a prisoner. It’s taken a really big psychological toll on people here,” says high school classmate Donna Crowe, who grew up here and returned to the area five years ago. “Mount Shasta is a touchstone for us all. Most of the time we couldn’t see it. The smoke rolled in so far that all of the mountains disappeared.” Other wildfires burning in southern Oregon contributed to the smoke hovering over the landscape during the last two months. “Economically, it’s the worst disaster I’ve ever been through,” says my friend Louie Dewey, the second-generation owner of the historic Cave Springs Resort in Dunsmuir. This shrinking railroad town of 1,650 on the upper Sacramento River sits in a canyon about eight miles south of Mount Shasta. Tourism and outdoor recreation, from trout fishing to hiking around picturesque lakes, waterfalls and mountains, are the lifeblood for many local businesses. Cave Springs lost about 50 percent of its crucial seasonal rentals due to fire-related cancellations, says Dewey. Dunsmuir, my home for three years of high school, felt like a ghost town during our visit. My family had our pick of tables at the normally bustling Cornerstone Cafe. Dunsmuir Hardware, an old-fashioned general store dating back to 1894, had a handful of people when we went in. The Ted Fay Fly Shop, a destination fishing store started by a famed angler (and father of a high school friend), was deserted as well. At the Saturday evening class reunion in the Railroad Park Resort just south of Dunsmuir, the soaring spires of the distinctive Castle Crags rock formation were lost in a smoky haze. My classmates and I welcomed being indoors for dinner in an air-conditioned old railroad car to escape the smoke. This year’s disastrous fire season began when the Carr fire struck the small city of Redding in late July. Driving to Dunsmuir, we pulled off and visited devastated neighborhoods on the west side. Most striking were streets where the wind-driven blaze burned one side to the ground, while the other side was spared, leaving intact houses with technicolor green lawns in sharp contrast to black-and-white ruins. The Carr fire ultimately became the sixth most destructive fire in California history, burning nearly 230,000 acres, destroying some 1,600 structures and killing eight people before complete containment on August 30. Meanwhile, on August 9, the Hirz fire started just east of the Carr fire, and burned 46,150 acres before being fully contained on September 12. By then, the Delta fire, starting September 5, was underway, sweeping along Interstate 5 north of Redding, causing truckers and other motorists to abandon their vehicles to escape the fast-moving flames. The raging fire closed down a 45-mile stretch of this major north-south highway and put Dunsmuir on evacuation alert. “I’ve never experienced fear of fire until now,” says retired school teacher Harriet Alto, a recent widow who’s lived in town for 65 years. She prepared to evacuate with two small packed bags, making plans with a neighbor to drive north to an emergency shelter if evacuation became mandatory. Though the Delta fire came close—14 miles away—Dunsmuir fortunately was spared. Local residents I spoke to agreed that two major problems—climate change and forest management—contributed to California’s wildfire problem. “I’m concerned there clearly isn’t the political will in this country to deal with climate change. The climate has already changed and denying it isn’t going to fix anything,” says Cave Springs owner Dewey. In addition, failure to manage forests by thinning wooded areas and thick undergrowth provided abundant fuel to feed wildfires, noted Dewey. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation allocating $1 billion over five years for statewide fire prevention, including increased management of overgrown forests. Right now, there is great relief the Delta fire, which has burned 63,300 acres, is 97 percent contained, with full containment estimated for late Friday (October 5), one month after it started. As the smoke finally receded, Crowe recalled screaming in excitement like a small kid when Mt. Shasta came back into view and stars again shone in the night sky. Current weather in the area is cloudy and cooler, with scattered showers and rain. “I’m thankful the rain started. It feels like it finally might be the end of the long fire season,” Crowe said by phone Monday. But, like many other Californians, she is left with a nagging concern about future fires: “How do you really feel safe again?”",A wave of conflagrations has altered both the land and human psyches -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-10-03T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Living with Fire in Northern California,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/living-with-fire-in-northern-california/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/5BB2F0CD-8A9E-4728-A30EE01ACF5AFB26.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,Smoky Mountains,0

Karen Chávez,"The body of an Ohio woman was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park late Tuesday afternoon, a week after she went missing. Angela Gosnell, Knoxville News Sentinel Professional search and rescue teams had hiked more than 500 miles in steep terrain searching for a hiker missing in Great Smoky Mountains National Park since Sept. 25. (Photo: Courtesy of Great Smoky Mountains National Park) Getting turned around in the woods can be almost as easy as breathing, especially in a forest as dense and deep and rugged as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where a woman out for a day hike had been missing for a week until her body was found late Tuesday afternoon. A massive search and rescue effort ended when Mitzie Sue Susan Clements, 53, was found by search crews 2 miles west of the Clingmans Dome parking area and three-quarters of a mile south of the Appalachian Trail, according to a park news release. Her cause of death is unclear at this time. Mitzie Sue ""Susan"" Clements, left, and her daughter were hiking Sept. 25 in the Smokies near Clingmans Dome. (Photo: Courtesy photo) Experts advise anyone heading into the woods, whether for a quick walk or an overnight stay, to take safety seriously. Sharon Van Horn, an experienced hiker, and member of the Nantahala Hiking Club said getting lost in the woods can be easy, even for veteran hikers, like herself and her husband, Bill. We were hiking the AT (Appalachian Trail) once, and stopped to talk to someone, and then kept marching straight ahead. We went about 45 minutes before we realized we were on the wrong trail, Van Horn said. Its something as easy as stopping to talk to someone. When you come to a junction, you could easily take a wrong turn. RELATED : Clingmans Dome tower in Smokies gets $250K makeover According to Julena Campbell, a Smokies spokeswoman, Clements, who was from Cleves, Ohio, near Cincinnati, and her 20-year-old daughter were on their way back from Andrews Bald, a 1.8-mile hike each way. Campbell said her daughter wanted to climb to the Clingmans Dome Observation Tower, and because she was hiking faster, she told her mother she would go ahead and then meet her back at the parking lot. ""When she arrived at the parking lot, her mother wasn't there,"" Campbell said. ""She waited a little bit, walked around, retraced some of her steps and then called the park."" Never hiking alone is one of the first rules of safety in the woods. Not only is it easier to navigate with a second person, but the likelihood of surviving a wildlife encounter, an injury or a fall is also better with a group. Nathan Smith, rescue division lieutenant with the Buncombe County Rescue Squad, has been the liaison with his groups volunteers in the rescue effort in the Smokies, which now includes about 125 personnel from more than 40 agencies from five states. The personnel from our agency are part of the North Carolina Emergency Managements Mountain Rescue Team, a specialized resource among search and rescue. Those teams were called in specifically because it is very steep, very dense terrain. They train on that type of terrain, Smith said. Rescue personnel from five states and some 40 agencies were assisting in the search for a hiker missing in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. (Photo: Courtesy of Great Smoky Mountains National Park) Theyre taking the approach of searching every creek, every ravine, every boulder field, but parts are very steep and very dense, and that makes it that much harder to cover thoroughly. Its different than at a place like Bent Creek where things are mostly level and its relatively easy to search. He said people should be prepared with a backpack, even if just going on a short walk in the Bent Creek Experimental Forest south of Asheville. Mountain weather can change rapidly, especially at this time of year. Always bring an additional layer of clothing, even if its supposed to be an 80-degree day. Assume theres a possibility you will be out after dark, after the temperature drops, and you will need an extra layer, whether its a rain jacket or another synthetic jacket, not made of cotton, Smith said. According to Campbell, the temperature in the Clingmans Dome area, which is the highest point in the park at 6,643 feet in elevation, can be as much as 20 degrees colder than in the Asheville area. RELATED : Smokies closer to replacing $2.5 million in outdated emergency radios Smith also advises bringing extra snacks and more water than what you think youll need, a source of light, spare batteries, a medical kit, any necessary personal medications, and a map and compass that can be used independently from a cell phone, since service can be spotty to non-existent in the woods. A lot of folks, when they hear this type of advice and dont feel like they are proficient in backwoods skills, might think those warnings are only for people who spend a lot of times outdoors, he said but should be heeded by everyone. He recommends people take a hiking or backpacking basics class with an outdoor outfitter such as REI before heading outdoors. Twisted ankles, bee stings, falls from rocks or into ravines, meeting up with a black bear protective of its cubs, or just getting hungry, thirsty and disoriented are all things that can make quickly make a short hike turn into a nightmare. Mitzie Sue ""Susan"" Clements, 53, had been missing in the Great Smokies since Sept. 25. Her body was found Oct. 2. (Photo: Courtesy photo) On June 1, 2015, Jenny Bennett, 62, went hiking in the Greenbrier area of the Smokies. Bennet was an experienced hiker and author of a popular blog, ""Endless streams and forests, about her Smokies adventures. She was reported missing and found dead, partially in a stream, seven days later. More: Woman missing in Great Smoky Mountains National Park since Tuesday More: Great Smoky Mountains missing hiker search intensifies More: One week after a hiker went missing in Great Smoky Mountains, searchers have no clues The official cause of death from the Sevier County Medical Examiners Office was environmental hypothermia due to cold exposure. The report also said Bennet had a lethal level of diphenhydramine, an antihistamine drug, in her blood. Other searches end more positively. Last summer, Austin Bohanan, 18, of Blount County, Tennessee, was lost in the Smokies in the Abrams Creek area for 11 days but kept hiking until he was able to wave down a boat on Abrams Creek, and arrived safely back home. Campbell said there are about 100 search and rescue operations in the Smokies each year. It is the most visited park in the National Park Service, with 11.3 million visitors in 2017. Most rescues do not take longer than a day. This has been going on for longer than the statistical average, but at (the) same time, there have been a lot of cases that have surprised us, Smith said. Its important for us to approach it with as optimistic of a perspective as we can and resist falling into too much worry. At the same time, the longer it goes on, the more likelihood it will have a negative outcome. Hiking safety tips: Don't hike alone. You are safest with a group. Leave your hiking plans with someone at home and check in frequently. Establish a time you will check in upon completion of your trip, as well as a procedure to follow if you fail to check in. Be wary of strangers. Be friendly, but cautious. Don't tell strangers about your plans. Avoid people who act suspiciously, seem hostile, or are intoxicated. Bring a map and compass and know how to use them. Carry a cell phone. Bring extra food and water. Bring extra layers of synthetic clothing. Avoid cotton, which doesnt dry quickly and can lead to hypothermia when its wet. Have information?

Allana Akhtar,"Courtesy of Airbnb Staying in a converted Airstream is a unique way of experiencing camping in the surrounds of nature, without the hassle of pitching a tent. The silver RV's were originally popularized in the 50s and 60s, but have recently enjoyed a revival. The variety of activities offered by these 'glamping' locations range from stargazing, to goat milking, to mountain-top yoga. Pack your hiking boots, but skip the sleeping bag: It’s time to go glamping. Glamping is for travelers who want to camp in luxury, exploring nature in secluded natural environments but staying in renovated Airstreams or furnished tents with electric ports. It’s one reason that recreational vehicles are seeing a resurgence. Sales have been soaring, due to both retiring baby boomers and a new millennial fan base, according to the Wall Street Journal. But for plenty of people, an RV in the driveway isn’t quite as appealing as an occasional weekend in a tricked-out, secluded Airstream. Check out these nine extreme glamping sites, all available on Airbnb.","Courtesy of Airbnb Staying in a converted Airstream is a unique way of experiencing camping in the surrounds of nature, without the hassle of pitching a tent.

The Associated Press,"Interested in Government Shutdown?
Add Government Shutdown as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Government Shutdown news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
National parks across the United States are scrambling to clean up and repair damage that visitors and storms caused during the recent government shutdown while bracing for the possibility of another closure ahead of the busy Presidents Day weekend later this month.
Visitors left human waste, piles of trash, graffiti, used unauthorized trails and damaged Joshua trees at the namesake park in California during the 35-day shutdown. Many of the parks went unstaffed, while others had skeleton crews with local governments and nonprofits contributing money and volunteers.
National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst in Washington, D.C., declined to provide a full accounting of the damage at more than 400 locations, saying it was isolated and most visitors took good care of the land.
But conservationists warn that damage to sensitive lands could take decades to recover. Even before the shutdown, national parks faced an estimated $12 billion maintenance backlog that has now grown.
President Donald Trump has said another shutdown could start Feb. 15 if he and Democratic leaders can't agree on funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, compounding the pressure the park service faces to catch up on repairs and maintenance.
Hiring seasonal workers who typically start in the spring as rangers, fee collectors and hiking guides also has been delayed.
""We're kind of ready to just have a bit more stability,"" said Angie Richman, a spokeswoman at Arches National Park in Utah.
Arches visitors left human waste outside a restroom, stomped out five trails in a permit-only area that was supposed to be closed and damaged an entrance gate to allow vehicles to drive on snow-covered roads when the park was closed after a storm, Richman said.
At Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California, one of the iconic twisted-limbed Joshua trees was run over by an off-road vehicle and a juniper tree was cut down, said park superintendent David Smith. Several other Joshua Trees were damaged, including one that was spray painted, but the park has yet to determine the exact number, he said. Off-road vehicles created extensive unauthorized trails in the park's deserts, with wheel marks dug into the delicate soil nearly a foot deep in some spots, Smith said.
Employees at Death Valley National Park found human waste and toilet paper scattered in the desert and evidence people tried to kick in locked restroom doors, said David Blacker, executive director of the Death Valley Natural History Association. The group kept the visitors center open during most of the shutdown, where tourists got information on packing out trash and digging a hole to use the bathroom.
A time-lapse video on Death Valley's Facebook page showed how it took staffers two hours to clean a restroom overflowing with trash and splashed with waste. Crews also have to rake and replant vegetation to repair ruts from off-road vehicles, which delays work elsewhere in the 3.4 million-acre park.
""It became pretty depressing the kinds of things people will do when they are unsupervised,"" Blacker said.
People in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park drove around locked gates and through meadows, spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said.
At Great Smoky Mountains National Park straddling the North Carolina-Tennessee line, visitors cut locks on some gates to closed roads and stole about $5,000 in maintenance tools, spokeswoman Dana Soehn said.
Winter storms damaged some parks that lacked enough staff to make repairs quickly.
Officials at Zion National Park in Utah, Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado and Olympic National Park in Washington were fixing trails, roads and campgrounds. Mesa Verde wasn't set to open until Monday, and some areas were still closed at Zion and Olympic.
Campgrounds, visitors centers and trails that seasonal workers help prepare could face delayed openings, and families planning spring break or summer vacations might think twice about visiting national parks if they don't think they're safe or fully staffed, said Phil Francis, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks.
""There are a lot of impacts that will be felt in the future that aren't being felt or even talked about now,"" he said.
In some parks, animals that typically don't interact with visitors claimed the space.
A colony of elephant seals took over a Northern California beach in Point Reyes National Seashore without staffers to discourage the animals from congregating in the popular tourist area. Rangers and volunteer docents will lead small groups of visitors starting this weekend to the edge of a parking lot so they can safely see the elephant seals and their newborn pups.
Meanwhile, the prospect of another shutdown looms.
Grand Canyon National Park could miss out on its main centennial celebration Feb. 26 and other related events.
""It's a big deal, and we are looking forward to celebrating it in whatever way we can,"" park spokeswoman Emily Davis said.
Elizabeth Jackson, a spokeswoman for Guadalupe Mountains National Park on the Texas-New Mexico border, noted the stress it places on workers.
""It's a way of life if you're a federal employee,"" Jackson said. ""Not to be glib, but it's something we face every year.""

Genevieve Scarano,"Some U.S. national parks are finally reopening after the partial government shutdown ended on Friday.
This weekend, many U.S. national parks, including the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Virgin Islands National Park, and the Wright Brothers National Memorial, welcomed visitors again, the Associated Press reported.
""Following the enactment of the continuing resolution, the Natl Park Service is preparing to resume regular operations nationwide though the schedule for individual parks may vary depending on staff size and complexity of operations."" Full statement at https://t.co/j0R3Kdo8b8
— NationalParkService (@NatlParkService) January 26, 2019
The National Park Service (NPS) is working to reopen all U.S. national parks soon, however, some might not open immediately due to clean up and staff shortages. In a press statement, the NPS said visitors should contact individual parks or visit park websites for more information on accessibility and post-shutdown opening schedules.
On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a short-term deal to end the partial government shutdown, which negatively impacted some U.S. national parks for 35 days, Gizmodo reported. The shutdown caused some U.S. national parks to experience unsanitary facilities and garbage pollution, because there were limited employees available to clean and patrol areas.
The NPS is currently working with park rangers and other officials to get many national parks, including Joshua Tree National Park and Yosemite National Park, back in shape before the spring season.
Fully reopening the federal government will mean so much to so many,” Theresa Pierno, president and CEO for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a press statement. “For rangers and other park staff, it will mean returning to our national parks, assessing the terrible damage done to them while they were open with such limited staff, and once again welcoming visitors to the places they all love. Now is when the real work begins.

Sean Gregory / Bongpyeong,"Jamie Anderson has hugged trees before competitions, and carries bark in her travel bag. She burns incense in her hotel rooms. The American snowboarding star grew up in Lake Tahoe, Calif., homeschooled alongside seven siblings by her mother Lauren; mom believed that kids didn’t belong cooped up in class, but should be free to roam the mountains and woods and learn the book stuff on their own time. “It was about connecting with the universe,” says Anderson’s older brother Luke, 33, “and going with the flow.” She does yoga, and has said that her purpose is to find consciousness. She brings a pharmacy full of herbal remedies to events. The laid-back Californian has called herself a “peaceful warrior,” balancing the need to crush her opponents with inner calm, and a smile. “I consider myself an old hippie for sure,” Anderson’s father, Joey, a retired firefighter who grew up in the Bay Area in the 1960s tells TIME. “But Jamie’s a serious hippie.” Anderson’s at one with her spirit, and on Monday afternoon at the Phoenix Snow Park in Bongpyeong, South Korea, she became a two-time Olympic champ. She cruised to another gold medal in the slopestyle competition, thanks to an error-free run; treacherous winds messed with the tricks of most riders. With her second gold, Anderson — who four years ago won the inaugural Olympic slopestyle event in Sochi — is now the first woman to win two Olympic gold medals in snowboard. So far, the Americans have swept the snowboarding gold medals of these Games: Red Gerard took men’s slopestyle gold on Sunday. The women’s halfpipe final is on deck, set for Tuesday morning local time in South Korea: U.S. teen phenomenon Chloe Kim topped in qualifying, and fellow Americans Maddie Mastro, Kelly Clark, and Arielle Gold could also compete for medals. Controversy did overshadow the women’s slopestyle, as some riders insisted that, given the gusting winds, the event should have been postponed. Riders repeatedly wiped out, banging their bodies against the snow after sailing and twisting off steep ramps. Just five of the 25 athletes in the competition completed their first run. “I don’t it think it should have been run at all,” says Norwegian rider Silje Norendal. She labeled the decision to go forward “crazy” and “sad.” Women’s slopestyle missed a rare chance to tout its talent to the world. “What we were able to show today was not good at all,” says Norendal. Olympic officials did cancel the giant slalom alpine ski race on Monday, leading Norendal to suggest that that FIS, the international governing body for both skiing and snowboarding, gave the skiers preferential treatment. “When it’s alpine, they have a higher status, and they really want a good show,” says Norendal. “I feel like we’re definitely coming in second.” Giant slalom doesn’t even count as a speed event in ski racing. Meanwhile, snowboarders soar to the edge of insanity. Officials sacrificed safety to avoid a cancellation, some riders suggested. “The slalom today, I know it’s unfair if it’s windy,” says Norendal. “But they can’t die. We can actually get super hurt.” Luckily, no one did. Anderson argued for holding the event, which was delayed for over an hour due to the weather. “It’s not like what we’re doing is safe anyhow,” says Anderson. Knowing so many riders in front of her were falling, Anderson dialed back her game plan, and even made a midair decision to flip once, not twice, off one jump. “I’m not extremely proud of my run,” she says. It was the kind was routine you’d find in a qualifying round; the riders save their best of the finals. Olympic viewers saw the junior varsity. Still, her gold medal shines. Anderson had to fight injuries — both physical and mental — to earn her second Olympic title. Since Sochi, Anderson’s witnessed an influx of younger riders executing more difficult tricks. Their talent messed with with her head. “I was like really afraid,” says Anderson. “I was like oh my gosh, I don’t know if I’m going to keep with these young bucks.” Incense and bark helped her stop stressing. Anderson’s always been a free-spirit, thanks largely to her upbringing. Her mother Lauren earned a teaching degree, then decided she’d rather instruct her children herself. “I wanted them to run free like little lambs,” Lauren, who during the event was wearing a USA beanie with “MOM” stitched in the wool, tells TIME. When Anderson was about 12, the spent a few days in junior high. Her father (wool hat: DAD) recalls her laying on the couch one day, after the final bell. “Dad,” she told him. “School sucks.” Read More: All the Medals the U.S. Has Won in the 2018 Winter Olympics The mountain serves as her classroom. She’d beat the boys in BMX racing, and battled older sisters Joanie, 31, and Stacie, 28, on snowboards. The sisters constantly one-upped each other with new tricks. “She knew how to push buttons,” says Joanie, who along with Jamie won X-Games gold in 2007. “She wasn’t about to be lost in the mix.” Or as younger brother Joey, 23, puts it: “she’s a f–king boss, man.” Anderson brings therapeutic accoutrements on road trips. “I have like a little altar set up at every hotel,” Anderson says. “It’s pretty sweet.” For the Olympics, she packed crystals — smoky quartz and clear quartz — a piece of bark, seed from a Hawaiian temple, and various essential oils. She brought frankincense and lavender to the mountain for her Olympic coronation. “I knew she had a little bit of a gypsy personality,” says Anderson’s boyfriend, Canadian Olympic snowboarder Tyler Nicholson. But when they started dating around three years ago, Nicholson was surprised she traveled like a healer. He’s since warmed up to her habits. “She owns it,” he says. Plus, finding consciousness yields one hell of a result: making Olympic history.",Jamie Anderson becomes the first woman to win two Olympic gold medals in snowboard,2018-02-12T10:36:27Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","How Jamie Anderson, America’s Olympic Hippie, Won Snowboarding Gold",http://time.com/5143976/olympics-2018-jamie-anderson-snowboarding-gold/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-917169340.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Smoky Mountains,0
Jeremy Bodenhamer,"After Thanksgiving, while most of the country was getting ready for the holidays, the largest wildfire in California history ripped through California's central coast, including our hometown of Santa Barbara. It was a monster, 440 square miles, forcing more than 100,000 people to evacuate, and decimating life in Ventura, Ojai, Fillmore, Carpinteria, Summerland, Montecito and beyond. Burning at a rate of almost one acre per second, many local residents didn't even see the fire coming. CNN told us that the fire ""would [have burned] through Manhattan's Central Park in about 14 minutes."" It was terrible. The Thomas Fire turned Santa Barbara into a ghost town. A thick, smoky fog nestled up against the usually picturesque mountains, and stayed there for almost two weeks. The air was hazardous to breathe. It permeated buildings. All of our schools shut down. Air filters sold out. We encouraged our team to leave town because those who remained risked serious health complications. A bleak view of our future. But the Thomas Fire, which is now contained, paints a grim picture of America's future; a future where goods are no longer bought in local stores, but instead everything is bought online. Local businesses in the fire zones were hit hard. Many closed. A few tried to stay open, but found few, if any customers due to the toxic smoke and large evacuation zones. Retail clerks now can't pay their rent. And some, like C'est Cheese, a popular Santa Barbara cafe and cheese shop, are grappling with the reality of having to close for good. Last week I found a note taped to their door. ""We are heartbroken to announce that we have had to close down our cafe for the time being. In addition to the people who have been directly affected, [the Thomas Fire] has also had a severe impact on the local business community."" C'est Cheese is not alone. Ken Oplinger, President of the Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce issued his plea in the Independent, one of our local newspapers, ""We're asking for people not to do their shopping online. Help local businesses instead."" The true impact of online shopping. Like massive fires and hurricanes, online giants such as Amazon and Walmart continue their push into every conceivable corner of our lives, from electronics and toilet paper, to groceries and even home repair. I can't help but think of the similarities to the fire that recently gutted our town. A giant, uncontrolled fire, slowly moving, blowing powerful winds to distribute smoldering embers across our great country, taking over one business and one job at at time. But this isn't us. We are a nation of entrepreneurs. A nation of brave individuals who take risks to do things that have never been done before, to invest in our communities, our families, and each other. But the winds of change are afoot and they are threatening our very identity. There is still hope. The Thomas Fire provided a brief window into what life would be like without our local economy. And it's worse than I ever dreamed. After last year's hurricanes, many in Houston and Florida are experiencing life through the same lens. As I read further, I found that the owners of C'est Cheese provided a ray of hope at the end of their letter. ""We are not asking for charity or donations, there are plenty of people and causes who deserve them more. Our big ask is that in the weeks and months ahead to please just give consideration to where you spend your hard earned money. Small purchases at places you like make a difference (large purchases do too). If you like a place, and want it to stick around, please stop in from time to time and let em' know."" What can we do? I encourage you to not lose sight of the men and women striving to maintain the world of small business against these powerful online forces. And remember, supporting local business is investing in your community. With that, I'm off to go buy some cheese.",The Thomas Fire turned Santa Barbara into a ghost town.

James Hetherington,"An Ohio woman has gone missing while out on a hike with her daughter in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which covers a large area across the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. Clements was last seen walking on the Forney Ridge Trail, near Andrews Bald. 53-year-old Mitzie Sue Susan Clements disappeared on Tuesday after she fell behind her daughter during the walk. According to National Park Service spokesperson Julena Campbell, via WATE-TV, Clements's daughter eventually stopped to wait for her mother to catch up, but she never did. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 120 people from around 30 different agencies have been unsuccessful in tracking Clements down. They are searching the mountain which because of its rugged terrain requires a methodical approach, Campbell told CBS News. Police are using dogs, helicopters and drones to try locate Clements. Flyers have also been posted in public areas to help people identify the missing woman. According to the National Parks Service, Clements is five-foot-six, weighs around 125 pounds and was last seen wearing a green zip-up sweater, black workout pants over black leggings, a clear rain poncho, and white tennis shoes with purple laces. Clements is from Cleves, 16 miles west of Cincinnati. Search crews get ready to scour the mountains at sunrise. National Parks Service According to TV Station WCPO, Clements is an accounting tech for the Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati. Interim director Diana Christy, Clements's boss, pleaded for people to come forward with any information. ""Everyone here at MSD is thinking about Mitzie and praying for her safe return,"" Christy said. Acting Chief Ranger Jared St. Clair said no additional volunteers are needed as crews aim to only use professionals trained for systematic searches. This is unforgiving terrain, and we are working long hours to find Ms. Clements. We are extremely grateful for the rapid response by so many well-trained personnel and the generous support resources that our cooperators have dedicated to this search,"" St. Clair said.

TRAVIS LOLLER / AP,"(NASHVILLE, Tenn.) — If Tennessee electrocutes Edmund Zagorski on Thursday, it will be in an electric chair built by a self-taught execution expert who is no longer welcome in the prison system and who worries that his device will malfunction. Fred Leuchter had a successful career in the execution business before his reputation was tainted by his claim that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz. Tennessee’s chair, which hasn’t been used since 2007, is just one of many execution devices Leuchter worked on between 1979 and 1990, according to an article by Fordham University professor Deborah Denno in the William and Mary Law Review. In addition to electric chairs, Leuchter built, refurbished and consulted on gas chambers, lethal injection machines and a gallows for at least 27 states. After his comments about the Holocaust, it came to light that he had neither an engineering degree nor a license, even though he promoted himself as an engineer. His rise and fall was portrayed in a 2000 documentary. Nonetheless, Leuchter stands behind the electric chair he rebuilt in 1988, relying on skills picked up designing navigational and surveillance equipment and a careful study of documents describing early executions. His concern is that Tennessee’s chair will fail because of changes others made to it after he was no longer allowed to service it. “What I’m worried about now is Tennessee’s got an electric chair that’s going to hurt someone or cause problems. And it’s got my name on it,” Leuchter said. “I don’t think it’s going to be humane.” Gov. Bill Haslam said he is confident the execution can be carried out without problems. “I have a great deal of confidence in our Department of Correction folks. … We’ve spoken with them regularly and they’ve assured us” the chair is ready. Leuchter said he was familiar with prisons because he accompanied his father to his job as superintendent of transportation in the Massachusetts state prison in the 1940s and ’50s, from about age 4 to age 16. As a teenager, Leuchter helped his father move the state’s old electric chair when the prison relocated, and he remembers they had to do it on a Sunday because the warden didn’t want the news media to know. “I helped put the chair in the truck. We covered it up with canvas,” he said. Years later, when it looked as though Massachusetts might restart capital punishment after a long hiatus, a prison steward who knew Leuchter’s father asked Leuchter to come in and see whether the old chair was still usable. From there, “my name was given to other states,” Leuchter said. He said many of their electric chairs were “decrepit, defunct, didn’t work properly — if they ever had in the first place.” Denno, a law professor at Fordham who has studied execution methods for more than 25 years, said Leuchter filled a void. Often “the most qualified people don’t want to be involved” in executions, she said. Even after he was no longer welcome as a prison contractor, Denno said prison officials continued to contact Leuchter for help “because they literally had no one else to go to.” Tennessee asked Leuchter to refurbish its chair in 1988, when it was facing the possibility of its first execution in decades. “It looked like it was made for a midget or something,” Leuchter said. So he built a new chair that incorporated wood from the original, which he was told was from the old gallows, and replaced the chair’s electrodes. He also replaced the old leather straps that tether prisoners to the chair with quick-release nylon belts, to aid guards tasked with removing bodies after executions. He trained prison workers and gave them certificates as “electrocution technicians.” Leuchter said he sold the original chair. A collector of “murderabilia” listed it on eBay in 2000. It now resides in the Alcatraz East Crime Museum in the Smoky Mountains. Denno said electric chairs have “a history of botches that has only gotten worse.” In two Florida executions in the 1990s, smoke and flames shot from the condemned inmates’ heads. In 1999, blood spilled from under an inmate’s mask. Shortly afterward, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the electric chair violates the 8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. But the case was dropped after Florida switched to lethal injection. Tennessee has executed only one person in Leuchter’s electric chair. Daryl Holton died that way in 2007. In preparation, an electrical engineer reduced the voltage from 2,640 to 1,750 and raised the amperage from 5 to 7. The timing was also changed, from two, one-minute jolts with a 10-second pause between, to a 20-second and 15-second jolt with a 15-second pause between. The execution was successful. The chair was inspected on Oct. 10 of this year and found to meet the criteria for an execution, state documents show. But Leuchter said he feels the chair now is “defective and shouldn’t be used.” “It worked the first time, but I think they were lucky,” he said.

AMY FORLITI / AP,"(MINNEAPOLIS) — Park rangers were once again greeting visitors at some national parks across the United States and flight operations at major airports were returning to normal on Saturday, one day after a partial government shutdown came to an end.
While there were signs that some government machinery was grinding back to life after a record 35 days without funding, many federal workers and their families approached the end of the shutdown cautiously, saying they were relieved they would receive paychecks again, but would continue to restrict their spending amid fears that another shutdown could happen in weeks.
“You can only be so happy because you just have to know that it could happen again,” said Rachel Malcom, whose husband serves in the Coast Guard in Rhode Island. “We’re going to be playing catch up, so I don’t want to overspend.”
President Donald Trump signed a short-term deal Friday to end the partial government shutdown, which caused 800,000 federal employees to miss two paychecks. The administration asked department heads to reopen offices in a “prompt and orderly manner.”
Many government agencies still had notices on their websites Saturday saying they were not fully operating due to the lack of appropriations. Calls to several agencies also went unanswered, with voicemails saying the offices were closed due to the shutdown. But many parks — from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Minnesota — were glad to open their doors to weekend visitors.
John Anfinson, superintendent of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, said it felt great to tell his employees to open the Mississippi River Visitor’s Center. He texted his manager and said “Roll up the gate!”
“They were just waiting for the green light,” he said. Park ranger Sharon Stiteler posted a video to Twitter that showed the center’s gates opening with the word: “Weeeee!”
The visitor’s center, located in the lobby of the Science Museum of Minnesota, saw 180 visitors in its first hour of operation, Anfinson said, and when he stopped by, the employees had “big smiles on their faces.”
The National Park Service said it was working on reopening all of its parks as quickly as possible, but some parks may not open immediately depending on their staff size and complexity. The Virgin Islands National Park, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the Wright Brothers National Memorial and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were among the parks that reopened Saturday.
And Yellowstone National Park officials said visitor centers would reopen there by Sunday afternoon, with the majority of staff returning Monday to begin working on a backlog of permit requests, including from those seeking to do research in the park.
Mike Litterst, chief spokesman for the National Park Service, said the nation’s more than 400 parks are reopening on a rolling schedule. Some of the parks that were partially open and accessible during the shutdown are expected to get back to full operations more quickly.
“We’re certainly grateful that all of our dedicated rangers and park service staff are back at work,” Litterst said.
In the New York area, airport operations were returning to normal, just a day after LaGuardia Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport both experienced at least 90-minute delays in takeoffs because of the shutdown — which caused a ripple effect throughout the system. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration reported that flights at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport were landing and taking off Saturday morning with 15-minute delays. There were no other major delays nationwide, according to the FAA’s website, which tracks flight delays.
Some parts of the government were taking a little more time to open up.
The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo in Washington planned to reopen to the public on Tuesday. Spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said until then, employees will check all audio-visual and interactive exhibits to make sure everything is working properly and curators will make a final check of the exhibits. Cafeterias will also be restocked and food shipments will resume, but full food service might not be immediately available.
Nigel Fields, superintendent of Virgin Islands National Park, said donations kept the park mostly open during its busy tourist season. But, he said, there is some anxiety about another closure. The park covers about 60 percent of the island of St. John, which was hit by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The shutdown affected the park service’s ability to continue rebuilding, strengthening the coral reef and restoring native vegetation after the storms.
For families of workers, the government’s reopening came with a mix of relief and fear. While those who were furloughed or required to work without pay will receive back pay, it’s unclear when that will happen.
Crystal Simmons, whose husband serves in the Coast Guard in Connecticut, said it will likely take some time to process back pay, and then employees could be in the same situation again if another shutdown happens.
“I don’t think I can really relax and go back to the way things were,” she said.

Jim Carlton,"SPOKANE, Wash.—On a recent morning in this city bred on the great outdoors, the halls of Mt. Spokane High School were filled with some 600 football players throwing spirals, cross-country runners doing laps, and marching band members twirling batons. The air outside was too smoky to breathe. The Pacific Northwest, sandwiched between Canada’s smoldering British Columbia to the north and six fire-wracked Western U.S. states, is feeling the side effects of one of the worst fire seasons on record. For much of the past several weeks, clouds of choking smog have upended daily life and posed a health hazard for millions here. “It was like being at a campfire wherever you went,” said Paul Kautzman, Mt. Spokane’s athletic director, after a particularly noxious day. Flights have been delayed because of visibility problems, the Seattle Seahawks moved practice to an indoor facility, and people are showing up at hospitals and medical clinics with complaints of wheezing, shortness of breath and other ailments. Long-planned surgeries have been canceled because patients are too ill from the smoke. In Spokane last week, a thick, gray fog draped the sky, obscuring the view of Mt. Spokane and the fir trees that dot the skyline here. A YMCA camp had to shuttle 60 children from a park to its nearest indoor facility, a former Gold’s Gym, where they arrived wearing protective masks. This region has dealt with smoke pollution before, but this year has been significantly worse, residents and experts say. Aug. 20 was the worst day so far for Spokane, population 215,000. Its air was dirtier than that of any major city—outpacing typically smog-addled places like Beijing and Lahore, Pakistan, according to a global pollution survey by IQAir Group, a Swiss-based manufacturer of air-pollution equipment that has a data collection unit. Among 80 cities with populations of more than 300,000, Vancouver, British Columbia, had the worst air quality in the world that day, followed by Seattle, IQAir said. Under the Air Quality Index, a standard followed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 101 to 150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, 151 to 200 is unhealthy for everyone, and over 200 very unhealthy. Spokane reached a high of 226 last week. Vancouver hit 165. Eric Lewis, chief executive of Olympic Medical Center in Port Angeles, Wash., on the Olympic Peninsula north of Seattle, said he has experienced a sore throat, raspy voice and difficulty breathing—even though he suffers from no respiratory illness and has forsaken his daily walks for more than two weeks. “It’s like suddenly becoming a smoker,” he said. Rain over the Spokane area cleared out the skies Sunday and Monday, but smoky conditions were expected to return later this week there and in other parts of the Pacific Northwest that got a reprieve. Experts say it is unclear when the smoke will lift for good. An unusually stubborn ridge of high pressure has blocked most of the cleansing onshore winds from the Pacific, said Ranil Dhammapala, an atmospheric scientist at the Washington State Department of Ecology. High-pressure systems and wildfires are frequent occurrences this time of year in the region, but the duration and extent of the pollution is unusual, said Mr. Dhammapala. While long-term effects of the smoke inhalation are unknown, short-term effects including coughing and shortness of breath are most pronounced in people with respiratory problems such as asthma and emphysema, said Colleen Reid, assistant professor of geography at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies climate change and public health. Officials at the PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Wash., north of Seattle, said they received about 100 telephone complaints of respiratory symptoms on the morning of Aug. 20. Managers at Hoagland Pharmacy in the same city said they sold 85 air-filtration masks out of a case of 100 within hours of its arrival on Aug. 22. “Even people who don’t have lung conditions have been feeling ill effects,” said Sarah Farmer, a respiratory therapist at the pharmacy. Few places have been more affected than Spokane, where residents thrive on easy access to lushly forested mountains and trout-filled lakes and streams. With smoke blanketing the Spokane Valley for much of August—a tie for the longest such period in at least 20 years of record-keeping—many have been rushing to escape the great outdoors. Local YMCA administrators say people who usually hike or swim outdoors have been filling their indoor gyms and pools instead. That has made for some cramped conditions, such as when two school cross-country teams came to the YMCA of the Inland Northwest branch on the same day last week to practice. “Everyone is trying to figure out what to do,” said John Ehrbar, the branch’s chief operating officer. By Thursday, the smoke at Mt. Spokane High School had dissipated enough for some players to enjoy their first outdoor practice of the summer. “You get a little headache sometimes, but it’s fine,” said Tanner Brooks, a wide receiver and linebacker on the football team. Jacob Zacharias, head drum major for the marching band, was thrilled to get out of the school’s main indoor hall, where runners had to zigzag around the marching band. “We’re all kind of going stir crazy,” he said. The reprieve didn’t last long. By midmorning, sports teams and the marching band were called back inside as the air quality worsened. The next day, the school called off a preseason football game.","The Pacific Northwest, sandwiched between Canada’s smoldering British Columbia to the north and six fire-wracked Western U.S. states, is feeling the side effects of one of the worst fire seasons on record.",2018-08-29T10:46:38Z,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",CHOKE: Northwest Air Too Smoky to Breathe...,https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-wildfires-burn-miles-away-smog-blankets-the-northwest-1535535001,https://images.wsj.net/im-23749/social,the-wall-street-journal,The Wall Street Journal,Smoky Mountains,0
WVLT,"GSMNP, Tenn. (WVLT)- Great Smoky Mountains National park rangers are searching for a 53-year-old woman from Cleves, Ohio who was last seen in the Clingmans Dome area of the park on Tuesday, September 25. Mitzie Sue Susan Clements was hiking with her daughter on the Forney Ridge Trail, near Andrews Bald when the two separated. She was last seen around 5:00 pm approximately a quarter of a mile from Andrews Bald. Park officials were alerted that Clements was missing on Tuesday evening, and began searching the immediate area with no success. On Wednesday, officials expanded the search area, and additional personnel were called in to search. Wednesday night, experienced searchers spent the night on the Appalachian Trail attempting to locate Clements and to interview any hikers in the area. The search continued Thursday morning with approximately 40 trained members of the parks Search and Rescue Team. On Thursday evening, the park service announced that the entire length of Clingmans Dome Road would close to vehicles tonight and will remain closed until further notice. The closure is to help with the search, the GSMNP said. Susan Clements is a white female with light brown hair and blue eyes. She is 56 tall and weighs 125 pounds. She is wearing a green zip-up sweater, black workout pants over black leggings, a clear rain poncho, and white tennis shoes.

Kane is with the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio. (Photo: Angela Wilhelm, /awilhelm@citizentimes.com) Imagine not getting a haircut for 80 years. That’s how the Blue Ridge Parkway is looking in some spots these days — a little hairy and ragged around the edges. But in the first major project of its kind since the parkway was constructed in the 1930s, a team of parkway resource managers and skilled arborists are working around Haywood and Jackson counties to give some much-needed shearing to overgrown vistas. The goal of the “Renew the Views” project is to balance the original, scenic design intent of the parkway and the National Park Service mission to protect its natural resources, said parkway landscape architect David Anderson. It is the most visited national park in the country, drawing 16.1 million visitors in 2017. On Thursday, hand-held radio traffic of “All clear!” preceded the whine of a chain saw, the hiss and creak of a 70-foot yellow birch taking a fall, and the shrieking crash as it hit the forest floor. Anderson watched from the sunny top of a steep embankment at Milepost 434.2, where the parkway passes in front of the Richland Balsam Range, about halfway between Mount Pisgah and Waterrock Knob. Over and over, the trees went tumbling down, and more mountains came into view. There are 910 designed roadside vistas along the 469 miles of parkway from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia down to the entrance of Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Cherokee. Maintaining the roadside vistas experienced at 45 mph as drivers round bends, to the paved overlooks with parking areas for stopping a while to stare, is never-ending work, Anderson said. He said it’s thought the forests – heavily logged at the turn of the 20th century – were just starting their regrowth when parkway construction got underway in 1935. The short saplings or nonexistent trees allowed for full viewing pleasure, which was the original purpose of the parkway – to attract tourists to the endless expanses of rippling mountain scenery. But nearly a century later, the trees have grown up into an even-aged stand, obscuring once-open views. Regular overlook vegetation maintenance is done every three years, but only enough to basically keep the bangs out of the onlooker’s eyes. “We do 310 vistas every year to clear the smaller stuff. We leave the rhododendron and flowering shrubs, the dogwoods and blueberry bushes,” Anderson said. “We start about 70 feet down. We’ve only been cutting that same footprint for the last 70 years, but the background is growing to maturity and blocking the view that was the original design intent.” Chris Ulrey, a plant ecologist with the Blue Ridge Parkway and a member of the Arborist Incident Response Team, assesses a tree during a vista clearing project on the Blue Ridge Parkway April 13, 2018. (Photo: Angela Wilhelm/awilhelm@citizentimes.com) Funding from the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation of $20,000 is allowing the National Park Service to get at those mature trees at vistas between Mileposts 420-435 over 10 days. The work involves 17 sawyers with AIR — Arborist Incident Response Team, Southeast Region — a team of highly skilled National Park Service arborists who respond to tree emergencies across the country, such as the aftermath of hurricanes that have brought down trees across power lines, roads or buildings. Visitors will be able to see for many more miles at certain overlooks, but on close inspection, they will also see what appear to be tree graveyards in the foreground. “People should know we’re not killing trees,” said Chris Ulrey, parkway botanist and AIR Team member. “They will re-sprout where they are.” He said before any tree cutting takes place, monitoring is done to determine if the trees are vital habitat to wildlife, such as the Northern flying squirrel, which is a federally endangered species. The squirrel makes its home at elevations above 5,000 feet in conifers like red spruce and Fraser firs on north-facing slopes. Ulrey said there were no Northern flying squirrels found in annual monitoring in the trees being removed, which are mostly yellow birch and red oak. “We leave the trees where they fall,"" he said. ""They create habitat and nutrient regeneration into the soil. We get lichens, fungus and mushrooms that accompany decaying wood, and that’s good for bugs, birds and ground squirrels.” Specialized, intensive work like this would not be possible without partnerships, Anderson said. The Blue Ridge Parkway has one of the highest maintenance backlogs in the National Park Service, at $517 million worth of road, building and maintenance work waiting to be done. Funding for the vista restoration is coming exclusively from partner groups, including the Haywood and Watauga county tourism development authorities and the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation. The nonprofit parkway foundation fills in large holes for the national park by raising money for many parkway programs and projects, such as the expansion at the Graveyard Fields parking lot and restroom construction, renovation of the Craggy Flats Trail, and ongoing rehabilitation of the Moses H. Cone Manor House. Its “Renew the Views” program got a jump-start last year when a Virginia artist, Eric Fitzpatrick, donated hundreds of lithograph pieces of his “Blue Ridge Parkway” fall scene, said Mandy Gee, communications associate with the foundation. “He wanted us to use those to donate to the project. Those who gave a gift of $100 or more got a piece of artwork. It helped us encourage donors to give. Our supporters loved it. People care so much about the views on the parkway,” Gee said. She said the nonprofit raised $90,000 so far, which will be used for another vista clearing project in the fall. Vistas have already been cleared on the Virginia side of the parkway, with funding from that state’s Friends of the Parkway nonprofit. The view from the Double Top Mountain overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway had been recently clearing April 13, 2018. (Photo: Angela Wilhelm, /awilhelm@citizentimes.com) The North Carolina work started at the Double Top Mountain Overlook at Milepost 435, which is about 15 miles southeast of Waynesville and about 55 miles southwest of Asheville. AIR Team members took out hundreds of trees over about a third of an acre in a day, Anderson said. “The before and after was pretty incredible,” Gee said. “When we left, we could actually see Double Top Mountain. People weren’t stopping at the overlook as they drove by and by the time we left they were stopping to look. It transformed. If these views aren’t there, people aren’t going to go to the parkway. It’s one of the only places to get those unobstructed views without seeing high rises.” A National Park Service study released last year found that visitors to the Blue Ridge Parkway in 2016 spent $9.8 million in communities near the park, and by supporting thousands of local jobs, it had a cumulative economic impact of $1.3 billion. “We get a fair number of complaints that the overlooks are overgrown, and now where we’ve done the work, we get lots of compliments,” Ulrey said.

"A.E. Dwyer on The Takeout, shared by Katie Rife to The A.V. Club","Mountains of boiled potatoes have rolled blandly across my dinner plate throughout my life. I was never thrilled by their presence, tolerating them but never truly enjoying them. It wasn’t until later in life when I began studying the food of my Irish heritage that I began to realize their worth. I treat them with more respect now, and prepare them with more care. One of the key books that connected me with my Irish heritage is Darina Allen’s Irish Traditional Cooking. According to Allen, a chef and proponent of Irish cooking and founder of Ballymaloe Cookery School, the potato found its way to Ireland by the early 17th century. Potatoes had come to England and the rest of Europe as a novelty plant for the expansive vegetable gardens of wealthy estates. When the crops were found to grow easily and abundantly, it was soon embraced in Ireland as a comforting crop offering food security. Potatoes became the mainstay of peasant and working-class Irish people, often the main source of nutrients in their diets—a veritable life-saver when combined with protein from readily available buttermilk, iron from foraged plants like nettles and lovage, and scraps of meat or fish. Many people have some peripheral knowledge of Ireland’s Potato Famine of the mid-1800s, but most don’t know its devastating extent. In 1845, a fungal disease known as potato blight destroyed two-thirds of the potato crop, which had already begun to have a few shaky years. The following years saw further bad harvests—famine and disease swept through the poorer classes who were completely reliant on one variety of potato. One million Irish people died, and roughly 2 million were forced to emigrate. Reliance upon one key foodstuff had never been so tragically demonstrated, writes Allen. After the blight, the potato rebounded and fed the masses once more. Today Ireland boasts several unique and disease-resistant potato varieties, and efforts are being made to preserve even more heritage varieties. The potato remains special to the Irish. It can still feed a lot of hungry mouths for relatively little cost. It can be mixed, and mashed and mingled in a thousand different ways, and Irish cooking notably excels at elevating the tubers to comforting main courses. The dishes below enliven humble potatoes, pairing them with their good friends: alliums, brassicas, and porky bits. All these recipes need butter—lots of butter. You should not feel shame or trepidation at the amount. Upon consuming you should feel a connection to Irish traditional foods, right there on your buttery lips. These recipes, and eating instructions, are inspired by Darina Allen’s Irish Traditional Cooking, as well as my own family’s traditions. Mashed potato notes Use russet or round white potatoes. Irish recipes traditionally use drier, flour-y types, rather than waxy types like yellow potatoes. Try boiling potatoes with­­­ their skins—or “jackets”—on. Once tender, slip off the skins quickly, ideally, burning your fingers as little as possible. If you have a potato ricer, use it. If not, these recipes are forgiving, as a few potato lumps will be indistinguishable from the supporting veggies. You actually want to mash the potatoes in the hot pot it was cooked in, over a low flame as you mash in ample warm butter. Then add warmed milk or cream to the mash to achieve your preferred consistency. You’ll notice there are few specific measurements provided, but assume 1 large russet potato—about 1/2 lb.—per person. The amount of scallions or bacon you use depends on your personal preferences for these flavorings. For me, it’s a lot. Champ Champ is mashed potatoes with scallions and butter. Sauté 2-3 sliced scallions lightly with a pat of butter and bit of salt until tender. Stir into your mashed potatoes. Serve up a large scoop of champ, hollowing out a well in the center and filling it with butter. Eat from the outside, dipping each bite into the butter pool. Colcannon At its simplest, colcannon is mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage or kale, though regional varieties in Ireland may use seaweed, stinging nettles, or wild garlic. This is my favorite version: mashed potatoes laced with dark ribbons of sautéed kale, melted leeks and garlic. Wash a slender leek well (it can have a lot of dirt on the inside) and finely slice. Add to a sauté pan slicked with butter. Cook over low heat, adding a splash of water if the leeks start to brown. Once softened, stir in a large bunch of julienned Lacinato kale and a finely sliced garlic clove, and cover and cook together until kale has softened but not withered too much. Meanwhile, boil your potatoes until tender, peel, and mash. Season the kale-leek mixture with salt and pepper and fold through the mashed potatoes. Taste for salt, adjust if needed, and top with lumps of butter. Potato, bacon, and scallion soup If you have a nice homemade chicken stock or even lamb stock, use it here, but plain water will do too, as you’ll still end up with smoky, oniony flavored broth, made silky with the potato starch. The potato can be cubed, or sliced into 1/8-inch rounds. Fry the bacon pieces first, adding the potatoes once the fat has rendered. After a few minutes, add the chopped scallions and stock, just covering the potatoes by an inch or two—don’t drown them. Simmer gently until potato is tender. Taste for salt, and add a few crack of black pepper. A bit of butter added at the end wouldn’t hurt either. Boxty Made with equal parts mashed and grated raw potato with a bit of flour to bind, boxty is a cross between potato pancakes and hash browns. Boil one large potato until tender, peel and mash in a bowl. Meanwhile, grate a separate raw potato, and squeeze out the water in a clean dish towel. Add to the mashed potato, sprinkle over a 1/4 cup of flour, and a pinch of baking soda, salt, and pepper, and mix. Drop tablespoon-sized scoops of potato mixture into a buttered medium-hot pan, flattening the pancakes slightly if too rounded. Pan-fry until golden and crusty, about 5 minutes per side.

Eillie Anzilotti,"If you need an example of something that is unequivocally bad for the environment, here’s a suggestion: plastic water bottles. One million are sold each minute across the world, and though they’re technically recyclable, only 7% of tossed bottles become new ones. The rest end up in landfills and waterways. Some companies are trying to mitigate this industry’s harm. Evian, for example, has pledged to create all of its plastic bottles from recycled plastic by 2025. And in recent years, the apparel industry has stepped up to make an impact by integrating recycled plastic bottles into supply chains. Adidas is integrating recycled plastic into its shoes, and the clothing startup Aday has developed a jacket spun from 41 reconstituted water bottles. One of the sectors for which incorporating recycled plastic makes the most sense is outdoor gear. That industry began gravitating toward synthetic materials like polyester and acrylic because they were cheap to produce, and performed well in extreme conditions. But manufacturing synthetic threads is as detrimental to the environment as making plastic bottles is. They both, after all, originate as crude oils, and not only are the processes water and energy intensive, they also require the use of chemicals that contaminate the environment. Companies like The North Face recognize that their use of synthetic materials is at odds with their sustainability goals–but also crucial for delivering their outdoorsy customers the high performance gear they expect. The ThermoBall, for instance, is one of the brand’s signature jackets. It’s got a quilted look as a result of its design, which features clusters of synthetic insulation designed to trap heat. This fall, The North Face rolled out an updated version of the ThermoBall, called the ThermoBall Eco, which is made from recycled materials. The shell is made from recycled polyester, and the insulation includes at least five plastic bottles that otherwise would’ve ended up in landfill. “Sustainable business practices are a part of our DNA,” says Tim Bantle, general manager for The North Face’s urban exploration and mountain lifestyle divisions. In 2017, the company introduced a “climate beneficial” beanie made with wool sourced from a sheep farm that sequesters carbon, and earlier this year, launched a collection of shirts and sweatshirts made from plastic collected from Yosemite, Grand Teton, and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks. The ThermoBall, Bantle says, is one of The North Face’s largest product collections, and being able to convert the whole line is a testament to how much materials innovation has evolved. “There are so many areas across our products where we could switch to more sustainable practices, but sometimes the technology or science hasn’t caught up,” he says. “In this case, everything lined up.” What’s also happening now is that some brands, like Aday, are launching amid all of these advances and incorporating them from the get-go. The Seattle-based company Arvin Goods is still new–it launched in 2017–and from the beginning, it’s been committed to creating basics like socks and underwear from recycled materials. Just this week, it rolled out its latest product line: A beanie made from a material called Polylana. Developed by a global organization called The Movement, which is working to push the fashion industry in a more sustainable direction, Polylana is essentially an alternative to 100% acrylic threads. The thread is formed from a combination of proprietary pellets created to mix seamlessly with recycled polyethylene terephtalate flakes–or in regular English, ground-up plastic bottles. In contrast to 100% acrylic, Polylana threads use 76% less energy, 85% less water, and result in 76% less waste. For Arvin Goods, working with Polylana threads made sense when rolling out a beanie line. Most beanies are made from 100% acrylic because it’s cheaper than wool, the other commonly used material, and less scratchy. “Acrylic is nasty, chemically,” says Arvin Goods cofounder Dustin Winegardner. “It uses a lot of water and energy.” By sourcing yarn for its beanies from Polylana, Arvin Goods can reduce acrylic use by 60%. (Polylana still has to be mixed with 40% acrylic to retain the “loft,” or slightly fluffy quality to the yarn that people expect in beanies, but ideally that could be switched out for a more sustainable material eventually.) “We say that our beanie is a reduced-impact choice,” Winegardner says. What’s most promising about these developments is the partnerships that brought them about. The North Face sources its insulation from PrimaLoft, a company that also supplies Patagonia (which has been incorporating plastic bottles in gear for several years) and other outdoor apparel companies. Polylana also supplies yarn to retailers like Esprit and Dorothy Perkins, neither of which are particularly upscale or environmentally conscious brands. These partnerships show that incorporating plastic bottles into supply chains is not only the right move, from an environmental standpoint–it’s also economically feasible for a variety of brands. And soon, for consumers, wearing plastic bottles may become the norm, not the exception.","Retailers like The North Face are converting entire product lines to incorporate recycled plastic–and making the case for more to do the same.

Associated Press,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Park officials say an autopsy found that a man whose body was discovered being eaten by a bear in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in September died of accidental methamphetamine intoxication, not a bear attack.
A park news release Monday says officials decided to euthanize the bear that was feeding on the body of 30-year-old William Lee Hill Jr. of Louisville, Tennessee.
Officials say they didn't know the definitive cause of death at the time but decided to euthanize a few days later for public safety reasons after consulting with wildlife professionals and further understanding the bear's aggressive behavior.
Officials estimate 1,500 bears are in the park along the Tennessee-North Carolina border, and though very few show aggressive behavior toward humans, bears that pose a threat to visitor safety are euthanized on rare occasions.

"Special to USA TODAY, Lindsay Cohn, Special to USA TODAY","Last Slide Next Slide During cooler months, guests at Willow-Witt Ranch in Ashland, Oregon, can warm up with a relaxing soak in the wood-heated, outdoor hot tub. (Photo: Dave Baldwin) Italy may have defined the concept of agriturismo (a working farm that takes in guests), but you don’t need a passport to have an authentic experience that brings you closer to the source. Domestic agritourism is on the rise. Potential reasons for the boom? The appeal of open space, starry skies, fragrant meadows and adorable animals is nothing new. But we live in a hyper-connected society and, while technology certainly has its benefits, the compulsion to be constantly plugged in has spurred a longing for simpler times. “People are looking for ‘real’ vacations,” says Beth Kennett of Vermont’s Liberty Hill Farm. “On a deeper level, most folks are generations away from having family involved in agriculture. Parents want their children to understand more about what they eat and the environment, and how those things are connected.” These days, travelers interested in learning where their food is grown and produced have an increasing number of options. Vacationers can hunker down at working farms and ranches throughout the United States. The result is a culinary immersion. More than just picking herbs and veggies from the garden, rural getaways allow people to reconnect with the land. Geography plays a major role in agritourism, which means your experience on a ranch in Oregon will differ from a dairy farm in Vermont. That said, you’ll find some commonalities. Topping the list are fresh fare, affordable accommodations and scenic surroundings. Think: Organic gardens, chicken coops, beehives, fruit orchards and verdant pastures for cattle to graze. Inviting guests to stay is a chance for growers, croppers and cultivators to share their world with others. Farm life isn’t easy — in fact, most will tell you it’s hard and humbling — but it’s rewarding and, best of all, delicious. If your fantasies are five-star fancy, agritourism probably isn’t for you. However, if you’re craving a truly meaningful trip (and you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty), these picturesque farms and ranches might be the perfect place to spend your next vacation. Liberty Hill Farm Rochester, Vermont This family-run dairy farm has welcomed tourists since 1984. Adults and kids of all ages can take part in an array of activities, from milking cows and bottle-feeding calves to fly fishing and hiking. Of course, you’ll need energy for all that. Luckily, a stay at Liberty Hill Farm includes lodging and meals. Days begin with a hearty breakfast and end with a home-cooked dinner. Willow-Witt Ranch Ashland, Oregon Seeking an off-the-grid escape? Consider Willow-Witt Ranch in southern Oregon. Guided by a commitment to environmental conservation and sustainable agriculture, this 445-acre property beckons visitors to discover the bounty of nature. There are some 200 plant varietals on the grounds, plus tons of animals. Whether you prefer gathering eggs, feeding pigs or sowing seeds, you’ll find plenty of Arcadian pursuits to fill your time. Blackberry Farm Walland, Tennessee Situated on 4,200 pristine acres in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, Blackberry Farm is a gastronomic destination, where traditional aggie practices still thrive. Guests are encouraged to participate in foraging excursions, gardening seminars, tasting tours and cooking classes at the acclaimed restaurant. Of course, epicurean delights aren’t the only draw. Horseback riding and archery are also popular. Hidden Villa Los Altos Hills, California When you think of Silicon Valley you probably don’t envision the countryside, but maybe you should. Forget high-speed Internet and social media — Hidden Villa (a nonprofit educational organization) is a tech-free zone, where roosters replace alarm clocks and the gentle babbling of Adobe Creek lulls you sleep at night. In addition to farm stays, the 1,651-acre land trust hosts after-school programs and summer camps. Monteillet Fromagerie Dayton, Washington Monteillet Fromagerie is the first artisanal cheese farmstead in the Walla Walla Valley — although it feels more like France than Washington. Helmed by Pierre-Louis and Joan Monteillet, the riverfront retreat is a glorious getaway. Rent the gîte (French for “holiday home”) and spend a few days soaking in the rustic charm, mingling with animals and mastering the art of hand-ladled chèvre. Taos Goji El Prado, New Mexico Nestled in San Cristobal, Taos Goji is an organic farm that offers WWOOFers and foodies alike a chance to stay on a homestead dating back to the 1880s. Historic cabins are fitted with functional kitchens, bathrooms, wood fire stoves and eco-friendly linens. Also up for grabs? Real-life lessons in harvesting, adobe brick building, caring for livestock and beekeeping. Inn at Valley Farms Walpole, New Hampshire Agrarian enthusiasts flock to the Inn at Valley Farms, part of a multi-generational countryside estate, in the fertile Monadnock Region of New Hampshire. Rooms are cozy and comfortable. Free weekly movie nights in the barn enhance the experience. Before you depart, stock up on grass-fed beef, local maple syrup, homemade jams as well as pasture-raised chickens, turkeys, pork and eggs at the farm store. Mountain Goat Lodge Salida, Colorado Mountain Goat Lodge is a bucolic farm and B&amp;B in the high desert of Colorado. Visitors get to interact with dairy goats and even bottle-feed kids (depending on the season). More than just cute pets, these critters provide milk for in-house cheese-making. Burgeoning shepherds can take classes on breeding, raising, herding and husbandry.

Matt K. Smith,"On a warm, clear November Tuesday in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, survivors paused to remember the dead—the 14 people killed in a fast-moving wildfire that swept out of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park a year ago, leaving behind more than 2,500 ruined homes and businesses. Rangers had been monitoring what was at first a small fire for five days, before it morphed and came roaring down the slopes of a 4,800-foot peak known as Chimney Tops, whipped on by wind gusts of up to 80 mph from an approaching storm. A deep, lengthy drought in the southern Appalachian Mountains had left plenty of dry brush, logs, and leaves in its path. As the fire moved toward Gatlinburg, park rangers and city officials struggled to communicate because their radios worked on different frequencies and large areas lacked cell phone service. The result was a fast-moving wall of flames that sent thousands fleeing in what looked like a road rally through hell. In addition to the dozen-plus lives lost, the 17,000-acre fire destroyed nearly $1 billion worth of property—much of it rental cabins that pump money into the local economy. Prosecutors accused two teens of starting the fires, but charges against them were later dropped. It’s been a year since a fast-moving wildfire swept out of the Great Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee and crept into the resort town of Gatlinburg below, killing more than a dozen people. Down the road in Pigeon Forge, Tony Watson had his eye on the next fire as the anniversary neared. Watson is the fire chief in Pigeon Forge, eight miles north of Gatlinburg. Though not as hard-hit as its neighbor, his town of 6,100 lost 19 homes in the city limits and another 269 in the nearby countryside. Watson and his firefighters are busy promoting ways to protect homes from what the National Park Service has called a “new normal”—a higher risk of wildfire, driven partly by climate change. Pigeon Forge is best known as the hometown of Dolly Parton and the country singer’s Dollywood theme park. Now it’s also seeking recognition as a “firewise community,” keeping the hazards of their mountain home near the top of people’s minds. Watson and his crews have so far advised about 100 property owners about what they can do to help defend against the threat of another fire. “It involves going out and assessing our residences and community businesses to give them recommendations to make their home more resilient from the threat of wildfire,” Watson said. “That may be anywhere from talking to them about fuels being next to the house, it could be combustibles storage, it could be thinning, it could be non-combustible plantings. We’re going out there and showing them what they can do.” Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge lie in the shadow of America’s most popular national park, which straddles Tennessee and nearby North Carolina and draws more than 11 million visitors per year. Urging communities in the Southeast to get ready for that “new normal” has become a cause for University of Tennessee geographer Henri Grissino-Mayer, a wildfire expert who has been telling residents to rebuild with the next blaze in mind. “To be sure, these same conditions are likely to align again in the future to allow for a large-scale wildfire that leaves the park and burns into the urban-interface,” the Park Service concluded in its after-action report on the disaster. Climate change is expected to worsen those dangers, the August report added—and it urged the agency and communities near the park to plan for threats that “can no longer be ignored.” You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason. The kind of fires that devastated Gatlinburg – or that struck towns north of San Francisco in October—are more common in the drier West, Grissino-Mayer said. But far more people live among the forests east of the Mississippi River, and they’re now facing the same risks their western cousins have lived with for years. “If you’re going to manage lands and manage forests, you have to accept the fact that wildfires are going to become more common,” Grissino-Mayer said. “They’re going to be more destructive, they’re going to kill more people and destroy more property. That’s the bottom line.” Grissino-Mayer said other Appalachian draws like Helen, Georgia—a mountain getaway about two hours north of Atlanta—could find themselves facing a Gatlinburg-type blaze. Modeled on an Alpine village and perched at the edge of the Chattahoochee National Forest, Helen “is literally the Georgia counterpart to Gatlinburg.” “It is these tourist towns that pose the greatest danger,” Grissino-Mayer said. “They are built up, made of wood—rustic, mountainous [and] surrounded by areas that were meant to burn.” North Georgia also saw unusually large wildfires in 2016, including one that scorched 25,000 acres about 50 miles west of Helen. Helen’s city manager, Jerry Jenkins, said his town has been looking for a way to address that risk “that’s reasonable, without too much additional costs.” “It’s hard to get people to go along with some of these things, because it costs them money, and they don’t want to do that,” Jenkins said. After Gatlinburg, the city sent out booklets with Firewise checklists to residents, but it hasn’t changed any building or zoning rules, he said. “I really wish I could tell you we were doing more. When things like that are over, it’s a big deal, then everybody lets it drop to the wayside. Hopefully, we will improve on that.” The prospect of more billion-dollar losses certainly has the attention of the insurance industry. The aftermath of a disaster like Gatlinburg “is really an opportunity to take a hard look at things and to try to make sure it doesn’t happen again—to change our policy, to change our behavior,” Rob Galbraith, director of underwriting research for Texas-based insurer USAA, said. But faced with the task of rebuilding, people have the urge “to put it behind them and move on.” “At a time when it seems like extreme weather events are increasing, we’re also building in these areas,” Galbraith said. “So I do think there’s going to be a kind of exponential curve if we’re not careful, where we’ll see more and more expensive disasters happening.” In Gatlinburg, however, not everyone buys the “new normal.” In a sharp public break with the Park Service, the city and surrounding Sevier County said they “strongly disagree” with that assessment. The statement said both agencies are working to improve their emergency management plans and conducting their own after-action reviews. But it called the disaster “an unprecedented event caused by a ‘perfect storm’ of extreme drought, hurricane-force winds, and arson. It was among the worst natural disasters in our nation’s history and no fire of this proportion has ever occurred in our region.” Grissino-Mayer said he and others were “blown away” by that statement. To ignore the experts who investigated the fire and the aftermath “is placing a lot of people and property in danger,” he said. Individual neighborhoods and people have shown interest in taking steps toward building more fire-safe communities, he said, but “they really need greater participation from the majority of the people.” Gatlinburg officials did not respond to requests for comment about the criticism and what they’re doing to address the risk of future fires.But back in Pigeon Forge, Watson said his town is acting on the warning the Park Service report delivered. Fire seasons are getting longer, intensifying faster, and getting bigger. And while droughts are hard to predict, Watson said the kind of winds that whipped up last year’s conflagration happen up to six times a year, and can potentially stoke stronger, more frequent wildfires. “That doesn’t mean it’s going to happen next week. It doesn’t mean it’s going to happen next year,” Watson said. But he added, “I do believe these things can occur again when those conditions arise. That’s what the science tells us.”",The resort towns nestled at the base of the Smoky Mountains are experiencing their first—but not last—wildfires.,2017-12-02T02:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thedailybeast.com'}",This Town Got Burned By Wildfires.

Issie Lapowsky,"Skooter McCoy was 20 years old when his wife, Michelle, gave birth to their first child, a son named Spencer. It was 1996, and McCoy was living in the tiny town of Cherokee, North Carolina, attending Western Carolina University on a football scholarship. He was the first member of his family to go to college. McCoy’s father had ruined his body as a miner, digging tunnels underneath lakes and riverbeds, and his son had developed a faith that college would lead him in a better direction. So McCoy was determined to stay in school when Spencer came along. Between fatherhood, football practice, and classes, though, he couldn’t squeeze in much part-time work. Michelle had taken an entry-level job as a teacher’s aide at a local childcare center right out of high school, but her salary wasn’t enough to support the three of them. Then the casino money came. Just months before Spencer was born, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians opened a casino near McCoy’s home, and promised every one of its roughly 15,000 tribal members—among them Skooter and Michelle—an equal cut of the profits. The first payouts came to $595 each—a nice little bonus, McCoy says, just for being. “That was the first time we ever took a vacation,” McCoy remembers. “We went to Myrtle Beach.” Once Spencer arrived, the checks covered the family’s car payments and other bills. “It was huge,” McCoy says. He graduated college and went on to coach football at the local high school for 11 years. Two decades later, McCoy still sets aside some of the money the tribe gives out twice a year to take his children—three of them, now—on vacation. (He and Michelle are separated.) And as the casino revenue has grown, so have the checks. In 2016, every tribal member received roughly $12,000. McCoy’s kids, and all children in the community, have been accruing payments since the day they were born. The tribe sets the money aside and invests it, so the children cash out a substantial nest egg when they’re 18. When Spencer’s 18th birthday came three years ago, his so-called “minor’s fund” amounted to $105,000 after taxes. His 12-year-old sister is projected to receive roughly twice that. Skooter McCoy, 41, got his first casino payout when he was 20. A former high school football coach, McCoy now runs the local Boys’ Club. In 2006, McCoy won the Frell Owl Award for contributions to the welfare of Cherokee children and families. He displays it on his desk at the Boys’ Club. McCoy is now general manager of the Cherokee Boys Club, a nonprofit that provides day care, foster care, and other services to the tribe. At 41, he has a shaved head and wears a gray Under Armour T-shirt over his sturdy frame, along with a rubber bracelet around his wrist that reads, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” The casino money made it possible for him to support his young family, but the money his children will receive is potentially life-altering on a different scale. “If you’ve lived in a small rural community and never saw anybody leave, never saw anyone with a white-collar job or leading any organization, you always kind of keep your mindset right here,” he says, forming a little circle with his hands in front of his face. “Our kids today? The kids at the high school?” He throws his arms out wide. “They believe the sky’s the limit. It’s really changed the entire mindset of the community these past 20 years.” These biannual, unconditional cash disbursements go by different names among the members of the tribe. Officially, they’re called “per capita payments.” McCoy’s kids call it their “big money.” But a certain kind of Silicon Valley idealist might call it something else: a universal basic income. The idea is not exactly new—Thomas Paine proposed a form of basic income back in 1797—but in this country, aside from Social Security and Medicare, most government payouts are based on individual need rather than simply citizenship. Lately, however, tech leaders, including Facebook founders Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes, Tesla’s Elon Musk, and Y Combinator president Sam Altman, have begun pushing the concept as a potential solution to the economic anxiety brought on by automation and globalization—anxiety the tech industry has played its own role in creating. If robots and offshoring take all the jobs, or at the very least displace the low-skilled ones, the thinking goes, there may come a time when there simply aren’t enough jobs to go around. What then? In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election, which some have attributed to this very tension, questions about how to support the so-called working class have only grown. Politicians have latched on too. In her new book, What Happened, Hillary Clinton writes that she considered rolling out a basic income policy during her 2016 campaign. In September, Silicon Valley congressperson Ro Khanna introduced a bill calling for a $1.4 trillion expansion of the earned income tax credit, which would effectively create a small basic income for low-income working people via tax credits. And the mayor of Stockton, California, recently announced that beginning in August 2018, the city plans to give all 300,000 of its citizens, regardless of their income, $500 a month, an experiment being funded by Hughes’s organization, the Economic Security Project. The Eastern Band of Cherokee isn’t the only group whose members get unconditional cash: The Alaska Permanent Fund has been giving $1,000 to $2,000 a year to its citizens for decades, and other Native American tribes have also divided up casino revenues. But the Cherokee example is among the most researched. Back in the 1990s, scholars at Duke were studying the mental health of Cherokee children in the region; then the casino was built, creating the conditions for a natural experiment. Three decades of longitudinal research backs up McCoy’s anecdotal evidence that the money has had profound positive effects. As the richest people in America fixate on how to give money to the poorest, the Cherokee program is a case study of whether a basic income is in fact a practical proposal for alleviating economic inequality or just another oversimplified, undercooked Silicon Valley fix to one of the most intractable problems our society faces. Or maybe it’s both. The biannual payments to every Cherokee tribal member comes from the profits from the Harrah’s casino. The Qualla Boundary, a 56,000-acre tract in western North Carolina, is the designated home of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, who have lived in the region for hundreds of years. The landscape is beautiful but dotted with signs of neglect. Along the stretch of road that spirals its way through the majestic, fog-capped Blue Ridge Mountains, each hairpin curve reveals a single-story motel, ramshackle gas station, or abandoned barbecue stand. Mobile homes sit idly along the roadside accumulating rust. Although the land is held in trust for the Cherokee, many white people, especially poor whites, live there too. The median household incomes in the counties of the Qualla fall well below the national figure. In Swain County, where the Boys’ Club is based, 24 percent of people live below the poverty line, about 12 percent higher than the national median. Asheville, with its craft breweries and art galleries, is about an hour’s drive east of the town of Cherokee. “Downtown” in Cherokee refers to a mile-long section of Tsali Boulevard lined with log cabin souvenir shops that hawk handwoven baskets and black bear figurines made in China. It was here, in the quiet shadow of the mountain range, that a team of researchers including Jane Costello, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, decided to ground the Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth. Costello wanted to find out about the need for mental health and psychiatric services for children in rural America, and in 1993 the researchers began studying 1,420 children, 350 of whom were members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. They divided the group into three age cohorts—9-year-olds, 11-year-olds, and 13-year-olds—and gave their parents thick, detailed personality surveys called the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, which were completed every year until the kids turned 16 and then again every few years until they turned 30. Looking for indicators of behavioral or emotional troubles, the researchers asked questions about whether the children ever engaged in physical fights and whether they had trouble being away from home. Costello and her team also recorded household data like parents’ occupations, history of domestic violence, and, crucially, income. When the study began, about 67 percent of the American Indian kids were living below the poverty line. It wasn’t until after the casino opened that Costello began to notice that household income among the Cherokee families was going up. It was subtle at first, but the trend turned sharply upward as time went on, eventually lifting 14 percent of the Cherokee children in the study above the poverty line. Household income for those families who were not Cherokee, meanwhile, grew at a slower rate. It was an awakening for Costello, who had accidentally stumbled onto an entirely new line of inquiry on the impact of unconditional cash transfers on the poor. “I suddenly thought, ‘Oh my god,’” Costello remembers. Research showed that when the Cherokee families started receiving regular cash payments, children were mentally healthier and stayed in school longer. In 1995, the tribe opened its first casino, a controversial decision among locals, who worried that gambling might attract unsavory characters to the area. It was Joyce Dugan, the tribe’s only female chief and a former teacher, who suggested that if the tribe were to benefit from its new casino, then every one of its members ought to get a cut too. The tribal council agreed. The casino started as a glorified arcade, filled with electronic poker and bingo machines, but it has now grown into the 21-story Harrah’s Cherokee Casino. All glass and stone, it juts out of the earth like one of the mountain’s many towering peaks. Inside, the casino floor is dotted with thick pillars, designed to look like giant trees, a reminder that the great outdoors is just beyond the cigarette smoke and zombie-themed slot machines. Harrah’s, which operates the casino, takes 3 percent of the $300 million annual profits. The bulk is funneled back into the community, covering infrastructure, health care for every tribal member, and the college education fund. Casino funds have paved roads and paid for a new $26 million wastewater treatment plant. Half of the profits go toward the per capita payments. The casino has become the tribe’s most precious resource. The Eastern Band’s change in fortunes also shifted the course of Costello’s research. “We thought it’d be interesting to see if it made any difference” to the children’s mental health, she says. They also started comparing the younger Cherokee children, whose families started accruing money earlier in their lives, to the older ones. They wanted to answer a simple question: Would the cash infusion benefit these kids in measurable ways? The answer defied Costello’s initial hypothesis. “I thought, ‘There’s such a pit of poverty there that this isn’t going to make any difference; it’s trivial,’” she remembers. “But it wasn’t.” Now the body of research that she and other academics have built has become a favorite point of reference for universal basic income advocates, providing some of the most compelling evidence yet of the positive effects of bestowing unconditional sums of cash on the poor. In two studies, one published in 2003 and a follow-up in 2010, Costello compared children who were lifted out of poverty after the casino opened to those who had never been poor. She scored them based on the presence of what researchers referred to as emotional disorders, like depression and anxiety, as well as behavioral disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Before the casino opened, Costello found that poor children scored twice as high as those who were not poor for symptoms of psychiatric disorders. But after the casino opened, the children whose families’ income rose above the poverty rate showed a 40 percent decrease in behavioral problems. Just four years after the casino opened, they were, behaviorally at least, no different from the kids who had never been poor at all. By the time the youngest cohort of children was at least 21, she found something else: The younger the Cherokee children were when the casino opened, the better they fared compared to the older Cherokee children and to rural whites. This was true for emotional and behavioral problems as well as drug and alcohol addiction. Other researchers have used Costello’s data to look at different effects of the casino payments. One fear about basic income is that people will be content living on their subsidies and stop working. But a 2010 analysis of the data, led by Randall Akee, who researches labor economics at the University of Southern California, found no impact on overall labor participation. Of course, the casino also brought jobs to the area, and the majority of the roughly 2,500 people the casino employs are tribal members. This would seem to confound the question of whether the tribal payment or casino income made the difference in the children’s lives, but Akee looked into this too. He found that, among the parents in Costello’s study, employment didn’t go up or down after the opening of the casino. Akee also looked at the effects of the money on education and found that more money in the household meant children stayed in school longer. The impact on crime was just as profound: A $4,000 increase in household income reduced the poorest kids’ chances of committing a minor crime by 22 percent. All of this amounted to substantial financial benefits for the community as a whole. “This translates to fewer kids in jail, fewer kids in in-patient care,” Costello says. “Then there are the other costs you can’t calculate. The cost of people not killing themselves? That’s a hard one.” Costello has been at the center of the research showing the effects of the casino payments, but during all the time in Qualla Boundary she says she had never even heard the term basic income. That is, until she started getting phone calls from people who were interested in the topic. People like Chris Hughes. The main drag in Cherokee is lined with log cabin souvenir shops that hawk handwoven baskets and black bear figurines made in China. Visitors to the town are greeted by a giant sculpture of a Cherokee warrior. Hughes grew up about a three-hour drive from Cherokee, in Hickory, North Carolina, where his mother worked as a public school teacher and his father was a traveling paper salesman. But that’s not what attracted Hughes to Costello’s work. He was interested in basic income primarily because at just 33 years old, Facebook has made him filthy rich—he’s worth roughly $1.5 billion—and he’s still grappling with how, exactly, that happened. “I’m proud of the work we did at Facebook, but I’ve also been very clear that the financial rewards I got were disproportionate to the work we put in,” Hughes says. He’s sitting cross-legged in a leather chair inside NeueHouse, a Manhattan warehouse that’s been converted into a swanky coworking space (top-tier membership costs $3,500 a month). “In human history, you have not had self-made wealth among twentysomethings on the order of magnitude we have today,” Hughes continues. “What’s making that possible? Because whatever it is, is happening at the same time median household wages have barely budged.” It’s true. Since 1980, average income for the top.01 percent of Americans has more than tripled. For the bottom 90 percent, it’s basically flat-lined. Hughes is among those who view the disparity as a national crisis. And so he recently launched the Economic Security Project, a two-year effort to invest $10 million from Hughes and others into research on universal basic income. This investment comes amid a sudden wave of interest in universal basic income in the tech industry. Y Combinator, the Palo Alto–based startup accelerator, announced in early 2016 that it was starting its own basic income experiment in which a small number of Oakland residents would receive a cash payment and be compared to a control group. Tesla’s Elon Musk, meanwhile, has warned about the rise of the robots, arguing at the World Government Summit earlier this year that a basic income is “going to be necessary.” And when Mark Zuckerberg delivered his commencement speech at Harvard in May, he advocated for a basic income, saying it would provide people with “a cushion to try new ideas."" According to Ro Khanna, who represents California’s 17th congressional district in the heart of Silicon Valley, the 2016 election woke techies up to the country’s glaring economic inequality. “They don’t want a populist backlash,” he says. “They don’t want a country divided by place.” Hughes called Costello while he was looking for basic income studies that the Economic Security Project might like to finance. The goal of the organization is to provide the money so that researchers can investigate the impact of a basic income on people’s lives. While Hughes has not funded Costello’s research, his group has contributed $1 million to Stockton, California’s basic income experiment, as well as to GiveDirectly, a Google-backed charity that is studying the impact of unconditional cash transfers in Kenya, and other projects. The Economic Security Project team also recently conducted its own survey of more than 1,000 Alaskans who receive roughly $2,000 per person, per year, through the Alaska Permanent Fund, which is drawn from oil revenues. It found that when faced with a choice between lowering taxes or keeping their cash payments, 71 percent of Alaskans say they want to keep the payments. “It feels like security,” Hughes says, “and in an economy that zigs and zags and has more part-time jobs, security is hard to come by.” Hughes is no basic income purist. He believes, for instance, that for this economic moonshot to be politically palatable, it would have to be tied to work. “Not just because it seems more intuitive for people,” he says, “but because work is a key source of purpose in our lives.” But the changing nature of work, particularly among top tech employers, is still a critical problem for the American workforce. One illuminating New York Times article illustrated how the men and women who scrub toilets and do other low-skilled work for companies like Apple are hired from contracting companies which set the terms of their employment. Those workers are cut off from the benefits and upward mobility that the company’s engineers and marketers enjoy. Because the workers are contractors, the big tech companies feel no pressure to raise their wages, and aren’t responsible for offering health-care coverage. In 2015, Facebook’s bus drivers voted to unionize in order to secure themselves the kind of worker protections that the social networking giant refused to provide. Looked at in this light, the tech-led efforts to push a basic income can appear hypocritical. In a new economy that mints billionaires overnight, giving millions of dollars away for experimentation is the easy part. It’s taxpayers, after all, not individual tech companies, who would have to pay for a basic income should one ever come to pass. Spencer McCoy, 21, is now in college and hopes to use his “big money” to start a business. A legislated basic income is in the realm of fantasy at the moment. Even among its proponents there is almost no agreement about the fundamentals, starting with how much money would be an optimal basic income. Ioana Marinescu, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy and Practice, who researches basic income, says that research on the Alaska fund is enlightening, but not dispositive. “We know $2,000 a year makes a real difference to many people,” Marinescu says. “But would something lower still make a difference? We don’t know.” Others argue that the problem with a universal basic income is the “universal” part. In a world in which every American gets a check, some of that money would necessarily be squandered on rich people. Some libertarian groups like the Cato Institute support the idea, seeing it as a way to replace the country’s existing social safety net programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps, an idea liberals deplore. “When resources for antipoverty policies are scarce and dwindling, especially in this Congress, we need to be careful about our targeting,” says Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the former chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. Bernstein prefers something like an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, such as the one Silicon Valley’s Khanna has introduced, which he says would put extra money where it is needed—in the pockets of working people. He concedes, however, that Khanna’s bill, the Grow American Incomes Now Act, is essentially on a hopeless path in the current Congress. “An idea like Ro’s is going to take a long runway,” Bernstein says. “It ain’t going to happen soon, but that doesn’t mean that if we were strategic it won’t happen later.” Even in a fever dream scenario in which a basic income could pass in Congress, there is so far little evidence that it would help the “forgotten men and women” whom Trump described in his campaign—the people whose plight supposedly woke Silicon Valley up to this problem to begin with. After all, $2,000 a year hardly feels like an adequate substitute for a disappeared $50,000 union job at the local steel mill. Even in Cherokee country, where the additional income is quite sizable, the payments are not enough to live on. That suggests a basic income may not be the life raft for working class adults that its proponents suggest it would be. But it could be something different: It could be an investment in their children’s future. During his 11 years as a high school football coach, and now working at the Boys’ Club, Skooter McCoy has seen just about every way that the casino money can be wasted. He remembers two football players who, after graduation, flew from Asheville to Key West and then road tripped their way back up the coast, stopping in beach town after beach town, and burning through tens of thousands of dollars of their newfound wealth. “I said, ‘Boys, you had an opportunity with this money to take care of yourselves for the majority of your lives. What do you have to say for yourselves?’” McCoy remembers. “They said, ‘Well, it was one hell of a month, coach.’” The money hasn’t exempted the community from the drug epidemic that has swept through so much of Appalachia, either. In fact, according to McCoy, when the checks come out twice a year, there seems to be an uptick in overdoses. “There are times when some people say members don’t even get a check, because they’re indebted to a dealer,” McCoy says. “When they get their check, they hand it right over.” As with any program, there are infinite opportunities for abuse and bad decisionmaking. But over time, the tribe has made tweaks to try to prevent recklessness. The tribal council recently passed legislation, for instance, that staggers the minor’s fund payouts. Now the tribe will give members $25,000 when they turn 18, $25,000 when they turn 21, and the rest when they’re 25. Spencer McCoy is now 21. Like his father, he has a square jaw and deep brown eyes, and he talks readily about the importance of Christianity in his life. He followed his dad to Western Carolina University, where he played football, before transferring to Mars Hill University, where he is pursuing a marketing degree. Like Skooter, Spencer imagined a different life for himself. But there’s one crucial difference between them: Unlike his father, Spencer says, he never doubted that he could have that life. “In my grandpa’s time, nobody from my area was going to college. My dad accepted a football scholarship, but without it I doubt he would have been able to go,” Spencer says. “Now we can go to school practically anywhere in the country, and they pay for it. That’s a really big deal.” When Spencer first got his “big money,” he says, “I’d get online and I was looking for trucks and stuff, but I thought at the end of the day, it wasn’t really worth it.” Aside from a used bass boat he bought to take out fishing, Spencer has stashed most of the money away in hopes of using it to start his own business one day. The true impact of the money on the tribe may not really be known until Spencer’s generation, the first born after the casino opened, is grown up. For the techies backing basic income as a remedy to the slow-moving national crisis that is economic inequality, that may prove a tedious wait. Still, if anything is to be learned from the Cherokee experiment, it’s this: To imagine that a basic income, or something like it, would suddenly satisfy the disillusioned, out-of-work Rust Belt worker is as wrongheaded as imagining it would do no good at all, or drive people to stop working. There is a third possibility: that an infusion of cash into struggling households would lift up the youth in those households in all the subtle but still meaningful ways Costello has observed over the years, until finally, when they come of age, they are better prepared for the brave new world of work, whether the robots are coming or not.","Thanks to a profitable casino, an Indian tribe gives its members sizeable cash payments.

Bianca Nogrady,"T he peatlands that drape the high, treeless slopes surrounding Australia’s tallest peak form a natural archive. “They are unusual bits of landscape in that they actually record their own history,” says Geoffrey Hope, an environmental historian at the Australian National University, who has been studying these unique bogs for more than 15 years. The brumbies have created gullies through the peatlands, increased turbidity in streams, trampled vegetation, and created manure piles acting as ‘invasion windows’ for exotic plants. In this famously dry continent, the peatlands of Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales are remarkable in their persistent sogginess. They experience heavy frost and snow in winter and, occasionally bushfires in summer. Yet somehow, they endure, providing a haven for one of Australia’s most critically-endangered species, the brilliant yellow and black Corroboree Frog. But recently, a new history is being stamped into these delicate ecosystems by the hooves of wild horses. Locally known as brumbies, the region’s free-roaming horses — technically feral, though colloquially called wild — are the descendants of those supposedly abandoned by English settler James Brumby when he left Australia for Tasmania in 1804. As the wild herds grew, so did their tough and hardy reputation, catching the imagination of Australian poet Andrew Barton ‘Banjo’ Paterson. Paterson’s iconic 1890 poem ‘The Man From Snowy River’ turned the region’s hard-riding and fearless horsemen into legends, spawning three films, a television series, and even a live arena spectacular. It laid the groundwork for today’s extensive mythology around the brumbies, which can border on the mystical. “I ask the House to picture this image: a beautiful stallion running wild and free, his muscles bulging with strength,” John Barilaro, the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, told Parliament in June 2015. “When he stands up on his back hooves, one is overcome by his grace and power. There is nothing quite like seeing a brumby in the wild.” But as brumby numbers have risen, they have inflicted increasing damage on fragile alpine habitats. Today these two cultural icons — the native Australian peatlands and the introduced European horses — are fighting each other for survival. Scientists, environmentalists, and even animal welfare experts are now calling for a substantial cull of brumbies to stop the devastation these large animals are causing in the Kosciuszko National Park. Such a decision is highly controversial. Brumby supporters say the horses are a significant part of Australia’s history, and a unique breed famed for their hardiness. It’s a view supported by the majority of New South Wales Parliament, which has just passed legislation to recognize and protect the heritage value of ‘sustainable’ wild horse populations in the national park. In his speech to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly about the bill, Barilaro — whose electorate includes the Kosciuszko National Park — made it very clear that his intention with the legislation was to put an end to any possibility of lethal control methods, such as ground or aerial shooting. But evidence suggests that culling may be the only viable way to bring brumby numbers down to manageable levels. In 2016, the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage published a review of the previous wild horse management plan for Kosciuszko National Park. That plan, passed in 2008, relied on trapping the brumbies with lures, and then removing them from the park for domestication and re-homing. But the review found that only 583 of the 3,183 horses removed from the park since 2002 were actually re-homed. Due to a lack of demand, the other 2,600 horses were sent to a processing plant or slaughterhouse. The federal Bureau of Land Management in the United States has faced a similar challenge in trying to re-home captured mustangs — descendants of horses brought to North America by the Spanish. Rising numbers of these similarly feral horses threaten the desert ecosystems of the Western rangelands, but because their slaughter has effectively been prohibited, the Bureau itself currently cares for some 45,000 captured animals in pens and pastures, at a lifetime cost of around $50,000 each. Earlier this year, New South Wales Deputy Premier John Barilaro introduced legislation (which was passed in June) to ban the culling of brumbies in Kosciuszko National Park. Share this story! The animal welfare implications are of considerable concern to Bidda Jones, chief science and strategy officer for the animal welfare organization RSPCA Australia. Jones calls the process “extremely traumatic.” She explains, “They’re trapped in the park, then put in a stock trailer, driven to the depot, then put on a truck and taken to another place. How many times that continues depends on where they end up.” In Australia, there are only two slaughterhouses licensed to export horse meat, both of which are more than 600 miles away from the national park. Jones, along with Geoffrey Hope and six others, were appointed by the state environment department to an Independent Technical Reference Group in 2014 to advise the department as it drafted a new wild horse management plan. The group found that while it was difficult to pin down exact horse numbers, the evidence for their environmental harm was clear. One major concern was the impact of brumbies’ hard hooves on the banks of streams. “The banks are highly organic, and the ones there have taken thousands of years to build up,” Hope said. “I’ve got cases of streams that were formerly little narrow, deep, windy things — you could hear the water flowing, but you couldn’t see it really because the vegetation has grown over. I’ve gone back to those sites [after brumbies have been near them] and they’re five meters wide and sandy, with no banks at all.” “They’re trapped in the park, then put in a stock trailer, driven to the depot, then put on a truck and taken to another place. How many times that continues depends on where they end up.” The group noted research showing that in addition to compacting soils, the brumbies created gullies through the peatlands, draining them of moisture. They also increased turbidity in streams, trampled vegetation, and created manure piles acting as ‘invasion windows’ for exotic plants. With brumby numbers now so high — estimates range anywhere from 3,000 to 14,000 — the experts concluded that culling should be included in any plan to sustainably manage them in the national park. Having considered all management options, the group — including Jones — concluded that aerial shooting of brumbies was the most humane and effective means of lethal control, particularly in the less accessible areas of the park. But the experts were instructed by Barilaro, then the local member of Parliament but not yet the deputy premier, not to recommend aerial shooting. Aerial shooting had previously been used to cull 606 wild horses in 2000 in Guy Fawkes River National Park in northeastern New South Wales. That cull sparked public outrage, with accusations that horses were left to die with horrific injuries. A later investigation found only one horse had survived two weeks with serious gunshot wounds, but by then the public had turned against culls. The state government issued a permanent ban on aerial shooting of horses in the state of New South Wales, where Kosciuszko National Park is also located. The Independent Technical Reference Group’s report informed the revised wild horse management plan for Kosciuszko National Park, released in draft form in May 2016, which set a target to reduce the wild horse population by more than 3,000 within five to 10 years. The management plan, which was put together by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, recommended a range of control methods, including trapping for re-homing or slaughter, fertility control, fencing … and ground-based shooting. This final plan was scheduled to be released later that year, but was delayed and has now been superseded by the new heritage legislation, which effectively bans lethal control measures of any kind. The Kosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Bill passed on June 6, prompting one scientist on the NSW Threatened Species Scientific Committee — ecologist David Watson — to resign in protest. The bill has been publicly denounced by the Australian Academy of Science, the Ecological Society of Australia described it as “reckless, cruel and unachievable,” the International Union for the Conservation of Nature wrote a letter of protest, and members of the Independent Technical Reference Group issued a letter expressing its concern that the bill would “make it impossible to conserve the unique environmental values of Kosciuszko National Park.” (Barilaro’s office did not respond to requests for comment.) The NSW environment minister Gabrielle Upton’s office said the new legislation would seek “a balance between protecting the heritage values of the wild horses and the other environmental values of the Park.” Meanwhile, Barilaro and pro-brumby groups acknowledge some brumbies need to be relocated from the more ecologically sensitive areas of Kosciuszko National Park to other areas within the park where they can be sustainably managed. They support the continued use of trapping, mustering, and rehoming to achieve this, but oppose any culling. However, there’s little detail on where those less-sensitive areas might be, and some — like ecologist Don Driscoll — argue that feral horses have no place anywhere in the national park. “One of the key points I’ve been making is how little national park-protected areas there are in New South Wales; less than 9 percent of the land is set aside for native Australian species,” says Driscoll, a terrestrial ecologist and director of the Center for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University. In addition to providing habitat for the Corroboree frog, Kosciuszko National Park also shelters other endangered species, including the Smoky Mouse, Raleigh Sedge, Mountain Pygmy Possum, Guthega Skink, and the Stock Galaxias fish. “It’s a slap in the face to everybody who’s been working hard to stop these species going extinct, to have a recognized threatening process banged right on top of your last populations.” “It’s a slap in the face to everybody who’s been working hard to stop these species going extinct, to have a recognized threatening process banged right on top of your last populations,” Driscoll says. Despite the outrage over aerial shooting, it’s a strategy already employed in Kosciuszko National Park to control feral pigs. Across the state border in the Victoria’s Alpine National Park, shooting is used to manage feral deer. It’s also one way brumby numbers are controlled in the nearby Namadgi National Park, in the neighboring Australian Capital Territory. Finally kangaroos — a native animal so iconic that it features on the Australian national coat of arms — are widely killed by ground-based shooting. In fact, barely a week after his legislation to protect the brumbies passed Parliament, Barilaro announced an expansion in kangaroo culls in western New South Wales to aid drought-stricken farmers. The irony is not lost on Graham Moore, a Gurrungutti man and Aboriginal liaison officer with the nearby Bega Valley Shire Council, who has worked in natural resource management for more than 30 years. “If you go to the far west, there’s kangaroo culling because there’s an impact on their crops,” Moore says. “I’ve got no problems with brumbies — they are a magnificent animal.” But, he notes, horses were introduced, not native. “If they’re culling roos, why can’t they cull and manage, with a control measure, the brumbies?” Bianca Nogrady is a freelance science journalist and broadcaster whose work has appeared in, among other publications, Scientific American, Nature, The Guardian, and Australian Geographic.","Experts are calling for a substantial cull of wild horses living in Kosciuszko National Park.

Steven Diaz/Walt Disney World Resort via Getty Images With roller coasters and water slides, amusement parks are an essential part of summer in America. A cross-country tour of the US will take you to the world's tallest steel coaster, the steepest wooden coaster, and the tallest steel-on-wood hybrid. MONEY tells us the best amusement parts in the country and the best rides to go on if you visit. Nothing screams summertime quite as much as amusement parks. They are the one place you can walk for miles, listening to screaming thrill seekers and munching on sugary funnel cakes. If you're an adrenaline addict, you can tour the US to find the world's tallest steel coaster, the steepest wooden coaster, and tallest steel-on-wood hybrid ride. To find out which parks offer the biggest thrills, MONEY partnered with Yelp to identify the country's best amusement parks, as well as the best rides at each attraction. Whether these parks are driving distance or require planning, we guarantee they are worth a trip. Here are the 10 best amusement parks in the country: 1. Disneyland Park Anaheim, California Hottest ride: Hyperspace Mountain The happiest place on Earth doesn't disappoint visitors, earning the top spot among all other amusement parks. Walt Disney came up with the idea for the park himself, helping with the original design and layout. The park is now home to classic rides like the Pirates of the Caribbean boat cruise and the dizzying Matterhorn Bobsleds. The most popular ride is the indoor, space-themed roller-coaster Hyperspace Mountain, which features Star Wars-themed clips and simulators. If you've still got an appetite, you can grab Mickey Mouse beignets at the park's New Orleans Square, or seafood at Ariel's Grotto, named after the character in The Little Mermaid. Those who want the full Disney experience night and day can stay at its resort hotels, the Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa and the Disneyland Hotel. Ticket prices vary depending on the day. Regular prices rose earlier this year to $117 ; peak prices are een higher. According to the Disneyland's website, two-day passes start at $105 per day for ages 10 and older. 2. Magic Kingdom Park at Disney World Lake Buena Vista, Florida Hottest ride: Space Mountain Disneyland's sister park in Lake Buena Vista takes the No. 2 spot, ensuring Mickey Mouse's dominance. Magic Kingdom Park is one of four themed parks inside Disney World, and is recognizable by its majestic Cinderella castle. You'll find characters from Disney classic movies like Aladdin, Mickey Mouse and Peter Pan roaming the streets, and kid-friendly rides, like the giant spinning tea cups at Mad Tea Party. Be sure to check out Space Mountain, the park's most popular ride. You'll zip through the ""galaxy"" on an indoor roller-coaster, inside a dark room illuminated by ""stars."" Another popular ride to try is Splash Mountain, which delivers a slow cruise up a mountain before taking a 50-foot drop into a pool of water. Tickets to Disney World don't come cheap. Two-day tickets, which also give you a day in one other Disney World park, cost $209 per person ages 10 and up. If you want to max out your visit, Travel + Leisure suggests visiting on a Friday when Magic Kingdom is open extra hours. 3. Cedar Point Sandusky, Ohio Hottest ride: Millennium Force Sometimes dubbed ""America's Roller Coast,"" Cedar Point is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the US The Midwestern park features 71 rides over 364 acres of space. This year, the park opened the Steel Vengeance, the tallest and fastest hybrid (wood-plus-steel) roller-coaster in the world ; it's 205 feet tall, runs at 74 mph, and goes upside down four times, in and out of loops. The park's most popular ride, however, is the Millennium Force, a steel coaster that opened in 2000 and was briefly the tallest and fastest coaster in the world. The 310-foot-tall, two-minute ride reaches speeds of 93 mph. Riders must be at least 48 inches tall. Daily admission to the park varies depending on the time, but prices typically start at around $50. 4. Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Virginia Hottest ride: Griffon The Busch Gardens theme parks have sites in both Tampa and Williamsburg, but the Virginia location comes out on top. The 383-acre park's thrilling coasters including the 360-degree virtual reality adventure ride Battle for Eire, the bumpy wooden Invadr, and the interlocking, double looping Loch Ness Monster. Or try the park's most popular ride, Griffon, if you want to drop 90 degrees straight down from 205 ft in the sky — while going 75 mph. The park also offers a selection of fare from around the world: try German classics (including sausages and hot red cabbage) and different types of craft beer at the Brauhaus; fill up on stew and corned beef sandwiches at the Irish O'Tators ; or feast on cannolis at the Italian-style Marco Polo's Marketplace. One-day tickets vary in price, but average $70 for rides alone, or $95 for rides and all-day dining and drinks. 5. Hersheypark Hershey, Pennsylvania Hottest ride: Storm Runner Founded by Milton S. Hershey, Hersheypark was originally developed as a space for his chocolate factory employees to relax. Over the decades since, the park has introduced a variety of roller-coasters and a waterpark. Recently, the park opened the country's first ""choose your own thrill"" coaster that lets riders choose between three different plummets. The park's most popular ride, however, is the Storm Runner: Its 2,600-foot-long course is relatively short, at just 30 seconds, but takes riders from 0 to 72 mph in just two seconds. If coasters aren't your speed, meet some candy bars ""characters"" — like a Hershey's bar and a Reese's Cup — during Breakfast at the Park. You could also visit ZooAmerica, the year-round zoo adjacent to Hersheypark and home to 200 animals form across North America. One-day tickets to the park cost $66.95, while two-day tickets cost $85. 6. Dollywood Pigeon Forge, Tennessee Hottest ride: Mystery Mine Dollywood is named after Dolly Parton who cofounded the park with theme park giants Herschend Family Entertainment. The park is situated in the Smoky Mountains, so that you can admire their natural beauty in the seconds you're up on top of the rides. The 150-acre theme park boasts many roller-coasters, including the Mystery Mine, which took top marks from Yelp — a steel 1,811-foot-track coaster that travels through what purports to be an abandoned coal mine. Dollywood's Splash Country Water Park Adventure has many thrilling water slides and kid-friendly pools. Unwind at the park's onsite hotel, the DreamMore Resort and Spa, where you can get Southern-style barbecue dinners at the Song &amp; Hearth restaurant. 7. Carowinds Charlotte, North Carolina Hottest ride: Fury 325 This North Carolina Peanuts-themed amusement park boasts many thrilling coasters, including the vertical looping ride Vortex, the Afterburn (with a 113-foot drop), and the whirlwind Carolina Cyclone. The most popular ride, however, is Fury 325, the world's tallest and fastest "" giga coaster "" — a category defined as being between 300 and 399 feet tall and completing a full circuit. You'll reach a peak height of 325 feet and reach speeds up to 95 mph. Fury 325 is also North America's longest steel roller-coaster, at 1.25 miles, and the average ride time is 3.25 minutes. Younger children can head over to Camp Snoopy for kiddie rides and a chance to see the Peanuts characters in person, or head over to Harmony Hall Market Place for a lunchtime dance party with Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the rest of the gang. Daily ticket rates at Carowinds vary, but start at $67 at the gate. 8. Silver Dollar City Branson, Missouri Hottest ride: Outlaw Run Silver Dollar City is a 1880s mining village themed park with over 40 rides. The park also hosts 10 festivals throughout the year, including the National Crafts &amp; Cowboy Festival, featuring barn dancing and 125 visiting craftsmen. The park just opened its Time Traveler ride, the fastest, steepest, and tallest spinning complete-circuit roller-coaster in the world. The most popular ride, however, is the wooden coaster Outlaw Run — the only wood coaster that twists upside down three times, and reaches speeds up to 68 miles per hour. When the rides wear you out, try the signature succotash skillet dishes, made up of sauteed chicken, corn, yellow squash, peppers and okra. The skillets can be found in various locations throughout the park. For dessert, grab a handful of fudges, brittles and candy made right before your eyes at Brown's candy factory. One-day general admission tickets cost $65 for adults 12-61, $54 for children 4-11, and $63 for seniors aged 62 years old or over. 9. Canobie Lake Park Salem, New Hampshire Hottest ride: Untamed Canobie Lake Park started as a trolley park — a recreational area at the end of the streetcar lines. The park featured a botanical garden, an arcade and an area for canoeing. The thrills have accelerated a bit since those days. Hop on a grizzly bear-style cart on Untamed, the park's most popular ride, to be dropped ""beyond vertically"" — at 97 degrees — from 72 feet in the air. Other rides include the Yankee Cannonball, a wooden roller-coaster that lasts 60 seconds, and the spinning Ice Jet. To cool off on a warm day, get soaked on the Boston Tea Party ride, which drops riders from 50 feet into nearly 250,000 gallons of water. Elsewhere in the park, try St. Louis style barbecue ribs and pulled pork at Smokin' BBQ, or see if you can use critical problem-solving skills to escape the Puzzle Rooms. General admission tickets cost $39 at the gate and online. 10. Castles N' Coasters Phoenix, Arizona Hottest ride: Desert Storm Castles N' Coasters features four outdoor mini-golf courses, several rides, a go-kart track and an indoor video game arcade. The Desert Storm Roller Coaster, the park's most popular ride, features loops, twists and vertical drops. You could also hop on Skywire, a popular zip-line attraction that lets guests soar across the park, or take young kids to the Junior Dixie Wheel — children can ride this one even without an adult. When you're hungry, try to get chicken and waffles and ice cream in waffle cones at Waffles~n~Stuff, or build your own tacos for just $2.50 each at Tacos~n~Stuff. The bronze pass, which gets you unlimited rides all day, costs $29.99 per person ; tickets that include mini golf and arcade games are more expensive.","Steven Diaz/Walt Disney World Resort via Getty Images With roller coasters and water slides, amusement parks are an essential part of summer in America.

"USA TODAY, Michael Collins, USA TODAY","Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, showed up on his first day in office on horseback, and now he’s got a very interesting way of letting people know whether he's there or not. Buzz60 In this Jan. 17, 2017, file photo, Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont. testifies on Capitol Hill. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) WASHINGTON – Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is moving forward with a plan to relocate thousands of federal employees across the country as part a major reorganization that aims to put the department’s resources closer to the national parks and other public lands that it manages. The department has included $18 million for the reorganization in the budget request that it sent to Congress on Monday. The proposal will be forwarded in the next couple of weeks to the nation’s governors. Other details will be made public during congressional hearings on the department’s proposed $11.7 billion budget, Zinke told reporters earlier this week. Zinke argues the restructuring, which is expected to begin this year, is needed to cut red tape and better manage the natural resources and cultural heritage sites the department is charged with protecting and to preserve them for future generations. “It’s time to look 100 years into the future to make sure we are organized to address the challenges we know are going to occur,” he said. The Interior Department manages 500 million acres of public land, a fifth of the total surface area of the United States. Of that total, some 85 million acres are part of the National Park Service. The proposal would divide the country into 13 regions, the boundaries of which would be based upon watersheds and geographic basins rather than by individual states. Employees in some key agencies within the department, such as the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Reclamation, could be relocated to the western United States to bring them closer to the resources they are tasked with managing. The goal, Zinke said, is to place an individual park or asset in one region, which would it easier for employees to work together and avoid some of the management headaches that can occur when more than one federal agency is involved. Right now, for example, a salmon stream located near a lock or dam could fall under the jurisdiction of multiple federal agencies. More: After Bears Ears, Trump administration ponders more changes to national monuments To carry out his vision, Zinke will need the approval of Congress, which must sign off on the relocation of a large number of federal employees. So far, the proposal has gotten mixed reviews among lawmakers. ""Moving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to Colorado would bring the agency closer to the vast public lands we all cherish and share, and that is a good thing,” said Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo. “We have a strong and growing outdoor and recreation industry across our state that relies on public lands that helps make Colorado an excellent candidate for the new BLM headquarters.” Other Congress members said that while they are generally supportive of restructuring federal agencies, they are concerned that offices would be eliminated or that individual states would be placed in multiple regions under the proposed boundaries. Tennessee, for example, would be placed in two regions. Colorado would be split among three. “The secretary's idea of creating common boundaries could lead to a more efficient operation, but I want to make sure that splitting Tennessee into two regions doesn't create some unintended problems,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., called the reorganization “concerning” because, he said, it appears to eliminate the Navajo Regional Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. “A change of this magnitude should only come after extensive, meaningful government-to-government consultation with the affected tribes,” Heinrich said. “On its face, this looks more like a dismantling than a reorganization.” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., supports efforts to move more of the federal government out of Washington but thinks that any relocation should improve the Bureau of Land Management’s work with state and local partners, his office said. More: National Park Service proposes new $70 entrance fee at popular parks Advocacy groups also have raised concerns about the restructuring and its impact on the National Park Service. “We’re chiefly concerned about the lack of detail, in particular for a Park Service that has been struggling with considerably insufficient staffing and other budgetary challenges,” said John Garder, a senior director with the National Parks Conservation Association. Garder said the Park Service is currently operating with 11 percent fewer employees than just five years ago. “While there may be opportunities for efficiencies, which are always welcome, we don’t want to see the role of the National Park Service diminished,” he said. Park advocates also are worried about “the morale expense” of reshuffling federal employees, whose jobs may be relocated or abolished, said Phil Francis, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, which represents nearly 1,400 current, former and retired Park Service employees. “It will affect many, many people’s lives, people who have dedicated maybe 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives to serving the American public,” said Francis, former superintendent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. “I just don’t believe the outcome will produce results that are worth the investment.” Zinke said he doesn’t expect any layoffs will be necessary because the reorganization will take several years. Sixteen percent of the department’s 70,000 employees are already eligible for retirement, he said, and that number will jump to 40 percent within five years. As employees retire, their positions could be reclassified and their jobs moved closer to the front lines “where they belong,” he said.

Joseph Hudak,"Dolly Parton will become the first country-music artist to be named the MusiCares Person of the Year in the honor’s 29-year history. The Recording Academy will salute the Tennessee native, who rose from poverty in the Smoky Mountains to become a global superstar, at a February 8th, 2019, ceremony in Los Angeles. The MusiCares Person of the Year event is traditionally held during Grammy Week and features a host of artists paying tribute to the honoree. (This year’s Grammys are set for February 10th.) Last year, Harry Styles, Keith Urban and Miley Cyrus were among those performing for Fleetwood Mac, the first-ever band to receive the designation. While guest artists have yet to be announced, it’s a fair bet that Cyrus will make a return appearance for Parton — the 9 to 5 actress is the pop star’s godmother. Along with being known for such hits as “Coat of Many Colors,” “I Will Always Love You” and the Kenny Rogers duet “Islands in the Stream,” Parton is a musician, author, namesake of the Dollywood amusement park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, and philanthropist. Her Imagination Library, an initiative to encourage children to read by distributing free books, recently delivered its 100th million book. In 2017, Parton released the children’s album I Believe in You, and sings with Alison Krauss on a just-released tribute LP to Roger Miller. In 2019, she will receive her second star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her role in the Trio collaboration with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. Proceeds from the MusiCares benefit concert support the MusiCares charity, the Recording Academy’s campaign to provide people in the music industry a “place to turn in times of financial, medical, and personal need.”","Singer, songwriter, actor and philanthropist will be honored February 8, 2019, in Los Angeles",2018-09-05T00:26:28Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Rollingstone.com'}",Dolly Parton Named 2019 MusiCares Person of the Year,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dolly-parton-named-2019-musicares-person-of-the-year-719138/,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dollymusicares.jpg,,Rollingstone.com,Smoky Mountains,0

Angela Gosnell, Knoxville News Sentinel Mitzie Sue ""Susan"" Clements with her daughter (Photo: National Park Service) The family of Mitzie Sue ""Susan"" Clements, whose body was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park late Tuesday afternoon, a week after she disappeared while hiking with her daughter, issued a statement Wednesday. I want to specifically thank the National Park Service for their incredible efforts. The cooperation shown between more than 50 agencies was amazing, comforting, and very supportive,"" reads the statement, provided by the park. ""Every piece of the operation, including the scientific fronts, logistical parts, and the emotional support provided to us was very impressive. ""The children, her sisters, and I want to especially thank Jared St. Clair (Chief Ranger), Joe Pond (Incident Commander), James Latendresse (Operations Chief), and Florie Takaki (Family Liaison) for their dedication and support. We also want to thank the countless other people who helped look for Susan. This includes the ground searchers, pilots, drone operators, dog trackers, technicians, EMS providers, the many teams of tactical climbers and rescuers, and the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The kids, her sisters, and I greatly appreciate the intense work they performed for us, and we will be eternally grateful. Exhaustive search with 175 assisting Clements, a 53-year-old mother of three from Cleves, Ohio, had been missing since Sept. 25, when she and her daughter became separated during a hike on the Forney Ridge Trail. The daughter hiked ahead and lost sight of Clements about 5 p.m., then reported her missing roughly three hours later, according to park spokeswoman Julena Campbell. The Clingmans Dome area received more than 5 inches of rain over the first couple of days, making it difficult for searchers to find tracks and canine teams to pick up on scents, Campbell said. Fog further complicated early search efforts, and rangers reported struggling with ""incredibly low visibility"" as they navigated the treacherous terrain, she added.

(Photo: Brianna Paciorka/News Sentinel ) The search grew in size and scope as days passed without any sign of Clements. Rangers interviewed hikers in the area, but no one reported seeing her after she went missing. An estimated 175 personnel joined the effort, including trained searchers, doctors and scientists. Crews employed dogs, helicopters and specialized search-and-rescue drones. Search teams ultimately found Clements' body off trail in a rugged, heavily wooded area of the Huggins Creek drainage, in Swain County, North Carolina, officials said. A news release from the park describes the area as 2 miles west of the Clingmans Dome parking area and three-quarters of a mile south of the Appalachian Trail. What happened to Clements after she disappeared remains unclear. Her cause of death is still under investigation. Officials said Wednesday that foul play was not suspected but declined to offer further details.

Jon Freeman,"Dolly Parton ’s newly released “Girl in the Movies,” a song from the forthcoming soundtrack of the Netflix film Dumplin’, is sung from the perspective of the film’s title character. But its lyrics are just as applicable to Parton’s own rags-to-riches fairytale of a life, from a one-room cabin in the Great Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee to global stardom on the big screen. A dreamy ballad, both literally and figuratively, “Girl in the Movies” sets its initial scene in a movie theater just as the lights dim and a film begins. With gentle acoustic guitar in the background, Parton sings, “Up on the silver screen I picture me, living out my passions, hope and fantasies.” In the poignant second verse, Parton sings of the desire to have the confidence to pursue her dreams, continuing the movie-themed metaphor with the line, “Here’s a preview of some things to come, it’s not too late for me to be someone.” Premiering on Netflix December 7th, Dumplin’ stars Danielle Macdonald as plus-sized Texas teenager Willowdean Dickson, nicknamed Dumplin’ by her mother, a former beauty queen played by Jennifer Aniston. The Dumplin’ soundtrack, on which Parton duets with Miranda Lambert, Alison Krauss, Sia, Elle King, Macy Gray and others, will be released November 30th and is now available for pre-order.","New Netflix film, out December 7th, features a soundtrack of Parton collaborations with Miranda Lambert, Sia and others",2018-11-02T15:08:58Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Rollingstone.com'}",Hear Dolly Parton’s Uplifting ‘Dumplin” Song ‘Girl in the Movies’,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/dolly-parton-dumplin-song-girl-in-the-movies-751080/,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dolly-girlinthemovies.jpg,,Rollingstone.com,Smoky Mountains,0
AP,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Park rangers were once again greeting visitors at some national parks across the United States and flight operations at major airports were returning to normal on Saturday, one day after a partial government shutdown came to an end.
While there were signs that some government machinery was grinding back to life after a record 35 days without funding, many federal workers and their families approached the end of the shutdown cautiously, saying they were relieved they would receive paychecks again, but would continue to restrict their spending amid fears that another shutdown could happen in weeks.
You can only be so happy because you just have to know that it could happen again, said Rachel Malcom, whose husband serves in the Coast Guard in Rhode Island. Were going to be playing catch up, so I dont want to overspend.
President Donald Trump signed a short-term deal Friday to end the partial government shutdown, which caused 800,000 federal employees to miss two paychecks. The administration asked department heads to reopen offices in a prompt and orderly manner.
Many government agencies still had notices on their websites Saturday saying they were not fully operating due to the lack of appropriations. Calls to several agencies also went unanswered, with voicemails saying the offices were closed due to the shutdown. But many parks from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Minnesota were glad to open their doors to weekend visitors.
John Anfinson, superintendent of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, said it felt great to tell his employees to open the Mississippi River Visitors Center. He texted his manager and said Roll up the gate!
They were just waiting for the green light, he said. Park ranger Sharon Stiteler posted a video to Twitter that showed the centers gates opening with the word: Weeeee!
The visitors center, located in the lobby of the Science Museum of Minnesota, saw 180 visitors in its first hour of operation, Anfinson said, and when he stopped by, the employees had big smiles on their faces.
The National Park Service said it was working on reopening all of its parks as quickly as possible, but some parks may not open immediately depending on their staff size and complexity. The Virgin Islands National Park, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the Wright Brothers National Memorial and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were among the parks that reopened Saturday.
And Yellowstone National Park officials said visitor centers would reopen there by Sunday afternoon, with the majority of staff returning Monday to begin working on a backlog of permit requests, including from those seeking to do research in the park.
Mike Litterst, chief spokesman for the National Park Service, said the nations more than 400 parks are reopening on a rolling schedule. Some of the parks that were partially open and accessible during the shutdown are expected to get back to full operations more quickly.
Were certainly grateful that all of our dedicated rangers and park service staff are back at work, Litterst said.
In the New York area, airport operations were returning to normal, just a day after LaGuardia Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport both experienced at least 90-minute delays in takeoffs because of the shutdown which caused a ripple effect throughout the system. On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration reported that flights at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport were landing and taking off Saturday morning with 15-minute delays. There were no other major delays nationwide, according to the FAAs website, which tracks flight delays.
Some parts of the government were taking a little more time to open up.
The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo in Washington planned to reopen to the public on Tuesday. Spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said until then, employees will check all audio-visual and interactive exhibits to make sure everything is working properly and curators will make a final check of the exhibits. Cafeterias will also be restocked and food shipments will resume, but full food service might not be immediately available.
Nigel Fields, superintendent of Virgin Islands National Park, said donations kept the park mostly open during its busy tourist season. But, he said, there is some anxiety about another closure. The park covers about 60 percent of the island of St. John, which was hit by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The shutdown affected the park services ability to continue rebuilding, strengthening the coral reef and restoring native vegetation after the storms.
For families of workers, the governments reopening came with a mix of relief and fear. While those who were furloughed or required to work without pay will receive back pay, its unclear when that will happen.
Crystal Simmons, whose husband serves in the Coast Guard in Connecticut, said it will likely take some time to process back pay, and then employees could be in the same situation again if another shutdown happens.
I dont think I can really relax and go back to the way things were, she said.

Adam Williams,"This former military train car is over 70 years old and has an interesting history that includes it being used during World War II and the Cold War. Now installed on some rural land in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains in Maryville, Tennessee, it has been painstakingly renovated into a guest house and is available to rent on Airbnb.
The wagon was made in 1942 and served as a kitchen car for US army cooks while troops were transported throughout the country for the war effort. After WWII it was mothballed then pressed back into service during the Cold War to carry computers and communication gear.
Finally retired in 1998, the train lay unused until it was purchased in a military surplus auction by a Lieutenant Colonel who installed it on his own property. He had plans for it, but ended up getting divorced and his home, train car included, passed to its current owners.
The new owners hit on the idea of turning the train into guest accommodation and named it Platform 1346. It took around eight months for them to strip it out and source the new furniture and sort out the wiring and plumbing, but the end result is very well done and the decor is a nice fit for the space.
Still finished in military green, Platform 1346 is accessed by steps on its front and end entrances and also has a small deck area outside. Its interior is mostly taken up by a large open living space with a well-stocked kitchen and a breakfast bar, plus a nearby living room with a sofa bed and a small office nook with a drop-down desk. A Murphy-style bed turns this nook into a bedroom.
At the far end is a bathroom with a bath/shower, sink and toilet that's accessed by barn-style sliding door.

Cindy Augustine,"With spring break season upon us, families across America are looking to experience more than just a theme park (although, not surprisingly, that still ranks high). According to a recent survey by Airbnb* of American travelers — in this case, defined as those over 18 with at least one child — more than three in five admit to staying within driving distance for their next family vacation, with less than 10% venturing to international destinations. For families traveling via Airbnb this spring, this rings true — with nearly all of the top destinations located within the continental United States. Although Paris makes the top-10 list, the remaining destinations are a mix of urban and country locales. These are the top 10 spring break destinations for families, based on Airbnb bookings: Orlando Los Angeles New York City San Diego Washington, D.C. Phoenix Paris Tahoe Central Florida Gulf Coast South Florida Gulf Coast Las Vegas Smoky Mountains Big Bear Lake Urban Orange County With more than seven in 10 families planning at least one group vacation this year, beach getaways rank high on the priority list, with 36% expressing a desire to be close to a shoreline. On Airbnb, listings located along the coastlines are reflecting that, with Myrtle Beach (162%), Panama City Beach (151%), Greater Saint Augustine (131%) and the Alabama Gulf Coast (123%) in particular seeing a significant uptick in guest arrivals over the coming weeks, compared to last year. Rural destinations are also on the rise, with Airbnb listings in the Smoky Mountains (221%), Flagstaff (183%), and the North Carolina mountains (151%) seeing a significant increase in travelers since last year. The survey also revealed that the booking window for family travel this year is much shorter, with nearly half planning their vacations only one to three months in advance. When it comes to deciding on where to go, a few key factors come into play: Value (nearly half deemed it the most important factor when planning a family vacation) Peer reviews and recommendations (47% deemed it “very important”) Family-friendly amenities (with more than three in five stating Wi-Fi is the most important, followed by kitchens, cable television, pools and multiple rooms) Traveling tots (two-thirds of all respondents say that children are influential when it comes to deciding on a destination) This February, Airbnb launched (among other things) its Family Collection; every home in the collection is highly rated with reviews from other families and provides complete privacy, plus the essentials a family needs for a comfortable stay. *This Airbnb survey was conducted using the online survey platform Pollfish, and compiled by DKC Analytics, a division of DKC Public Affairs and Government Relations. The nationwide sample of 1003 adults in the United States was surveyed on March 15, 2018 in the United States. The margin of error is 3.15% and no additional weighting was done to the initial sample.

Autopsy: Man died of meth overdose before being eaten by bear at national park
Park officials say an autopsy found that a man whose body was discovered being eaten by a bear in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in September died of accidental methamphetamine intoxication, not a bear attack.
A park news release Monday says officials decided to euthanize the bear that was feeding on the body of 30-year-old William Lee Hill Jr., of Louisville, Tennessee.

Officials say they didn’t know the definitive cause of death at the time, but decided to euthanize a few days later for public safety reasons after consulting with wildlife professionals and further understanding the bear’s aggressive behavior.

"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908, https://www.facebook.com/markberman","OJAI, Calif. — As the Golden State continued to burn for a sixth day, California officials warned that higher Santa Ana winds forecast through the weekend could create more erratic fire behavior, offering little chance of a reprieve for residents and firefighters who have endured flames and smoke for nearly a week. On Saturday, multiple wildfires continued to rage throughout Southern California, cloaking the area in nightmarish flame and towering plumes of smoke so thick they were visible from space. On Friday, authorities reported the first fire-related death: The Ventura Medical Examiner Office identified a body found on Wednesday as Virginia Pesola, 70, from Santa Paula, the “only confirmed fire-related death in Ventura County to date.” Pesola had died from “blunt force injuries with terminal smoke inhalation and thermal injuries” in a traffic incident during “active fire evacuation,” according to the county medical examiner. As the fires spread, much of the region also faces the threat posed by the dense smoke. Public health officials warned of dangerously bad air quality and said it was particularly threatening for the elderly, children and people with respiratory or heart conditions. Los Angeles County issued smoke advisories, urging people to remain indoors when possible, while Santa Barbara County officials said they expected to distribute 50,000 masks to area residents. Phil Moyal, an air quality specialist in Ventura County, said the smoke was causing hazardous conditions there, especially in the Ojai Valley, which is surrounded by mountains that have been trapping the smoke. “When we say ‘off the charts,’ we mean off the charts,” Moyal said Friday about air-quality measurements there. “I would not want to be there too long... I would tell people to go to Seattle. There are not many places in Southern California that are clean or will stay clean, and that can change in a minute depending on the wind.” [ How Santa Ana winds spread wildfires ] There were a few positive signs for the state. Officials battling the Thomas Fire in Ventura County — the biggest active blaze in the state after burning through 140,000 acres — spoke in cautiously optimistic tones as they lifted evacuation orders for cities along the fire’s southern edge: Santa Paula, and parts of Ventura. The coastal enclaves of Carpinteria and Santa Barbara were still under threat as the fire’s northern vanguard continued to move. And officials said that winds which could strike up at a moment’s notice remained a concern. The fire had burned more than 200 buildings in that county, alone. President Trump on Friday declared a state of emergency in California, ordering federal aid to the state in response to a request from Gov. Jerry Brown (D). Firefighters, joined by reinforcements from outside the state, battled the blazes. Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed and thousands more remain at risk as more than a half-dozen blazes continued to burn, officials said. The fires combined to burn across nearly 250 square miles. In San Diego County, firefighters continued to battle the Lilac Fire, which injured three civilians and two firefighters. Residents who fled described rapidly moving flames. “Oh my God, the heat, the heat,” Clifford Sise, a horse trainer who had to evacuate while trying to get his horses out of the San Luis Rey Downs, a racehorse facility in San Diego County. “One of my fillies wouldn’t leave, she burned to death in like one minute. I had ’em all out, and then when I went back after. I must’ve had two little babies run back in their stalls and they died.” The winds fanning the flames were lighter Friday, but forecasts call for them to increase again through Sunday. Red flag warnings of heightened fire risk will remain in place for at least Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Sunday, when winds could peak at around 50 mph. That could combine with extremely low humidity to create more unpredictable fire behavior and severe conditions for firefighters on the ground. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Dianne Jacob, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, said Friday at a news briefing. “We need to stay vigilant and be prepared.” Across the region, people who fled recounted fire and smoke that seemed to come from everywhere. The sounds of helicopters woke Patricia Hampton and her boyfriend at their house in Ventura as the Thomas Fire was growing. When they looked outside, the ground was covered in ash, the air so smoky it was hard to breathe, she said. They hopped on bicycles and tried to flee. “We didn’t know what had happened,” Hampton, 48, said at a temporary shelter at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Thursday, two days after leaving home. “We rode down into town trying to make sense of what we were seeing — police everywhere, firetrucks, helicopters. It was like a war zone. You could hear transformers blowing up.” In Los Angeles, Lili Hamedi said she went into her yard during the week and found her swimming pool filled with ash. “We were surrounded by the fires,” said Hamedi, who lives in the Encino area. “I heard the fire. I never knew you could hear a fire.” In Ojai, the favorable weather Friday allowed fire crews to make progress against what had been multiple lines of flames in recent days. A morning offshore wind calmed to nothing by midday, then shifted to a light breeze that had firefighters near Ojai preparing to defend the western edge of the city. Along the Thomas Fire’s northern edge near Carpinteria, a small city in Santa Barbara County, fire crews, backed by helicopters dropping water near homes and ranches, made great strides against multiple blazes Friday morning and throughout the day. Parts of the city remained under mandatory evacuation orders, but the flames just miles away the previous day had turned into smoldering plumes of smoke. This let fire crews concentrate on Ojai, a quirky town where New Age and the Old West mix in the hills high above Ventura. It has been surrounded by the Thomas Fire for much of the week. Over several breezeless hours, smoke settled into the canyons and dry river beds, complicating visibility for the helicopters making drops to the north and west of the city. For firefighters, the stillness meant the wind was shifting, so they had to get ready, said Forrest Rowell, a battalion chief and strike team leader from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department. “We’re preparing to go in and keep the fire off the city from the north, and clean up some edges that could worsen with the new wind,” Rowell said. The smoke spreading through Ventura pushed Jet Kauffman to pack up her two dogs, two cats and valuables into a car. “Everything is literally burning around you and it’s raining ash and ember, and things are just lighting on fire around you, and you can’t really do much to stop it,” Kauffman said. Her boyfriend, Shaun Kelleher, stayed behind to protect the Victorian house he bought in 2012. He looked out a back window and saw the glow creeping over the hillside, consuming palm trees in its path. The 32-year-old, ignoring mandatory evacuation orders, threw a scarf over his mouth and goggles over his glasses and ran outside to douse the home and yard with a hose. “I saw a house light on fire, and that’s when I started to freak out, because there was no one around,” Kelleher said. A second house burst into flames, then a third, and then an apartment complex. Fire and smoke were getting closer to his house and the wind was picking up. Kauffman, at a friend’s house, called Kelleher and pleaded with him to leave. Then he heard a sound that filled him with relief: Sirens. Some 20 firetrucks pulled into the area, he said, and firefighters stopped the flames bearing down on the house. The couple ended up in Thousand Oaks, a nearby city, staying with Kelleher’s father. Their Victorian home in Ventura had no power or drinkable water, but it was still standing. Ventura resident Nate Weber wasn’t so fortunate. The anesthesiologist and his wife Christine fled Monday evening with their four- and two-year-old daughters to his mother’s house in Oxnard Shores. Early the next morning they got a call from a neighbor: their home at the top of a hill on Mint Lane was gone. Nate returned to find sympathetic neighbors crowded around what remained of his house. He said the experience was “similar to a friend dying.” “I lived in that house six years, but it was a very formative six years,” he said. “I got married, I had two kids — just watching the kids grow up in that house, all those memories.” The kids, too, have had trouble processing the loss. When he showed his 4-year-old daughter a picture of the burned home, she remarked about how sad it was. “Then she goes off to play,” he said. “Two hours later she said, ‘Dad, I’m ready to go home.’ ” Wang, Berman and Rosenberg reported from Washington. Rob Kuznia and Noah Smith in Los Angeles; Soo Youn in Ventura, Calif.; and Angela Fritz in Washington contributed to this report. The Thomas Fire burns between the 101 Freeway and the Pacific Ocean.

GATLINBURG, Tenn. (WATE) - While parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are still closed and park employees are unable to go back to work due to the partial government shutdown, others who rely on the park being open are feeling the impact too. 
Those impacts from the weather, the government shutdown, and fewer working full-time park employees lead to roads that would normally be reopened within hours, taking longer.
Now, one tour guide is making his own ""back-up plan"" to stay prepared for customers. 
""It's become a dynamic situation from moment to moment throughout the day, especially when we get inclement weather throughout the day,"" said Steve Ellis, owner of ""Hike the Smokys"".
Ellis has 400 hikes under his belt and offers a guide service throughout GSMNP from short day trips, to overnight camping and kayaking.
He says customers come from all over the country and understand the services at the national park level are limited. 
""They understand with the shutdown how its creating a lot of unknowns for everybody,"" said Ellis. 
But still, Ellis says his guide service business is down from where it was this time last year. He credits both the weather and the partial shutdown, one he hopes will end soon. 
""It's still really frustrating, because we don't see any end in sight for this politically,"" said Ellis. 
Ellis' biggest concern isn't his business, but rather, the state of the park itself.
Volunteers are working to keep the park clean during the shutdown, holding community events to pick up trash. This, Ellis says, is helping. 
""Seeing a national treasure diminished...that's the real tragedy. My kids and my grandkids, I want them to have this park,"" said Ellis. 
He's joined the volunteer efforts to keep the park clean, most recently, cleaning trash along The Spur. He hopes others help keep the park the way it was meant to be enjoyed by not littering or volunteering during the shutdown.",GSMNP tour guide business suffering during government shutdown WATE 6 On Your Side While parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are still closed and park employees are unable to go back to work due to the partial government...,2019-01-12T01:31:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wate.com'}",GSMNP tour guide business suffering during government shutdown - WATE 6 On Your Side,https://www.wate.com/news/local-news/gsmnp-tour-guide-business-suffering-during-government-shutdown/1698425682,https://media.wate.com/nxs-watetv-media-us-east-1/photo/2019/01/11/GSMNP_Sunset_1_1547267553115_67218309_ver1.0_1280_720.JPG,,Wate.com,Smoky Mountains,0
RICHARD SANDOMIR,"“It made me realize that adults thought I was broken, so I gave up trying to communicate with them,” he told Publishers Weekly in 2014. He added, “I have no memories of being able to speak without severe disfluency, and I remember a childhood filled with fear and pain.” He found relief when he was 18, at a clinic in upstate New York, where he learned to speak fluently. He graduated from Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College) in Westminster, Md., with a bachelor’s degree in biology and chemistry. At the University of Tennessee, where he studied black bears, raccoons and bats, he earned a master’s and a Ph.D. He wrote his dissertation about the ecology of the raccoon in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Dr. Rabinowitz was a research fellow at the Wildlife Conservation Society when Dr. Schaller, who was a top executive there, suggested that he go to Belize to study jaguars. “He had a vision for himself that he hadn’t realized,” Dr. Schaller said. “When you meet someone like that you have to give him a try.” That set Dr. Rabinowitz on a path of exploration and adventure, one that dealt with not only jaguars, lions and tigers. In northern Myanmar, for example, he discovered a previously unknown species of deer, the leaf muntjac, and in the Himalayas he met the last known Mongoloid pygmies in the world, called the Taron. Recalling his meeting with one pygmy, Dr. Rabinowitz said he had communicated nonverbally with him. “He started making gestures about young children, which I didn’t quite understand at first,” he said in a 2013 interview with the On Being Project, which focuses on subjects involving moral imagination and social courage. When he realized that the man had asked him why he had no children, Dr. Rabinowitz answered through a translator, “Why do you assume I have no children?”","Alan Rabinowitz with two Siberian tigers at the Bronx Zoo in 2007.

Jessica Puckett,"The movie “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” won big at the Oscars on Sunday night. The film scored statuettes for both Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell) and Best Actress (Frances McDormand). Want to visit the picturesque main street and mountainous landscapes where the film was shot (minus the dark plot)? Well, even though Ebbing, Missouri, is a fictional city, the tourism board of Sylva, North Carolina, has you covered. The quaint city of 2,644 set in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina was the real-life location of the award-winning movie. North Carolina’s tourist website has a three-day itinerary for diehard fans of the morbid blockbuster to see all the highlights of film’s milieu. These include the local store, Sassy Frass, which was converted into the Ebbing Police Station, Jackson’s General Store, which houses Red Welby’s office and Sylva’s Main Street. The movie’s writer and director, Martin McDonagh, spent three days scouting Sylva for shooting locations, The Guardian reports. “Martin wanted to find that quintessential small town, somewhere a little sleepy, but a place that most people could identify with,” Guy Gaster, director of the North Carolina film office, told The Guardian. “He also knew he needed a town with a main street where – slight spoiler alert – a character could believably throw something across the street and into another building.” In addition to the sites from the movie’s pivotal scenes, the travel guide includes suggestions for local restaurants and hotel accommodations around Sylva, and takes fans to the eclectic city of Asheville and nearby Maggie Valley, which is adjacent to Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Both locations were also featured in “Three Billboards.” Unfortunately, the actual billboards in the movie’s title have been removed since shooting wrapped, but the guide does tell fans where to drive the scenic road, North Fork Left Fork Road, where the three billboards stood. “Three Billboards” joins the ranks of other movies such as “The Fugitive,” “Dirty Dancing” and “The Hunger Games” that have been filmed in Western North Carolina’s rolling hills.

Mark Osborne,"Steve Penny, former president of USA Gymnastics, was arrested Wednesday night for allegedly tampering with evidence in the case of disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar. Penny was arrested by the U.S. Marshals service in Tennessee on a warrant issued by the state of Texas. He was indicted by a grand jury on a charge of tampering with evidence, a felony, on Sept. 28. He allegedly removed documents from the Karolyi Ranch, the U.S. gymnastics' training facility in Huntsville, Texas, related to Nassar's activity at the gym. ""The indictment further alleges that the removal of the documents was done for the purpose of impairing the ongoing investigation by destroying or hiding the documents,"" the U.S. Marshals said in a press release. He allegedly ordered the documents be sent to him at USA Gymnastics headquarters in Indianapolis. Those documents have never been recovered, authorities said. The U.S. Marshals Service shared a photo of former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny being arrested in Gatlinburg, Tenn., on Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018, for allegedly tampering with evidence in the Larry Nassar case. Penny was taken into custody at a cabin in rural Gatlinburg, Tennessee, by the U.S. Marshals and Smoky Mountains Fugitive Task Force, according to authorities. He is awaiting extradition to Texas. He faces up to 10 years in prison, if convicted. The Karolyi Ranch was operated by Bela Karolyi and wife Marta Karolyi, the two people tasked with selecting and developing athletes for the U.S. national team. It served as the national team's training facility from 2001 until earlier this year. Nassar worked at the facility and several of his accusers said they were abused by him at the facility. Penny resigned as USA Gymnastics president in March 2017 amid allegations of sexual abuse against Nassar. Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of child molestation, but more than 130 women and girls, including Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman, have accused him of assaulting them. Many of those accusers testified at a hearing in January when he was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison. He pleaded guilty in two other cases -- one pertaining to assault and another possession of child pornography -- as well. Rhonda Faehn, Penny's former deputy, testified to the Senate in June that she brought up allegations of misconduct to him and she was told to keep quiet. Penny, who appeared before the same committee, chose to plead the Fifth and not testify. Former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar stands in Ingham County Circuit Court on Nov. 22, 2017 in Lansing, Mich. USA Gymnastics has been in near-constant turmoil since the Indianapolis Star broke the story in September 2016 of Nassar's abuse of gymnasts under his care, both with the U.S. national team, where he was the team doctor, and at Michigan State University, where he was a faculty member. Nassar had been dismissed from his job with the U.S. national team in 2015, but only said it was done due to ""athlete concerns."" After Penny's departure in March 2017, he was replaced by Kerry Perry in November 2017. But Perry's tenure was marked by consistent criticism over the handling of the Nassar scandal as well. She resigned less than a year after being named as Penny's replacement. Perry was criticized by stars, like Raisman, over her lack of transparency about how the organization planned to protect athletes going forward. She resigned days after she hired Mary Lee Tracy, in part to replace the Karolyis, as the sport's top coach. The hiring of Tracy received condemnation from athletes because she supported Nassar in the immediate wake of accusations against him. In this Tuesday, June 5, 2018 photo, former USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny invokes his right not to answer questions in a Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, on Capitol Hill in Washington. But the neverending parade of presidents didn't end with Perry's ouster. Just this week, former Congresswoman Mary Bono, who was tasked with replacing Perry as interim president of USA Gymnastics, was forced out for a pair of scandals -- less than a week since her hiring. A day after her hiring, Biles criticized Bono, a Republican, for a photo posted on Twitter in which she was shown blacking out a Nike logo over the company's hiring of Colin Kaepernick as spokesperson. She publicly apologized for the photo. A few days later, Raisman joined calls for Bono's ouster after discovering that Bono worked for the same law firm that worked with USA Gymnastics during the Nassar scandal and crafted excuses for his absences. Bono was not directly involved in the law firm's representation of USA Gymnastics, but she stepped down nonetheless on Tuesday. Penny is one of at least three people arrested in connection with the handling of the Nassar scandal. Debbie Van Horn, a trainer who worked with Nassar, was arrested last month in Walker County, Texas. She has denied charges, according to her lawyer, who spoke to the Houston Chronicle. William Strampel, the former dean of Michigan State University's osteopathic medical school and boss of Larry Nassar while he was a sports doctor there, was charged March 27 with neglect of duty and criminal sexual conduct. His case will go to trial at a yet-to-be-scheduled date.

"Opinion contributor, Bruce Kelley, Opinion contributor","Yassin family at their restaurant, Knoxville, Tennessee, July 28, 2018 (Photo: Amanda Friedman, Readers Digest) I want to tell you a classic Readers Digest story. One day in February, residents of Bennington County in Vermont gathered to discuss an influx of refugees into far-away New York City that had brought headlines of dislocated, suffering children. Despite icy roads and bitter cold, the meeting hall was standing room only. The Vermonters, who generations earlier spirited fugitive slaves from farmhouse to farmhouse until they reached Canada, cooked up a plan to help: They would invite 60 of the children to Vermont that summer to learn the language and customs of their new home while their parents in New York put their lives together. Any lingering doubts about welcoming refugees from a foreign country into American towns were swept away when the children piled off the train from New York. To quote from the piece we published, Why they were just children! After eight weeks of playing outside, bonding with Vermont families, and learning the language and American civics, the children were ready to go home. A final corn roast capped by a singalong with smores under the stars was followed the next day by tearful goodbyes on both sides. The year? It was 1939. The refugees? Europeans escaping the atrocities of the Holocaust. Sharing meals in a 'safe place' for 'all types' For 96 years, Readers Digest has told stories of everyday Americans who come together to do good things and its both astonishing and telling how often those tales involve a community welcoming outsiders into the fold. One such community is Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered last weekend by a gunman who resented their welcoming spirit toward refugees. As we mourn this tragedy, it is heartening to know there are places in America where love is blooming in place of hate. We became acquainted with many of them in our annual search for the Nicest Place in America and announced the winner last week. Theres no more classic American tale than that of Yassins Falafel House in Knoxville, Tennessee. Its proprietor, Yassin Terou, is a refugee from a horrific civil war in Syria who came here in 2011 with almost nothing but a gift for preparing Syrias signature food, the falafel. Just six years later, his well-loved restaurant is a place where Knoxvillians of all faiths, preferences and political persuasions come together to share meals in a safe place for all types, as signs around the restaurant proudly declare. Inspired by his openness and generosity, Yassins neighbors and customers nominated his restaurant for our contest. Then Readers Digest editors and a panel of outside judges, including ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts, chose it as one of 10 finalists from among nearly 450 other places in 49 states where trust and civility are winning. After a public vote (63,000 votes were cast), Yassins Falafel House emerged from the pack. More: Bring more refugees to America. They'll fill vacant jobs and boost our economy. GOP should support work visas. They'd help business and ease the caravan problem. Mike Pompeo: We remain the worlds most generous nation Each of the 10 finalists shared something important with Yassins and the Vermonters. At a time when our government is cutting the number of refugees we admit to our country and trying to change the way we welcome immigrants, they all demonstrate the American instinct to offer help and open arms to neighbors in need, no matter how or when they arrive. For instance, in Ellijay, Georgia, a hamlet in the Smoky Mountains, folks scootch over to make room when someone new comes into town, including Hispanic migrants who work the regions apple farms. When Maria Gonzalez Santoss father was picked up on his way home from work by immigration agents, the community rallied around the family and made sure his legal status was renewed. In the small Chicago suburb of North Riverside, residents have over decades created a self-governing system of volunteer block captains responsible for making sure no one gets left behind, including immigrants with complicated statuses. After a neighbor from Poland told her block captain that she was having trouble sorting out her citizenship paperwork, the captain told the committee, who told the mayor, who enlisted the help of her local congressperson, and soon everything was in order. You can read the inspiring stories of each of the finalists in our November issue, but before you do, heres one more classic Readers Digest story that I hope will remind you of how welcoming America can be. This one is also set in winter, in the days before Christmas, when a small group of locals gathered at the First Baptist church for an annual holiday event called Welcome the Stranger. Its a Christian ritual with Jewish roots, where neighbors greet neighbors, friends, and anyone else who passes by with warmth and compassion, celebrating the season. But this year, not everyone was in the spirit. As the speakers organized by local churches stood before the crowd to share their holiday thoughts, a man draped in an American flag began yelling that he was out of a job and immigrants were to blame. As it happened, a local businessman who himself was an immigrant took the stage, preparing to speak. He invited the man onstage so immigrant and native-born American could hold the flag together. The man refused. So the immigrant waded into the crowd, invited the man to dinner and offered him a job. When they parted, they shook hands. When you break bread, the businessman later explained, you break hate. As you may have guessed, that immigrant businessman is Yassin Terou, whose restaurant is the 2018 Nicest Place in America.

"USA TODAY, Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY","This file photo shows an Allegiant Airbus aircraft.
 (Photo: Allegiant)
Allegiant Air will begin flying to Alaska for the first time, adding flights to Anchorage as part of a broader 16-route expansion announced by the carrier on Tuesday.
Allegiants Anchorage flights will begin May 22, when the ultra low-cost carrier launches seasonal nonstop service from Bellingham, Washington. (Scroll down for full list of all the new routes)
Alaska is huge news for us, Drew Wells, Allegiant vice president of planning and revenue, says to USA TODAYs Today in the Sky blog. Were excited to launch service into any new city, but I think Alaska has a different level of excitement.
Alaska is immensely popular for Northwest folks, Well said, calling Bellingham a natural fit in terms of the customer profile thats expected to propel summertime demand to Alaska.
Canadian travelers also could be a big draw for the service from Bellingham, which regularly draws a large number of travelers from across the border. The airport sits about 50 miles from downtown Vancouver, and flights to U.S. destinations are frequently cheaper from the U.S. side of the border.
Well certainly draw our fair share of Canadian customers on this, but theres no shortage of customers coming from Bellingham and northern Washington, Wells said, adding we could end up at a 50-50 breakdown between U.S. and Canadian customers for the Anchorage flight.
Elsewhere, Allegiants 15 other new routes continue a trend in which it has diversified its network. Allegiant has long run a business model focused on offering nonstop flights to high-demand leisure destinations in Las Vegas, Florida and California.  But the airline has increasingly been developing bases like New Orleans; Nashville, Tennessee; and Austin, Texas.  
TODAY IN THE SKY: Austin airport's new indoor/outdoor South Terminal is now open (story continues below)
Last SlideNext Slide
Allegiants latest expansion announced Tuesday included some of those newer bases, including four new routes to Savannah, Georgia, and two to Norfolk, Virginia.
This is a really kind of a gateway into Virginia Beach and maybe into the northern parts of the Outer Banks, Wells said about Norfolk. We like this as a secondary destination.
Also getting two new routes: Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where Allegiant will fly nonstop to 22 destinations once the new flights begin.
The last few years, youve definitely seen more of a push for Allegiant to get (from) the Northeast to Myrtle Beach, Wells said. Weve seen a lot of success there, especially later in the season. Its not so much an April or May destination, but as you push later into August and September, you see a lot of strength from the Northeast going down there.  Weve been very happy.
Perhaps the most interesting new route announced by Allegiant on Tuesday: Nonstop service between Denver and Knoxville, Tennessee. The route will be Allegiants second to connect Denver with an airport in the Great Smoky Mountains.
Last year we launched Denver-Asheville (North Carolina), and we were really pleased the performance, Wells said. We wanted to push that one further and try out Knoxville. We think it fits very well with our network profile.
He said the route should appeal to the outdoor communities in both markets. I think well end up split fairly evenly here with passengers going both directions.
Scroll down for details on all 16 of the new routes announced by Allegiant on Tuesday. Introductory fares must be purchased by Wednesday (Jan. 16) for travel by Aug.13.

On Tuesday, the fashion world gathered in Paris to pay tribute to the late Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel's Fall 2019 runway presentation, where the last collection he designed for the house before his passing in February would be unveiled. It was an emotional — yet celebratory — occasion, with Lagerfeld's muses and close friends either walking in the show (Cara Delevingne, Cat McNeil and Mariacarla Boscono) or sitting front row (Caroline de Maigret, Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer) to honor his legacy. And honor it they did, with a beautiful show set in a dreamy, snow-covered ski lodge and a collection full of knits, menswear and floaty dresses.

The beauty look for the show, helmed by hairstylist Sam McKnight and makeup artist Lucia Pica (who serves as Chanel Beauty's Global Creative Make up and Colour Designer), felt patently Chanel, and therefore, patently Lagerfeld. For starters, it was heavy on the hair accessories — a trend that will clearly still be going strong into Fall 2019 — and in many ways seemed intent on making the models look like the happiest, best versions of themselves.

""Sparkly hair slides, ribbons, brooches and camellias adorned the simple healthy hair,"" wrote McKnight of the look on Instagram. ""Hair half-up, half-down, natural cool-girl textures tied with ribbons."" He pulled models' hair into simple half-ponytails that were easy, wearable and classic.
He also shared a video that showed the broad array of different hair accessories and adornments he used to tie back models' hair.
One particularly covetable accessory — not unlike the many rhinestone-and-crystal-studded barrettes we've seen outside the shows at every city this Fashion Month — was a script version of the Chanel logo done entirely in pearls.
Another even more whimsical adornment brought the theme of the show into the beauty look: a cluster of pink-and-blue enamel barrettes in the shape of a heart, an ice skate and depicting snowcapped mountains.
The simplest version of the look incorporated a single black ribbon, tied into a neat bow at the back of the models' heads for a prim, classic effect.
While McKnight obviously took delight in the array of hair accessories and the look he created, he was also understandably quite sentimental, having collaborated on Lagerfeld's runways, season after season. He called Tuesday's show ""a celebration of Karl and all things Chanel,"" adding ""huge love and respect goes to the wonderful team at Chanel for a very personal and emotional show today,"" in one of his Instagram captions.
Pica's makeup for the show was an on-theme après-ski look with slightly rosy cheeks, blotted-out nude lips and subtle eye makeup. She created a slightly smoky, dark-rimmed eye look that lent a bit of depth without verging on dramatic or moody. Pica also enhanced models brows — a rarity in a season full of afterthought arches — and gave them a structured, boyish shape with a bit of fullness, much like Delevingne's natural brows for which she is so well-known.

"USA TODAY, Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY","A sign on a set of toilets at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado tells visitors the doors are locked because there is no one to clean them during the partial government shutdown.
(Photo: Trevor Hughes, Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK)
DENVER  Mounting piles of human waste and trash have prompted a coalition of retired National Park Service leaders to press the Trump Administration to shutter every national park during the ongoing federal shutdown.
Although federal funding has stopped until at least next week, many national parks are operating under a ""soft"" closure. That means they're largely unstaffed and unpatrolled while visitors continue entering.
The situation has led to piles of trash accumulating in some parks, locked and stinking toilets in others, and concerns that unsupervised users are destroying the resources and landscapes the parks are supposed to protect.
Its really an awful situation to be in, but our primary job is to protect park resources and the safety of the public,"" said Phil Francis, the chairman of the Coalition to Protect Americas National Parks. ""I hate it. I always advocated for keeping the parks open and finding a solution, but when youre unable to protect the park resources and protect the visitors, it changes how you have to look at it.
The coalition, along with the Trust for Public Land, is asking the president to shutter every park until funding returns. There are more than 400 national parks, monuments, battlefields and other sites around the country. Some are small, like the  John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site in Brookline, Massachusetts, and can be easily closed to access.
But others, like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, have no entrance stations and would have to be barricaded by staff, said Francis, who was a deputy superintendent there for nearly 10 years.
Anthony Martinez, 42, picks up trash along the main road into Yosemite Valley on Jan. 2, 2019. Martinez spent his day off from work at nearby Tenaya Lodge to pick up trash inside Yosemite durirng the 2018/19 government shutdown.

""I do not make this request lightly closing the national parks will disrupt many lives. But leaving them open without the staffing and resources they need imperils the health and safety of visitors and the long-term integrity of the parks,"" Diane Regas, the TPL's president and CEO, said in a statement.
Francis said volunteer efforts to clean up trash are welcome, but only park workers have the knowledge necessary to operate wastewater treatment systems, manage wildlife and prevent looting of artifacts or plants like ginseng.
Some states, including Arizona and Utah, are using state money to keep some parks open, including the Grand Canyon, Zion, Arches and Bryce Canyon. Arizona is kicking in about $64,000 a week to maintain essential services at the Grand Canyon, although no one is staffing the entrance booths.
At California's Yosemite National Park, privately run hotels and lodges within park boundaries remain open and reservations are being honored. But volunteers are picking up trash and removing diapers and human waste, a trying task made worse by freezing temperatures.
I thought they were kidding when they said there was feces everywhere, but there is, said volunteer Anthony Martinez, 42, as he poked at a tissue paper frozen to some grass. ""Thats going to stay there until spring, he said with a sigh.

Without the watchful eye of rangers and park stewards, Yosemite visitors have been leaving garbage at vista points, bringing dogs into pet-restricted areas, driving vehicles over curbs and even defecating on the ground near padlocked restrooms. It's a scene that's being repeated across the country as tourists refuse to let the closures ruin their vacation plans.
During the last government shutdown, Oct. 1-17, 2013, the Obama administration sparked widespread outrage when it closed park entrances and put up barriers around national monuments, and briefly turned away veterans trying to visit the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.
By keeping many of the parks open now, the Trump administration has been able to avoid the same kind of outright anger faced by the Obama administration.
Jeff Jarvis, who ran the park service during the 2013 government shutdown, said he took a lot of political heat then. But he still believes it was the right decision.
He said it would also be the right decision now. Jarvis served under President Barack Obama from 2009-2017, and spent five hours testifying before the Republican-led Congress after his shutdown decision.
I think this is purely politically driven, Jarvis said of the soft closures instituted by the Trump administration. They did it to avoid the public backlash but were already starting to see public outcry about whats happening in the parks.
Trump told Democrats on Friday he is prepared to allow the government shutdown to go on months or even years if that's what it takes to get a border wall, the primary source of conflict for the government shutdown.
Outside Washington, however, frustration among tourists is mounting, especially in parks where garbage cans are taped shut and toilets locked.
""Having the park closed, that kind of hurts,"" said Efrain Turrubiartez, 45, who was visiting Rocky Mountain National Park this week with his family from Waco, Texas.
Francis said he understands the desire to keep public land accessible to the public. But when it comes down to a decision between allowing access and protecting the park resources, there's no more room for debate: I think its to the point now were where it has to be done.""

"USA TODAY, Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","Conditions for firefighting in Southern California were favorable overnight and progress was made, but that's expected to change. (Nov. 11) AP Smoke clouds the air above the remains of a burned-out house and car in Paradise, California, following the Camp Fire devastation. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY NETWORK) The images and stories from the wildfires raging in Northern and Southern California present a picture of a rampaging inferno spreading at dizzying speed. The numbers behind those hellish scenes are just as somber. Heres what we know so far about the devastation inflicted upon the countrys most populous state. How many fires are burning? There are six wildfires, three of them considered major, currently sizzling throughout the state. The largest one is the Camp Fire in Butte County, north of the capital city of Sacramento, which became the most destructive fire in state history, leveling more than 6,700 structures. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection better known as Cal Fire reported that this blaze has charred 109,000 acres and is only 25 percent contained. Full containment is not expected until the final day of the month. The Camp Fires impact has been felt all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area, more than 150 miles away, with smoky air blanketing the region over the weekend. Down south in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the Woolsey Fire has brought an extra layer of grief to an area stunned by Wednesdays mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill, which left 13 people dead, including the gunman. This blaze has scorched more than 83,000 acres and is just 10 percent contained. The Hill Fire, also in Ventura County north of Malibu, has burned 4,500 acres and is 70 percent contained. How damaging have they been? To get a sense for the devastation inflicted by the Camp Fire, which wiped away the town of Paradise, consider that last years Tubbs Fire the most harmful of the Wine Country fires that took about three weeks to extinguish destroyed 5,636 structures, by far the most in state history. It took three days for the Camp Fire to surpass that total. Of the 6,713 structures it has obliterated, 6,453 were residences. More significantly, the Camp Fire has accounted for 23 fatalities many of them people killed in their cars making it the third-deadliest wildfire in state history. Officials fear it might surpass the standard of 29 set by a 1933 blaze. The Woolsey Fire has destroyed 177 structures and caused two deaths. In addition, it has combined with the nearby Hill Fire to force the displacement of 250,000 people, among them celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Cher, Martin Sheen, Kim Kardashian West, Alyssa Milano and movie director Guillermo del Toro. Why have these fires erupted so quickly? Forecasters warned in the middle of last week that conditions were ripe for fires to ignite because lack of rainfall and warm weather had left vegetation bone dry, and increasing winds added to the likelihood the blazes would spread quickly. Soon after, the Camp Fire named after Camp Creek Road, where it started made good on those predictions, flaring up Thursday morning and expanding at an astonishing rate. The Woolsey and Hill fires were sparked that day as well. President Trump inserted an element of controversy into the tragedies when he tweeted Saturday that gross mismanagement of the forests was to blame for the fires. California officials have maintained higher-than-normal temperatures likely caused by climate change have sucked the humidity out of grass, shrubs and trees, providing fuel for blazes to burn quicker and more intensely. Weather experts largely agree, although they also point to urban development as adding to the element of danger once fires are set off. What do conditions look like today? The National Weather Service has issued Red Flag warnings until Monday morning for vast swaths of Northern California, covering most of the central part of that region from Sacramento north to the Shasta National Forest and east to the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those warnings, which indicate critical to extreme fire conditions, were also issued for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Tuesday afternoon because of the combination of 40-60-mph wind gusts and humidity levels in single digits. Today is a critical fire-weather day, meteorologist Alex Hoon said. Theres going to be a lot of shifting winds, dry conditions.

Shannon,"The idea that the U.S.-China trade war could be seen in microcosm in the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee may seem at first far-fetched. But here in Sevierville, the gateway to the renowned resort town of Gatlinburg, and the hometown of the iconic Dolly Parton, evidence of a sea-change in American buying habits and attitudes is everywhere. This region, while historically poor Dolly Parton relates that the two-room cabin in which she grew up with 11 other siblings had no running water or electricity holds three sizable trade shows each year in early November. Buyers come from all over the United States and beyond to source everything from keyrings to costume jewelry, cell phone purses to silky scarves, and handmade vases to vape accessories. Chinese vendors always make a good showing at these events, particularly in jewelry, from the ultra-cheap to the over-priced. Many set up row upon row of cash and carry displays filled with the best and the worst of these products, which come mainly from eastern and southern China. Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month. On the first days of trade shows like this, buyers representing every segment from mom-and-pop enterprises to museums, hospital gift shops to hotels, casinos to campgrounds normally queue up to be first through the doors. They head to the Chinese owned-and-operated booths and quickly fill baskets, bags, and backpacks with as much as they can stuff in. The aisles are packed at these vendors by 9:05 a.m. at shows that open at 9:00 a.m. Jewelry and accessories are stripped from the shelves as fast as the Chinese team can reload them with fresh merchandise. That didnt happen this year in Sevierville, Tennessee. This year, the Chinese vendors booths were all but empty. The occasional shopper wandered in, picked up a basket, filled it with a few low-cost items, paid, and left. Then she headed to the Made in America section. And there, she opened her wallet. Made in America represented a large and diverse group of vendors selling everything from customized postcards to humorous license plates, all made in the United States, most by small, family-owned businesses. For four days, the Chinese vendors, with jewelry and accessories covering 1,500 square feet of space, representing a rental investment worth well over $30,000, sat and stared at their phones for most of the day, while over in Made in America vendors of jewelry more expensive than the Chinese products wrote order after order. It is easy to forget that the U.S -China trade war has an important corollary message attached to it for the American side of the equation: Buy American. The old phrase, which first came into mainstream use in 1933 under then-President Herbert Hoovers Buy American Act, is part of a message embodied in the April 18, 2017 Presidential Executive Order on Buy American and Hire American. But the 2017 act applies only to purchases made by the executive branch of the federal government. It, of course, does not and cannot regulate the private purchasing decisions of the ordinary American company or consumer. But the spirit of the Buy American Act appears to be motivating many buyers in the United States today, as so starkly played out in the Smoky Mountains over the past week. To be sure, buyers at the wholesale, retail, and consumer levels in the United States are beginning to see rising costs, as a result of the tariffs, on some goods coming into the country from China, and the resulting increase in price may certainly act as a deterrent to purchase. But anecdotal evidence suggests that price alone is not necessarily the key factor for American buyers at any position along the supply chain. For many American buyers, country of origin is supremely important. For those buyers, the country they want to buy from is the United States. Although the Sevierville show and its cousins in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg draw a large and geographically diverse attendance, many of the buyers come from the economically-challenged regions of the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, where incomes are up to 30 percent lower than the American average. Many buyers, when making investment decisions for goods to buy and resell in their regionally based businesses, do not want to purchase products that cost over $5. They will then sell those products for $10 to $15 at most. Chinese products fit that bill, and have for years. But Sevier County, Tennessee is Trump country. On November 6, voters in Sevier County returned their ballots for Republican Party candidates in dramatic numbers. Marsha Blackburn, the successful Republican candidate in Tennessee for the U.S. Senate, and a close ally of President Donald Trumps, took 71.5 percent of the countys vote. Trump had rallied for her election in Tennessee in the days leading up to the election. This week, the people of Sevier County and its surroundings not only literally voted for Republicans aligned with the Trump agenda — they voted with their pocketbooks, too. They took his Buy American message to heart and paid a little more in support of what they believe is a vital and patriotic mission. The Chinese group that came to Sevierville said they would not be back. That may have been the message they were supposed to receive.","In the Smoky Mountains, there’s evidence of a change in U.S. buying habits.",2018-11-08T15:28:55Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thediplomat.com'}",The US-China Trade War Shows up in Tennessee,https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/the-us-china-trade-war-shows-up-in-tennessee/,https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/thediplomat-iges-trade-show-553x360.png,,Thediplomat.com,Smoky Mountains,0
KIRO 7 News Staff,"Smoke from wildfires is clogging the sky across the U.S. West, blotting out mountains and city skylines from Oregon to Colorado, delaying flights and forcing authorities to tell even healthy adults in the Seattle area to stay indoors. Seattle’s Space Needle was swathed in haze, and it was impossible to see nearby mountains Monday and Tuesday. Below, find tips from the Washington State Department of Health on how to stay healthy during smoky air conditions. Stay indoors and keep the air there as clean as possible by keeping windows and doors closed and running an air conditioner if possible (set to recirculate, closing the fresh-air intake and regularly changing the filter). Don't add to your indoor pollution. That means not burning candles or incense and not using food boilers, fireplaces, gas stoves or vacuuming inside with a vacuum that doesn't have a HEPA filter. (Read why you shouldn't vacuum here.) Stay hydrated. If you don't have an air conditioner and are feeling hot with the windows closed, close your curtains to reduce heat gain and use fans to circulate the air. Don't exercise outside. Stay updated by regularly checking the air quality reports ( or this map ) and listening to the news and health warnings for your community. Additionally, if you have asthma or a lung disease, you should speak with your doctor and follow their directions. As large cities deal with unhealthy air for a second summer in a row, experts warn that it could become more common as the American West faces larger and more destructive wildfires because of heat and drought blamed on climate change. Officials also must prioritize resources during the longer firefighting season, so some blazes may be allowed to burn in unpopulated areas. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Aria Bendix,"In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed an act calling for national parks to remain ""unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."" 
 More than a century later, environmentalists are accusing the Trump administration of violating that act by allowing parks to remain open during the government shutdown. 
 With the shutdown already shattering records as the longest in US history, national parks have felt the absence of around 21,000 furloughed employees. An estimated 3,3000 park workers have stayed on to provide essential services such as law enforcement and emergency medical attention. 
 This understaffing has incited chaos in a number of parks across the country. Though some public land remains in pristine condition thanks to respectful visitors and local volunteers, other areas face long-term environmental damage and threats to visitor safety as the shutdown wears on. In some cases, the damage could last for years.

 Almost immediately after the shutdown went into effect on December 22, park visitors began to uncover piles of haphazardly discarded trash, including soiled diapers, alcohol bottles, and discarded shotgun shells. Restrooms began overflowing with human waste, and garbage was found scattered along major highways. 
 At Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California, visitors took to defacing rocks with graffiti and cutting down trees that have been around for centuries. Some even skirted entrance fees, which are supposed to go toward visitor services. 
Yosemite National Park on week three of the shutdown.
 John Tillison 
A few parks, like Yosemite, were able to handle the situation relatively quickly. 
 ""The first week was like the wild west and people did whatever they wanted,"" said John Tillison, a retired park ranger. 
 Two weeks later, he found portable outhouses and members of the Yosemite Climbing Association handing out litter grabbers, gloves, and garbage bags. The group asked visitors to return the garbage they had collected and offered to dispose of it for free. 
 Tillison said he collected only half a trash bag worth of garbage, since the park ""looked pretty good."" 
 That's not the case everywhere. In the midst of the shutdown, the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has compiled a list of parks with the most egregious conditions, including the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site — the former home of Theodore Roosevelt — which recently saw a fire in its visitor center. 
 The situation is ""becoming a crisis,"" said John Garder, the senior director of budget and appropriations at the NPCA. ""There is, at this point, a threat of long-term damage that could last years, if not decades."" 
 In some cases, he said, the damage can be irreparable. 
 According to Garder, the nightmare scenario that would require national parks to close has already arrived in certain areas. 
 There's a financial toll to keeping parks open 
 During prior government shutdowns, administrations have suspended all operations at parks, including visitor access. In an unorthodox move, the Trump administration has opted to leave gates open to the public. 
 The NPCA called the decision ""reckless"" and ""illegal,"" arguing that it violates at least four separate provisions of federal law. 
 The NPS has responded to concerns by diverting visitor fees toward park maintenance, allowing additional staffers to clean restrooms, patrol the parks, and pick up trash. 
 While the decision may help to keep parks cleaner, it could also be causing them to lose money. 
Visitors discovered piles of trash spilling out of a public bathroom at Lassen National Forest.
Twitter/Public Land Lover
According to the NPCA, national parks collect around $400,000 in fee revenue on an average day. Since the start of the shutdown, the group estimates, the NPS has lost more than $6 million in fee revenue. That's on top of a $11.6 billion backlog on much-needed repairs. 
 ""In robbing those accounts, they are undermining projects that superintendents and partner groups have been counting on — sometimes for years,"" said Garder. ""It essentially pulls the rug out from under them."" 
 Though keeping the parks open could ensure that visitors and tourists continue to pump money into the local economy, Garder said the long-term effects could be far more destructive. 
 ""In cases where parks are partially open, it is an invitation for visitors to be at greater risk...and for resources to be damaged,"" he said. 
 Understaffing could pose a safety threat 
 In the first sixteen days of the shutdown, at least seven deaths were reported in national parks — but the link between the deaths and understaffing is tenuous. 
 A spokesperson for the NPS told The Washington Post that an average of six people die in national parks each week due to ""accidents like drownings, falls, and motor vehicle crashes and medical related incidents such as heart attacks."" 
 With so many park rangers off-duty, it's possible that more accidents could occur.

On Christmas Day, a man at Yosemite died of a head injury after what was likely a short fall. A witness told The Post that the emergency personnel who arrived on the scene didn't have a stretcher. The man also had a dog with him, which violates federal regulations. A senior NPS official told The Post that rangers frequently intervene when they see someone walking a dog. 
 At the time, the paper reported that only six rangers were available to monitor conditions at Yosemite, whose land is roughly the size of Rhode Island. 
 There's also the danger of crumbling infrastructure whose maintenance has been put on hold. 
 ""There are visitor centers in disrepair, roads that are falling apart, trails that need stabilization, [and] water systems that are at risk of breaking down,"" said Garder. Without the funds to address these issues, he said, ""it will eventually create some threats to visitors' [safety]."" 
 Visitors are endangering trees and wildlife 
 Visitors aren't the only concern. The absence of park rangers makes it difficult to police human activity that endangers wildlife. 
 At the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, at least three black bears have been poached since the start of the shutdown. 
 Littering also poses a severe hazard. When humans leave their food lying around or pile it into overflowing trash cans, bears can grow accustomed to eating it. This causes them to lose their fear of humans and potentially attack. 
 Some visitors have also sent out drones that can harm local birds. On January 2, Pinnacles National Park in Central California learned of a visitor who was using an unauthorized drone to harass a California condor, according to a report given to Business Insider by the NPCA. 
A Joshua tree was cut down by visitors.
 National Park Service 
Of particular concern, said Garder, is the damage done to Joshua trees. 
 The towering species is more than a namesake for a national park. It's also a key part of the Southern California ecosystem, providing vital support to birds, bats, and insects, among other forms of wildlife. 
 ""When a mature [Joshua] tree is cut down, an ancient organism has been killed, and it could be centuries before another takes its place,"" a director at the Mojave Desert Land Trust told the Desert Sun. 
 During the shutdown, there have been at least three reported cases of the trees being cut down at Joshua Tree National Park as visitors tried to off-road in restricted zones. These actions propelled the park to announce a closure on January 8, but it later rescinded the plan, saying it would use park revenue to stay open. 
Rangers and conservationists agree: parks should close
 While the sum of this damage already constitutes an emergency, it's difficult to predict what could happen next. 
 ""The parks service won't have a full sense of the damage until they're able to get back on duty,"" said Garder. ""We expect they'll find more vandalism and other significant damage to sensitive ecosystems."" 
 That's assuming park rangers will resume their positions after the shutdown — a possibility that, for some, has faded further from view.

By week three of the shutdown, some rangers had already secured second jobs while others were considering filing for unemployment. President Trump has suggested that the shutdown could last ""months or even years."" 
 ""I really love my job and I would do everything I could to come back to it...but I've got to eat,"" said a National Park Service employee at a park in the Southwest, who wished to remain anonymous so she could speak frankly. 
 ""Everybody's really tired of riding the roller coaster,"" said Tillison. ""There's a lot of frustration, and rightfully so."" 
 While most parks have managed to avoid shutting down entirely, many have closed their campgrounds due to health and safety concerns. Both the NPCA and park rangers agree that the solution would be to close the parks for the remainder of the shutdown. 
 ""It's gotten to the point where businesses and people and communities surrounding parks are now urging that parks be closed,"" Garner said. ""They understand that our parks are not just for short-term gain. They are for long-term preservation and the enjoyment of the American people.""","In the midst of a government shutdown, the conditions at national parks could threaten visitor and wildlife safety.

Jamie Wiebe,"Your Myers-Briggs personality type can seem surprisingly apt: ""Why yes,"" you might say while reading your personality description, ""I don't like theories and abstracts, and I do leap before I look! This explains so much."" Sometimes, an internet quiz actually can go a long way in figuring out who you are. Or figuring out where to live. Looking for a new adventure and not sure what city best suits you? We've connected all 16 Myers-Briggs personality types to their best-fitting city so you can ensure your living situation matches your disposition. Not sure what type you are? Take the test. ISTJ—Charlotte, North Carolina You might look like an old-school accountant on the outside, although you've updated the look with skinny jeans and chunky glasses. But on the inside… well, you're still a bit accountant-like—and that's not a bad thing! You're a sucker for history and tradition, and you're skilled at zeroing in on the facts. But we're betting flashy New York City offices aren't your thing. Charlotte, North Carolina, drops you in a lush, historic landscape, and it's one of the nation's best cities for finance jobs. Plus, its expansive arts scene lets you loosen up whenever the urge strikes. INFJ—Syracuse, New York Whether it's with the pen or the paintbrush or any other tool of choice, you're immune to the allure of your art. You deserve to pay your bills with your creations, too. Not only is Syracuse, New York, one of the most affordable cities to live in the United States, but it has one of the highest percentage of self-employed artists in the country. When you're short on inspiration, just hop the train down to NYC. INTJ—Little Rock, Arkansas You're a self-sustainer—no need for strangers intruding upon your day-to-day routine. But that clever mind still needs stimulation for strategies and innovation. Consider Little Rock, Arkansas. Natural beauty surrounds the capital of Arkansas, leaving plenty of options when you just gotta get away. But this small city also offers a thriving network of creatives, and plenty of job opportunities in advertising and marketing. ENFJ—St. Louis, Missouri Your name says it all: You're always willing to give a little part of yourselves to strangers if it will put them in a good mood. St. Louis, Missouri, is one of the nation's most affordable large metros, with residents spending just 25.95% of their income on living expenses. It's also one of the most charitable. Almost half of the city's charities focus on human services, so you'll have endless opportunities to live up to your name. ISTP—Kansas City, Missouri You love getting your hands dirty and creating something you can look at. You're also a bit unpredictable—one day you may want to check out a gallery, the next you want to hit up the bars, and the next you're just angling for some angling on the river. Check out Kansas City, Missouri : With more than two million residents, this Midwestern mega-city promises to fill any of your sudden whims. ESFF—Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota The center of attention is your favorite place. And let's be frank—you adore that spotlight. Set up shop in one of America's most social cities : Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. Spend your weekends cheering on the Timberwolves or the Twins. When you're spending barely 25% of your salary on living expenses, you'll have plenty of funds to be the life of the party. INFP—The Mediator You adore your collection of precious crystals, you have a favorite astrologer, and you have a lot of opinions about your birth sign. Or maybe you simply love to get lost in daydreams. Check out hippie heaven Asheville, North Carolina. Its farmer's markets and street festivals are a haven, and the nearby Smoky Mountains will connect you with nature. ESFP—The Entertainer You feel most comfortable on the stage, with all eyes on you as you belt out your latest banger. Keep that music career strong by moving to a city with a surprisingly strong record for hits : Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Follow in the footsteps of Wiz Khalifa and Christina Aguilera and earn your mettle in this steel-and-metal city. ENFP—Albuquerque, New Mexico Cookie cutters are your enemy, and looking like anyone else might as well be poison. Pick a city that appeals to your love of the interesting and the unique—like Albuquerque, New Mexico, one of the kookiest cities in the United States. (Some people even call it Albu-Quirky.) Not sure you're ready to move? Consider spending your first visit at the city's psych hospital-turned-hotel. We bet you'll be convinced. ESTP—Salt Lake City, Utah You like to move fast and break things. No shame in that. Your perfect city may be surprising: You'll be packing up and moving to Salt Lake City, Utah. This western metropolis is one of the country's best tech cities outside San Francisco. Keeping your attention may be a challenge, but with the state's wide variety of outdoor activities—and a growing art scene—there's no shortage of interesting activities. ESTJ—Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina No one need to worry when you're in control. You're a leader and most likely working to help people every day (the bet is on ""doctor""). One of the country's best cities for medical work is Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina —and the two cities are also wildly affordable. The combination of health care jobs and the area's famed ""Research Triangle"" makes this a perfect pick, regardless of whether you want to help people through research or practice. ENTJ—Grand Rapids, Michigan You've got a talent for taking charge, and you're most comfortable when you're in the big office making the big decisions. You'll find similar spirits in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is one of the best cities in the United States for starting a business. Surrounded by your new entrepreneurial friends, you'll be sure to succeed. INTP—Huntsville, Alabama You've never made an illogical decision. It's impossible. And hopefully you'll find this decision completely logical, too: Huntsville, Alabama, isn't just the most affordable city in the country, but it's also the best city for STEM jobs, with an average salary of $91,900. Keep your analytical mind churning, no matter your preferred field. ISFJ—Louisville, Kentucky There's no reason to live in discord when you can live in one of the country's friendliest cities. Louisville, Kentucky, will appeal to your kind personality, and your new friends will support your idealism, optimistic attitude, and positive mood. The area is rapidly increasing in popularity, but still staying affordable. ENTP—Indianapolis, Indiana This rare personality type indicates you might be more comfortable as a loner. Our best guess: You have a lot in common with Ron Swanson. Which is one reason you think you'd love Indianapolis, IN. The state's Hoosier spirit will appeal to your individuality, and there's plenty of nearby land for sprawling. But don't fear: When you're ready for a long, intellectual chat, the city and its plethora of world-class universities will be waiting. ISFP—Phoenix, Arizona Some people might consider you an introvert, but you know that's not true. You're just waiting for the right moment—and then you'll strike. You're a sucker for spontaneity. And so is Phoenix, Arizona. As the second-most-spontaneous city in the United States (second only to Los Angeles, which may be a little much for your introversion to handle), you'll never have any trouble finding something funky to liven up your evening when you need it.","Your Myers-Briggs personality type can seem surprisingly apt: ""Why yes,"" you might say while reading your personality description, ""I don't like theories and abstracts, and I do leap before I look!

Josh Laskin,"A few summers ago, I was lucky enough to embark on a three-month-long, 13,000-mile cross-country drive on my motorcycle. After using a few bungees to strap a fly rod, camping gear and a bag full of clothes and tools to the back of the bike, I set off to explore the nation’s backroads and stunning parks.

W ith just a few weeks of vacation time and careful planning, anyone can tackle a road trip to explore the vast network of US national and state parks and forests. Planning your national park road trip Before you leave, consider whether or not you want to make this a round-trip drive, or if you’d prefer to fly back. If you opt for the latter, consider a repositioning rental and make sure to rent your vehicle with a credit card that offers primary car rental insurance (such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire Preferred and United Explorer Card ). Drivers making a one-way trip will need to book a return flight home. Jackson Hole Airport (JAC), located just a few minutes from the Grand Teton National Park, is serviced by United, Delta, American and Frontier. If you end the trip at North Cascades National Park, however, you’ll be just 120 miles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA). When you’re driving up to 13 hours a day, it’s smart to bring along a good credit card for earning points on gas purchases. With the Citi ThankYou Premier Card, for example, you’ll earn 3x points when you fill up, along with 3x points on many travel purchases, 2x points on dining and entertainment and 1 point per dollar on everything else. Another tip? Make sure to buy a national park pass to save money on entrance fees. An annual pass can be purchased from the National Park Service for just $80, and is valid at any National Park for 12 months. Current US military members are eligible for a free annual pass, while seniors ages 62 or older can opt for the $20 annual or $80 lifetime pass. Acadia National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin. Acadia National Park, Maine Located on the coast of Maine, Acadia is the Northeast’s only national park. Here, a mountainous landscape converges with the Atlantic Ocean, creating a rugged and rocky shoreline, reminiscent of what you might find out west. Spend a night or two in Bar Harbor’s newest property, the Inn on Mount Desert. And while you’re in the area, be sure to drive the loop road around the park, stopping at classic destinations such as Otter Cliffs and Jordan Pond. Head to the Schoodic Peninsula during busier times if you need a break from lingering summer crowds. During fall, the summer tourists retreat, and the foliage serves as the perfect backdrop to the rocky cliffs and coastline. When you’re ready to officially embark on your national park road trip, head south for about 13 hours until reaching Shenandoah National Park. Break up the drive with a stop in either Boston or New York City. Distance : 780 miles. Shenandoah National Park, Virginia Shenandoah extends along the ridge of Virginia’s section of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and offers 200,000 acres of protected lands and over 500 miles of hiking trails. Rolling hills reach down into green valleys and farmland, offering views that are easily accessible from points along Skyline Drive, the main road that cuts through the center of the park. Stay at the Residence Inn or Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites, in the city of Harrisonburg, for 17,500 Marriott points per night. If you are up for a strenuous and technical hike, don’t miss Old Rag — but be sure to reach the trailhead early to avoid crowds. Then, drive south for about five and a half hours to the Pisgah National Forest. Distance : 330 miles. Pisgah National Forest. Photo by Josh Laskin Pisgah National Forest, North Carolina Home to some of the tallest mountains on the East Coast, North Carolina’s Pisgah National Forest is filled with grassy balds (treeless summits covered only by native grasses and shrubs) affording hikers uninterrupted views and an “alpine” feel that is rare in climates such as this. The nearby mountain town of Asheville has a number of accommodation options, ranging from a Hyatt Place Asheville Downtown ($198 or 12,00 World of Hyatt points per night) to The Omni Grove Park Inn (from $239). Head into town to sample classic North Carolina barbecue at the 12 Bones Smokehouse. The drive to the next destination, Great Smoky Mountain National Park, is just over two hours away, which leaves plenty of time to explore both areas. Distance : 100 miles. Smoky Mountains National Park. Photo by Shutterstock. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee In 2017, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was the most visited in the country — and for good reason. With more than 800 miles of hiking trails meandering around some of the oldest mountains on Earth, coupled with the area’s distinct southern hospitality, the Smokies are a highlight any time of year. But the mountainscape is especially lovely in autumn, when the fall foliage transforms the park. Spend the night at the The Park Vista, a DoubleTree by Hilton in nearby Gatlinburg, Tennessee for $104 or 31,000 Hilton Honors points per night. Travelers can also retire to a rustic lodge or cabin rental in Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge. Be sure to hike or drive to the top of Clingman’s Dome — the highest peak in Tennessee — for 360-degree views of the iconic mist-covered mountains. The drive to the next destination, the Ozarks National Forest, will take approximately 11 hours. Luckily, the most direct route will bring you through Nashville and Memphis, both of which are great options for splitting up the drive. Distance : 750 miles. Ozarks National Forest, Arkansas Arkansas is home to deep valleys and rolling mountaintops blanketed in the wild Ozarks National Forest. Hike to the 209-foot Hemmed-in-Hollow Falls, which is the tallest waterfall between the Appalachians and the Rockies; explore the nearby town of Fayetteville, Arkansas; and spend the night at The Chancellor Hotel. Book with your Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card at Hotels.com/Venture to earn 10x miles on your stay. (You can also take advantage of the Hotels.com Rewards program to earn one free night for every 10 paid nights, effectively boosting your return to 20% when you pay with the Venture card.) If you want to do some leaf-peeping this autumn, venture over to the Sylamore District of the Ozarks. The nearby Mountain View area hosts a handful of fall festivals and bluegrass concerts. The next drive to the Great Sand Dunes National Park will be another long one: just over 12 hours. Get it all out of the way in one shot, or spend a night in Oklahoma City. Distance : 760 miles. Great Sand Dunes National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado Discover towering sand dunes, similar to what you might expect to find in the Sahara Desert, in the middle of Colorado — along with snow-covered mountains and prairie-like grasslands. These are just a few of the diverse ecosystems you’ll find in Colorado’s Great Sand Dunes National Park. Although there are no towns immediately near the park, Zapata Ranch offers overnight lodging and vacation packages for road trippers who’d prefer not to camp. Don’t forget to try your hand at sand boarding or sand sledding before heading to the next destination. After the last long stretch, you’ll be delighted to find that the drive to Rocky Mountain National Park is only five hours north of the Dunes. Distance : 300 miles. Rocky Mountains National Park in Colorado – Photo by Shutterstock Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado Glacial basins, towering ridges and alpine terrain, accessible by more than 300 miles of hiking trails and two scenic roads (one of which is the highest paved road in the US), make Rocky Mountain National Park one of the most beautiful places in the country. Enjoy the diverse wildlife and hikes suitable for all experience levels before bedding down at The Ridgeline Hotel, located in Estes Park. The property boasts modern amenities in a casual mountain-inspired space (expect lots of blonde wood and ensuite fireplaces). When you’re finished in the park, head over to Elkins Distilling Company, one of only a handful of high-altitude distilleries in the nation. The next destination — Utah’s Arches and Canyonlands National Parks — are five and a half hours southwest. During the drive, you will see the landscape morph from snow-capped peaks to red sandstone cliffs. Distance : 400 miles. Arches National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, Utah Located just outside of Moab the Arches and Canyonlands parks offer an impressive introduction to the vast and dramatic desert landscape that makes up much of Utah. Arches National Park is filled with spectacular, natural sandstone (you guessed it) arches, formed by erosion. Many of these arches are easily reached from the road or with short walks, and because Arches is the more accessible of the two parks, it is often the most crowded. Canyonlands is the less-popular neighbor. Though the landscape is similar, it’s a much larger park — and somewhat more stark and wild. The town of Moab offers a handful of lodging options and restaurants, including a Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites ($180 or 40,000 IHG points). After a restful night in Moab, begin the drive to the Grand Canyon. This will take between five to seven hours, depending on which part of the park you decide to visit first. Distance : 300 miles. Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona This bucket-list destination is home to the deepest and most spectacular canyon in the country, and cracks open millions of years of geologic history. While many choose to view the canyon from the park’s numerous pull-outs and viewpoints, one of the best ways to get a sense of perspective is by embarking on one of the many hiking trails that trace the canyon’s rim and even descend into its depths. The Grand Hotel at Grand Canyon, located just one mile from the entrance to the South Rim, is the only three-diamond hotel in the region. If you are looking for a more extreme and off-the-beaten-path adventure, try the 3,200-foot-long zip line at Grand Canyon West ; or take the 20-mile round trip hike to the emerald-blue waters of Havasupai Falls. Camping permits for Havasupai must be acquired in advance, and can be difficult to claim. Once you’re ready to move on, head north back over the Utah border — a drive that can take between two and four hours — to Zion National Park. Distance : 100 miles. Zion National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin Zion National Park, Utah Located in southwestern Utah, Zion National Park encompasses nearly 230-square-miles of red and pink sandstone cliffs, narrow slot canyons and the prominent Zion Canyon, which spans more than 15 miles and cuts up to a half-mile deep. Spend the night at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Springdale ($175 or 39,000 Hilton Honors points per night) to take advantage of the free breakfast, before starting one of the most popular hikes in the park, called The Narrows. Hikers will move through the most tapered section of Zion Canyon, and the trail requires wading in the Virgin River. Depending on the route you choose, a permit may be required to complete this hike. After Zion, head west for about eight hours until reaching Yosemite National Park. Enter from the east side of the park, from the town of Lee Vining, California. Distance: 47 0 miles. Photo by MundusImages / Getty Images. Yosemite National Park, California Famous for its sheer granite cliff faces, spectacular waterfalls and glacier-carved valleys, Yosemite has been a mecca for rock climbers and mountaineers for nearly two centuries. But that doesn’t mean non-climbers will enjoy the park any less. Yosemite has a well-maintained network of auto roads and 750 miles of trails. Located in June Lake, the Double Eagle Resort and Spa is a four-season resort perfect for travelers who want a relaxing place to unwind after a long day driving. And the resort is just 12 miles from the park entrance. One of the best ways to experience Yosemite is by hiking and backpacking. For road-trippers who’d rather not venture into the backcountry without a guide, REI Adventures offers a variety of trips that cater to hikers of all experience levels, ranging from four to seven-day outings, depending on your schedule. After Labor Day, the crowds thin significantly, and the foliage on the oaks, maples and dogwoods begins to transform into a riot of hues. After spending time in Yosemite, the route shifts north, with an eight-hour drive to Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. Distance: 450 miles. Crater Lake National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin Crater Lake National Park, Oregon Formed by a violent volcanic eruption some 7,700 years ago, Crater Lake is the deepest in the United States and arguably the most pristine in the world, making it worthy of the creation of Oregon’s singular national park. From the loop road, visitors can admire the deep sapphire blue waters and imposing silhouette of the Cascade Mountains. There are also excellent hiking trails that lead to the multiple summits framing the lake. Garfield Peak, for example, is accessible via a 3.4-mile out and back trail. The hike can get very crowded, however, and is strenuous at times. Built in 1915, Crater Lake Lodge, which has a rustic northwest vibe, is the perfect place to rest a road (and trail) weary head. Next, continue north for about seven hours to Olympic National Park. The cities of Portland and Seattle are great destinations to visit if you are looking for a break from nature (read: better food and coffee). Distance : 400 miles. Photo by @ChreesyBear via Twenty20 Olympic National Park, Washington One of the most unique national parks in the country, Olympic is home to several different ecosystems scattered across its almost one million acres. Visitors will find glacier-capped mountains, old-growth temperate rainforests and ragged coastline. Due to its vastness, the best way to explore this park is to leave the car behind and head out on foot. Hurricane Ridge is a great year-round attraction, offering hikes in the summer and lift-access skiing and snowboarding during the winter. The Lake Crescent Lodge is located within park boundaries, and it’s a tranquil retreat with a mix of rooms and cabins. If you decide instead to stay in Seattle, book a room at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel with The Platinum Card® from American Express. As it’s a member of Amex Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts, you’ll get an upgrade upon arrival (depending on availability), a $100 food and beverage credit and complimentary breakfast for two, along with other perks. You can spend a long time in Olympic National Park and its surrounding cities. But when you’re ready to move on, head north again for about four hours to the North Cascades National Park. The most direct route from the northern part of the park requires a ride on the Port Townsend-Coupeville Ferry. Distance : 170 miles. North Cascades National Park, Washington Located just a few hours from Seattle, the North Cascades National Park is a pristine alpine escape. There are two properties in the national park, including a lake resort and the North Cascades Lodge at Stehekin. For something more casual, consider an Airbnb (and put it on your Chase Sapphire Reserve for 3x points). Anglers will be happy to know that the park is home to a variety of salmon and steelhead trout and other species. Try your luck in the Skagit River, one of Washington’s major watersheds. Grab a drink (after you’re done driving for the day, of course) in the town of Bellingham at the new Twin Sisters Brewing Company. At this point in the trip, you can make the decision to fly back east, or head eastbound by road, stopping at a few more major national parks. Distance : 500 miles. Glacier National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin. Glacier National Park, Montana Straddling the continental divide, Glacier National Park is home to headwaters that feed the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay. Over a thousand different plant species, along with hundreds of animal species, can be found in the park’s mountainous alpine terrain, making it a great place to search for wildlife. While in the park, be sure to drive the Going-to-the-Sun Road, enjoying its many viewpoints along the way. Whitefish is a fun town to check out, and it’s filled with plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants. Book a room at a historic lodge or inn, such as the Lodge at Whitefish Lake or the upscale Grouse Mountain Lodge. Fill up your vehicle in town, and press on about six more hours to see Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park. Distance : 400 miles. Yellowstone National Park. Photo by Getty Images Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming Yellowstone National Park is a geologically unique landscape: of mountains, bubbling geysers and steaming hot springs. The adjacent Grand Teton National Park, on the other hand, offers some of the most rugged and rocky mountains in the country — with a fraction of the crowds. Spend a night at the 385-room Jackson Lake Lodge (a mix of suites, cottages and rooms), located in the Tetons, where guests can admire the view from 60-foot floor-to-ceiling windows. While in the area, be sure to visit the iconic Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone, easily accessible via a paved walkway. Once you make your way south toward the Tetons, spend an evening wandering around the western mountain town of Jackson, and grab a meal at the famous Million Dollar Cowboy Steakhouse. Grand Tetons National Park. Photo by Josh Laskin. Alternate routes If you decide to drive back instead of catching a flight, spend the next two or three days pressing eastward, stopping to visit a few more nation parks and forests. The George Washington and Jefferson National Forest in West Virginia, and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on the Pennsylvania/New Jersey border, for example, are great options. And while the suggested route starts in the Northeast, there are endless variations of this trip, depending on where you live. For travelers based on the West Coast, consider beginning at Olympic National Park and working your way to Glacier, Yellowstone and the Tetons before heading east.

"Eric Rosen, Contributor, Eric Rosen, Contributor https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrosen/","As the end of 2018 approaches and travelers prepare to plan their trips in 2019 and beyond, the internet becomes a veritable cacophony of catalogs listing up-and-coming destinations for every taste and budget. One of the latest lists comes courtesy of travel industry disruptor Airbnb, which rounded up a roll of 19 destinations for 2019. The company based its list on a combination of criteria, including Airbnb searches, growth forecasts and additions to users wish lists, coming out with a compilation that skews heavily toward off-the-beaten-path towns and regions. Airbnbs news release on the topic highlights travelers increasing focus on sustainable and authentic tourism, as well as users interest in visiting and helping communities that have experienced recent hardships or disasters including earthquakes and wildfires. The coastal town of Kaikoura in New Zealand topped this year's list. Tim Marshall via Unsplash Topping this years list is Kaikoura, New Zealand, which showed a 295% increase in year-over-year bookings. The coastal town on New Zealands South Island was heavily damaged by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in 2016. Transportation services to the historic whaling town have reemerged following the disaster, though, and visitors are flocking there for nature activities such as seal-sighting and whale-watching. Next on the list is Xiamen, China. The port city has become an aviation hub where travelers are likely spending some more layovers these days. Airbnb notes booking increases of 283% year-over-year thanks to attractions like local pub crawls, a strong food scene, and the charms of nearby Kulangsu, a pedestrian-only UNESCO-listed island just off the coast. Xiamen ranked high with foodies this year. Airbnb Coming in at number three is Puebla, Mexico, a colonial city with over 300 churches just a three-hour drive from Mexico City. Instead of the typical Mexican beach vacation, visitors are traveling here to take cooking classes, see lucha libre matches and help out with recovery efforts after the 2017 earthquake that rocked the city. In fact, the city enjoyed a 220% bump in year-over-year searches and a 206% increase in wish-list inclusions. Normandy, France, is attracting history buffs and beachgoers alike thanks to its dramatic English Channel coast. 2019 will mark the 75 th anniversary if the D-Day landings, which is probably partially behind a 229% increase in bookings and a 120% increase in searches. Airbnb also points to the popularity of architectural tours, a cheese trail and the areas World War II history. With the 75th anniversary of D-Day, Normandy is high on everyone's list.

Shane Mitchell,"Good food is worth a thousand words—sometimes more! In My Family Recipe, a writer shares the story of a single dish they've inherited, and why it's meaningful to them. The night before a long road trip, my mother always fried chicken. She wrapped each piece in waxed paper, enough for three hungry kids, and packed them in a tin-lined cooler. Then, she boiled eggs and filled a large thermos with orange Tang. (This was 1962, before the rise of fast food franchises on the freeway.) She was a thrifty traveler. My parents owned a Volkswagen Type 2 T1, a boxy rear-engine van familiarly known as the VW Microbus, which would eventually come to symbolize a counterculture era of peace, love, and vagabonding. Steel grey and ivory two-tone, with a dial-operated radio that crackled between AM signals and spillproof rubber floor mats, our “Vee-Dub” was customized with Mom-made curtains on the rear windows and a folding table my father built and bolted to the interior paneling. He also flipped the bench seats to face each other, so we could dine at rest stops together on the way down to South Carolina’s Lowcountry, where we'd visit extended family during summer vacations. The bus had an awkward gearshift column and faulty battery; whoever was behind the wheel often needed to jumpstart it on a dead roll out of our steep driveway. If the engine didn’t kick over by the bottom of the hill, we weren’t going anywhere that day. When we did make it to the open road, chugging along at a top speed of 60 mph, my siblings and I filled the long hours tussling in the way back. No child restraints existed then, let alone rear passenger safety belts. We invented our own weird word association games—one was simply called “ICA” and involved guessing what the other person saw. We sang nursery rhymes over and over; “The Itsy Bitsy Spider” drove my parents around the bend. My father was an artist, and banned coloring books because he thought they stifled creativity, but we never lacked for blank notepads and giant boxes of crayons. When it got too dark to draw or read Little Golden Books, we snuggled under blankets with our favorite stuffed animals and counted stars outside the window. The chaos and clutter attending family road trips intensified after my two youngest sisters were born, increasing the backseat population to five, along with several beloved dogs, including one who ran away during a terrifying thunderstorm when we stopped in a strange town. She was never found and we cried for days. Thank goodness for pet microchips now. We puttered the Jersey Turnpike, crossed the Chesapeake Bay on a car ferry, bought souvenirs at wacky roadside attractions in the Smoky Mountains, erected sandcastles on Myrtle Beach, and occasionally detoured for no better reason than a billboard advertising fireworks or an underground cavern with a stalactite organ. Everywhere, we ate my mother’s chicken. One of the photographs from this era that I treasure shows Mom sitting in the VW at the Slack Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway in northern Virginia. She was peeling a hard-boiled egg as I gnawed on a drumstick. Flower-decorated Dixie cups, miniature plastic salt and pepper shakers, and paper plates set on the picnic table; a cardboard Ball jar box loaded with a bag of Wise potato chips and other road snacks close to hand. My brother Jamie sucked a Tootsie Pop, my sister Kaki clutched her sock monkey. Cold fried chicken may not appeal to every palate, but we kids loved the softened crust and depth of flavor that only time in a picnic cooler confers. It wasn’t as hot and crisp as it'd be right out of the frying pan, but it still made us happy, miles away from one of her home-cooked meals. My mother grew up in Florence, South Carolina, and even through the Depression—like a lot of comfortably situated white Southerners at the time—her parents could still afford a cook, so Mom didn’t learn how to prepare dinners until she married and moved up North. Turns out she was pretty good at it. Her two favorite cookbooks were Larousse Gastronomique and Charleston Receipts. They were her only cookbooks, actually. The Microbus eventually gave out, and my folks scrapped it. Too bad they didn’t know then how much a vintage model in mint condition sells for at classic car auctions today. But those early road trips taught me to appreciate the rhythm of a long journey. My husband and I still drive South to visit family. Pillows, check. Dog toys, check. Cue the podcasts, set the GPS, pin pet-friendly rest stops. Toss a coin to see who gets behind the wheel first. The route we follow from northern New York passes countless Cracker Barrels and Pilot Flying J truck plazas, continues through the Shenandoah Valley and over the Blue Ridge Parkway, where we pause to picnic at the same overlook near Rockfish Gap my parents once favored. And yes, there is still cold fried chicken. My husband gets dibs on the drumsticks. To interrupt this trip down memory lane, however, I should make clear that my mother never passed on her recipe, because she was one of those parents who refused to relinquish control of the stove. (She died way too young in 1989, before we could truly appreciate her kitchen legacy.) So, like her, I had to teach myself. Got a family recipe you'd like to share?

ELAINE GLUSAC,"INTO THE WILD Under Canvas operates seasonal glamping resorts near national parks, among them Yellowstone, Zion and Glacier. Last month, it opened Under Canvas Rushmore in South Dakota through Oct. 1. The solar-powered forest compound of 80 four-person tents, each with a wood stove and some with attached bathrooms, offers views of Mount Rushmore (from $209). Guests can eat hearty breakfasts and campfire dinners of smoked, grilled and roasted meats on site, and the kitchen packs box lunches for those heading out to climb, bike or take Jeep safaris. On Aug. 30, Under Canvas Great Smoky Mountains will open in Gatlinburg, Tenn., with 54 tents on 200 acres near the national park (from $199). Collective Hill Country, the second opening this summer of a glamping resort by Collective Retreats, will spring up on a 225-acre ranch near Austin, Tex., offering activities like horseback riding and winery tours. Guests in its 12 tents will dine on campfire dishes like jalapeño and Cheddar grits and wild boar osso buco (from $400). On the Hudson River in Kingston, N. Y., Terra Glamping is slated to open this month at Hutton Brickyards, a riverside event venue, with 25 tents featuring memory-foam mattresses, down bedding, Turkish towels and robes (from $225). Guests can borrow bikes, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards, as well as lanterns and flashlights after dark. For beach lovers, Wild Lotus operates a tented camp on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Tents come with blowup mattresses, coolers and ice, and guests have access to showers at a neighboring beach bar (from $149). Or you can glamp at the company’s rain forest camp on nearby Montserrat. Among the truly glamorous new glamping facilities, the Rosewood Luang Prabang opened in March in a forested setting near the Laotian city with six deluxe tents among its 23 accommodations (from $724). While residing closer to nature, guests of the tent suites have access to the resort’s many amenities: a pool, tented spa villas, restaurant and activities such as cooking classes and Mekong River cruises.","The allure of luxury camping has brought a wave of new destinations this year, and they aren’t always in the wild.",2018-06-15T09:00:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Getaway: Glamping Slips Into the Mainstream,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/travel/luxury-camping.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/17/travel/17Getaway1/17Getaway1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Smoky Mountains,0

Matthew Hayes,"Vancouver was covered in fog. Nearby the North Shore Mountains kept their beauty veiled behind a dense, low cloud, and everywhere the tops of buildings crept up and away into smoky white nothingness. I had crossed the border and infiltrated MechCon as an outsider -- a total stranger to the BattleTech universe -- and for a couple of hours I was able to get my hands on the first single-player MechWarrior game we've seen in fifteen years. The fans and attendees here are frenzied in their anticipation, and I'm starting to understand why. If you're a MechWarrior fan, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries is gearing up to deliver one of the most compelling and comprehensive single-player experiences you could hope for. If you're completely ignorant of BattleTech 's 30-plus-year history, and know absolutely nothing about its incredibly complex canon, let me sort this out straight away: the Mechs are the stars of the show. If your heart flutters at the prospect of piloting a massive walking tank, and wielding obscenely destructive weapons capable of leveling entire fortresses, this is your bag. (Photo: Piranha Games) In our demo we had three Mech models to choose from. The Atlas-class Mech was by far the largest and most intimidating, and so naturally, I decided to take that one for a spin. I deployed to Denbar Prime, and landed in an area densely covered with forest greenery and mountains. Trees cracked and snapped like twigs as I walked over them, and with every step a deep and satisfying thud pounded through my headphones. I felt unstoppable, and with fully-engaged thrusters I crushed a path through the forest toward my target, who I assume was probably doing some paperwork and feeling quite secure in his lofty tower surrounded by military fortifications. I encountered some small tanks, turrets, and attack helicopters along the way, and this is when I realized just how effectively immersive MechWarrior 5 's presentation can be. These tanks and choppers might as well have been ants and gnats -- they seemed so small and puny from my cockpit -- but as they opened fire I was startled by the percussive and muffled impacts that shot into my ears. Ping! Bom! Pong! I started to panic, and soon I was making hurried efforts to stop my momentum, lock on to my enemies, and retaliate. This is where things get tricky, and very satisfying. You have to take command of your Mech in order to effectively take out your targets. Lasers, rockets, cannons, ballistics... These are all at your disposal (depending on your particular Mech's loadout), but this is different from the first-person shooters you're used to. There is an art to managing your directional momentum and positioning. With fingers flying you will constantly be steering and turning your stories-tall war machine, rotating and twisting to protect damaged limbs and fire upon enemies. There's no sprinting or quickly ducking behind cover here. You have to fully commit to your actions in MechWarrior, and sometimes losing an arm means losing your most powerful weapon. There is a cost for every action you take, and an opportunity cost for every chance you don't take. (Photo: Piranha Games) The same can be said off of the battlefield as well, and this is what I find most exciting about MechWarrior 5. You are going to forge your own path within this war-torn universe, and endeavor to make a name for yourself. This game takes place within a very specific stretch of the BattleTech timeline, and with every new game you're telling a brand new story. You show up on the scene in the year 3015 as a nobody. You've inherited a mercenary company and a single, unimpressive Mech. As feudal warfare rages in the inner sphere between long-standing houses of power, it is your goal to build an elite mercenary group capable of impacting the momentum of history through your might on the field, and your cunning off of it. You're not a hero, and you're not a great leader. You're you, in this universe, and you will decide how your life plays out. You will decide which great house you want to work with, or work against. You will decide how to spend your time and money. You will witness the evolution of military technology and use it to your advantage as you endeavor to form a respectable squad of mercenaries, and every single time you play through this game it's going to be different. Speaking with Piranha Games Junior Producer Alex Garden, it dawned on me that this is going to be role-playing heaven for long-time BattleTech fans. He explained that every time you take on a mission, the parameters are generated on the spot. Enemy placement, objective placement, dynamic difficulty, terrain... all of this is overseen by an ""intelligent director"" and will be unique with every playthrough. That means that if you want to experience the most formative years of the BattleTech canon as the leader of a pirate mercenary group who partners with the lawless forces along the outer perimeter of the system, actively sabotaging the efforts of the great houses, you can do that. If you want to relive this arc as the loyal muscle of the Federated Suns, serving the House Davion and enjoying all of the privileges and alliances that come with that loyalty, you can do that too. While there is a defined meta-story that is playing out in the greater universe around you, you will never tell the same story twice as you play through, and your missions, Mechs, upgrades, alliances, and rivalries will always be changing. It's as if you've been given the opportunity to live as many lives as you want, selecting one avatar after another and using their life as a kind of sandbox in this storied and bizarre universe that fans have come to love so much over the decades. (Photo: Piranha Games) Can you see the big picture? Are the pieces starting to fall into place for you like they have for me? Piranha Games is endeavoring to take a stretch of this very precious canon, crack it open, and let you go play inside of it however you like. Master your machine; multiply your resources; recruit your crew; form your alliances; forge your own fate and tug on the strings from which the great houses dangle and sway. Or, you know, just have fun blowing shit up with your giant robot. MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries will be launching in 2018. We'll have an official release date and more preview coverage for you very soon, so stay tuned!","Comicbook.com MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries Hands-On Preview Comicbook.com Vancouver was covered in fog.

Rachael Lock,"The peaks of theGreat Smoky Mountains, encased in greenery and reaching over 6,000 feet, have a national park named in their honor. It’s home to more biodiversity than any other in the park system. Spanning the borders of both Tennessee and North Carolina, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is also the most visited park in the system with over 10 million annual visits. Just east of the park, the bustling city of Asheville couples unmatched scenery and easy access to the park. Add in a friendly, outdoorsy vibe and Asheville is the perfect landing spot for your Great Smoky Mountains getaway. 
Access an unbusy visitors center and trails in the heart of the park.
Asheville is located between the Great Smoky Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northern part of North Carolina. You’ll get more peak views driving into the park from Asheville than from the popular vacation towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge to the west of the park — and the drive from Asheville to the park gate takes less than an hour. Another bonus of basing yourself in Asheville is that you’ll experience far less traffic heading into the park during the busy months of summer. Along the way you’ll pass shimmering lakes, forests, and bustling businesses, all of which provide plenty of things to do and see before and after you head into mountains. 
From Asheville, you have a few options to get into the national park. The most straightforward is to hop on Interstate 40 and cruise west. However, this is more of a streamlined interstate to get drivers through the park more quickly, so there aren’t many pull-offs to enjoy the views along the way. To get into the heart of the park, get off the interstate at exit 27 onto US-74 and head towards Cherokee, then go north on US-441 towards Oconaluftee. Here, you will find trails that are just as beautiful as those on the main side of the park but less frequented during peak season. 
When you pass Cherokee and continue north, Oconaluftee is the next significant point of interest. This scenic area has a small visitors center and a historic village, offering a unique vantage point of the area even to those who’ve visited the Smoky Mountains before. As a bonus, the elk that frequent the area can usually be seen at dusk or dawn before they head back into the mountains. Keep your eyes peeled as they love to scrounge for food. If you happen to see an elk while driving, never stop your vehicle. Find a parking spot or turn around to see it again as sudden stops can cause a collision and back up the roadway. 
Take advantage of lesser-visited attractions on the park’s eastern side.
If you’ve never seen an old grist mill, make sure to stop by the one at Mingus Creek after you’re done at Oconaluftee. This 1886 mill is still operational and debatably makes the best cornmeal around. But the real perk is that this is where you’ll find the trailhead to the Mingus Creek Trail, a hike as breathtakingly beautiful as it is isolated. The trail is an out-and-back hike of 5.8 miles rated moderately challenging, and if you feel like pushing on further, it does connect to other trails along the way. You don’t have to do the whole trek in order to reach incredible views, however. After a little over a mile of walking, you’ll encounter a fork in the road that leads to a spooky old cemetery on the right fork.
Keep driving along US-441 until you encounter the Swinging Bridge Quiet Walkway Trailhead, a name much more convoluted than the hike itself. This trail is a short out-and-back jaunt with breathtaking views of the hills and forest. Many people actually miss the trail by never looking past the overlook. Look for a small weathered tan sign at the edge of the parking lot and, upon closer inspection, you will see “quiet walkway” and a set of pointed instructions to “take your time.” Once you’ve abided the directions at the overlook, taking in all of the expansive mountain views, venture over to the trail to soak in even more natural beauty. 
Toast to your adventure in town with craft beer.
Few things go better with exploring the outdoors than beer, and few places do beer as well as Asheville. Opportunities abound all over town to cheers with a well-deserved brew and chat away about the day’s adventures. Asheville Brewing Company is your first port of call, a friendly brewpub that not only serves amazing craft beer but also delicious pizza and burgers, as well. You can sit outside at both its downtown and North Asheville locations. 
Another strong pull is Wicked Week Brewing, located downtown and offering a bustling patio scene. For something a little more lively, hop on over to Off The Wagon Dueling Piano Bar Asheville. You’ll find it on the last brick road in Asheville. The inside has a very 1920s vibe though the musicians here are anything but old-school. Prepare to have an exciting and entertaining night as the over-21 crowd experiences a different kind of piano dueling.
No matter where you stay, drink, or play, you will not feel the “touristy” vibe in Asheville. It’s easy to feel like a local here, particularly if you’ve spent time in similarly outdoorsy, hipster-friendly, mid-size cities like Boulder or Missoula. Asheville blends southern history, good food, and a friendly atmosphere. These features, coupled with it’s close proximity to The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, make the town your perfect basecamp. If you haven’t had enough adventure by the time the next morning comes, the river of beer awaits.",Easy access to lesser-known trails.

Jenny Armini,"In late June 1973, Republican Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee earned his place in history by asking the essential question of the Watergate hearings: “What did the president know and when did he know it?” Baker had been a Nixon ally. In February 1973, he told Nixon, “I’m your friend. I’m going to see that your interests are protected.” But that was before the revelation that Nixon had recorded Oval Office conversations, and before White House Counsel John Dean diagnosed the presidency with “cancer.” The changing Watergate dynamics changed Baker. You don’t need to be an oncologist to figure out that the country is suffering from a recurrence of the same disease. We have another president under investigation, one accused of high crimes, misdemeanors, and everything in between. What we don’t have is another Baker. No one in the GOP has shown themselves ready, as the saying goes, to put country before party. [ Yoni Appelbaum: Impeach the president ] John McCain is dead. Lindsey Graham has gone MAGA. Susan Collins never lives up to liberal fantasies. And Mitt Romney is Mitt Romney; his naked ambition and political opportunism make him a less-than-ideal protagonist. But Democrats can’t take on the president alone. A recent ABC News/ Washington Post poll found that although a majority of Americans support investigating President Donald Trump, a significant portion—46 percent—believe that any process conducted by House Democrats would be unfair. Only one Republican senator might shift from protector to prosecutor, as Baker did, and bridge the trust gap: Baker’s protégé, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. As Alexander’s former student and speechwriter, I can attest to the senator’s rectitude. Democrats set on impeachment should realize that Alexander is their pressure point. He was made for this moment, in part because he made his career in Baker’s image. Alexander served as Baker’s first legislative aide, in 1966, and worked again for him in the late ’70s. Like Baker, Alexander has unassailable party bona fides. He is regularly endorsed by the National Rifle Association, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the National Right to Life Committee. And he has bipartisan credentials, too. He and the Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington worked on medical research, education, and opioid addiction as the Senate leaders of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The two made a valiant attempt at fixing the Affordable Care Act. Murray, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and other Democrats have spent time at Alexander’s cabin in the Smoky Mountains. [ Read: Why Democrats have suddenly started talking about impeachment ] This way of doing business descends directly from Baker, who liked to quote his father as saying, “You should always listen to the other fella. He might just be right.” Alexander shares Baker’s talent for “eloquent listening,” a phrase Alexander used when he eulogized his mentor in 2014. For all their similarities, Alexander has eclipsed Baker. Alexander was a popular two-term governor, university president, U.S. secretary of education, and presidential candidate. But his ability to talk about the country with the country is what truly separates him from other political leaders. A jaded Harvard grad student, I was surprised to find myself inspired when a conservative from East Tennessee connected the intricacies of election reform to the national narrative and the strengths of the American character. With candid optimism, he bridged our differences. Alexander has the stature to help Congress and the country navigate through possible impeachment and removal proceedings. And, as luck would have it, he’s retiring at the end of his term, so he doesn’t have to worry about repercussions from the still Trump-infatuated Republican base. Of course, the fact that Alexander is right for the job doesn’t mean he wants it. In recent interviews, he has dismissed the idea that retirement offers a chance to play a mediating role in Washington. “They took Trump and they didn’t take me,” he told Vox. Democrats looking for an ally should ignore that quip, which undersells his five decades of service. Instead, they should look to Lamar Alexander’s Little Plaid Book, the paperback he published in 1998 that describes his 311 rules for living. In it, he tells a story about a Dwight D. Eisenhower Cabinet meeting. It was rife with indecision. Each secretary was protecting his particular interest. Ike nearly lost his cool. The president finally boiled the chaos down to one essential question, which became Alexander’s Rule 151. “When stumped for an answer, ask yourself, ‘What is the right thing to do?’ Then do it.”",Impeachment-focused Democrats need a Republican ally if they’re going to succeed.,2019-02-07T11:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Will Lamar Alexander Turn on Trump?,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/lamar-alexander-could-help-democrats-impeach-trump/582079/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX6JHCD/facebook.jpg?1549391326,,Theatlantic.com,Smoky Mountains,0

The Associated Press,"Poor air quality will be common across parts of the Pacific Northwest this week as winds push smoke from surrounding wildfires into the region, forecasters and regulators said. Air quality alerts are in effect for much of Washington state through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Smoky, hazy conditions are making a return to the Puget Sound region because of wildfires in British Columbia and the Cascade Mountains, according to the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. Smoke could worsen into unhealthy levels by Monday, the agency said. An air quality alert is also in place across eastern Washington and north Idaho. Smoke from fires in British Columbia drifting into Washington and Idaho will cause unhealthy air levels through Tuesday, the weather service said. On Sunday afternoon, several monitors in north-central Washington state showed air quality at hazardous levels. Two women's college soccer matches scheduled at Gonzaga University in Spokane and Eastern Washington University in Cheney were canceled Sunday because of the poor air quality, university officials said. Air pollution can be a particular concern to sensitive groups such as the elderly, children and those with respiratory conditions. But high levels of pollution can affect everyone. Environmental regulators also issued a pollution advisory for southwest Washington, Portland and much of the Willamette Valley. The air quality level is expected to reach into unhealthy for sensitive groups. Conditions are expected to get worse Sunday night and last through Wednesday. An air pollution advisory for southern Oregon remains in effect until further notice.","ABC News Smoky skies, poor air from wildfires return to Northwest ABC News Poor air quality will be common across parts of the Pacific Northwest this week as winds push smoke from surrounding wildfires into the region, forecasters and regulators said.

Keshia Badalge,"The architecture of a city so often becomes an integral part of its branding and identity. The distinguishing image of Paris is the Eiffel Tower and Haussmann apartments. San Francisco has the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, of course. And New York has lofts, brownstones, impressive skyscrapers like the Empire State Building, and quirky modern residences designed by big names like Zaha Hadid and Bjarke Ingels. But you don't always need to live in a city with exorbitant rents to enjoy beautiful architecture. In fact, some of the country's best architecture lies just outside city lines—meaning one of these unexpectedly architectural cities probably isn't too far from you (and it might even be surprisingly affordable). Here, five unique towns: New Canaan, Connecticut (Image credit: Michael Biondo) Median Home Value: $1,297,100, according to Zillow. Homes for sale (as of writing): 366 What's so cool about it: After fleeing Germany, Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus movement, took a position at the Harvard Graduate School of Design between 1937 and 1946. Then, in 1948, he and a group of architects now famously known as the ""Harvard Five""—Eliot Noyes, Philip Johnson, Landis Gores, John M. Johansen, and Marcel Breuer—took over New Canaan as a modernist incubator and built several landmarks. The most famous building here is Philip Johnson's iconic Glass House, a transparent, 1,800 square-foot glass box built in 1949. It houses a permanent collection of 20th century paintings and sculptures and temporary exhibitions and installations by artists. Other landmarks include SANAA's Grace Farms and the 1960 Gores Pavilion. Just two months ago, the town of New Canaan played host to the annual Iconic Houses Conference. Conference participants from all around the world came to New Canaan to survey the landmark modernist icons. Your cool house options: Philip Johnson's Wiley House is on the market, but it's going to cost you a cool $8.5 million. At $879,000, this mid-century modern beauty is a less-pricey option that still maintains the town's signature style. Columbus, Indiana (Image credit: Nagel Photography/Shutterstock) Median Home Value: $146,300, according to Zillow. Homes for sale (as of writing): 292 What's so cool about it: Columbus architecture was brought under the spotlight when the 2017 movie Columbus featured a backdrop of the town's modernist buildings, like the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library by I. M. Pei. Pritzker Architecture Prize winners Robert Venturi and Richard Meier have also developed projects here. The city's official center maintains a list of 75 notable architectural projects. Of these, seven have since been designated as national historical landmarks: the First Christian Church by Eliel Saarinen (1942); Irwin Conference Center (1954), Miller House and Garden (1957), and North Christian Church (1964) by Eero Saarinen; Mabel McDowell Adult Education Center by John Carl Warnecke (1960), First Baptist Church by Harry Weese (1965), and The Republic by Myron Goldsmith (1971). Your cool house options: Though many of the city's fabulous architecture is public facing, there are some private Modernist-inspired options, too. For example, this 1960s brick home built by architect Harry Weese is on the market for $686,400. Into older homes? This charming 1920s home (complete with a claw-footed tub) is on sale for $165,000. Taos, New Mexico (Image credit: Angel McNall Photography/Shutterstock) Median Home Value: $384,000, according to Zillow. Homes for sale (as of writing): 436 What's so cool about it: Taos is a town in the far north of New Mexico, away from the main draws of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It is an architectural town in its own right with historic adobe complexes such as the Taos Pueblo, a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and a National Historic Landmark, as well as many galleries and museums in Pueblo Revival or Mission Revival architectural styles. One of these is the Taos Art Museum, a museum in the former home of Russian artist Nicolai Fechin. Other buildings of architectural importance include Spanish Colonial buildings such as the Kit Carson Home and Museum and Hacienda de los Martinez, and grand bridges such as the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. Taos is also a great place to see unique Earthship biotecture. Your cool house options: There are plenty of Pueblo-style homes on the market, like this two-bed, three-bath home with mountain views for $540,000, and this curvy adobe and wood style for $699,000 Knoxville, Tennessee (Image credit: CrackerClips Stock Media/Shutterstock) Median Home Value: $160,000, according to Zillow. Homes for sale (as of writing): 2,573 What's so cool about it: The city of Knoxville, Tennessee, is less than an hour away from the Smoky Mountains National Park. But it holds its own as an architectural beauty for visitors that pass through. For starters, there's the huge Sunsphere, a 266-feet high hexagonal steel structure with a 75-foot golden orb at the top. It was the symbol for the 1982 World's Fair and has become an unmistakable Knoxville icon. But there are other highlights, too, such as the Tennessee Theatre, a 1920s ""entertainment palace"" that features a Spanish-Moorish style interior, Czechoslovakian crystals, French-style chandeliers, and Italian terrazzo flooring. Many of the homes in Knoxville are also on the National Register of Historic Places for their trademark architectural styles. These include the Benjamin Morton House (Colonial Revival), Central United Methodist Church (Gothic Revival), The Robert Daniel House (Streamline Moderne), Greystone (Romanesque), and the Ivan Racheff House &amp; Gardens (American Craftsman). Your cool house options: This colorful and affordable Queen Anne Victorian is going for $335,000. There's also a $99,900 Craftsman-Style home ripe for a renovation. Wilmington, North Carolina Median Home Value: $216,200 according to Zillow. Homes for sale (as of writing): 2,573 What's so cool about it: Wilmington—like Knoxville—has an eclectic mix of architecture within its residential neighborhoods. And location scouts love it! Known by some as the ""Hollywood of the East,"" Wilmington has been featured in ""Dawson's Creek,"" ""One Tree Hill,"" ""A Walk to Remember,"" and ""Iron Man 3."" Apart from great examples of American Craftsman, Colonial Revival, and Queen Anne architecture, there are also the Antebellum mansions. Though these are often spaces with sordid pasts, there are spaces like the Bellamy Mansion Museum, which not only acknowledges the beauty of the house, but more importantly pays deference to the enslaved people who spent their lives working in these homes. Your cool house options: The perfectly purple Smith-Willoughby home by Burett H. Stephens is on the market for $319,000. Or if you desire something more grandiose (and have $2.5 million to spare), you can pick up The Graystone Inn, a Neo-Classical Revival home designed by architect Charles MacMillen.","The architecture of a city so often becomes an integral part of its branding and identity.

Michael Zhang,"When photographing wild animals in the great outdoors (especially big ones), it’s important to stay at a safe distance for the good of both you and the animal. But one sightseer in a Canadian national park was recently seen giving a masterclass in how NOT to shoot from a reasonable distance. Sundog Tours guide Kendra Neef Nace was giving a wildlife tour in Albertas Jasper National Park back on August 23rd when her group came across a large elk. While her tour group watched the elk from the roadside, a man who was traveling with his family (and not part of the tour) decided to walk up to the elk for some close-up shots with his camera. The man only ran away when the elk started lowering its antlers and apparently getting ready to charge. Nace caught the incident in this 16-second video: “This man was not one of my guests,” Nace tells PetaPixel. “We were viewing this elk and his harem when this man approached. I shouted out the window at him multiple times that it was dangerous and recommended he return to his car. He laughed and waved at me saying it was fine, and that’s when I started recording.” Nace says that this type of incident is unfortunately quite common in national parks such as Jasper and Banff. “Unfortunately many tourists don’t recognize the danger that potentially comes with approaching wild animals, especially during mating season,” Nace says. “This man was extremely lucky that the elk didn’t make contact, but eventually the animal will lose its patience and someone will get hurt. “And often that ends in the termination of that animal because of ‘public safety’.” Back in 2013, a photographer in North Carolina’s Great Smoky Mountains National Park was filmed getting into a headbutting match with a young elk. The photographer had been shooting from “a safe and respectful” distance before the elk approached. After the video went viral, the elk was killed by park authorities for the safety of visitors because it “could not be re-trained to be fearful of humans.” Nace says that while her video above is the worst incident she’s been able to catch on camera, she has seen everything from tourists trying to feed bears to people trying to pet elk. And when things go wrong, it’s often the animals that also suffer the consequences of people’s actions.","When photographing wild animals in the great outdoors (especially big ones), it’s important to stay at a safe distance for the good of both you and the animal.

Lynn Neary,"Novelist Richard Powers lives in a house perched on a hillside, just on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. ""It's very much a tree house,"" he says with a laugh. ""That's why I live here."" His latest book, The Overstory, brought him to the old growth forests of Tennessee. The novel follows the lives of nine different people, all determined to save ancient trees from destruction. Their lives become entwined as they fight to save virgin forests, with unforeseen consequences. Powers makes no apology for his current obsession with trees, though for most of his life he knew little about them. ""I could probably name with some certainty, maybe three of four trees,"" he admits. That is hard to believe because The Overstory is sprinkled with fascinating details: How the American chestnut disappeared, how a huge banyan tree grows from a small fig, how trees communicate with each other. Powers did extensive research and says these facts are a crucial part of this story about the fight to save old growth forests. ""What a tree can do to transform the atmosphere, to transform the soil, is absolutely part of the story of humans trying to give to these huge, ancient, incredibly diverse and incredibly supple creatures, the same kind of sanctity that we reserve exclusively for ourselves,"" he says. Powers roots his book in the stories of nine people, from a famous botanist to a down and out Vietnam vet. All of them have some connection to trees. Some of them eventually meet as radical environmentalists in the Pacific Northwest. Their struggle to save the old growth forest ends in violence. But it begins with their reverence for trees, especially one ancient redwood. Novelist Richard Powers moved to Tennessee after first visiting the Smoky Mountains — shown above, at sunset — for research. NPS ""The trick there was making the people come to see that tree and the magnificence of that tree,"" Powers explains. ""To have these humans fall in love with that tree and want to protect it with their lives and fail to do so. That's something that a reader who's completely tree-blind might sit up and take notice."" Powers is the very opposite of tree-blind. Walking through the woods he stops constantly to smell or touch. Standing on an overlook, with a view of the mountains in the distance, Powers observes the scene with the keen eye of someone who understands forests. ""To a person who's not tuned into trees it's just a kind of mass of green,"" he says. ""But as your eye attenuates, the mountains start to divide up into patches."" Those patches are different kinds of forests and Powers has hiked through all of them. ""I have these thrilling moments when I turn a corner and, all of a sudden, from one step to the next, I go from one of these forest types to the other,"" he says. ""It's the most dramatic thing, the ground under your feet changes, the smell of the air changes, the look, the color of the air changes."" Writing The Overstory has changed Powers' life. He moved to Tennessee after first visiting the Smoky Mountains for research. I want to see what a forest looked like before Europeans came here. I want to see what America looked like 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 8,000 years ago. Novelist Richard Powers ""The more I read about it, the more I thought: I have to see this,"" he says. ""If I'm going to write about these things, I want to see what a forest looked like before Europeans came here. I want to see what America looked like 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 8,000 years ago."" We head up to see such a forest which is just a short walk off a winding mountain road. It's like walking into the primeval forest of folk tales, shrouded in fog with patches of snow here and there. Huge tree trunks and branches sprawl on the ground while living trees rise high above. Blankets of thick moss and lichen cover everything. A giant root system stands on its side towering above us. A forest like this can't be tamed and should never be lost, says Powers. ""There's something about an old growth forest that flies in the face of management and rationality,"" he says. ""It's crazy, it's messy, it's dynamic, it's brutal. But once you ease into it, that mess becomes part of the beauty."" These trees have been here for centuries, Power says. To save them, and ourselves, will require a shift in human consciousness — a new way of thinking. He believes literature will have a role in bringing that change about. ""There's a whole new kind of story that we're going to have to learn how to tell,"" he says. ""We won't be dispensing with the social, or the political — not by a long shot. But to add in this environmental drama, that's going to be a marvelous task and a great source of meaning for the writers of the future."" Andrew Limbong and Rose Friedman produced and edited this story for broadcast. Beth Novey adapted it for the Web.","In The Overstory, Powers explores how humans can revere ancient trees with ""the same kind of sanctity that we reserve exclusively for ourselves.""",2018-04-19T20:31:07Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Novelist Richard Powers Finds New Stories Deep In Old Growth Forests,https://www.npr.org/2018/04/19/602903697/novelist-richard-powers-finds-new-stories-deep-in-old-growth-forests,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/04/19/smokymountains2_wide-7aed6b6b71f7bc8cb33a04eb04418ed4031a53ac.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Smoky Mountains,0

SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) - The autopsy report from the Knox County Regional Forensic Center revealed Monday that William Lee Hill Jr., 30, died of an ""accidental methamphetamine intoxication"" in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in September, prior to his remains being scavenged by a bear. 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park officials released the autopsy report Monday.
     Previous Story | Bear thought to be euthanized earlier killed by park officials
Hill, from Louisville, Tenn., was found off-trail in the park on Sunday, Sept. 9, 2018 off Rich Mountain Road two miles north of Cades Cove. At the time of discovering his body, park officials found a bear feeding off his body.
Without knowing the exact cause of death, park officials and wildlife professionals made the decision to euthanize the bear, which occurred a few days later after a search. 
According to the report released Monday, ""An autopsy revealed extensive postmortem animal predation, but no findings of antemortem/perimortem trauma (i.e. Mr. Hill was not attacked by a bear).""
GSMNP has an estimated 1,500 bears roaming its terrain. 
""Very few bears exhibit aggressive behavior towards humans,"" park officials said Monday. ""Wildlife biologists and park rangers work hard to prevent bears from becoming food-conditioned or habituated to high-use areas. Out of an abundance of caution for the park's 11 million park visitors, park staff implement aversive-conditioning techniques and, on rare occasions, euthanize individual bears that pose a threat to visitor safety.""
In September, park officials were notified that Hill and a friend came to the park to look for ginseng.",Autopsy: Man overdosed on meth in GSMNP before bear scavenged his remains WATE 6 On Your Side Autopsy: Man found in Smokies died of meth overdose before being eaten by bear USA TODAY Man found eaten by bear in Great Smoky Mountains National Park died of meth …,2019-02-04T19:46:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wate.com'}",Autopsy: Man overdosed on meth in GSMNP before bear scavenged his remains - WATE 6 On Your Side,https://www.wate.com/news/local-news/autopsy-man-overdosed-on-meth-in-gsmnp-before-bear-scavenged-his-remains/1754392016,https://media.wate.com/nxs-watetv-media-us-east-1/photo/2018/06/11/gsmnp_1528727112413_45133916_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg,,Wate.com,Smoky Mountains,0
CBS News,"We've all been singing along with Dolly Parton for decades. But if you want to know the truth about her, know this: She works way more than just 9 to 5. Even with a half-century of music behind her, the glitzy, big-haired queen of country glamour is still at it 24/7, still writing her a legacy one song at a time.
""That's my therapy; my little guitar's my friend,"" she told correspondent Tony Dokoupil. ""And when I'm in that zone – I call it my 'God zone' – I just love that time.""
So please, don't even mention the R-word to this 73-year-old. ""Yeah, people always say, 'Why don't you retire?' I say, 'And do what?' I mean, what does that even mean?""
""Sit on your pile of money and awards?""
""I could never do that. I don't care. I always count my blessings, more than I count my money. I don't work for money, never did. It was the art, it was the job. I loved the work. And I've done well, and I'm thankful for it.""
On Friday the music industry said ""thank you"" to her, with a star-studded celebration of Parton, who is the Grammys' 2019 MusiCares Person of the Year, in honor of her charity work, like Parton's Imagination Library, a literacy program she started which mails millions of free books each month to children under five. ""We thought maybe it might do good in our county, and maybe a couple counties over,"" she said. ""But now, we're all over the world, and we've given 100 million books away.  I'm as proud of that, as anything I've ever done.""

 Recording Academy / GRAMMYs on

And she's also proud of her peerless wardrobe, on display at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. ""I love being flashy,"" she said of her trademark costumes. ""I love kinda showing the parts of me that I've become famous for, and I try to do it in as good a taste as I can!""
Dolly is open about nearly everything, including her cosmetic surgery. But as she sings in her song ""Backwoods Barbie"" (""I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a pushup bra and hells""), don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there. 
She told Dokoupil, ""It is true that I look artificial, but I believe that I'm totally real. My look is really based on a country girl's idea of glam. I wasn't naturally pretty, so I make the most of anything I've got.""
""Hold on a second: You were not naturally pretty?"" asked Dokoupil. 
""I'm telling you, I'm not.""
""I've seen the pictures, Dolly. I'm sorry, I have to disagree with that.""
Dolly Parton with correspondent Toy Dokoupil.
CBS News
""Well, you should've seen me this morning before I got ready to see you!"" she laughed. ""But I'm serious, though. I'm not, like, a natural beauty. But I can enhance it. Whatever it takes, I do. I try to make the most of everything.""
It's hard to argue with the results. 
If you need a reminder, Parton has sold more than 100 million albums, won a shelf-full of Grammys, and written thousands of songs, including ""I Will Always Love You,"" which was a 1974 hit for Parton – and a 1992 sensation for Whitney Houston, in the film ""The Bodyguard.""

 TransLucenT3D on

Dokoupil asked, ""Does it ever bother you that people think that's Whitney Houston's song?""
""No,"" she replied. ""I always say, she can have the credit, as long as I get my cash!""
It's a good line, and Parton is full of 'em, like, ""It costs a lot to look this cheap.""
Or, ""How do you want people to remember you 100 years from now?""
""I want 'em to say, 'God, don't she look good for her age!'"" she laughed. 
Humor was a help where Parton grew up, the fourth of 12 children in rural Tennessee. ""I wrote a song years ago called 'In the Good Old Days When Times Were Bad,' and it said, 'No amount of money could buy from me the memories that I have of then. But no amount of money could pay me to go back and live through it again.'""
Music made everything a little brighter. 
""When I started writing these songs, my mom was real impressed with how I could write, writing these songs at such an early age,"" she said. ""And she would say, 'Oh honey, go get that guitar. I want you to sing them.'  And she'd say to people, 'I want you to hear this song this little thing wrote.' And so I thought, ooh, I'm getting a whole lot of attention now! So, I think that kind of encouraged it. 
""But also, I loved the sound of that music. I loved the sound of the instruments. I loved being able to create something, and it gave me a little space, and a little world of my own that I could just live in, and be creative in.""
Dokoupil asked, ""How early did you realize this more than just a dream, this is going to be my profession, this is a job?""
""I guess I was about ten years old, the first time that my uncle took me to sing in front of an audience. And it was when they kept clappin' and clappin' after I had finished my song, that I thought that, you know, I felt something. I was scared, I was nervous, I'm a country little kid. But when I got that applause and got that feeling, is when I thought this is what I think I'm gonna do.""
She moved to Nashville, and soon she was singing before a national audience on ""The Porter Wagoner Show.""  One night after a performance she met a young fan: ""I remember this little redheaded girl with green eyes, prettiest little thing, and I said, 'Well, what's your name?' And she said, 'Jolene.' I said, 'I love that name.' All the way back to the bus I was [singing], 'Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,' so I wouldn't forget the name.""
She gave the name to another redhead she knew – a bank teller who flirted with her husband, Carl:

The song helped launch Parton's solo career. (And don't worry, she is still happily married.)
But as she jumped from country to pop to Hollywood, though, the couple never did get around to having children. Is that a regret? ""No, absolutely not,"" she said. ""It wasn't meant to be. And I don't regret it. I never regretted it. I mean, it was a choice. So, you make your choices, you make your sacrifices, and I never looked back. I knew early on that I was gonna walk that road 'til God told me to stop. And I'm still walking it, and He ain't said nothing to me about quittin' yet!""
In fact, she's going back for more, including a sequel to her classic 1980 film, ""9 to 5.""  Her character, Doralee, got the best of an abusive male boss, and in the eyes of some became a feminist hero.  
Dokoupil asked, ""Is that a word, feminist, that you apply to yourself?""
""Well, I guess I am. But I don't think of it like they do. I'm just, I'm a feminine girl. I'm a workin' girl. I think we all should be treated with respect. And if we do a good job, we should get paid for it. So I'm all about that.""
Dolly Parton has written more than 3,000 songs, and she says her favorite is ""A Coat of Many Colors,"" a story of a poor kid from the Great Smoky Mountains who learned early on what really matters.

Nothing is better than getting some fresh air, gazing at an alpine lake, and taking in views of mountainous silhouettes. Below we curated the most photographed and beautiful mountains in the US. In no particular order, you can read about them below and ideally get your own photos of these gorgeous peaks! If you want to plan a mountain getaway, you should check out our list of the best credit card bonuses to help you save on your trip. Denali National Park, Alaska – Home of The Highest Mountain in the United States 1. Denali aka Mt. McKinely, Alaska Denali, the name of the HIGHEST mountain in North America sits at the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve in south-central Alaska. The mountain sits 20,310 feet above sea level and is the third most prominent and third most isolated peak on Earth following Mount Everest in Nepal and Aconcagua in Argentina. The Tallest Mountain in The United States Is in Alaska! Denali National Park is home to nearly 12,000 lakes and glaciers which cover roughly one million acres of the park, about one-sixth of the entire park which encompasses six million acres of wild land. Wild animals roam free on these unfenced lands and you can see wildlife all year round. To climb to the top of Denali takes a experienced mountaineer, skilled climber, and avid outdoorsman. There are world class mountaineering and climbing routes on the peak that are only for the very established mountaineer. You need special equipment, guides or experts to get to the top of this gnarly peak. For those looking to photograph the peak, it won’t be hard to get a good view once you’re in the park. The morning is the prime time to see the peak before it’s shrouded in clouds. Hikes to popular locations are accessible via bus, shuttle or car. Mid-June to mid-July is the peak time for wildlife. So if you want a vibrant shot, that’s the time to get it. 2. Mt. Rainier, Washington Mount Rainier is the highest mountain in the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest and the tallest peak in Washington with an elevation of 14,411 feet above sea level. It is an icon in the Washington landscape and most accessible from Mount Rainier National Park. Here’s Mt. Rainier From a Plane! Mount Rainier is an active volcano and is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of its large amount of glacial ice. The peak is located just east of Eatonville and southeast of Seattle and Tacoma if you want to fly in to visit the peak. You will be able to see the volcano from your plane because it will be the tallest peak in eyesight. When photographing Mt. Rainier, you can’t go wrong. Head into the park and there will be endless hikes and vantage points to get just the right angle. If you’re an experienced alpinist, you can also opt to climb the peak and get a view from the summit. 3. Maroon Bells, Colorado Located minutes outside of the famous ski town, Aspen, Colorado, the Maroon Bells are said to be the most photographed peaks in North America. The gorgeous red colored, jagged peaks are surrounded by pristine National Forest land and make this one of the most spectacular views in the world. You can explore the entire glacial valley surrounded by 14,000 foot peaks (fourteeners as the mountaineers call it) and it will never get old. Maroon Bells Is Located Just Outside of Aspen, Colorado Accessibility to the Maroon Bells is limited by car, and only available before the snow starts to fall. During peak summer season, there are bus tours running up to Maroon lake, directly below the peaks from 8:30 am until 5:00 pm. The Aspen buses are clean, convenient, consistent and really help when there is a parking crunch. Outside of these hours, you can take your car up. The road is also accessible to non-motorized vehicles at any time of day, free of charge, so if you’re into road biking, rollerblading, or even skateboarding, consider earning your views! Leaf peepers also frequent the bells from mid-September to early October to get one of the best foliage views in the world. The surrounding Aspen trees really start to change color, and it is one of the most magical, and sought out views in the world, especially when the first snows start to fly. The best time to photograph the Maroon Bells is first thing in the morning. Something about the stillness of the water on Maroon Lake creates a perfect mirror effect which reflects the bells perfectly. Sunset is also a great time to check out these magesties. The red and pink “alpenglow” shines onto the peaks in the most glorious way! The bells are just 10 miles west of Aspen, and 16 miles from Snowmass, just up Maroon Creek road. You can click here for more information on the Maroon Bells. 4. Mt. Shasta, California Mount Shasta sits in the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County, California. With an elevation of 14,179 feet it’s the second highest peak in the Cascades and fifth in the state. Mt. Shasta Looking Stunning! You can ski, hike, or climb Mt. Shasta. But you don’t have to summit or even consider climbing it to get the spectacular views and enjoy the alpine paradise. There are easy hiking paths and loops through wildflower-filled meadows, into alpine forests and along the rivers where you can see waterfalls and streams. Mt. Shasta rises from surrounding flatlands in a perfect, cone-shaped peak formation and you can get spectacular photographs year round. The snow topped mountains look beautiful from all angles and I highly recommend going to get that perfect photo at sunrise. Around Mt. Shasta there is world-class fly fishing, camping and endless spots to disconnect and enjoy the wildlife. 5. Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee/North Carolina Although the Great Smoky Mountains are not one specific peak they are a beautiful mountain range saddling Tennessee and North Carolina and need to be on your bucket list. Add The Great Smokey Mountains to Your Bucket List! The Great Smoky Mountains have great hiking available all year round and have trails accessible to every age and ability level. The most popular hiking destinations are Charlies Bunion, Alum Cave Bluffs, Andrews Bald, Rainbow Falls and Chimney Tops. The hikes take you to waterfalls, great views, old-growth forests and endless adventure. You can also do a multi-day hiking trip if you’re feeling super adventurous but you need a reservation and permit to stay overnight in the parks backcountry. 6. Grand Tetons, Wyoming The Grand Tetons are known as the most astonishing peaks in North America for viewing and for exploring and have over 200 miles of trails throughout the surrounding National Park. There is Nothing More Grand Than The Grand Teton! The park has a number of activities and attractions to cater every visitors pleasures including, lakes, rivers (the Snake is a personal favorite), campgrounds, bike trails, and wildflowers. The Grand Teton is the highest peak in the Teton range, and is a classic American spot for mountaineering, and climbing. Schwabacher’s Landing is my favorite spot to snap photos in the entire park. Take a cruise along the river and you will come upon endless options for photos. If you bring some river shoes, you can take some shots from mid-river where other souls might not dare to go. The mountains are much more accessible in the summer, but the winter provides some stunning photo opportunities. The sharp jagged white capped peaks against the blue bird Wyoming sky provides some of the best photos. 7. Glacier National Park, Montana Glacier National Park is not one peak but a gigantic national park spanning 1,583 square miles of gorgeous wilderness in Montana’s Rocky Mountains. There are glacier-carved peaks, turquoise lakes, deep valleys and over 700 miles of hiking trails. Glacier National Park And All Its Beauty. There are plenty of things to do in Glacier National Park from backpacking and camping to cycling and hiking. Glacier National Park has tons of native plant and animal species and is home to grizzly bears, mountain goats, moose and Canadian lynxes. There are hundreds of species of birds, lots of fish species and a forest like you have never seen before. Everywhere you go in the National Park you will be sure to get a good photo, hence why it’s one of the most photographed places in the U.S and has 360-degrees of gorgeous landscape no matter where you look. If I had to recommend two places to get the best photographs I would head to Lake McDonald and wake up for sunrise or stay out until sunset. The color of the sky reflected on the water will be unbeatable. The View From Lake McDonald Is Always Worth It. I would also recommend the Hidden Lake Overlook which is one of the most popular hikes in the park and from the top you will be able to see jutting mountains, beautiful lakes and the green forest below. 8. Mt. Baker, Washington Mount Baker is not only one of the most photographed mountains in the world but it is also one of the best ski resorts in the world. It’s an active glaciated andesitic stratovolcano and sits in northern Washington. Mt. Baker has an elevation of 10,718 feet and people say it’s more breathtaking up close than any other peak in the Cascade Range. Mt. Baker Is One of The Best Ski Resorts in The World! One of the coolest things about Mt. Baker is if you don’t want to photograph it from afar and are not an experienced mountaineer, you’re more than welcome to take a chairlift up to the top and ski or ride down taking pictures the whole way. Mt. Baker ski area is home to the world’s greatest recorded snowfall in one season – a whopping 1,140 inches was received during the 1998-99 season. To put that in perspective, on average Aspen Snowmass, one of the best ski resorts in the world, receives 300 inches of snowfall annually, and that’s a lot of snow! They say that Mt. Baker enjoys the highest annual snowfall of any resort in the world, an average of 641 inches every year. 9. Mt. Elbert, Colorado Mt. Elbert is the tallest peak in Colorado and the highest summit in the Rocky Mountain Range. It sits at 14,440 feet and is #1 of the 53 14ers in Colorado. Mt. Elbert is located in San Isabel National Forest just outside the City of Leadville which is the highest incorporated city and the second highest municipality in the U.S. Mt. Elbert is a long hike but accessible to those willing to walk at altitude for 5 to 10 hours depending on your pace. It requires physical fitness but no mountaineering or special skills are necessary. Mt. Elbert is often referred to as the “gentle giant” because even though it’s the tallest mountain in Colorado if you just keep putting one foot in front of the other, you are sure to make it to the top (weather permitting). There are breathtaking mountains all over the U.S. and we would love to know your top spots and favorite places to photograph peaks. Comment below with your favorite mountains.

Stephanie Aurora Clark Nielson,"Saturday night we drove in a downpour through the smoky mountains from Kentucky. I will admit, I was frightened. The rain was coming down to fast and so hard our windshield wipers could hardly keep up. Our destination was Durham, North Carolina to visit our good friends Jordan & Craig and their adorable children. With 2 hours left in our journey the rain was so heavy and we just didn't feel safe, so we pulled into a convenient church parking lot in Hickory, NC and we bundled up and hunkered down for the night. It was very convenient because we woke up in the morning, walked 50 steps and into the chapel for church! The people in the congregation were so friendly and kind. And we truly felt welcome. There is something so comforting and inviting about The Church, and it doesn't matter who you are and where you are in the world, the same gospel principals are taught. It's truly a beautiful feeling. Also, it was pretty fun to have Angus in our church photo. Seeing our friends J & C has been the highlight of our trip. Jordan had a delicious lunch set out for our families, and was so gracious when Angus ran circles in her beautiful home. Jordan is one of the most patient, humble, soft-spoken, smart, and strong women that I know. I love her dearly. And her husband Craig is just as wonderful. They are magnificent and generous people in every way and we truly are lucky to know them.

Lee Mathews,"Like most folks who wear its clothing or use its outdoor gear, The North Face is a big fan of our national parks. This week, the company announced a new way it’s helping to keep our parks clean and beautiful. The North Face will be donating a portion of the sales from a new clothing line to The National Parks Foundation. Funds contributed by TNF have been earmarked for sustainability projects including water bottle refilling stations and bear-proof recycle bins. That’s not the only way the company is helping out, however. It all started with the raw materials. The new clothes are actually made from plastic bottles that were collected from three of America’s most-loved parks. More than 160,000 pounds of plastic was collected from Grand Tetons, Great Smoky Mountains, and Yosemite National Parks. It’s easy enough to see where all those bottles came from. Those three parks see a total of around 20 million visitors each year. The North Face has Bottle Source shirts for the whole family up for sale — including the excellent “John Muir is My Homeboy” tee that pays homage to the father of the National Park system. You can find them on its website and in U.S. stores. There’s also a limited edition tote that you can use to carry around your park necessities in a sustainable way. Its new Bottle Source range isn’t the only way The North Face supports sustainability efforts. The company also uses recycled polyester insulation in some of its core products like the Denali jacket. The same fill adds warmth to TNF’s Re-source hoodies and its signature packable blanket. The North Face has also started using Climate Beneficial wool. What’s Climate Beneficial wool, you ask? It’s wool sheared from sheep that graze on a carbon farm. The farms utilize “inexpensive organic management practices” to offset the greenhouse gasses produced by the flock.

Brian Resnick,"In the coming weeks, billions of leaves will change color. Labor Day has come and gone, pumpkin spice is wafting through the air, and drug store shelves are already being stocked (!) with Halloween candy. The autumn season brings many changes, but none are more spectacular than this: Billions of leaves are turning from green to auburn and gold. When days begin to grow shorter, deciduous (green leafy) trees start signaling their leaves to stop producing chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for the leaves’ color and photosynthesis. Because the color change is more dependent on light than temperature, it takes place at basically the same time year after year, according to the US National Arboretum. Temperature and weather conditions, though, can impact the intensity of fall colors and how long they linger. They can also subtly affect the timing of when the leaves start to change. And drought can change the rate at which the leaves turn. For instance, drought in Maine has meant the state’s trees are already turning amber. Because of all the variables at play, it can be tough to predict precisely when fall colors will peak, and how long they’ll last, in a particular area. But here’s an admirable effort: The website SmokyMountains.com (a site promoting Smoky Mountains tourism) created this interactive map to determine peak fall colors across the United States by county. You can slide the bar at the bottom of the map to see how the peak foliage spreads out across the country over the coming weeks. Use it to figure out the right time to do some leaf peeping in your area or on a weekend trip. The map pulls historical data and seasonal forecast predictions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and makes a best guess about peak timing. “A model will never be 100% accurate,” Wes Melton, the co-founder of SmokyMountains.com who made the map, says in a press statement. (Here’s another easy way to figure out whether the map is accurate for your home: Go outside!) Why do the leaves turn red, orange, or yellow? When the chlorophyll disappears from the leaves, the National Arboretum explains, other chemicals persist and show their colors: Chlorophyll normally masks the yellow pigments known as xanthophylls and the orange pigments called carotenoids — both then become visible when the green chlorophyll is gone. These colors are present in the leaf throughout the growing season. Red and purple pigments come from anthocyanins. In the fall anthocyanins are manufactured from the sugars that are trapped in the leaf. In most plants anthocyanins are typically not present during the growing season. Different trees will reveal different colors, as the US Forest Service describes on its website. The leaves of oak trees, for example, turn reddish brown or russet. Here are a few others: - Hickories: golden bronze - Aspen and yellow-poplar: golden yellow - Dogwood: purplish red - Beech: light tan - Sourwood and black tupelo: crimson The color of maples leaves differ species by species: - Red maple: brilliant scarlet - Sugar maple: orange-red - Black maple: glowing yellow - Striped maple: almost colorless","Fall foliage is coming.

Stephen Betts,"Dolly Rebecca Parton, born January 19th, 1946, in tiny Locust Ridge in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, turns 72 years old today. Having recently set two world records, Parton is presumably having a good birthday week. Probably a better one, at least, than the subject of the song she performs above with Willie Nelson. In the heartbroken ""Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,"" Parton – whose original 1965 vocal was used alongside Nelson's new one in a 1982 recording of the song – and Nelson sing sad birthday wishes to one another even though they've now gone their separate ways. With a birthday cake between them, Dolly's inimitable ad-libs sprinkled throughout, and powerful vocals from both, the performance is everything fans of these country-music icons could wish for in a three-minute clip. Watch the two perform the song (with new vocals from both) in the above clip, which originally aired as part of a star-packed TV special from 1985. One of those certificates Parton received from Guinness World Records acknowledges her as the female artist with more hits on Billboard 's Hot Country Songs chart, stretching back to her very first entry there, which was 1967's ""Dumb Blonde."" But, it's rather ironic to note that in spite of the protestations of country traditionalists who didn't like her crossing over to the pop world in 1977 with ""Here You Come Again,"" Parton's very first Billboard chart entry, ""Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,"" was a pop record released as her second single for Monument Records in July 1965. Produced by singer Ray Stevens, Parton's cover of the bittersweet 1957 doo-wop hit by the Tune Weavers reached Number Eight on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart in early October 1965. Although it never reached the Hot 100, and got nowhere near the country chart, the song did get the virtually unknown artist booked on the nationally broadcast American Bandstand, with Monument Records' head Fred Foster's help. Parton, however, was uncomfortable singing that kind of pop music at the time and begged Foster to let her record the songs she felt she was born to do. ""I knew she could do anything,"" Foster would say in an interview, quoted in author Nancy Cardwell's excellent overview of the singer-songwriter's recorded work, The Words and Music of Dolly Parton. ""There was no doubt. When I told her that, she said, 'You're the craziest thing I've ever been around. You scare me, you're so crazy."" Foster, as it turns out, was anything but crazy, as his track record with Parton, as well as Roy Orbison, Kris Kristofferson and many others would prove. When he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October 2016, Parton performed ""Dumb Blonde,"" her first Top Thirty country hit while a Monument artist, in his honor. In 1982, with Monument struggling to stay afloat, Willie Nelson helped organize a special recording event which saw him join former label mates Parton and Kristofferson, as well as Brenda Lee to record material individually and collectively on a double-album called The Winning Hand. Consisting of both original Monument recordings and newly cut material (Parton's movie schedule hindered her availability at the time, so her original tapes were used in her absence), the album also featured liner notes by Johnny Cash. When tickets for a December 1984 network TV taping in Nashville featuring all five superstars were made available to the public, they were snapped up in just 26 minutes. The special, which included a Parton and Nelson performance of their Top Ten hit from the album, "" Everything's Beautiful (In It's Own Way),"" also featured the pair performing what is now one of Parton's most hard-to-find records, and her first-ever pop hit. In 1986, not long after the special aired, Ronnie Milsap would take his version of ""Happy, Happy Birthday Baby"" to Number One on the country chart.","Celebrating her 72nd birthday today, Parton's rare original 1965 version of this song became her very first pop chart entry",2018-01-19T19:06:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Rollingstone.com'}","Flashback: See Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson's Mournful 'Happy, Happy Birthday Baby'",https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/dolly-parton-willie-nelson-sing-happy-happy-birthday-baby-w515647,http://img.wennermedia.com/social/gettyimages-831440878-11f0cb1a-7177-4257-aa42-6dacf15b43e0.jpg,,Rollingstone.com,Smoky Mountains,0
"Maxine Joselow, E&E News","In a laboratory nestled at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains, the federal government is quietly working to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. That’s in contradiction to President Trump, who is overseeing a freeze on efficiency standards beginning in 2022. In the real world, that means cars would travel 30 mpg under Trump’s plan, instead of 36 mpg. The National Transportation Research Center (NTRC) is a short jaunt from Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s main campus, known for its pioneering work on nuclear weapons during World War II. The pale, blue silhouettes of mountains rise in the distance. Inside the lab, it’s like a beehive. Researchers wearing goggles hunch over complex machinery. They’re busy studying nearly every part of a vehicle, from the engine to the exhaust. Despite their different specialties, the researchers are committed to the same goal: getting vehicles to travel farther on a single tank of gas. That might not be a snug fit with the president’s view of America, in which more coal, oil and gas are produced to achieve a dominant energy economy. Researchers here tend not to talk about politics. EPA and the Department of Transportation have joint jurisdiction over the clean car standards. Compliance with those rules is overseen by EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. Less known is the role of Department of Energy facilities like the NTRC, which helps to advance technologies that inform the stringency of the standards. Staffers here aren’t authorized to discuss political issues like Trump’s regulatory rollback on cars. Instead, researchers interviewed for this story implied that the move hasn’t affected their day-to-day work. “What motivates us to come to work every day is of course to do the science that can enable clean and sustainable energy,” said Jim Parks, group leader for emissions and catalysis research at the lab. “So that’s going to drive my research, regardless of the regulations and the things being debated there. “At the end of the day, we know that it will take research and development to enable these more fuel-efficient vehicles and these cleaner vehicles,” he added. “So we’re going to put in that work to do that.” There’s another factor at play, too: market forces. The researchers recognize that if they create the technology for better fuel efficiency, automakers will be interested in it. The companies still sell vehicles in countries with stringent efficiency rules, particularly China and India. “I haven’t read the rule that came out. We’ve talked about this some in terms of how it might affect our work, of course,” said Brian West, group leader for fuels and engine research at the NTRC. “But the whole world wants better fuel economy,"" he said. “The manufacturers that build cars here build cars all over the world.” Myths vs. facts The NTRC is responsible for running fueleconomy.gov, the U.S. government’s online clearinghouse for information about fuel economy. The site offers tips to consumers for getting better gas mileage, such as by driving less aggressively. The tips are based on experiments at the lab. “For fueleconomy.gov, we try to inform consumers about things that you can do,” West said. “Like don’t drive around with three sets of golf clubs in your trunk. Every 100 pounds will cost you about 1 percent fuel economy.” The Trump administration has altered many government webpages since January 2017, including by removing references to climate change ( Climatewire, Jan. 10). But fueleconomy.gov remains largely intact. That means the site often undercuts the Trump administration’s arguments for rolling back the Obama-era car rules. For instance, visitors to the site are greeted with a phrase at the top of the screen: “Improved fuel economy saves you money.” The Trump administration has argued the opposite: that rolling back the fuel economy standards would save consumers on average $2,340 in overall vehicle ownership costs. The site also includes safety ratings for a host of different cars and trucks. The ratings show that bigger cars like SUVs aren’t necessarily safer than smaller ones. The Trump administration, on the other hand, has argued that auto manufacturers often achieve better fuel economy by making lighter vehicles. That can reduce safety in a crash, the administration claims. Claus Daniel, director of the sustainable transportation program at Oak Ridge National Lab, declined to comment on the Trump administration’s assertions. But he refuted the general notion that vehicle size is linked to safety. “There is a myth out there that essentially bigger, heavier cars are more safe,” Daniel said. “With the engineering going into the development of the car, essentially these days, small cars are just as safe—if not more safe—than big vehicles. And smaller cars have the lower center of gravity. They’re not as prone to rollover.” What about emissions? Environmentalists have warned that the clean cars rollback would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which recently eclipsed the power sector as the country’s largest source of carbon dioxide. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Obama-era car rules were estimated to reduce greenhouse gases by 2.2 billion metric tons. “It’s incredible how much this would erode the gains that we’ve had thus far,” said Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst at UCS. “It’s pretty clear just how significant the climate impacts would be.” In an environmental impact statement for the clean cars rollback, EPA and DOT say freezing the standards at 2020 levels would cause an uptick in air pollution and related illnesses and deaths ( E&amp;E News PM, Aug. 3). On a call with reporters earlier this month, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum also tacitly acknowledged that the proposal would lead to “incrementally less protection of health and the environment.” But he said the agency is legally required to place weight on other factors, including highway safety. The NTRC researchers, meanwhile, are focused on reducing all types of emissions coming from tailpipes. “We talk about an all-of-the-above approach” to reducing emissions, said NTRC Director Robert Wagner. “Really, there’s no one solution that’s going to get us there. They’re all important. And they have different pros and cons. So we just try to do the science and shine a light on those pros and cons.” Modern vehicles are equipped with a device called a catalytic converter that reduces emissions of three harmful compounds found in car exhaust: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbons. Parks held up a three-way catalyst as an example of the fruits of his research. “This catalyst is very, very efficient at controlling NOx, CO and hydrocarbon emissions from an engine,” he said. “It’s called a three-way catalyst because it controls all three simultaneously on this one catalyst. And this is the technology that’s been developed since the 1970s, when the Clean Air Act first came out.” Cutting emissions, not budgets In his fiscal 2019 budget proposal, Trump called for slashing the funding of DOE’s Office of Science. The office supports basic science and energy research at the 17 national labs, including Oak Ridge. But the president faced sharp opposition from lawmakers with national labs in their home states, including Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee. Alexander criticized the proposed cuts at a hearing in April featuring Energy Secretary Rick Perry. He said financial support for the Office of Science was crucial to the competitiveness of the U.S. economy ( Energywire, April 12). When the Senate passed its fiscal 2019 energy-water legislation in June, the measure ended up including record funding for the Office of Science ( E&amp;E Daily, June 25). “I want to suggest that a candidate for the president’s ’America First’ agenda that has bipartisan support is the record funding for government-sponsored research reflected in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill,” Alexander said in a statement. “It is hard to think of a major technological invention since World War II that didn’t have some support from government-sponsored research.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

BENEDICT CAREY,"“Its strength was that she included measures of both psychiatric mood diagnoses and personality disorders, and so was able to compare the long-term effects of both,” said E. Jane Costello, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University. (Dr. Costello’s long-term Great Smoky Mountains Study, in rural North Carolina, has similarly tracked mental disorders over a lifetime.) “And she was statistically very good,” Dr. Costello said, which added rigor to the results. Dr. Ezra Susser, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia, said of Dr. Cohen’s work: “Hers was a foundational study, in what we nowadays call life-course psychiatric epidemiology.” Life-course studies like Dr. Cohen’s and Dr. Costello’s are especially crucial in psychiatry as a check on faddish diagnoses, Dr. Susser said. In the early 2000s, for example, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital and elsewhere began diagnosing bipolar disorder in children as young as 3. But studies like Dr. Cohen’s and Dr. Costello’s showed that the trend was mistaken. In adults, the disorder involves periods of sadness alternating with periods of mania. Young children, however, did not exhibit classic manias, the studies found, and those who were given the diagnosis so early rarely, if ever, went on to develop full-blown adult bipolar disorder.

"Monica G. Turner, The Conversation US","The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research. This summer marks the 30th anniversary of the 1988 Yellowstone fires —massive blazes that affected about 1.2 million acres in and around Yellowstone National Park. Their size and severity surprised scientists, managers and the public and received heavy media coverage. Many news reports proclaimed that Yellowstone was destroyed, but nothing was further from the truth. I was there during the fires and returned that fall to view the aftermath. Burned forests extended for miles, with blackened tree trunks creating a stark and seemingly desolate landscape. But peering down from a helicopter, we were surprised to see that the fires had actually produced a mosaic of burned and unburned patches of forest. I have studied the recovery of Yellowstone’s forests since 1989, watching landscapes of charred trees transition into lush young forests. Fires play an important ecological role in many ecosystems, and Yellowstone’s native plants and animals are well-adapted to historical cycles of disturbance and recovery. Today the burned landscape is dominated by thriving young lodgepole pine trees. We learned much about how ecosystems respond to such fires because they burned mostly in national parks and wilderness areas. Post-fire management was minimal, and nature took its course through most of the burned area. Because Yellowstone’s forests were remarkably resilient, the 1988 fires were not an ecological catastrophe. Today, however, climate and fire trends may be pushing forests beyond their limits. The rules of the game are changing fast. Heat, drought and wind Extreme weather conditions drove the 1988 fires, as they have fostered many recent fires across the West. Summers in Yellowstone are usually too cool and moist for such large fires, but the summer of 1988 was and remains the driest on record there. Amounts of fuel (dead logs and pine needles on the ground and live trees) were not unusual, and there is no evidence that suppression of prior fires had much, if any, influence on the 1988 fires. Hot temperatures, severe drought and high winds set the stage. Gusts over 60 miles per hour prevented me from flying over the fires in early July, well before the blazes made their biggest runs. Roads, rivers and even wide canyons spanning the Yellowstone and Lewis rivers did not stop flames from spreading on windy days. Strong winds carried burning branches ahead of the main fire front, advancing fire spread. The fires also continued to burn at night. How burned forests recover Severe fires have burned in Yellowstone at 100- to 300-year intervals for the past 10,000 years. “Crown fires” burn through the forest canopy, killing the trees while triggering a flush of new growth. Such fires are business as usual in Yellowstone and many other forests at high elevations and far north latitudes. Lodgepole pines have thin bark and are readily killed, but often bear fire-adapted cones that allow them to regenerate right after fires. When heated, the cones release vast quantities of seeds that produce a new generation of trees. Fires also create ideal growing conditions, with plenty of mineral soil and sunlight. In Yellowstone, wildflowers and grasses sprouted from surviving roots because soils did not burn deeply and retained key nutrients needed for plant growth. Native species steadily filled in the bare spots. Aspens—long a species of concern in the northern Rockies—established from seed throughout the burned pine forests, many miles from the nearest mature aspen trees. Many are doing well at higher elevations than their pre-fire distribution. Yellowstone’s ecosystems recovered rapidly on their own. I suspect that many visitors no longer “see” evidence of the 1988 fires as they admire scenery and wildlife amidst a sea of green. Similar patterns of natural recovery following 20th-century fires have also been observed in Rocky Mountain, Glacier and Grand Teton National Parks, which also have evolved with fire for millennia. Historically, high-severity fires kill trees but do not destroy the forest. Huckleberry Mountain in Glacier National Park after a fire on July 30, 1935 ( top ) and July 9, 2009 ( bottom ). National Park Service Warming climate, more fire The 1988 fires ushered in a new era of major wildfires that are burning more western forests each year. Summers and winters are getting warmer, and the hot, dry weather associated with large fires is no longer so rare. Snow melts earlier each year, fuels dry out sooner, temperature records are broken and fire season gets longer. Recent fires have burned in many national parks and monuments, including Bandelier, Rocky Mountain, Glacier and Yosemite. A warmer, drier climate means that drought is getting worse in places that are already hot and dry. In the western United States, human-caused climate change has dried fuels and nearly doubled the area burned by forest fires from 1984 to 2015. And while lightning ignites most fires in the northern Rockies, human ignitions are lengthening fire seasons in populated areas. Even in the moist mixed forests of the southern Appalachians, severe drought allowed a human-caused fire that started in Great Smoky Mountains National Park to rage into Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Rocky Mountain National Park has banned campfires for the first time in six years https://t.co/l27UujEJ55 via @julia_rentschRH — Mitchell Byars (@mitchellbyars) July 6, 2018 What lies ahead? Even forests that are well-adapted to large, severe fires are at risk in a warming world. By the late 21st century, hot, dry weather like the summer of 1988 could be the rule rather than the exception in Yellowstone. Large fires are expected to occur more often, and are already starting to reburn forests long before they have had enough time to recover. In Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, fires in 2016 burned young forests that regenerated from fires in 1988 and 2000. Our studies of these recent fires have documented greater burn severity and fewer post-fire tree seedlings. Survival of these young trees is not guaranteed, as they are starting out in a much warmer world. Big and severe fires are now burning more frequently and could threaten the resilience of Western forests. National parks anchor many of the country’s last intact landscapes, and are among our best living laboratories for understanding environmental change. Research on the 1988 fires now provides a reference for assessing effects of more recent fires. Yellowstone will still maintain its beauty, native species and power to inspire us. However, only time will tell whether Yellowstone’s forests can maintain their ability to recover from fire in the decades ahead. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Daniel Ackerman,"America’s national parks might seem like an obvious refuge from city smog. Not so, according to new research that finds popular parks’ levels of ozone—a major air pollutant—match those of the country’s largest metropolitan areas. The study, published Wednesday in Science Advances, also suggests national park visitation drops when ozone levels soar. But some experts argue it is too early to determine whether air quality warnings influence the travel decisions of park-goers. Researchers agree the best way to solve the ozone problem in national parks is to address it upwind in cities, whose pollution rides the breeze into America’s wild places. Ozone is a complicated gas; it can be beneficial or harmful to humans, depending on where it is in the atmosphere. Six miles above Earth’s surface, the naturally-occurring “ozone layer” blocks most of the sun’s cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. But at ground level, where we live and breathe, the gas poses respiratory hazards. This surface ozone forms via reactions among nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in vehicle exhaust, and as byproducts of industrial processes. (Such organic compounds can also originate from vegetation). If inhaled ozone can inflame the throat and lungs, especially in people who are young or have respiratory problems. Heat and sunlight catalyze the formation of ground-level ozone, so the threat of inhalation grows more menacing in summer, the most popular season for national park visits. The research team took the average of yearly ozone readings at 33 national parks from 1990 to 2014. They compared those numbers to ozone levels from the country’s 20 largest metropolitan areas. “My prior [expectation] was that these two things would be really different,” says Gabriel Lade, an environmental economist at Iowa State University who co-authored the study. Lade notes most people view air pollution as an urban scourge. But his team found that since 1992 the maximum daily ozone levels in national parks matched those of cities, with trends from the two settings “lying on top of each other,” according to Lade. “It was one of our more surprising findings,” he says. The number of days when ozone concentration in the air exceeded 70 parts per billion halved in both cities and national parks between 1999 and 2014, however. Lade and other experts attribute this drop to the success of the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1963 and amended in 1990 to specifically address surface ozone. The observation that park visitation dipped when ozone spiked “tells you that people value air quality,” says Lade, who surmises that visitors heeded air quality alerts and stayed home on high ozone days. Other researchers are unsure of the connection between ozone warnings and park visitation. “Correlation is not causation,” says Joel Burley, an air pollution scientist at Saint Mary’s College of California, who was not involved in the study. Burley notes that the researchers did not pinpoint why people decided whether to visit a park. He is skeptical that travelers who, for example, reserve campsites in Yosemite National Park months in advance would abandon plans to visit so easily. “How many visitors are actually changing their behavior after checking air quality?” he asks. “It’s a fascinating study,” Burley says, but the next step should be to determine whether air quality alerts really impact park visitation decisions. “They didn’t measure that,” he says. Lade points out that the causes of ground-level ozone vary from park to park. In California the chemicals that combine to form ozone waft from cities to Sequoia, Yosemite and Joshua Tree National Parks. “A lot of this pollution is blowing up from the Los Angeles area,” Lade says. In the eastern U.S., parks including Great Smoky Mountains and Cuyahoga Valley bathe in these ozone-forming chemicals from nearby coal and industrial production. Because wind transports these compounds so easily, some experts are not surprised by the finding of ozone in national parks. “Ozone takes time to form in the atmosphere—it’s not emitted directly by cars or power plants,” says Dan Jaffe, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. He notes that ozone itself often forms only after its component chemicals have blown away from their sources. “We’ve known for years that ozone is higher outside of cities,” he says. So Jaffe argues it makes sense that even remote parks could have elevated ozone levels. “Yosemite is known to have some of the highest ozone levels in southern California,” he says. The researchers claim their study demonstrates the extent of the air quality problem throughout the national park system—more than one-third of park visits occur when elevated ozone levels may pose inhalation risks. To limit ozone in parks, Jaffe and other experts agree that capping emissions in cities is the best strategy, as little can be done within the parks themselves. Even with heavy traffic during peak visitation, car emissions in parks have only a moderate effect on air quality, according to Andrzej Bytnerowicz, a retired air pollution researcher formerly with the U.S. Forest Service who did not participate in the study. Rather, Bytnerowicz says that purifying park air will entail “addressing issues upwind—hundreds, even thousands, of kilometers away.” Despite the study’s finding of declining ozone in both cities and parks between 1990 and 2014, Bytnerowicz cautions this encouraging trend may be reversing in certain areas. In 2017, ozone-rich smog in Los Angeles crept upward for the second straight year. Whereas some officials blame high temperatures, Bytnerowicz says underreported industrial emissions and increased truck traffic could also be contributing factors. He believes curbing these emissions sources are the key to cleaner air in the most polluted parks, like Joshua Tree. For vacationers looking to escape urban smog, “there are plenty of parks that do have good air quality,” according to Ivan Rudik, an environmental economist who co-authored the study. He cites Olympic and Glacier National Parks as oases of clean air. These pristine parks may be the best bets for breathable air during the warmest months. The influx of park visitors in summer coincides with the ozone spike, Rudik says, so “it’s a double-whammy in terms of exposure.”",New study finds city-like air pollution levels in the nation’s parks -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-07-18T18:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Visiting a National Park this Summer?

The Associated Press,"GATLINBURG, Tenn. (AP) — Researchers from around the world are meeting in Tennessee for a conference about how humans and bears can safely coexist. The Knoxville News Sentinel reports Great Smoky Mountains National Park is hosting the Fifth International Human-Bear Workshop through Thursday. An estimated 1,600 black bears live in the Smoky Mountains and their greatest threat is encountering humans. Researcher Jessica Giacomini, a University of Tennessee graduate student, says the Smokies bear population has been growing since the ’90s, and the park has roughly 11 million visitors every year. She says bears that become conditioned not to fear humans are more likely to be struck by cars or killed by hunters than if they remained in the park eating natural food. The more food bears find, the farther they’re likely to roam into urban areas. ___ Information from: Knoxville News Sentinel, http://www.knoxnews.com","GATLINBURG, Tenn.

Isabel Torrealba,"Good food is worth a thousand words—sometimes more. In My Family Recipe, a writer shares the story of a single dish that's meaningful to them and their loved ones. This week, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, we follow a family's journey from Mexico. I remember the day I saw the house that was to be our restaurant for the first time. It was— is —a 200-year-old colonial house in downtown Oaxaca, a city in Southern Mexico. The sheer magnitude of the place—with several rooms arranged around a roofless inner courtyard that included a fountain and a century-old, knobby orange tree—was enough to leave a person in awe, let alone a six-year-old child. It seemed like a mansion to me, brimming with hiding spots. I didn’t know it then and, perhaps, it took losing it ten years later to realize that place was home, with everything that word entails. Just a few days before my 16th birthday, in May 2006, the teachers’ union went on a state-wide strike. They settled with improvised tents in the central plaza, el Zócalo, and all over downtown Oaxaca, including our restaurant’s street. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. The teachers had been going on strikes that sent children in the public school system into an undesired vacation every year for a couple of decades. They still do it (it’s an effective strategy to get higher wages). Only, that particular year the Governor didn’t budge, and his attempt to remove the teachers forcibly just served to escalate the conflict. Eventually more political discontents joined, and together they formed the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO). This group soon appointed itself as ruling body and demanded the resignation of the Governor. Barricading the city, seizing and burning public buses and buildings, the APPO effectively took control of Oaxaca, all while wrecking its tourism-based economy. Of course, the Governor didn’t resign. By September, my family was bankrupt and the economic predictions were grim. It was expected—correctly as the future revealed—that it would take a decade for Oaxaca to recover. But families can’t wait ten years to feed their children. There really wasn’t time to say goodbye. I was two weeks into my junior year of high school when my parents sat my sister and me down and announced that we were moving to the United States “next Wednesday.” We had six days. Six days to say goodbye to friends and loved ones, six days to take inventory of our lives and select which dearest possessions could fit into a suitcase. But six days wasn’t enough time to say goodbye to the kitchen where my grandmother had taught me what ribbon stage meant for baking, or to the dining room where I’d spend the vast majority of my Christmases. It certainly wasn’t enough time to say goodbye to my father, who stayed behind to settle things and sell whatever he could. Our new house in Santa Fe was quintessential New Mexico: adobe-style and just off a quiet dirt road. All I remember thinking was how brown everything was; different shades of brown, beige and terracotta, but brown nonetheless. I missed the encircling mountains and the colorful two-toned houses lining the streets of Oaxaca. For our first dinner in the new house, my mom made a staple of Mexican home cooking, albóndigas, meatballs in a tomato sauce. Her tomato sauce is spiced with chipotles and the meatballs are laced with capers and Oaxacan oregano, which she had smuggled in her suitcase. There were rice and black beans on the side, along with a basket full of corn tortillas. The beans were not quite the same, and the tortillas were slightly grainier and sweeter than the ones back home, but it didn’t really matter. For a brief moment, as I cut an albóndiga into smaller pieces and placed them inside a tortilla with a spoonful of beans and took a bite, I felt a sense of normalcy. My mom had cooked for us, and it tasted like home. “ I didn’t know it then and, perhaps, it took losing it ten years later to realize that place was home, with everything that word entails. ”  Share I imagine cooking was therapeutic for her, because my mom cooked a lot that year. After a long day of being mocked for my broken English and laughing off ignorant and slightly racist questions (“Do you have cars in Mexico?” to which I responded, “No, we all just ride donkeys everywhere”), it was comforting to come home and sit at the dinner table to eat with my family as I always had. We often Skyped Dad and ate “together.” Our shared meals grounded us, they made us feel like we belonged somewhere, even if it was just at that dinner table. Together at least. We bought a 1992 Toyota Camry from one of the kitchen cooks my mom worked with. And many kind people gave us their hand-me-downs so we could survive the harsh New Mexico winter we weren’t accustomed to. As the snow fell outside, my mom made mole coloradito —a deep red and smoky sauce that takes a couple of hours to make, as well as a few chiles and more smuggled oregano— because I had asked her for it. A little bite of Oaxaca in the middle of a Santa Fe winter. I can only be certain of how I was feeling and what I was thinking during those days, but I can imagine everyone in my family felt very much like I did. Months had passed and we had all become American citizens by then, but our new reality hadn’t quite sunk in. I would often sit in my room for hours, looking through old photos, and I would close my eyes and imagine myself walking down the restaurant corridors. I thought of the summer days when I helped my mom, measuring the ingredients for mole negro or placing hibiscus flowers in a large bowl. I thought about my grandma, who would hide Kinder eggs (yes, the ones that are banned in America) around the courtyard for Easter. It felt that if I just imagined hard enough, long enough, I would transport myself back to Oaxaca. “ Our shared meals grounded us, they made us feel like we belonged somewhere, even if it was just at that dinner table. ”  Share “Dinner’s ready ( ya está la cena ),” my mom would call. I would put away the old photos and leave my room, and sit at the dinner table to eat tinga verde ; milanesas ; mole amarillo ; albóndigas. That was home. Almost six years after moving to the United States, my dad planted a small orange tree near the entrance of their new restaurant. It turned out to be a lemon tree instead. But as with the not-quite-the-same beans and tortillas from that first dinner, it didn’t matter. In a way, it was almost perfect. The original orange tree never gave oranges either.

For years, Blackberry Farm in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee has been one of the most acclaimed resorts in the United States. The Forbes 4-Star property combines the charms of a country inn (set in farm buildings dating to the 1800s) with activities on 4,200 acres (fly fishing, hiking, biking, canoeing, etc.), and a very highly regarded full-service spa.
But the signature attraction at Blackberry Farm has always been food, and the top tier eatery, the Barn at Blackberry Farm, draws foodies from all over the world who come in pursuit of the refined foothills cuisine that utilizes many ingredients grown or raised on site, including house made honey, eggs and cheese. The restaurant and resort have been rated in the worlds 15 Top Foodie trips, won several James Beard Awards (for chef, restaurant and wine list), has earned Wine Spectators most coveted Grand Award for 13 straight years, and received Relais &amp;amp; Ch&amp;acirc;teauxs highest culinary honor, Grand Chef (the property has been a member of the luxury boutique hotel organization for 25 years).
For all these reasons, one of the biggest stories in the word of travel is the launch of an all new Relais &amp;amp; Ch&amp;acirc;teaux resort from the same owners, the even bigger 5,200 acre Blackberry Mountain. An adventurous retreat combining modern luxury and outdoor activities in a gorgeous natural environment, it just opened - the day after Valentines Day (February 15, 2019).
The 5,200-acre Blackberry Mountain resort has a focus on outdoor recreation and fitness, including SUP yoga.Trek Travel
Blackberry Mountain takes the same approach as its famous older sibling in terms of hospitality and food, but is even more suited for the active traveler. The property offers another full spa and immersive outdoor and wellness activities, including aerial yoga, progressive fitness classes, mountain biking, hiking, trail running, and much more, with miles of trails. Theres even forest bathing, the trendy Japanese pursuit of soaking in the surrounding nature, a sort of combination of hiking/walking and mindfulness. The resort sits adjacent to one of Americas most beloved national parks, Great Smoky Mountains.
Blackberry Mountain has an activity base camp called The Hub, which includes a large gym with an indoor rock-climbing wall. Morning fitness and wellness classes in the Hub such as alternative yoga, Pilates, indoor cycling classes and high intensity interval training (HIIT) are included in room rates. But most of the resorts fitness offerings are outdoors and rooted in nature, including sunrise yoga, creekside meditation, hikes and climbs, trail running, paddle boarding, rock climbing, bouldering, and mountain biking. Blackberry Mountain also offers regional fly fishing, horseback riding, and lake opportunities.
The new resort showcases the beauty of Tennessees Smoky Mountains and the omnipresent views.Trek Travel
But most notably, Blackberry Mountain just announced a new partnership with Trek Travel, one of the worlds leading operators of active guided trips, with a focus on cycling and multi-sport. Ive written about Trek Travel here at Forbes before, because in addition to the standard weeklong bike trips in places like Tuscany, they offer some really unique opportunities including hard core immersion training camps and all-women trips. The award-winning company made the 2016 Travel + Leisure Magazine Worlds Best Tour Operator list, and it stands out to me because it is run by a woman, Tania Burke, and outdoes the other top tier cycling companies in terms of its very high quality hardware, thanks to a strong relationship with one-time parent Trek Bicycles (they are now separate companies, though both are based in Madison, WI). The standard issue bikes are considerably better than industry norms: for road riding its the new generation full carbon 2019 Domane SL 7 Disc, featuring Shimano Di2 electronic shifting and disc brakes, and for mountain, the excellent dual suspension Fuel EX 8 27.5 inch model. Every guest also gets another first-rate hardware perk, a Garmin Edge 1030 GPS bike computer (I use an earlier version at home) preloaded with each days route, so there is no looking at maps and no getting lost. For safety, all bikes have front and rear blinking lights.
We are thrilled to design this trip with the Blackberry Mountain team, said Trek Travel president Tania Burke (via release). The signature Blackberry touch is felt throughout as we blend great cycling in the stunning southern Appalachian foothills with renowned hospitality, celebrated food and wine and endless adventures. The region is renowned for the beauty of its road cycling, and Trek Travel already has similar trips based out of Blackberry Farm.
Most cycling trips of this sort change hotels, staying at two or three places while exploring a region, but there is something to be said for unpacking just once and really getting to enjoy the amenities of such a diverse property. Trek Travel has several such trips as part of its One Collection, meaning just one world-class hotel, including a Relais &amp;amp; Chateaux resort and spa in Provence and the renowned Explora eco-adventure lodge in Perus Sacred Valley of the Incas..
The six-day, five-night Blackberry Mountain adventure will offer an immersive experience of luxury, adventure, and the resorts renowned hospitality. Rather than hotel rooms, all Blackberry Mountain accommodations are in eighteen stone cottages, six smaller cabins, and a variety of multi-bedroom mountain homes. Trek Travel guests will stay in one of the resorts private cabins and riding highlights include cycling around Chilhowee Mountain past rolling farms. There will also be fly fishing in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and hiking past numerous waterfalls. A resort chef will lead guests on a foraging hike and then show them how to create simple seasonal dishes utilizing edible plants found on the trails. The resorts famed cuisine and spa treatment such as massages are included, and you can choose different afternoon, post-ride activities just about every day. There is a private group dinner, other extras, and to keep it all intimate, the trip will be limited to a dozen participants.
Trek Travels Blackberry Mountain Cycling Tour will be offered October 6 - 11, 2019 and is priced at $6,399 per person. A four-day option is available from October 6 - 9 for $4,799 per person. Trek also has September and October trips based at the original Blackberry Farm. The resorts are both are in Walland, Tennessee, just seven miles apart, and 30 minutes from the Knoxville Airport.

Photo: GENNA MARTIN, SEATTLEPI.COM How harmful is it to breathe the wildfire smoke blanketing Seattle? For most healthy people, the smoky skies in Seattle this week might seem like a nuisance more than anything else. Fed by wildfires in British Columbia, Eastern and Western Washington, Oregon and likely even California, the air across Western Washington -- usually considered among the cleanest -- has been besmirched by a glut of smoke. The smoke is thick enough to obscure downtown Seattle from beaches and hilltops in West Seattle, and more than thick enough to make the Olympic and Cascade mountains -- usually readily discernible on even a mildly cloudy day -- disappear. It's also made for some amazing orange-red, end-of-days sunrises and sunsets. RELATED: Seattle gets another day of thick smoke, air worse than Bejing But the smoke is doing a lot more harm than simply making it hazy around the city. Even for healthy people, breathing the smoke can have both short- and long-term impacts, and for those who are already sensitive to the air they breathe, the conditions are downright dangerous. Smoke from wildfires can cause some immediate impacts to your health, not unlike reactions to allergies or a cold. Irritation of the eyes, nose and throat are common, along with wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and even headaches, according to King County Public Health. Those with heart, lung or circulatory problems are likely to have those conditions exacerbated by breathing the smoke. Sufferers of asthma, lung disease, COPD, infections, heart disease and a host of others will feel the biggest impacts from the low air quality. Air quality around the Seattle region varied from unhealthy to very unhealthy on Wednesday, with index readings far worse than those at the same time in Bejing, China, infamous for its polluted skies. Weather forecasts indicated that onshore flows from the west were due to clear the air over the region late Wednesday or early Thursday, but the damaging impacts of breathing the smoke won't end there. Exposure to polluted air can have long-term impacts including increasing the risk of various types of cancer. In an article from Fred Hutch News Service last summer, the cancer research organization pointed to the fact that air pollution was classified as a carcinogen -- a cancer promoting agent -- in 2013. Studies indicated ""a clear association between air pollution and an increased risk in lung cancer, and individual studies have indicated possible increased risks of bladder, breast and some other cancers as well,"" the story said. That said, isolated exposures to wildfire smoke aren't likely increase your risk of cancer, even if it's a few entire days of breathing the bad air, Environmental exposure researcher Dr. Parveen Bhatti said in the Fred Hutch post. RELATED: British Columbia burns: With 566 fires, province declares state of emergency Wildfire seasons, however, have started earlier, lasted longer and burned more acreage in recent years. Combined with high pressure systems that tend to lock the smoke into areas where it was previously fairly rare to see such a glut of wildfire smoke, exposure to poor air conditions has increased and is likely to increase more in future years. While it's impossible to avoid the smoky air, people can take a few steps to reduce exposure. For starters, if it's not suffocatingly hot, keep your home closed up tight and, if you have it, run your air conditioning on recirculate to avoid pulling in more polluted air. HEPA filters will take most particulate matter out of the air, too, Public Health says. Add charcoal filters and that will get some of the harmful gases out (such as carbon monoxide). If you must be outside, you can use a respirator rated N95 or N100 to filter out particulate matter, but that won't help with gases. People should avoid strenuous activity outside, such as exercise or biking, and, if air quality falls into very unhealthy or hazardous, may limit even indoor activity, according to Public Health.

Caleb Parke,"The Pacific Northwest is experiencing unhealthy amounts of smoke and ash from wildfires, with air quality more than twice as bad as Beijing, a city notorious for urban pollution. The hazardous haze has left Seattle with a sky so unclear people can’t see mountains or the city skyline, flights have been delayed and authorities have warned healthy adults to remain indoors. The smoky pollution has put the area’s air quality among the world’s worst, caused by wildfires out of British Columbia and the Cascade Mountains during a season that many spend outdoors, Q13FOX reported. As of Wednesday morning, Seattle’s air pollution was equivalent to a “cigarette intake” of more than nine cigarettes, according to research made by Berkeley Earth. The Environmental Protection Agency reported that Seattle's air quality index was between 180 and 204 (very unhealthy), whereas Beijing, China was 78 (moderate). SEATTLE'S AIR QUALITY 'WORSE THAN BEIJING' AS WILDFIRES SCORCH EASTERN WASHINGTON Smoke-related health symptoms include scratchy throat, coughing, stinging eyes, runny nose, irritated sinuses, and headaches, according to health officials. For people with heart or lung disease, they may experience shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and irregular heartbeats. The National Weather Service issued air quality alerts for much of Washington state as well as parts of northern Idaho until late Wednesday, but the levels are expected to improve through Thursday night and into Friday. Officials are urging residents to limit outdoor activity when possible. Washington has had 939 wildfires this year alone – more than ever before – burning more than 34,000 acres protected by the state's Department of Natural Resources, the Seattle Times reported.

Jillian Leedy,"Jordan Pulmano / Unsplash With the changing of environmental policies, national monuments shrinking and under review, and threats of federal lands being sold for oil drilling and logging, it is more important than ever in these chaotic and ever-changing times that we do everything we can to protect our environment and our national parks. As avid nature lovers and devoted parks fans, the best we can do individually is take action. Sign petitions. Vote for candidates who are pro-nature. Recycle. Frequent and donate to our national parks. Participate in environmental protection programs and clean-up projects. But, at times it feels overwhelming. No matter how much we do as just one person to help, it doesn’t seem like it’s enough. That is why it is important to foster a love of the environment and the national parks in others around us, for the greater good of preserving our natural treasures. One of the best ways to do this is through education. As Nelson Mandela once said, “Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.” By educating yourself and others, you breed understanding. And with this understanding comes empathy. In a world where individual interests constantly clash with the interests that benefit the group as a whole, having an emotional connection makes this political cause personal. Through reading, we learn to better appreciate our lands and their beauty and importance. Through education, we can change others from casual park lovers into warriors for Earth’s wonders. Here are 10 nature must-reads that would inspire anyone to go out and hug a tree: 1. The Yosemite – John Muir If you are a naturalist and an environmental champion, John Muir is probably one of your favorite human beings. John Muir and his wanderings and observations were an integral part in the creation of Yosemite National Park. Muir will impress you with his encyclopedic knowledge of the geology and plant and animal species of the region, the wisdom he gathered from 10 years worth of adventuring. His writing turns mere words into art and he captures the indescribable majesty of Yosemite as clearly as if you were there yourself. 2. A Walk in the Woods – Bill Bryson One cannot talk about hiking travels and science without referencing Bill Bryson. Let Bill, with his fun and casual writing style, become your friend and companion as he guides you through the history and ecology of the Appalachian Trail. 3. The Wilderness Warrior: Teddy Roosevelt and the Crusade for America – Douglas Brinkley We cannot discuss national parks without lauding one of their greatest patriarchs, Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was many things: a soldier, a Rough Rider, an author, an explorer, and a President of the United States, but perhaps one of his greatest achievements was leading the crusade for the creation of our national park system. Wilderness Warrior is a vivid account of a fascinating and unique individual who left behind a legacy of conservation. 4. Grandma Gatewood’s Walk: The Inspiring Story of the Woman Who Saved the Appalachian Trail – Ben Montgomery With an extra pair of clothes, Keds shoes on her feet, and less than two-hundred dollars in her pocket, Emma Gatewood became the first woman to hike the entire Appalachian Trail and later the first person to hike it two and three times. Her harrowing story of perseverance and determination is what many believe brought attention to the trail, leading to its preservation and saving it from extinction. 5. John Muir: His Life and Letters and Other Writings – John Muir John Muir is such a hero in the landscape of American nature preservation and environmental philosophy that it would be imprudent to only acknowledge him once on this list. This book is a combination of his unfinished autobiography and personal correspondence that gives insight into his life and legacy. The passion with which he fights for the wilderness can bring tears of your eyes and his prose is so beautifully constructed and quotable it is no wonder he convinced so many to join him in preserving our natural treasures. 6. Walking – Henry David Thoreau Thoreau is probably best known for his masterpiece, Walden. He was a trailblazer of his time being one of the first Americans to start a dialogue about the value of nature. His essay, Walking, explores the transcendental qualities and spiritual healing one gains from a walk with nature. His ideas influenced the creation of Yellowstone National Park, our nation’s first national park. 7. The Collected Poems, 1957 – 1982 – Wendell Berry If poetry is more your thing, this Appalachian transplant and farmer turned poet is simple, humble, and unpretentious. Written from a place of love for the environment, agriculture, and conservation, Wendell Berry tackles the circle of life and the peace and simplicity of nature through his prose in a meaningful and philosophical way. 8. The Journals of Lewis and Clark – Meriwether Lewis and William Clark In order to truly appreciate something, you must first know its history and origin. The logs kept by Lewis and Clark on their expedition out west showcase wild and uncharted land before it even became part of United States territory, much less our national parks. Their writings also describe their encounters with wildlife and their interactions with Native Americans, the first peoples of the United States. 9. National Parks: America’s Best Idea – Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan This coffee table book is a beautiful and comprehensive guide to the history of our national parks. Packed with stunning photography and interesting facts, it is a phenomenal companion to Ken Burn’s 12-hour PBS documentary of the same name. 10. Bear in the Backseat: Adventures of a Wildlife Ranger in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park – Kim DeLozier and Carolyn Jourdan This read is a fantastic account of the life of a park ranger in the heart of The Great Smoky Mountains. These conversational-style tales take you on a journey from run-ins with black bears to relocating skunks to re-introducing animal species to different areas of the region.","With the changing of environmental policies, national monuments shrinking and under review, and threats of federal lands being sold for oil drilling and logging, it is more important than ever in these chaotic and ever-changing times that we do everything we …",2018-04-07T18:13:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thoughtcatalog.com'}",These 10 Must-Read Books Could Save Our National Parks And The Environment,http://thoughtcatalog.com/jillian-leedy/2018/04/these-10-must-read-books-could-save-our-national-parks-and-the-environment/,"https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/photo-1518623380242-d992d3c57b37.jpg?resize=1024,731&quality=95&strip=all&crop=1",,Thoughtcatalog.com,Smoky Mountains,0

Snowed villages dotted with alpine trees by the calm wintry sceneries, punctuated with delicate aromas of cinnamon-laced delicacies, and bakeries. Savouries of artisanal cheese,fondue, and mulled wine with spices. Colourful marshmallows, candles, and homemade boutique soaps. European handicraft from the cottages and the tall Christmas trees adorned with wish cards, holly fruits, and Swarovski crystals. Such views of Christmas markets in Europe are nothing short of a spectacle reminiscent of the days from the fairy tales. Be it the village paintings, warm cottages, or the pleasing shades of red and green dotting streets everywhere.
From revisiting local traditions of nativity scenes, the Advent, and the Epiphany in the village markets, these are typical festivities characterising celebrations, everywhere. In Switzerland, for instance, Montreux Noel (Christmas Day); street markets in Basel overlooking the Rhine river; or dazzling trees in Zurich, artists from all across showcase their talents, and engage with tourists and natives alike presenting a mix of modern methods garnished with traditions from across the world. Consider diverse Indian folk paintings at the Christmas markets. Or, wine paintings from France; roasted chestnuts in the smoky earthenware; spicy Gluhwein(traditional mulled red wine with spices, served hot), or drinking chocolate to traditional Swiss fondue these small markets are integrated community spaces offering a place to everyone to coexist and thrive.

Heres looking at some of these colourful Christmas vibes from the quaint land of the Alps:
Tree decorations
Sparkling and twinkling lights adorning living dwarf subalpine fir trees, the Colorado spruce, or the artificial ones – every tree shimmers with silver and glitter, lights, and candles. Add to these cookies, candied fruits, elves, miniature craft, and bells. Every corner houses a Christmas tree, mostly a living one decorated with tree lights. Zurich in Switzerland has the streets illuminated with the most decorated trees, with the most popular being at the train station(called HB), with thousands of Swarovski crystals. At some places, these Swarovski donned trees are as tall as 50 feet glowing with colourful luminescence. Another famous tree is housed at St. Gallens (opposite to the cathedral) in Switzerland, which is also one of the tallest Christmas trees sparkling with stars and crystals. Another popular concept is that of the Wish Tree made of paper cards replete with greetings and wishes for loved ones.In addition to these green beauties, the entire ambiance thrives with village nativity scenes, the story of the three kings, and local folk tales.

Traditional delights
At many places, this is the time to observe White Christmas with snow welcoming Christmas festivities in the mountains. To go with the weather therefore, hot savouries such as drinking chocolate, spiced Chai tea, traditional Gluhwein with piping hot fondue are the local delicacies to relish. Gluhwein compensates for the frost bites during this time of the year and is served in beautiful clay pots and mugs, which are Christmas souvenirs for the tourists.Gingerbread and aniseed star-shaped cookies are other popular servings. German Christollen or locally known as Stollen, is a traditional cake made of fruit bread, topped with nuts, spices, cinnamon, and candied orange peels. Orange flavours are common ingredients in dessert preparations during this time. Similarly, cinnamon stars called Zimtsterne; Lackerli spice cookies from Basel, and the Swiss Baumnuss Guetzli, or walnut cookies are the regional specialties. Santa and his flying sleigh
Dotted with idyllic chalets (a Swiss wooden house) the streets of Montreux witness the spectacle of Santas flying sleigh waving at thronging crowds over Lac Leman (Lake Geneva). Just about twilight Santa welcomes and greets the crowds on his sleigh from the winter skies – singing carols, playing the guitar; wishing everyone Merry Christmas. In addition to these, Santa toy train rides touring markets, Santa ateliers or workshops at the village of elves, visit to Santa Post Office, and a ride to Rochers de Naye, the original house of Santa – nestled in the middle of glaciers with panoramic views, near Montreux, are other spectacular attractions, straight from the era of folk tales. An interesting trivia related to Santa is that he is known as Samichlaus in German-speaking parts of Switzerland; and Père Noëlin the French parts (Newly Swissed, 2016).

Candle dipping and handicraft workshops
From November last week until Christmas, candle dipping tents are organised all across street markets. Popularly known as Kerzenziehen, candle dipping in colourful paraffin wax remains a timeless tradition, here. Handcrafted tree shaped candles of different sizes are other popular choices for tree decorations and gifts. Similarly, artisanal soaps made of essential oils and homemade scrubs are other popular gifting options, and markets thrive with these two products, mostly for their aromas. Workshops for children on knitwear, embroidery, artisanal chocolate crafts at the village of elves dedicated to children and their creativity and imagination are other favourite attractions. While the essence of Christmas vibes is the same across different parts of the world, ideas that celebrate inclusiveness and cultural diversity can be learned and organised in other parts of the world, as well. For instance, recently, Bengaluru city in India unveiled the tallest Christmas tree at the World of Christmas themed around European celebrations andconcepts. Such multicultural activities not only promote cultural integration, but also tourism, local community development – as long as the festival related infrastructure, security, crowd management, and overall wherewithal can be taken care of, and organised in a citizen-centric and environment friendly manner.

Talia Schlanger,"Tori Amos Courtesy of the artist ""Up The Creek"" from Native Invader ""L.A. Woman"" from L.A. Woman ""Chocolate Song"" from Native Invader ""Me And A Gun"" from Little Earthquakes ""Mary's Eyes"" from Native Invader If Mother Earth were to manifest as a piano-prodigy-angel-voiced rock star, I think she would take the shape of Tori Amos. There's an elemental air to the music Amos makes, especially on her latest album, Native Invader, on which she traces some of the songlines passed down through the Smoky Mountains by her Cherokee grandfather. And, the way I hear it, there's a maternal generosity and wisdom that has defined Amos' essence since her 1992 debut album Little Earthquakes. Long before #MeToo, Tori shared her own story of being raped in the song ""Me and a Gun"" on that album. Although her record label felt the song was too painful a listen to be included on Amos' debut, she insisted. She also performed that song, in all its bone-chilling a cappella power, at every concert for years. I imagine for many women who had yet to come forward with their stories, a private dialogue with Amos' experience through that song may have served as the conversation they weren't ready to have yet with their own mothers. At this cultural moment, it felt particularly meaningful to talk to Amos about ""Me and a Gun,"" so we did. She also shared her advice for survivors of sexual assault and spoke about RAINN (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network) which she has been associated with for decades. Please be warned: Our conversation could be a trigger for some. But I'm hoping it's also helpful. Amos and I also talked about her mother's ""record shop,"" which would open as soon as her minister dad left for church; the romantic musical dance she does with her husband on a sexy new song called ""Chocolate;"" and The Doors. I hope you can listen. I'm really grateful to Amos for the conversation we had, and for all the important conversations she has started.","Long before #MeToo, the angel-voiced rock star shared her own story about sexual assault in the song ""Me and a Gun.""

Staff Post,"I’m winter caretaker at Mt. Le Conte, in the heart of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Here’s the gear I use at work every day. Below is a closer look at some of my favorite pieces of gear that I wear and carry for winter caretaking. Before we get into that, though, let me tell you about my typical workday on Mt. Le Conte. Park Caretaker’s Typical Morning The gentle hum of my alarm pulls me from a dream. I open my eyes and quietly stare out through the frosted loft window. A snow-covered wilderness lies hidden behind the veil of darkness. The sight of twinkling stars puts renewed pep into my step. After rolling out of bed, I begin gearing up for the day. My small green backpack waits patiently on a nearby forked tree branch, which now serves as an indoor coat hanger. The author takes in a sunrise I slip into my overalls and ignite the kerosene lantern sitting on top of the desk. The power of my 100-lumen headlamp pairs with the orange kerosene glow. I can see clearly now. Grabbing my pack off the wall, I feel the weight of its contents, already loaded with my essential gear. Anything not in the pack is worn on my person. Closing my pack, I begin to break the ice buildup on the frozen door jamb. I’m not too worried about the fact that I’m trapped in my own cabin. I just keep chipping away at the block. The door breaks free, and I turn the knob and step outside. Sharp winds bite at my cheeks as sunrise calls me further up the trail, deeper in to the wilderness. Onward. What I Wear Muck Boots Easy to slip on and waterproof, the shoes I use most often are my Muck Boot Edgewater II ’s. Pairing these neoprene-lined rubber boots with a pair of wool socks, I’m ready to tackle 90 percent of my tasks for the day. Whether I’m checking weather instruments, hiking across camp to the pit toilets, hefting 14 gallons of drinking water up from the spring, or trekking through the snow to capture the sunrise, these boots are my first choice. It’s just hard to beat the rugged functionality of this easy-on, easy-off boot. I’ve also worn Bogs’ rubber boots for many years and find them to be equally as dependable. Overalls Maybe I should’ve been a farmer. If I was traveling through the Smoky Mountains in winter, I would likely be cloaked in a plethora of synthetic fabrics. But when it comes to living and working high in the Smokies, I’m a big fan of Carhartt Insulated Overalls. That’s because the sturdy cotton canvas is extremely durable and provides excellent wind protection. Not to mention, the cotton fabric is nearly silent when hiking. I often receive confused looks from hikers when they witness someone donning overalls and rubber boots on top of one of the highest mountains east of the Mississippi River. A year ago, I would have been confused too. But now I’m siding with the approach farmers have taken for decades. Neck Warmer One piece I fell in love with this year is my Turtle Fur Neck Warmer. (Although I’ve never actually seen a turtle with fur.) This double-layered fleece neck warmer is ridiculously cozy and comfortable. It’s essentially a beefed-up version of the well-known Buff neck gaiter. Worn on the neck, the Turtle Fur Neck Warmer creates a toasty gasket between the head and core, trapping precious heat in frigid temps. I hate having cold ears, so I often wear an extra one as a headband during my morning hikes. If you live somewhere windy and cold, I highly recommend this affordable accessory. What I Carry Light and Capable Camera The Sony A6300 camera with a Zeiss 16-70 f4 lens is the combo I’ve used for 98 percent of my photography over the last two years. At just over 2 pounds the systems retains a nice balance between image quality, function and weight. I really appreciate the relative light weight when a short hike turns into a multi-hour photo escapade. I’ve recently added a few accessories to the system, but that’s a story for another time. There is a plethora of quality cameras on the market and it’s a slippery slope recommending a certain model to someone. Personally, I’ve found the combination above to be the right compromise that continues to work for me. Boot Spikes One interesting thing about living on top of Mt. Le Conte is the constant presence of ice on the trails. The mountain continually leaks from the seams; and once the temperatures plummet, all the trails become rivers of ice. Crampons are unwieldly and wearing nothing is just plain sketchy. I’ve found that Kahtoola MICROspikes are the ideal tool for the job and have left a pair on my boots for weeks at a time while living on the mountain. I’ve used the lighter more affordable Yaktrax, but they just can’t handle serious prolonged use. Plus, I can’t afford to slip and get hurt while living alone more than an hour from care. Headlamp My version of a fashion statement. Aesthetically, gold chains are a better look. But when it comes to function, a headlamp wins every time. Clouds and fog often blanket the Smoky Mountains at dusk and during the morning hours; this makes it impossible to see without a light source. Plus, headlamps free up your hands, which helps keep mundane tasks easy and safe. I’ve carried a Black Diamond Spot, in addition to the rechargeable Black Diamond Iota, but I’ve found the Spot to be more reliable, especially in wet conditions. Thermos My secret weapon for the coldest days and well … every day. OK, OK – it’s not that big of a secret, but it doesn’t take long living in a cold environment before you discover the beauty of a simple Thermos. I’ve had mine for years, and it gets the job done again and again. I prefer the simple model (pictured) because there’s nothing to bend or break off. Plus, the lid doubles as a cup. Leatherman and Lighter I’d be crazy not to have these two with me. Whether I’m on top of the mountain or lounging around in the valley, I’m rarely seen without a lighter and my Leatherman Style CS. A lighter is an inexpensive fire and light source that has been indispensable living on Mt. Le Conte. The stoves and lanterns I use don’t have automatic ignitors, so having a lighter on me always helps keep these simple tasks simple. And for tools, I’ve carried my Leatherman Style with me for years. I even wrote a review about how impressed I was with the tool after five years of regular use. Keeping these two little gems in my pocket not only makes my daily life easier, but I’d argue it makes it safer too. Looking for more gear ideas?

"Jonathan Mattise, Associated Press","Bob Bentz had just installed underground utility lines and paved a new road when wildfires roared through the eastern Tennessee treetop canopy he wanted to transform into a $30 million adventure park. A year later, after the blaze killed 14 people and damaged or destroyed about 2,500 buildings in the Gatlinburg area, tourists now take a ski lift from downtown up 600 feet to the Anakeesta resort, where they can zip-line, shop, explore a treehouse playground and wander tree to tree on a sky-bridge. The otherwise whimsical park saved space at its highest point for a memorial walk, featuring photos and stories about the heroism, heartbreak and raw destructive force of the fires. Despite such somber reminders, Bentz is sticking with his plan and, like others, forging ahead, even after a National Parks Service report said the conditions that let flames burn into the city could become the “new normal.” Climate change, the report concluded, has coupled with other factors to expose more areas like the Great Smoky Mountains foothills to wildfires. The report suggests a new level of vulnerability, with sweeping implications for some of the nation’s most revered wilderness areas and the tourism economy that surrounds them. But Bentz and city and county officials are unconvinced. They say it’s unlikely that Gatlinburg will again endure a perfect storm of factors that caused the blaze. Teens were playing with matches in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, winds whipped up to about 100 miles per hour to carry embers for miles and down powerlines to start more fires, and months of drastic drought created the perfect dry kindling. Other businesses are investing with the same confidence. A $35 million Margaritaville Resort is slated to open in Gatlinburg this spring. And two other hotels are already up and running since the fires. “I’m a believer in climate change,” said Bentz, Anakeesta’s managing partner, who has a forestry background. “But I don’t think we have concern about another fire coming to Gatlinburg and doing the same kind of damage.” Though downtown Gatlinburg was essentially untouched by the fire, and Sevier County was open for business quickly afterward, it cost an extra $1 million-plus in Gatlinburg advertising and more state money to convey that to travelers. It took a persistent campaign with simple messaging — “If you want to help, come visit” — to draw people back. Most of the damage in Gatlinburg was to residential buildings, and more than half of those were second homes or rental cabins, said Gatlinburg City Manager Cindy Ogle. “A lot of folks thought everything in Gatlinburg and Sevier County burned down,” said Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters. Gatlinburg is bustling again along its downtown strip of candy kitchens, restaurants, shops, distilleries with moonshine tastings, mini-golf courses, old-time photo storefronts, and Ripley’s Believe It or Not-brand attractions, including an aquarium. But there’s also the occasional vacant lot along the winding mountain roads, with only the foundation of a torched home left behind. The area’s tax revenues bolster its case for a comeback. Gatlinburg’s gross tax receipts were down 36 percent in December 2016, right after the fire, compared to December 2015. This September’s revenues were down only 2.4 percent compared to September 2016, before the fires. About 92 percent of Gatlinburg’s destroyed properties have been cleared out ahead of the end-of-the-year deadline to do so, Ogle said. More than 500 rebuilding permits have been issued in the city and county, but at times it’s been slow because there are only so many carpenters, plumbers and contractors, Ogle said. Waters, a 64-year-old who’s lived in Sevier County his whole life, said the fires were nothing like anything he’s experienced, and firefighters said it’s the type of blaze usually seen out West. How climate change plays into it all, he said he doesn’t know. Still, even though he doesn’t think there will be a repeat of the fires, the region has to prepare for one, Waters said. Gatlinburg’s flood warning system, which mainly reaches the downtown, is being expanded into other areas the fire torched. There will be an AM radio station for emergency purposes, and local officials won’t have to get state emergency officials’ approval to send mobile emergency alerts, which they weren’t able to do last year because essentially all lines of communication went down. Additionally, Great Smoky Mountains National Park will undergo a $2.5 million radio communications system upgrade, seven local fire departments will receive radios and protective equipment, and an emphasis will be placed on clearing out dead and dying trees. Anakeesta, which opened in September, has another $8 million in projects in the works, including a scenic restaurant, mountain coaster, and an amphitheater. Bentz cleared out plenty of dead trees after the fire, revealing a sprawling view of the mountains and Gatlinburg below that he hadn’t planned for. The charred-black trees that were kept standing to line the memorial walk say plenty about what has happened there, Bentz said. “It remembers what happened and the loss that occurred, but it also remembers, I think, the generation of new life coming back,” Bentz said.

"Dan Peltier, Skift","Many U.S. National Park Service officials have publicly pointed to the negative impact of overtourism during the past year, and they are considering reservation systems for some parks and other measures to address visitor growth. While officials are mulling reservation systems for some parks to get a handle on overtourism, these aren’t imminent, said Donny Leadbetter, tourism program manager for the U.S. National Park Service. More than 330 million people visited a park, monument or site part of the national park system last year, about the same as 2016. But visitors spent more than 1.4 billion hours in the parks, a 1.4 percent (19 million hours) increase year-over-year. Some 61 of the 385 reporting parks (the park service has 417 parks and sites across the United States) set new visitation records last year (16 percent of reporting parks). The 2017 visitation data released this week come after a chaotic year for the park service and Department of the Interior that oversees it. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who took office a year ago this week and was nominated by President Donald Trump, has sided with the oil industry over environmentalists and reassigned dozens of top park service managers to parts of the agency where they had no experience. Zinke also suspended more than 200 park service committees and boards pending an internal review and most of the park service advisory board’s members quit in January out of frustration with Zinke. Blue Ridge Parkway, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park were the most-visited of the park system with 16, 14.9, and 11.3 million visits, respectively. For national parks, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (11.3 million), Grand Canyon National Park (6.2 million), and Zion National Park (4.5 million) were the most-visited (see chart below). Although visitation was about the same in 2017 and 2016, the crowds at popular parks likely in part tarnished the visitor experience for some travelers, said Leadbetter. “It’s hard to objectively look at some of these places at some times and think ‘that’s a great visitor experience,'” he said. “Some parks are insanely crowded, almost like a theme park,” said Leadbetter. “In some of these most pressing places, it’s even beyond that. I think the travel industry agrees something must be done.” Crowds at parks like Zion and Arches don’t present the natural experience the park service wants visitors to have, said Leadbetter. “Different people have different tolerances,” he said. “But in some parks, shuttle buses are beyond capacity and are dumping huge numbers of people onto trails all at once. Parking is also an issue in some parks.” President Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget calls for a new fund to help tackle a $12 billion maintenance backlog at the parks that visitor growth has helped exacerbate. But the budget faces a long hurdle – the fiscal 2018 budget still hasn’t been passed – and is only a rough draft. It’s become clear that the president and other top lawmakers are using the park service as political leverage to advance other agendas. Still, Zinke feels the proposed fund is a step in the right direction. “Our national parks are being loved to death,” he said in a statement. “As visitor rates continue at a high level, we must prioritize much-needed deferred maintenance including aging facilities, roads, and other critical infrastructure.” Reservation Systems Are Work in Progress Last year the park service said it’s considering implementing a reservation system in popular parks to control when, where, and how many people can enter on a daily basis. But 2017 data show visitation was basically the same year-over-year while the time spent in the parks increased, and a system that limits visitors but doesn’t account for time spent in the parks won’t solve the problem. “The reservation systems are probably not happening this year, they’re at least a year or more away,” said Leadbetter. “We have online portals where we collect comments on plans and have community meetings. There are macro constraints that are out of the control of the travel industry.” The park service hopes a reservation system would help visitors consider visiting during off-peak times of the year when parks aren’t as busy. But work and school schedules often dictate when people choose to visit, said Leadbetter. “Many popular parks still have capacity but it’s clustered,” said Leadbetter. “Most people could be entering through one gate but other entrances of a park may have much more capacity. This isn’t about limiting access. If there’s a daily limit on entries, those limits are still collectively above what the numbers are now. And then there are situations like in the Grand Canyon where we only allow so many daily permits for rafting trips on the river.” What Do Visitors Think? Leadbetter said Arches and Acadia National Parks are two parks furthest along in collecting visitor data. Beyond tracking visitation, the park service wants to better understand how people actually feel about their visits. The park service’s 2016 visitor satisfaction survey, the most recent data available, show that visitors that year were very satisfied with their experiences despite crowding and maintenance backlogs. The park service had more than 330 million visitors in 2016, a record high for the system. The survey asked visitors to rate their overall satisfaction with the quality of facilities, services, and recreational opportunities available at parks. Some 98 percent of the more than 57,000 respondents said the quality of their experience was “very good and good” while only 2 percent said it was “average.” Nearly 20 percent of the 334 parks, monuments and sites part of the survey had 100 percent satisfaction. Visitors weren’t specifically asked about crowds or quality of the infrastructure but neither were overwhelming factors in respondents’ answers.

Kate Yoder,"As wildfire smoke descended on Seattle this week, the sun turned an apocalyptic shade of red and the city breathed in some of the unhealthiest air in the world. A new word to describe this phenomenon graced the headlines: “smokestorm.” The person who coined the term is Cliff Mass, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington and revered Seattle meteorologist. “A Smokestorm is Imminent,” read the title of his blog post last Saturday, in which he projected the dangerously smoky days ahead for northwest Washington state. “You have heard of rainstorms, snowstorms, and windstorms,” Mass wrote. “It is time to create another one: the smokestorm.” I called up Mass on Wednesday — the day before a drizzle came in and the smoke began to dissipate — to hear the story behind the term and what he thinks we can do to prevent future smokestorms. He came up the word to help prepare people for the hazardous air conditions. “I just wanted to give people a heads up, and something dramatic probably was more effective than ‘air quality alert,’” Mass tells me. Mass defines a “smokestorm” as “a sudden onset of high concentrations of smoke that are large enough to affect daily life.” Like other types of storms, a smokestorm disrupts normal operations. In Seattle this week, flights were delayed. The tourism industry took a hit. State health officials even started warning people not to vacuum. “This was the worst [smoke] event we had in 20 years,” Mass tells me. “But one thing you can keep in mind is that people are not old enough to remember what it was like the the early 20th century and before.” Mass says that Seattle was historically a “very smoky place.” He points to an example: In 1895, when Mark Twain visited Olympia, the capital of Washington, the city’s reception committee apologized to him for the dense smoke from wildfires that clouded picturesque views of the Olympic Mountains. Wildfires and smoke were part of life, but they weren’t like the giant blazes or smokestorms we see today. In additional to naturally occuring blazes, indigenous groups in the area would start low-intensity burns for hunting and clearing the land to gather food — a practice that stands in stark contrast with the aggressive fire suppression practiced during the last hundred-plus years. The forests are now overgrown and “completely unlike what they were like 150 years ago,” Mass says, “and they tend to burn these large fires which sometimes we just can’t stop.” There’s “considerable agreement” among scientists that climate change is making drought and heat — and consequently, wildfires — worse, according to the Society for Environmental Journalists. But it’s not the only factor at play here. Mass calls the climate change explanation for wildfires a “simplistic narrative,” though he acknowledges the danger it poses. “Climate change is going to get more and more serious as time goes on, so you gotta worry about that,” he told me. In addition to overgrown forests, Mass places some responsibility on the spread of invasive grasses — which he referred to as “grassoline” — that burn more readily than Washington’s native grasses. So how do we put a stop to gigantic fires, and thus smokestorms, in the West? Mass says the key is proper forest management: Clearing out excess fuel and doing low-level prescribed burns. “It would cost billions of dollars to do,” Mass says, “but we’re gonna pay for it anyway. You might as well do it smart and take care of it.”","Seattle's Cliff Mass coined the word ""smokestorm.""

Rachel Rummel,"Deep in the Harenna forest, located inside Ethiopias Bale Mountains National Park, beekeepers hand-carve the hives that will house their bees. They hollow out two pieces of tree trunks, fill one side with straw, then bind them together with bamboo and vines. To make sure the vessels aroma is enticing to a queen, they smoke it over a beeswax and moss fire. Finally, they hoist the hive high into the tree canopies to keep it out of the reach of predators.
Ethiopians have practiced beekeeping for thousands of years. As most of the countrys honey producers have started to use faster techniques, these beekeepers, who live in and around the village of Rira within the Harenna forest, maintain their traditions. The work is not only laborious, but dangerous: Beekeepers must harvest at night, when the hives residents are more subdued, or risk painful stings. Wearing no protective gear, they scale the tall trees with a rope, smoke out the swarm with a torch made from bound lichen, and retrieve the honeycombs.
Tasters say the resulting amber-hued honey has a creamy texture and a flavor thats smoky, slightly herbal, and mellow in sweetness. Its often used on flatbread, as a medicine, or as an ingredient in tej, a honey wine. Households store the liquid in gourds until a special occasion. And the funky, saccharine wine is certainly celebration-worthy. Some might even say its the bees knees.","Deep in the Harenna forest, located inside Ethiopia's Bale Mountains National Park, beekeepers hand-carve the hives that will house their bees.

Ed Payne,"(Gray News) It was a meth overdose that claimed the life of a man whose body was found in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in September, not the black bear that was eating him.
Park officials released a statement Monday saying William Lee Hill Jr. died of accidental methamphetamine intoxication, according to an autopsy from the Knox County Regional Forensic Center.
The 30-year-old was found in the park near Cades Cove, TN, on September 9.
At the time of discovery, searchers encountered a bear feeding on Hills body, the park statement said.
Without knowing the definitive cause of death, the next day officials made the decision to euthanize the bear in the interest of public safety after consultation with wildlife professionals and further understanding of the bears aggressive behavior.
Officials estimate 1,500 bears are in the park along the Tennessee-North Carolina border. Though its rare any show aggressive behavior toward humans, bears that pose a threat to visitor safety are euthanized on rare occasions.

Tony Endelman,"Some time ago, I was on the phone with Becky, a life coach who specializes in helping people with an overwhelming desire to create miracles. Becky lives in North Carolina, in a quaint, sparsely populated town that sits somewhere between the Atlantic coast and the Great Smoky Mountains. Shes been coaching for more than a decade.
In addition to being a life coach, Becky is a wife, a mother, a traveler, an internet entrepreneur and a motivational speaker. Shes also the seventeenth coach who reached out to me, after Id shared with an online community that I was profoundly desperate to have some kind of a breakthrough.
Simply put, Id hit a wall the same wall Ive hit repeatedly throughout my life. Its a hideous monstrosity; one that, somewhere along the way, I constructed in my own mind. It spans my subconscious. Its made of fear and anxiety and limiting beliefs, and despite my goals and grand ambitions, its always stood in the way of my progress.
Previously, Id have combed the self-help aisle and the blogs of influencers, looking for ways to tear down the wall or, more preferably, obliterate it, and turn it into a useless pile of swirling dust. Id have downloaded podcasts, signed up for webinars, purchased courses, and joined forums. Id have locked myself in a room and devoured information, only to emerge no more inspired and no less dispirited.
But, this time around, I sought out a coach.
I wasnt looking for just any coach. I wanted someone to guide me, expertly and without platitudes. Id grown tired of the cheese and sleaze and baloney and bunk. Id grown tired of hearing that Im a remarkable badass or a magnificent spark of divine light or a conscious creator who can connect to the cosmic life-force. Id grown tired of hearing that the world desperately needs my special gift.
For fuck sake, I just wanted some information I could actually use.
I wanted someone to show me the clearest path towards a rich life. I wanted someone to look inside the nooks and crannies and crevasses of my brain, and scrape out the bullshit. I wanted someone to tell me exactly how to break through my psychological barriers, achieve my goals, and find contentment. Indeed, I wanted someone to help me create some goddamn miracles already.
First, I spoke with Marty, a street juggler-turned-circus clown-turned-toymaker-turned-life coach whose mission is to inspire others to call in their creativity. An interesting man, no doubt. But, we spent much of the time discussing the intricacies of George Carlins most celebrated material. For some reason, I didnt think Marty could give me the information I was so desperately seeking.
Next, I spoke with Angie, a Chicago-based fulfillment coach who strives to help young professionals discover how bright and powerful they can be in the world. Angie couldnt have been kinder or more compassionate, which is why I promptly declined to hire her. I didnt think Angie could deliver the proper, high-voltage ass-kicking I felt that I needed.
Then, I spoke with Karen, a former economist and policy advisor who spent the better part of twenty years working with government leaders in Africa. Karen affirmed that I merely needed to look beyond thyself, shift thy perspective, and step into thy power. When I asked Karen how to do that, she divulged that I could book a four-hour Genius Session with her to find out. Stupid meI never did book the session.
I also spoke with Holly, who said shed uncovered a transformative five-step strategy for conquering fear that she would happily divulge as long as I joined her twelve-week mastermind group. I politely explained that I didnt have that kind of time.
Then, there was Dennis, who promised I would gain an enormous amount of clarity by using a No. 2 pencil and only a No. 2 pencil to draw thousands of tiny circles on a standard sheet of white paper. According to Dennis, I needed to do this for at least 45 minutes, without stopping. Reluctantly, I complied, and came away with nothing more than a tinge of embarrassment and a shooting pain in my hand.
Then, there was Jim, who insisted that I balance my checkbook.
And Rob, who made me punch a pillow while he watched.
And Mel, who unexpectedly read my Tarot Cards.
And Jackie, who demanded that I form a relationship with Jesus Christ.
And a succession of other coaches who all instructed me to do essentially the same thing: Decide where Id like to be in a year and figure out how to get there.
Then, Becky called.
She introduced herself in a mild southern drawl, radiating warmth and positivity. She told me that shes a strong believer in the goodness of life that shes driven by joy and generosity and purpose. She told me about her academic achievements, and her rigorous, post-graduate work. But, before she could tell me about her passion for helping people with an overwhelming desire to create miracles, I interrupted quite tempestuously and told her that Id hit a fucking wall. Poor Becky.
I told Becky that I was frustrated.
I told her that I was angry.
I told her that Id made some changes in my life, but it didnt seem to matter. I told her that I just wanted to be happy and successful and do things on my own terms and make some kind of an impact in the world. I told her that I was struggling to grow my business, and struggling even more to figure out why.
I told Becky that I was tired of reading about the other coaches and entrepreneurs, making millions of dollars with their premium packages and online courses and group intensives and stupid fucking eBooks.
I told her that I didnt get it.
I told her that I had just as much to offer as anyone else.
I told her that Id taken classes and attended workshops and read every goddamn motivational book under the sun, and nothing seemed to help.
I told her that I was stuck. Completely, hopelessly, and inexplicably stuck.
I told Becky that Id spoken with sixteen other coaches before her, and not one of those motherfuckers could tell me how to move forward.
So, what do you hope to get out of this call? asked Becky.
I told her that I didnt know.
I told her that Id been hoping for some sort of panacea. A magic bullet. A nugget of infinite wisdom that would blow my mind wide open and change my life forever.
Then, I told her that such a thing probably doesnt exist.
As were talking, I said, Im beginning to realize that you arent going to tell me anything I havent already heard. I dont think anyone can tell me anything I havent already heard. I think I know what to do. I just need to, likeyou knowfucking do it.
I think youre probably right, affirmed Becky.
I think I need a nap, I replied.
LEARNING VS. AVOIDING
If youre a man who is desperate to become better with women, for example, then youve probably read The Game by Neil Strauss, in which Neil chronicles his rise from socially awkward journalist to the worlds most notorious pick-up artist. Maybe The Game led you to its companion piece, The Rules of the Game, and then to books like Mystery Method or The Layguide or even Robert Greenes The Art of Seduction. Maybe you took to the internet, and spent hours in online forums, poring over the latest and most commonly used attraction methods. Maybe you even bought one of Ross Jeffries home study courses.
Then, you decided that canned openers, DHV stories, and kino escalation patterns all seem inauthentic and creepy, and youd much rather attract women by just being yourself. So, now youre reading all the best books on how to become a better, more integrated man, like No More Mr. Nice Guy by Dr. Robert Glover and The Way of the Superior Man by David Deida. Maybe youve picked up Dale Carnegies How to Win Friends and Influence People, Nathaniel BrandensThe Six Pillars of Self-Esteem, and Viktor Frankls timeless classic, Mans Search for Meaning. Maybe youve even joined a support group, which allows you to comfortably share your story with other men.
Yes, youve embarked on a wondrous journey of self-improvement, knowing it could very well lead to the woman of your dreams. And, I commend you.
My question is: When are you finally going to walk up to a woman and say hi?
Similarly, if youre a woman who wants to attract the perfect man, maybe youve been thumbing the pages of Elle, Marie Claire, and Cosmopolitan, looking for ways to get his attention and find out if hes into you.
Maybe youve spent some weekends at home, curled up on the couch with Matthew Husseys Get the Guy, Ellen Feins All the Rules, and Dr. Ali Binazirs The Tao of Dating.
Maybe you hired a dating coach to help you develop more confidence, meet higher quality men, and better understand the subtleties of male behavior. But, maybe your coach seemed a little weird and charged too much and didnt tell you what you wanted to hear and couldnt really answer any of your questions. So, now youre hoping Steve Harvey has all the answers because youve downloaded Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man and Straight Talk, No Chaser.
Yes, youre a strong, intelligent, and ambitious woman; and youve become dedicated to learning the language of love, because, goddammit, youre ready to meet your soulmate. And, you deserve to. Its about fucking time.
My question is: When are you finally going to introduce yourself to that cute guy at the gym and slip him your phone number?
If you loathe your job, and youve been dreaming of starting an online business, then youve probably read Tim Ferris generation-defining chart-topper, The 4-Hour Workweek. Maybe youve also read The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau, The Art of the Start by Guy Kawasaki, and Crush It! by Gary Vaynerchuk. Maybe you kill time in your cubicle by scouring the websites of prominent internet entrepreneurs like Frank Kern, Eben Pagan, Lewis Howes, Ramit Sethi, and Pat Flynn. Maybe youre even subscribed to their email lists.
And, surely youve clicked on a Facebook ad, which brought you to a well-crafted landing page, which prompted you to sign up for a webinar, which promised to show you The EXACT Blueprint that Thousands are Using to Turn Their PASSION into PROFIT and Consistently Land High-Paying Clients!  But, maybe the webinar wasnt as informative as youd hoped, and its real purpose was to sell you something, and even though you took notes, the whole thing kind of felt like a waste of time. So, now youre reading all the articles you can find on content marketing and blog monetization and SEO and sales funnels and social media.
Yes, youve been learning everything there is to know about running an online business. After all, youve got big ideas, and youre determined to create the life youve always wanted. No longer will you settle for being a paper-pushing drone, a cog in the machine, a slave to the modern workplace. And, I dont blame you.
My question is: When are you finally going to put up a goddamn website and start telling people about your services?
Make no mistake: You should never stop learning. As renowned motivational speaker, Jim Rohn, once said, Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins.
But, at some point, you might want to ask yourself: Are you really learningor just avoiding?
Are you filling your head with information to avoid taking action?
This, in fact, is one of the pitfalls of having an unlimited amount of information at our fingertips, and its especially dangerous in the world of self-help. For many of us, self-help material is just another form of avoidance, whether we realize it or not. We read books and listen to podcasts and watch videos and communicate with so-called experts, and our brains lead us to believe were making progress. Except, were not really making progress at all.
Real progress requires action. And, while filling your head with information may feel like action, more often than not, it leads to lengthy periods of inaction. Its mental masturbation or, as its most commonly called: analysis paralysis. Its also why, as journalist Oliver Burkeman points out in his book The Antidote, among themselves, self-help publishers refer to the eighteen-month rule, which states that the person most likely to purchase any given self-help book is someone who, within the previous eighteen months, purchased a self-help book one that evidently didnt solve all their problems.
The truth is, you are not going to find a nifty, book-sized solution to your problems. You are not going to achieve your goals by analyzing them. You are not going to succeed by talking to another success coach. And, you are not going to grow by watching one more PowerPoint presentation about growth.
If you want to make progress, start moving. Put one foot in front of the other. Do something. And, if only for a little while, stop filling your head with information. Chances are, you already have the information you need.
WHAT WOULD WILLIAM OF OCKHAM DO?
William of Ockham was an English Franciscan philosopher and theologian, generally considered one of the major figures of medieval scholastic thought. He died around 800 years ago, but one of his most important ideas lives on.
Occams razor (or Ockhams razor) is a basic problem-solving principle which states that the simplest solution is usually the correct one. In science, Occams razor is used as a heuristic to guide researchers in eliminating unnecessary assumptions while developing theoretical models. Of course, were not talking about science here. Were talking about some of the most common parts of life that we humans tend to overthink, overcomplicate, and overanalyze.
Much like this essay, a great deal of self-help material includes notoriously vague directives: Start moving. Take action. Do something!  This leaves us scratching our heads, wondering what the fuck the something is that were supposed to do. So we revisit the self-help aisle, hoping to find the answer. Rarely, though, do we stop to acknowledge that we probably already have the answer. We almost always know what we need to do. We just dont do it.
Doing something usually means doing something different. It means stepping outside your comfort zone, venturing into the unknown, and facing some of your fears. And, because this is emotionally daunting, we assume that it must also be complicated. It isnt complicated. The simplest solution is usually the correct one.
Wondering how you can get a date with that sexy barista? Ask her out. Wish you could get that cute guy to notice you? Walk up and introduce yourself. Sitting in an office is crushing your soul? Quit and find something else to do. Worried your business idea wont pan out? Try it and see. Desperate to make new friends? Get the fuck out of the house and go talk to people.
As Amelia Earhart once said, the most effective way to do it is to do it. So, stop thinking and start doing. You never know; you might just fulfill your overwhelming desire to create miracles.

ugc,"Sequoyahs origins are as murky as the heavy veil of mist that hangs over the nearby Great Smoky Mountains.  Born sometime between 1765 and 1776 near the shores of the Little Tennessee River, no written records exist that accurately chronicle his early life, but he would solve that problem for future Cherokee generations with his now-famous syllabary.
No two accounts of Sequoyahs life seem to match, and some are wildly divergent. Historians agree that his mother was named Wut-teh, but his fathers identity remains a point of contention. Because he was known as George Gist among the Anglo population, some believe his father was a German trader named Nathaniel Gist, but others maintain that he was full-blooded Cherokee. Regardless, the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum focuses less on his problematic nascency and more on his character as a curious and multitalented leader.
The lives of the Cherokee between the American Revolution and the War of 1812 changed dramatically, and Sequoyah worked cooperatively with the infant American nation, going so far as to fight in the 1814 Battle of Horseshoe Bend alongside Andrew Jackson. (Jackson later notoriously turned on his onetime Cherokee allies in 1838 when he removed them from the area around the Great Smoky Mountains, an event now infamously known as the Trail of Tears.)
As the story goes, Sequoyah came to understand the importance of the printed word during this tumultuous period, especially the way in which the federal government used it to organize and wield power. Realizing that the Cherokee were at a significant disadvantage, he set out to invent a written language for his own people.  
In 1809, without any formal education and with only a limited understanding of written English, Sequoyah began his decades-long linguistic journey. The museum presents a dramatic recreation of this endeavor in a three-dimensional video display that captures the strain of his undertaking. A shadowy figure, mumbling and sometimes wailing, artfully projects a frenzied Sequoya who was thought by many to be crazy for his single-minded pursuit.  His wife even burned his early efforts believing he was practicing witchcraft.
In the end, Sequoyah successfully devised an 86-character written language. The second half of the museum is devoted entirely to the success of his invention, with a large printing press taking pride of placement in a  room surrounded by walls of letters and newspapers written in the Cherokee language.   
Today, the Cherokee nation is the largest Native American group in the United States, with over 300,000 tribal members. Fewer than five percent of the population, however, speak Cherokee, making Sequoyahs invention vitally important to preserving the language. Situated in a Tennessee idyll, this museum is a fitting recognition for an extraordinary man of letters.","Sequoyah’s origins are as murky as the heavy veil of mist that hangs over the nearby Great Smoky Mountains.

Nicole Javorsky,"This story was originally published by CityLab and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Even in the awe-inspiring canyons of Yellowstone and mountains of Yosemite, the fresh air may not be so fresh: Concentrations of ozone in many U.S. national parks are similar to levels in America’s largest metropolitan areas, according to a new study in Science Advances by researchers at Iowa State University and Cornell University. Back in 1990, the biggest U.S. metro areas had higher average ozone concentrations and more exceedance days (when the EPA deems ozone levels unhealthy for sensitive groups) than national parks. But by the early 2000s, the study notes, ozone concentrations were “nearly identical” in national parks and large metro areas. In cities, average summer ozone levels decreased by more than 13 percent from 1990 to 2014. The same metric for national parks increased from 1990 to the early 2000s, but declined to 1990 levels by 2014. The researchers noted that these trends align with the timing of federal regulatory efforts, namely the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (mostly focused on pollution in urban areas) and the EPA’s Regional Haze Rule (centered on national parks). Average annual ozone concentrations in top 20 metros and national parks. (From Keiser et al., Science Advances, July 18, 2018.) The study’s authors looked at 33 national parks across the United States, including the largest and most visited in the National Park Service system, such as Acadia, the Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. The 20 largest metro areas, led by New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, were selected based on 2015 population estimates. Sequoia National Park had the highest average ozone concentration of the parks studied, and its trend for exceedance days is similar to that of Los Angeles — the city with the highest ozone levels. Exceedance days at Sequoia National Park and in Los Angeles. (From Keiser et al., Science Advances, July 18, 2018.) Ground-level ozone is the main ingredient in smog. It is created by chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in sunlight. Common sources of nitrogen oxides and VOC include emissions from industrial facilities and electric utilities, motor vehicle exhaust, and gasoline vapors. Ground-level ozone is different from stratospheric ozone, or “good” ozone, which appears naturally in the upper atmosphere. The study found that national parks had fewer visitors on days with poor visibility, presumably because some people followed air-quality warnings. Ozone exposure is associated with respiratory symptoms and increased hospitalization rates, and exposure during exercise worsens the effects. Although the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 expanded regulation of toxic chemicals to fight acid rain, urban air pollution, and toxic air emissions, the efforts largely centered on places where many people live. Substantive efforts to address air quality in national parks did not materialize until 1999, when the EPA created the Regional Haze Rule, which called for state and federal agencies to work together on the issue. This April, President Trump directed former EPA head Scott Pruitt to review the Regional Haze program. The rule has been controversial with some states and industry groups who cite the cost of regulation. Ivan Rudik, one of the researchers, told CityLab that about 10 percent of all park visitors since 1990 (or about 80 million people) have been exposed to ozone levels that are unhealthy for sensitive groups, including older adults, children, and individuals who have a lung disease or are exercising outside. “So pretty much everyone who goes to national parks,” he said. One of the most consequential findings, Rudik said, is that “there’s still quite a [number] of people being exposed to potentially unhealthy levels of ozone when they go to national parks.” Something to keep in mind the next time you escape the city for a dose of fresh country air.","Even in Big Sky Country, you can’t escape from air pollution.",2018-07-20T16:56:38Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Grist.org'}",Ozone levels in many U.S. national parks are similar to those in large cities,http://grist.org/article/ozone-levels-in-many-u-s-national-parks-are-similar-to-those-in-large-cities/,https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/yellowstone_river.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1,,Grist.org,Smoky Mountains,0
James Rudd,"Outside of Spain, the concept of “tapas” has become inexorably linked to sleek wine bars, degustation, and late-night flamenco shows. But tapas cannot be so over-simplified or easily categorized. Enter, zarajos. Originally from the city of Cuenca, this offal-based dish emerged from the “waste not, want not” philosophy, but has since become a common sight in both trendy and homely tapas bars across central Spain. Zarajos are made from the intestines of a suckling lamb that have been marinated in its natural juices. If you’re feeling a little fancier, some taverns marinate them in a mixture of garlic, onion, parsley, and white wine. Chefs then wrap the meat around skewers made from vine branches to form a thick ball and either fry it in hot olive oil until golden or cook it in a smoky oven. The crispy balls of innards are traditionally served as tapas, often alongside garlicky dishes, such as ajoarriero (a sauce of garlic, potatoes, egg, and olive oil that usually tops cod). They are sometimes cooked as part of a broth with another “acquired taste” ingredient: caracoles (snails). Either way, zarajos have remained popular, thanks to their succulent earthiness and reasonable price. Organ meat dishes, known as casquería, have been favorites in central Spain for centuries. Whereas seafood and rice dishes have defined the cuisine of the coastlines, the dry plateaus and mountains farther inland, by necessity, drew their fare from the farmyard. Though it’s now less common to see offal on the tapas menu, the tradition lives on through zarajos, callos a la Madrileña (tripe stew), and oreja a la plancha (grilled pork ear).","Outside of Spain, the concept of “tapas” has become inexorably linked to sleek wine bars, degustation, and late-night flamenco shows.

Sophie Lewis,"Two weeks into the government shutdown, this family is on a mission to clean up Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It's common for Marc Newland and his daughter Erica to spend their time together hiking, but their most recent excursion had a deeper purpose. After hearing about the shutdown, Erica suggested they spend their time collecting some of the litter left behind in the park. 
Many parks are currently open despite the shutdown, but with little staffing to maintain them. Great Smoky Mountains National Park's emergency fund ran out on New Year's Day, and the park has been operating under the Department of Interior's contingency plan since then, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. 
Newland detailed their plans in a post in the Hike the Smokies Facebook group. 
""First, it was off to the Little River and Jake's Creek trailheads where we were pleasantly surprised that there wasn't much work for us,"" Newland wrote. ""Next, we headed to the Laurel Falls trailhead and, as expected, we had plenty of work! We headed up the trail and before we knew it, our bags were full.""
Mark Newland and his daughter Erica picked up litter while hiking in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 
Marc Newland
Newland is not personally affected by the shutdown, but his family was still inspired to make a difference in their community. ""I am not a government worker, just an avid hiker who lives just outside of our national park,"" Newland told CBS News. ""We have always made an effort to clean up litter when we hike but after explaining the shutdown to Erica (our 10 year old), she was inspired to kick up our efforts and make a real difference."" 
National parks across the country have suffered as the shutdown enters its third week. It's left many parks without rangers and other staff members who keep parks clean and running. And three people have died in national parks since the shutdown began, including a woman who was killed by a falling tree at Great Smoky National Park. 
Newland said the hike was a  ""fun and very rewarding day for both of us.""
""Erica says that she would like to challenge other hikers to take one day off from getting in miles and impressive vista pics and instead, give back by grabbing a trash bag, heading to the park and collecting some litter!!"" Newland wrote. ""These mountains give so much to so many people.

Fox News,"Leaf-peeping season is about to begin for many pockets of the country, making now the perfect time to plan your next great trip. America is home to many beautiful places for marveling at the changing colors of the season, whether you're up north, down south, or even out west. So bundle up, grab some apples and get outside to leaf-peep away at nature's dazzling display. NORTHEAST Acadia National Park, Maine Visit the beautiful Acadia National Park and scale Cadillac Mountain, the tallest mountain in the park and the tallest along the eastern American coast. Not only is this a prime place to view the sunrise, but the 27-mile Park Loop Road system that winds around the mountain offers views of the coastal forests and shoreline. Peak season for leaf-peeping is generally in mid-October, but the state has a fall foliage website that's updated weekly, so you can determine the best time to visit. After youve had your fill of fall colors, head to the coastal town of Bar Harbor, full of history, shops and delicious restaurants. The Catskills, New York The Catskills are lovely in the autumn. View fall foliage in the great outdoors, or take a hike on one of the popular hiking trails in the Catskill Mountains. The area is also great for a scenic drive where you can see the historic covered bridges that date back to the 1800s. Be sure to see the many waterfalls in the region as well, with Kaaterskill Falls being the tallest cascading waterfall in New York State. A fall foliage report for the state can be viewed here. YELLOWSTONE OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING MAN WHO REPORTEDLY SHOT AT WOLVES Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania For amazing leaf-peeping and a good time, head to the Pocono Mountains. Consult the fall foliage forecast before you plan your trip, and if you want to be extra sure the leaves are at optimal color, check out their live cameras. Visitors can take a scenic train ride or trail ride through the region or even an air tour to see the changing foliage. (You know you are going to a superb area for leaf peeping when they have a leaf peeping FAQ available.) Mount Washington, New Hampshire Mount Washington State Park sits atop the summit of the highest peak in the Northeast. The area offers expansive views of up to 130-miles on a clear day, surrounded by the 750,000-acre White Mountain National Forest. If you are not looking to hike up the mountain, there is a scenic overlook with vehicle access. Note that the park (summit building) is closed from November to April. But another way up to view the area that is available through much of November is on The Mount Washington COG Railway, located in the White Mountains in Bretton Woods, N.H. This mountain-climbing train allows plenty of time to take in the views on either a historic steam train or an eco-friendly biodiesel locomotive. SOUTH Great Smoky Mountains, North Carolina &amp; Tennessee Where better to see fall foliage than at Americas most visited national park, the Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee. The park is home to roughly 1,500 black bears which can be viewed in Cades Cove, a popular area for touring that also offers an 11-mile one-way loop road that circles the cove for motorists. Fall color reports are available to guide your visit and offer prime viewing locations. The National Park Service also provides a guide to fall colors in the area. Shenandoah National Park, Virginia Visit Shenandoah National Park to leaf-peep to your hearts desire. Staff updates a fall color report each week so you can keep up with what the trees are doing. Visitors traveling by foot can hike on over 500-miles of trails, of which 101-miles are part of the Appalachian Trail. Motorists can take the Skyline Drive, a 105-mile National Scenic Byway, and see the park and beyond from one of the 75 scenic overlooks along the way. Or, experience the park on horseback, departing from Skyline Stables. The Blue Ridge area, Georgia Take a trip on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway, beginning in Blue Ridge, Ga., in the Chattahoochee National Forest. The 26-mile trip takes you along the Toccoa River to a layover in the sister towns of McCaysville, Ga., and Copperhill, Tenn. These twin towns are located on the Georgia-Tennessee state line. Leaf-peeping opportunities are optimal, but you can also take a special Fall Foliage trip on the railway. If you're in the area, be sure to see the Tallulah Gorge which has whitewater releases in November, when the kayakers show off their skills. MIDWEST Lake Geneva, Wisconsin At Lake Geneva you can do it all and therefore, it makes a wonderful place to leaf-peep. Hot-air balloon rides are available by the lake, too: After all, where better to leaf peep than amongst the trees themselves? Or, take a Zip Line Canopy Tour which consists of eight different zip lines, five sky bridges, three spiral stairways and a one-of-a-kind 'floating' double helix stairway which wraps around a breathtaking ash tree, according to the tour companys website. Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio The Cuyahoga Valley National Park is a nice place to view fall foliage via its several trails, including the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Towpath Trail. One great way to see the park is aboard the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad. For National Park Scenic trains departing out of Rockside station and Akron Northside station, upgrade to a Premium Upper Dome ticket for a three-hour continuous round trip adventure that allows you to view the foliage from a mostly glass ceiling. Other options include Bike Aboard! trains that run until Nov. 5, where you can bike the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Towpath Trail and take the train the other way; as well as Grape Escape and Ales on Rails wine- and beer-tasting excursions. Upper Peninsula, Michigan Seven million acres of trees, Great Lakes shores, lighthouses, lakes and waterfalls make a perfect place to seek out beautiful fall colors. Michigans Upper Peninsula offers a plethora of outdoor activities including mountain biking, ATV trails, birding and four state parks. Not to mention, in addition to being able to leaf-peep, you can also see the Northern Lights. WEST Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska Denali National Park encompasses six million acres of land with different forest types and North Americas tallest peak, the 20,310-foot Denali. Get outside and take a hike, go biking or search for wildlife. The park has sled dogs, too, and you can visit their kennels year-round. (Meet the litters of sled dogs here before you go.) Be warned: You might find pleasant fall weather or fresh snow and freezing temperatures, so plan ahead. Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming Visit Grand Teton National Park to see amazing wildlife, lakes and terrain. While leaves have historically peaked in late September, there are still sights to see. It's currently the rutting, or breeding, season for deer, and male elk bugles can be heard just look out for sparring matches. Note that hunting occurs in the park from mid-October through early December, so take precautions and wear orange or bright colors when visiting the park. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS Columbia River Gorge, Oregon Designated as a National Scenic Area, one can observe the canyon where the Columbia River flows through the Cascades. The area offers mountain biking, hiking, picnicking and scenic driving just to name a few activities. Ride the Mount Hood Railroad to see the sites, and take in all of the beautiful foliage.

Shannon O'Donnell | KOMO Meteorologist,"Some months, some seasons, take on a weather ""personality."" Some autumns are extra soggy. Some summers are smoky (we know that one all too well). And if this winter was developing a reputation, it would no doubt be ""windy."" From suffering through a rare and devastating December tornado to enduring a never-ending parade of blustery windstorms, this winter season seems bound and determined to go down as extra gusty.
So, I guess it shouldn't come as a major surprise that another windstorm is on the way. A deepening area of low pressure is moving over the Pacific, and as it closes in, gusty easterly ""Cascadia Winds"" will start funneling through the gaps in the mountains. As that air gets pulled into the low, it will twist, turn, and accelerate through the passes and down the passageways in the Cascades, blowing out into foothill communities like North Bend, Issaquah, Enumclaw and Gold Bar to the tune of 30 to 50 mph.
The weather service also issued a wind advisory for the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the northern Washington coast. Gusts could hit 55 mph in those areas.
There is a wind advisory in place near the foothills starting early Tuesday morning, and at this point it should continue until early Wednesday. While this wind event won't be as powerful as the weekend storm, it will last longer, and wind-weary residents in those east-side communities probably won't be too thrilled to hear the return of the whistling through the trees, especially in the households that are still without power.
Tuesday will also bring a return of the rain. Overnight lows will bottom out near freezing, so some of the showers may start out as wet snow or freezing rain for a brief hour or two before turning completely back over to just lowland rain. The snow level starts near 500 feet, but jumps quickly to 2,000 feet by mid-day, so any bursts of frozen precipitation should be short-lived. Afternoon highs climb into the 40s to about 50 near the metro area, which is typical for January. The Cascades will pick up a few inches of fresh snow at the resorts, but it will be very gusty over the peaks throughout the day, so skiing will be a bit tricky. Wind gusts around the waterfront of the Sound should stay below 30 mph.
Wednesday and Thursday feature a few more rounds of rain, with highs in the 40s to near 50. It will be breezy at times, but not to the extent that we've had in recent weeks.
Friday into the weekend? Believe it or not, at this point it looks pretty quiet! Mainly dry and partly sunny skies are in the cards now for Saturday and Sunday. Wouldn't that be nice to enjoy a wind-free, quiet weather weekend? We'll see if we can't turn this bad winter ""rep"" around after all!","Some months, some seasons, take on a weather ""personality.

Shane McGlaun,"Anyone who lives in the western portion of the US knows that this has been a terrible wildfire season. Much of the state of Colorado has been engulfed in flames, often from the stupidity of campers burning fires during fire bans or people tossing lit cigarettes out of car windows. California has suffered from some of the same fire issues this summer. Smoke in Colorado has been so heavy that warnings have been issued for air quality and some days it’s difficult to see the mountains only a few miles away due to smoky haze. This image is from NASA and it shows a colorful representation of smoke, dust, and other aerosols that are in the atmosphere around the planet. The orange color covering much of the western US is smoke from those wildfires. The image was created with data combined from multiple sensors on satellites orbiting the earth including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on Aqua and Terra satellites. Data was also gathered from ground sensors to create this colorized image. Some of the clouds of dust seen in the image are the result of weather patterns like Hurricane Lane and typhoons off the coast of Japan. We can also see in the image that the heavy smoke from wildfires in the western US has drifted well out over the ocean. The key tells us that the bright orange is black carbon from those fires, the purple is dust, and the white-blue areas are sea salt. The image represents conditions as seen on August 23, 2018.

Megan Barber,"Over 318 million people visited a national park last year From the Great Smoky Mountains to the coast of Olympic National Park, 2018 marked another busy year for our national park system. Many parks saw a record-number of people in 2018 as visitations to all national parks exceeded 300 million recreation visits for the fourth consecutive year. In total, approximately 318 million people visited a national park last year, making it the third busiest year since record keeping began in 1904. Out of the 385 parks that report visitation figures, 28 set a new record for visitation in 2018, with 17 parks breaking a record that was set in 2017. Parks that saw record visits included Arches, Death Valley, the Grand Canyon, Grand Teton, Joshua Tree, and Rocky Mountain National Park. The takeaway? More and more people are visiting national parks, and the trend shows no sign of slowing. The most-visited national parks include the Great Smoky Mountains (11.4M) and the Grand Canyon (6.3M), two parks that have been trading places at one and two since 1979. Other parks in the top five include Rocky Mountain National Park (4.5M), Zion National Park (4.3M) and Yellowstone National Park (4.1M). Lesser known national parks are also seeing an uptick in visitation; 77 parks—or about 20 percent of reporting parks—had over 1 million recreation visits. In addition, the 318 million figure includes visits to sites that are managed by the National Park Service that aren’t necessarily national parks. In California, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area saw over 15 million visitors, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. recorded 7.8 million, and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area saw 7.5 million visitors.

PETER BALAKIAN,"A half-hour north, the ninth-century Sevanavank monastery, with its two small beautiful, earth-colored churches on a peninsula, is worth the climb up the steps from the shore below. Just north of Lake Sevan, we crossed into the alpine mountain region of Tavush where streams and hiking trails wind through the lush forests of Dilijan National Park. The stunning monastery of Haghartsin is nestled on a forested mountain. The spa town of Dilijan, situated in the park, is an atmospheric place out of a Chekhov story. Its chalet-style buildings with gable-tiled roofs, open-air theater and mountain views made it a popular vacation spot for wealthy Russians in the 19th century; today it is a retreat for artists. One of the creative entrepreneur and philanthropist James Tufenkian’s four unique hotels is housed in a complex of restored 19th-century houses. From there, we drove to Avan Zoraget, another Tufenkian hotel, beneath the mountains on the Debed River. Sleek and imaginative, and appointed with Tufenkian carpets, its spacious rooms have lovely views. The restaurant overlooking the river offers a sumptuous repertoire: sautéed local greens and onions with yogurt; smoky eggplant dip blended with tahini; spelt with wild mushrooms; a tongue-melting sou boreg (thin flat noodles layered with Armenian cheeses), chicken cooked with dried plum and pomegranate sauce; superb dry white wine. Back in Yerevan the next evening, I walked through an arch onto an old cobblestone street off bustling Amirian Street and found Anteb, a Syrian-Armenian restaurant, where we had spicy, crepe-thin lahmajuns (Armenian pizza); a piquant muhamara (walnut, pomegranate molasses and red pepper dip) that you scoop up with hot, puffy lavash; and kuftas, crisp shells of cracked wheat bursting with lamb and herbs. The next night my friend Ashot took me to Babylon, an Arabic-Iraqi restaurant where our feast included crispy boregs (phyllo dough wrapped around cheese), meatless stuffed grape leaves and the most tender lamb kebabs I’ve had outside my mother’s kitchen. I never leave Yerevan without meandering through the Vernissage, the open-air market in a park along Aram and Buzant streets where there are stalls and stalls of ceramics, folk and contemporary art, rugs, textiles, jewelry and more. I bought two small antique Caucasian kilims before I wandered back to Republic Square, where I end most evenings. At night the Square, with its monumental rosy tufa stone buildings, is lit up; the fountains spew through colored lights, music plays, people dance. It’s a nightly ritual in Yerevan in the warm-weather months — a down-home celebration to end a day, and a resilient response to the harsh history of this new nation that has emerged from an ancient civilization.","A poet returns to his ancestral country where, after the recent “velvet revolution,” the sense of a new era is palpable.",2018-08-20T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Favorite Place: My Armenia,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/travel/armenia-peter-balakian.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/travel/26armenia4/26armenia4-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Smoky Mountains,0

Kendra Atleework,"In October 2017, 250 square miles burned in Northern California, destroying 6,000 homes and businesses and killing 44 people. For now, the cause of these fires has not been determined. The private utility company Pacific Gas and Electric, known to Californians as PG&E, is under investigation. Total damage for the Northern California wildfires comes to $9 billion. PG&E has started stockpiling cash. In California, this is a familiar story. Three years ago, in February of 2015, one-third of the houses in my remote neighborhood in Eastern California burned down. Here, before the fire, 100 houses lay scattered across the leeward flank of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The people who live here spend their time walking steep roads, listening to crickets, chasing mule deer out of the garden, and looking over a desert valley below. Days after the fire, my neighbor, Cassie, wasn’t doing any of these things. Instead, she stood inside her smoking foundation. Tall and easygoing with freckles on her nose, Cassie had come home from college that winter to sift rubble with her mom and dad. Under different circumstances, we might have hiked together or skated frozen ponds. I used to carpool with her family to school, and I remember her house, wooden and gorgeous and overlooking a ravine from which flames later rose. We wore rubber gloves to sort the rubble, but there was not much rubble to sort. The air smelled of sulfur, and mostly only dust lingered, as if a great storm had picked up the walls and roof and furniture and lifted everything away. Like the 2017 fires in Northern California, the cause of the fire that burned our neighborhood, according to the government database, is still under investigation. One source is more likely than others: On that day, strong winds whipped power lines that hung over dry brush. A power line can start a fire if it breaks in the wind. It can start a fire when a tree or a branch falls across it, or when lines slap together, or when equipment gets old and fails without anyone noticing. In 2015, fires started by electrical lines and equipment burned more acres in California than any other cause. Power lines sparked fires that set records in New Mexico and fed a blaze in Great Smoky Mountains National Park that entered the city of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and killed 14 people in 2016. In recent years, they have consistently been among the three major causes of California wildfires. Hurricane-force winds periodically shriek off the Pacific and rattle California. Wind strong enough to break a power line spreads fire fast. This past October, when I sniffed the air and found that California was once again burning, I looked around and saw many wires thatching an orange sky. I was visiting my aunt in Northern California, 50 miles from the fires. We sat inside and watched the noon sun dim. My childhood home didn’t burn the year Cassie’s did. But it should have. Dry leaves lay in piles beside the wooden walls. The volunteer fire chief’s house across the street burned, although he maintained plenty of defensible space. And so I wait, even now, for the next windstorm. In the months after my neighborhood burned, I waited fearfully, which means I waited angrily. In particular, I hoped power companies would put their lines underground. In 1995, fire-related costs ate up 16 percent of the U.S. Forest Service budget. By 2015, half of the budget was devoted to fire. Some of us wondered how safe our power can be when utility-company profits drive power operations. PG&E has been found guilty of negligence before in wildfires, and some of us point at negligence and greed again this time. There’s a precedent for fire occurring alongside an infrastructure that drives economic growth. From 1870 until the 1920s, most major fires in America were caused by locomotives. We fixed that problem, says Stephen Pyne, a firefighter-turned-historian. “New laws were enforced, fines and lawsuits applied economic pressure, engines were compelled to replace coal with oil as fuel, suitable spark arrestors were invented, rights-of-way were cleaned of debris, lines were patrolled.” And so locomotives started wildfires for decades, but not forever. Like railroads, power lines deliver a seemingly limitless supply of a product wherever people want it. On a good day, the grid makes life easy. Far from urban centers, in my house up the side of a mountain, in an ocean of dry brush, the lights still flick on. In general, power lines only cause fire when things go wrong above ground. Even utility companies agree, after a 2012 study by the Edison Electric Institute revealed that underground lines had fewer problems during storms and were better for public safety all around. But California has 210,000 miles of electrical lines. The cost to put lines underground is about $1 million per mile to start, and much more in mountainous areas. That’s five to 10 times what it costs to hang a line overhead, which usually makes underground lines logistically or economically impractical. In North Carolina, for example, a plan to put power lines underground was dropped because utility rates in the impacted area would have risen by 125 percent. And despite the impulse to blame industry, the power companies aren’t entirely in control of the solution. California utility companies don’t get to decide how much line they install underground; that matter is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission, in order to “protect consumers,” “safeguard the environment,” and “assure Californians’ access to safe and reliable utility infrastructure,” according to the organization’s stated mission. The commission balances risk with cost and limits how much utility companies can spend by putting wires underground. Other improvements to the grid are being investigated, including better line insulation and technology that could anticipate line failure and shut off power in advance. But all of these solutions will be slow and costly to implement. I might get angry with utility companies, but I like to turn lights on in the dark. In the United States, fossil fuels burned to make electricity and heat put more greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere than any industry. My neighbors’ houses burned amid the worst drought California had seen in a millennium. In recent decades, wildfires in the American West have begun to range farther and burn longer. Scientists from eight universities got together in 2016 and looked at tendencies in wildfire and the ways we manage wildfire. They concluded that “wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming.” They called this a “new era.” Fires burn bigger areas and destroy three times as many houses as they used to. What was once a problem in June, July, and August now extends through November and beyond. I evacuated for avalanche warnings in the winters of my childhood. In February 2015, I wandered my neighborhood and gaped at new patches of sky, as smoke seeped out of the ground. When a fire comes up the side of the mountain and destroys our homes, we say: natural disaster. When lightning starts that fire, we say: natural disaster. When power lines start that fire, we still say: natural disaster. Deliberate debris burning, fireworks, and rogue campfires are among the most common causes of so-called wildfire in some parts of California. Still, when people consider wildfire—even wildfire caused by human tools—it seems to us as inescapable as lightning. Three years after her house burned down, I asked my childhood neighbor Cassie whether she felt the fire that destroyed her house was inevitable. She lives in San Francisco now, where she prepares environmental impact reports for federal and state agencies. Her parents live in a house rebuilt atop the ashes of the old. “The smell of smoke made me nauseous,” Cassie told me, while Napa and Sonoma burned last fall. “I woke up in the middle of the night because I could smell it. It felt so close.” Cassie did not consider the loss of her home unavoidable. When people treat fire as an inevitability, she said, its consequences become divorced from human behavior. What she saw on the local news after the Northern California fires were the stories of “people and families and homes,” over and over. It makes sense, because people’s lives are changed, she said. “But that’s always the focus, instead of the bigger issue... instead of, this could have been prevented, and there’s a reason that it happened, and it’s connected to our infrastructure. But I just don’t think it’s something people want to talk about.” It sickened her, to feel fire’s heat, to smell its smoke, without facing its implications. And those implications are complicated. “Many of the problems of fire management do not have technical fixes,” Pyne, the fire historian, wrote during the Northern California fires. “They depend on social choices hammered out in politics—appropriate land use, the purpose of public lands, competing economic interests, cultural values, and philosophies.” It’s possible to update technology to dodge disaster, to a point. We can make advance warning systems for earthquakes, cloak first responders in NASA -developed fire suits, and mitigate rising sea levels with permeable pavement and rain gardens. We can also update technology to avoid having to change the assumptions that cause some of the problems in the first place. When locomotives burned forests, people changed the mechanics of trains—they didn’t reevaluate the long-term viability of rail. The need to move thousands of tons of lumber and coal and food and passengers at high speeds through forest and prairie and desert did not come into question. It’s easier to find a quick fix than it is to change culture. Some biologists contend that our brains did not evolve to conceive of the long-term consequences of our choices; that we are not primed to master deep time but to put out small fires⁠, if you will. Yet it appears we have also evolved to comprehend the far future, if only in flashes. We operate, Pyne writes, “not according to strict evolutionary selection but in the realm of culture, which is to say, of choice and confusion.” The night our neighborhood went up in smoke, I was 2,000 miles away. I sat on the floor and held a phone to my ear while my father described our mountain, burning. I gathered the things I had taken from my childhood bedroom around me like talismans and I imagined the world in flames. My house survived the fire because the volunteer fire chief, who drove up his street in a fire truck and saw his own house burning, had the presence of mind to keep moving, to keep working to save what remained. He or another volunteer doused the flames that devoured a pile of railroad ties in our yard, flames that could have laddered up our brush hill and laced fingers through the railings of the porch. Eventually, the scientists say, wildfires in the western United States might dwindle. This could happen when precipitation withers to the point that vegetation doesn’t come back. The fires will end when there is nothing more to burn. Cassie and I would like to choose a world in which there is a lot left to lose—we would prefer to protect our mountain homes, not to mention our larger communities and the global climate, and direct our lives in ways that will save what we love. Others would, too. Last October somebody put up signs in Sonoma that said, “The Love in the Air Is Thicker Than the Smoke.” For those of us living in the path of wildfire, we have come to understand that we must live with it, that no quick solution awaits us, that changing the ways we think and being open to new ways of living might protect our communities. Pyne writes that fire as we know it is “largely the outcome of what this creature has done, and not done.” Humans have changed fire, and fire will change us, one way or another. We can try to choose the way. Maybe this means smarter technology, already in the works. Maybe it means making new relationships with fire, making fire a tool, listening to the people who understand fire when it’s time to rebuild and then rebuilding in different ways, or even in different places. The scientists say we can choose to accept wildfire as “as an inevitable catalyst of change,” and we can adapt. Here, in a nation that currently suppresses 95 percent of all wildfires, at great cost and with questionable efficacy, it might be best to focus more on guiding the way fire burns. Communities can put more resources into controlled burns—more than 99 percent of which stay within selected boundaries—and teach the public about their benefit. Local governments can help educate and support landowners in fuel removal and property protection. And both residents and developers can think carefully before they build farther into wilderness, which is, after all, fire’s country. And yet it’s hard to work to change more than the technology—to change ourselves in order to accommodate and support these adaptations. It’s easy instead to slip back into life as we know it, to forget what a new era may ask of us, even when the stakes are very high. “Despite the fact that I feel very passionately about a lot of these issues, and they impact me personally, I don’t think about it day to day,” Cassie said. “At all. Ever.” And neither do I. This is life, the slow build of the wind on the Pacific, the heave of power over our heads.","Human technologies, especially power lines, are responsible for more loss from fire than any other cause.

JULIA MOSKIN,"Happy Monday. Sam is off the grid this week, and I’ve got his megaphone. So even though it’s a fact that kids in Oakland, Boulder, Milwaukee and Albuquerque head back to school today, I hereby declare that summer isn’t over yet. Around here, local corn is just arriving. There’s still time to have the binges that make seasonal eating worth it: the luxury of getting sick of ripe tomatoes and corn, peaches and blackberries. First, we have to eat our fill of the plain and lovely taste of corn (via corn on the cob, creamed corn, corn fritters for dinner with slab bacon and a heavily herbed tomato salad). Then corn’s friends can be invited over: ingredients like lime, mint, pancetta, scallions and shrimp that set off its sweet flavor without overwhelming it. Melissa Clark is on the case this week with a dinner-ready soup (above) — not so much a corn chowder as a brightened bowl of pozole verde, loosely based on the Mexican classic. She uses fresh corn instead of dried hominy, and seafood instead of pork, having twisted the arm of the chef Jose Salazar of Mita’s in Cincinnati to acquire the secrets of his famous version. He also roasts the tomatillos and green chiles before puréeing them into the broth, which tames their heat and acid and adds a smoky note. At this point in the summer you may have run through your grill’s greatest hits and be looking around for other tunes to play. With arugula and tomatoes, David Tanis has built a quick summer dinner around your new favorite steak, a neat thick slice of lamb leg with a bone in the center. Lamb is particularly delicious when grilled — the fat, in particular — and more easily cooked to your preferred doneness. (In some parts of the world, like the borough of Queens and the Pamir Mountains of Central Asia, grilled lamb fat is a delicacy in and of itself.) With September in sight, now is the time to fulfill those cooking — or non-cooking — fantasies you’ve harbored all year. Have tomato sandwiches for dinner. Search out the slightly bruised, much cheaper late fruit at a local orchard and make this the year of jam. Try eating vegan for a week — if not now, when? Stock up on homemade granola — exactly the same kind they hand you on your way out of dinner at Eleven Madison Park, one of the best restaurants in the world.

Trent Magill,"Top Stories KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) - As an arctic blast makes its way into East Tennessee, some parts of the region won't see temperatures above freezing for four days or more beginning Saturday morning. Our winter forecast months ago was hinting at a harsh start to the winter season. That's been playing out all December and it's ramping up even more as we roll into the New Year. The best news about this next Arctic blast coming to East Tennessee is that it's a dry blast. Any snow should be light with only minor accumulations. So let's talk numbers. Our record lows around the New Year are all at or below 2º. So I'm not talking about breaking records. Despite records staying untouched, it's still be something you should be preparing for. Morning lows will dip into the teens for days. We've been through that before -- last January we hit the single digits once and the teens twice. The problem this year is the duration. We'll be dipping into the teens four straight nights: Overnight Saturday through overnight Tuesday. Adding fuel to the fire (or ice to the igloo!) is the lack of a daily thaw. High temperatures will only hit the 20s and lower 30s. After Friday's lower 40s, some areas may not warm to above freezing until Tuesday. The Cumberland Plateau and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park won't see temps above freezing (32º) for four straight days. That means if pipes freeze, you may be without water for days. Do what you can to prepare for this ahead of time. And don't forget proper housing for your pets!

Dr. Andrew A. Snelling,"The Smoky Mountains offer much more than breathtaking vistas and vacation getaways. The hills resound with a symphony from the rocks, testifying to God’s creation of the world and the global Flood. When you hear the words Smoky Mountains, what images come to mind? Black bears and rustic cabins in the woods? Hillbilly Golf and funnel cakes in Gatlinburg, in eastern Tennessee? Variety shows with twangy southern music and kids in racoon hats at amusement parks like Dollywood? With over half a million acres of hardwood forests, the Great Smoky Mountains region is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the southeastern United States, famed for its backwoods culture. As a creation geologist from Australia, I didn’t hear about the Smokies until I visited the United States to do research. A fellow geologist recommended the Smokies as a good place to sample rocks for an idea I wanted to test. My goal was to verify that certain rocks in the earth’s mountain ranges formed quickly (even in weeks!), not over millions of years. In my area of expertise, I knew that within a certain mineral there are telltale byproducts if the rocks formed rapidly. I just needed to find some of that mineral in rocks that formed under the right conditions. I found myself driving down the winding two-lane Highway 441—the only paved road cutting through these mountains on the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. Other people were passing me on their way to see shops in Gatlinburg or scenic overlooks like Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the Appalachian trail, 6,643 feet (2025 m) in elevation. Meanwhile, I was pulling over at various roadcuts and waterfalls. At these locations, all the trees and soil have been cleared out of the way, exposing the underlying rocks. Geologists look at the world differently. We joke among ourselves that biology is something that covers up the good stuff, the rocks. Seriously, even if geology isn’t your calling, knowing a few basic things can transform how you view the world. You’ll never see the Smokies the same again. They’re full of evidence of God’s recent creation and the global Flood. And by the way, I had to find out that the mountains’ name does not derive from smoke from fires hanging over them. In the warmer months droplets of mist in the air, combined with vapors from resins and plant oils rising from the lush vegetation, and wisps of fog, cause the natural “smoke” that gives the Great Smokies their name. The gently swirling rise and fall of the haze under varying conditions of temperature and light produces a bluish-gray smoke effect around the summits and in the valleys. Ancient Hills? The standard evolutionary story, presented at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park visitor centers, is that these rolling hills are very ancient, eroded down to bedrock over hundreds of millions of years. They’re not like the Rockies, which rise dramatically and still have sharp edges because—we are told—they are younger and haven’t had as much time to wear down. A creationist sees these hills differently, based on the Bible. Every detail of the landscape makes sense within the Bible’s 6,000-year timeframe, from the Smokies’ broad vistas—row upon row of blue-tinted ridges stretching as far as the eye can see—down to the individual rocks and the microscopic crystals inside them. I see the same processes at work as other geologists, but I believe they occurred at a much faster pace in the past, especially during two unique events revealed in God’s Word—the six-day Creation and the yearlong Flood. The Apostle Peter says the Lord originally made the earth out of water and then “destroyed” it in a global Flood ( 2 Peter 3:6 ), forming a new world out of the raw materials, including mountain chains we see today. You just have to know what you’re looking for. Here’s a basic geology term— metamorphic rocks. You first came across it in a science class that you have possibly forgotten if your teacher didn’t connect such terms to reality. Geologists believe that the Appalachian Mountain chain (which includes the Smokies) consists of sandy ocean sediments about ten miles thick that were transformed when Africa’s tectonic plate moved northward and rammed into the southeastern edge of North America. That hammer blow “crumpled” up the sediments to form the Appalachians. The heat and pressure caused by smashing up these rocks changed (“metamorphosed”) the mineral compositions of the rocks. It’s like the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly—the rocks are changed. That’s why we call them “metamorphic rocks.” As I drive through these mountains, I envision the massive earth-shaping events that laid down all this sandy material and then reshaped it when continents collided during the Flood. Like other creation geologists, I believe the original earth was a single supercontinent that broke into tectonic plates during the Flood, and then these pieces moved around rapidly, smashing into each other before slowing down to a crawl in their current locations. If this is a correct interpretation of the evidence, the earth’s great mountain chains resulted from catastrophic forces unleashed during the Flood. Yet each mountain chain has its own special story, depending on its unique circumstances. The evidence indicates that sediment layers making up the Appalachians formed early in the Flood, and the Appalachian Mountains formed soon after. The powerful currents that circled the globe (from east to west) then shaved several miles of rock material off the top of this chain, exposing the deep layers we see today. That’s what I see when I visit the Smokies! They aren’t reminders of God’s creation, but of a worldwide judgment that produced “beauty out of ashes” (see Isaiah 61:3 ). When Continents Collide The bulk of the Smokies consists of rocks made of sand (sandstone) that was changed under pressure by colliding continents. Forces in some places were more intense than in others. I was looking for just the right place where the combination of temperature, pressure, and water would have produced the telltale markers of rapid transformation. I don’t expect you to get excited about the details of rocks and my experiment. Yet any Christian can get excited about seeing evidence of the great power that God displayed during the Flood and then telling others what God has done. As you drive along Highway 441, you can easily imagine several miles of rock above your head as it is squished between two colliding continents, and then roaring ocean currents scrape off the top layers. You can also imagine how the impact produced the ridges we can see today. The rocks themselves are interesting, however. They’re basically made of sands, which compose the lowest sediment layers in the local geologic column (known as Precambrian). The rocks below them are known as “bedrock”—they are made of earlier sediments that were intensely metamorphosed when molten material rose from deep in the earth and hardened. At Grand Canyon, you must descend a mile into the canyon to see these lower layers. But at the Smokies, you drive over the mountains to see them. How is this? When the African plate crashed into North America, it pushed up the lower layers. You could never see these lower layers unless some extraordinary earth movement pushed them upward (or a canyon was cut deep into the earth like at Grand Canyon). The map below shows the places I stopped to take rock samples. First Stop: Granites If you start your trip in Cherokee, North Carolina, you see “basement” rocks all around you. I took some samples just to contrast their minerals with the sandstone that I would find higher up. These rocks form the foundation on which all the other strata have been deposited. While we cannot be certain about the details, it is apparent from the description in Genesis 1 that on Day Three of the Creation Week there was a tremendous geological upheaval. God uplifted rocky materials from under the universal ocean of the first two days of Creation Week to form the dry land surface on which he then created the plants. As he gathered the waters together in one place, he may well have gathered the emerging land surface into one place to make a supercontinent. Those rocks would have been folded and metamorphosed under pressure and elevated temperatures, accompanied by volcanic activity and molten rocks during this “Great Upheaval.” Second Stop: Sandstone under Heat and Pressure The next stops were the focus of my study (see map). I wanted to visit the places where the crashing continents crumpled the sandy layers and the pressure was most intense. As I stated earlier, it is estimated that nearly ten miles of fine- to coarse-grained sandstones were deposited on top of the basement rocks. That’s layers of nothing but sandstone between 25,000 and 50,000 feet thick. By far the thickest and most massive and prominent portion of these formations is the Thunderhead Sandstone, which is exposed in numerous roadcuts and waterfalls. Where did all this sand come from? During the “Great Upheaval” on Day Three of the Creation Week, as the earlier rocks were brought together and uplifted to form the original supercontinent and then rose above the ocean waters, the water running off that supercontinent may have heavily eroded the emerging rocks. Enormous volumes of ground-up particles would have been swept away and deposited as sediments at the margins of the exposed supercontinent. Sedimentation would have continued, but at a much slower rate, until the Flood. When the Flood began, that supercontinent was torn apart as the fountains of the great deep broke up ( Genesis 7:11 ). As the continental fragments (plates) then “sprinted” across the globe it was inevitable some would collide with one another. Thus, Africa collided with North America. This brief union of Africa and North America during the Flood formed a temporary supercontinent known as Pangaea. This lasted no more than a month or so (and most of it would have been underwater). The Smokies became the crest of a great mountain belt that stretched across Pangaea. These rocks were metamorphosed. Depending on their location, the rocks display varying minerals that reflect different degrees of heat and pressure and different amounts of produced water. If I found the right place, I predicted that I would find the mineral in the rocks that, under a microscope, would have a combination of traits that wouldn’t be like those in any other rocks. The science is complicated, and it’s not the main point here. (I’ve covered it in previous articles in this magazine and in our Answers Research Journal —search for my name and “polonium radiohalos.”) The tiny mineral I was looking for is called biotite (the dark, shiny specks you often see in granite countertops). If the temperature was too high, the “markers” I was looking for would have faded away, or if the temperature and water flow through the minerals in the rocks were too low, the markers wouldn’t even get produced. Guess what. I found what I was looking for! These markers had to form in just days, not millions of years. Here’s a shorthand version of what happened. Radioactive uranium occurs in certain minerals in some rocks. As it decays, it produces another short-lived radioactive element (polonium) that leaves telltale blotches (radiohalos) in biotite flakes when it decays. These blotches could only occur during a short window of time (a matter of weeks) under just the right conditions, when the cooling rocks were hot enough to cause a particular reaction but not too hot to destroy the evidence. You’ll need to read the other articles for the details. But the exciting truth is that these mountains declare the glory of God—consistent with Scripture—whether you consider the large-scale rolling hills or each tiny mineral under a microscope. Third Stop: The Mountaintops The rapid movement of continental plates lasted only a brief time. The rocks eventually cooled, and the rare chemical changes ceased. Powerful ocean currents then swept away the deposits on top of these sandstones (so later geologists could find them!). As I drove to my final stops beyond the crest of the mountain chain to take samples, I didn’t expect to find the markers that I had found earlier. And those final samples matched my predictions, too. When I was finished, I visited some of the popular scenic spots along the crest—Newfound Gap and Clingmans Dome. I looked out over the rolling hills and marveled at the evidence of what my Creator and Judge has done. Today the only force shaping the Great Smoky Mountains landscape is the slow action of rain, wind, chemical weathering, and streams. Thankfully, God has kept his promise never again to send an earth-destroying catastrophe like the one-time Flood ( Genesis 9:11 ). The evidence is all around us, if we have the faith in God to build our understanding on the solid rock of his Word. Such awe-inspiring vistas should bring to our lips the words of the psalmist, King David, “ O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! ” and cause us to meditate on his exclamation, “ What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? ” ( Psalm 8:1, 4, 9 ). Dr. Andrew A. Snelling holds a PhD in geology from the University of Sydney and has worked as a consultant research geologist in both Australia and the US. Author of numerous scientific articles, Dr. Snelling is now director of research at Answers in Genesis–US.","The Smoky Mountains offer

Sara Ventiera,"No mode of travel is more American than the road trip. It’s basically a national rite of passage. Dating back to Model T days, folks have been hitting the wide open road to explore every nook and cranny of the 3,000 miles that lie between sea to shining sea. From mountain roads with hairpin turns to stunning seaside escapes to good ol’ Americana history, here are epic five road trips through the United States. 1. Overseas Highway: Florida This appropriately titled highway crosses over the turquoise waters that separate the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico with a series of 42 bridges including the iconic Seven Mile, which hovers over Pigeon Key. However, the incredible cerulean panoramas aren’t the only sight worth seeing on this 100-mile journey: the road is lined with palms and native flora, retro motels, shell shops and an impressive array of fauna (including the Key’s small namesake deer). The drive takes about four hours roundtrip starting from Florida City. Make it a longer vacation by starting the trip in Miami, then stopping by Homestead for a trip to the Everglades National Park, Knaus Berry Farm (in season) for cinnamon rolls and the Robert is Here fruit stand for tropical provisions and smoothies, before slowly meandering down the coral cay archipelago to Key West. (Photo by felixmizioznikov/Getty Images) 2. Route 66: Illinois to California In the 1940s and 50s, the 2,500-mile stretch of road from Chicago to Santa Monica, California, was the American road trip. That changed with the development of the interstate system, which rerouted large portions of the highway to larger interstates. Even so, tourists from around the globe still follow the famous path (or at least sections of it) past vintage neon signs, retro roadside motels, multiple national parks including the Petrified Forest and the Grand Canyon, as well as kitschy Americana stops such as the World’s Largest Catsup Bottle in Collinsville, Illinois, and cool art installations such as Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas, a 12-minute drive from the killer brisket at Tyler’s Barbecue. The section of road that lies next to I-40 through New Mexico and Arizona is particularly picturesque. (Photo by Ann Kathrin- Boppv/Unsplash) 3. Pacific Coast Highway: California to Washington There’s a big debate on the official start and end point of the PCH. Some say it runs down Highway One from Mendocino County in the north to Orange County in the south. Others say it runs the length of the entire West Coast. According to the California Department of Transportation, the highway officially starts at Dana Point in Orange County and stops in Oxnard. Intrepid road trippers should drive the whole damn road. The 1,650-miles from San Diego to Olympia National Park in Washington passes through a range of ecosystems, including rainforests, deserts and dramatic cliffs hanging over the churning Pacific. And there’s no better time than the present: The entire highway reopened to drivers in Fall 2017 after an eight-month shut down of the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge near the Big Sur coast, a must-see destination on any coastal Cali road trip. (Photo by @kmarinelli via Twenty20) 4. Blue Ridge Parkway: Virginia &amp; North Carolina Spanning 469 miles from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina, this stunning parkway winds its way through the forested peaks that belong to some of the oldest mountains in the world. The area is lush and green through the spring and summer months, but the road is most spectacular in autumn, when the rolling landscape is painted with fiery shades of red, yellow and orange, usually at its crest late-October to mid-November. Make sure to plan a stop in Asheville along the way: The mountain town is considered one of the top food and craft beer destinations in the Southeast. (Photo by jaredkay/Getty Images) 5. Route 89: Arizona, Utah, Wyoming &amp; Montana Far less famous than Route 66 but just as gorgeous, Route 89 is sometimes called the National Park to Park Highway. Truly ambitious road warriors can take the road less traveled by starting in Arizona, moving through Utah and up to Wyoming and Montana. The highway passes 150 towns, cities and reservations (the dining and culture component of the trip), seven national parks (including the Grand Canyon, Glacier and Yellowstone) and three giant geographic regions (Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau and the Rockies). While going from border to border would certainly reach bucket list status, a shorter Jackson Hole-Grand Teton-Yellowstone-Glacier National Park trip could still make for an unforgettable expedition.

That smoke came from almost 3,000 miles away in Butte County, wafting across the continental United States to end up on the East Coast. The Camp Fire, which began on Nov. 8, has burned 151,373 acres, destroyed 12,637 residences and killed at least 79 people. It is now 70 percent contained. News outlets and residents from Salt Lake City to Philadelphia to New York City reported smoky skies Monday. ""Map shows haze in Philly came from California wildfire smoke"" read one headline. ""Smoke from California wildfires could carry across country to Dallas,"" predicted another. ""Wow. I knew tonight's sunset over New York City seemed different, and I should've realized,"" tweeted ""Today Show"" meteorologist Kathryn Prociv.

On Friday, San Francisco's air quality index hit 271, an unhealthy range for all individuals. Despite much closer wildfires last year, the Camp Fire's smoke was worse in the Bay Area due to a few factors. Offshore winds from the Sacramento Valley flooded the Bay Area with smoke, which then stagnated near the coastal mountains. The only avenue for exiting smoke is the Golden Gate, which is too narrow an opening to clear the region. In addition, a high-pressure system over the area is keeping the usual ocean breezes from freshening San Francisco. Things should be changing shortly, however.

Reuters,"Growing wildfires chewing through parts of Southern California on Friday ravaged avocado farms, racehorse stables and a retirement community, even as milder weather aided firefighters in their efforts to slow the progress of six major blazes. Forecasters predicted weather would continue to challenge the 8,700 firefighters who have been battling fast-moving blazes for five days from the San Diego area up the Pacific Coast to Santa Barbara County. The fires killed at least one person, destroyed 500 structures, hurt six people and injured four firefighters. At the peak, about 212,000 people were forced to flee their homes. Evacuation orders were lifted in some areas, welcome news for many in shelters waiting to see if their homes survived. “The weather moderated today and the milder winds allowed for an increase in the number of both helicopters and air tankers that could safely complete mission dropping water and fire retardant, as well as conducting reconnaissance tasks,” the Ventura County Fire Department said on its website on Friday evening. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday issued a federal emergency declaration for California, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security to coordinate relief efforts. A 70-year-old woman died in a car crash on Wednesday with smoke inhalation and burns along an evacuation route in Santa Paula, the Ventura County Star newspaper reported, citing medical examiner Christopher Young. Two of the most dangerous fires, in Ventura County and San Diego County, were zero to 10 % contained, the CAL FIRE agency reported. Billions of dollars in property is at risk. A joint weather forecast by firefighting agencies said temperatures would remain “well above normal for the foreseeable future.” Winds were expected to continue, peaking in strength on Sunday then becoming much lighter on Monday. “Ongoing fires may see significant growth on Sunday,” it said. North of San Diego, the Lilac Fire swelled from 10 acres to 4,100 acres (1,659 hectares) in a few hours on Thursday, prompting Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for San Diego County. The fire destroyed 65 structures. Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards, burned, and homes were destroyed in its Rancho Monserate Country Club retirement community. Blazes approached the Camp Pendleton marine base. A 500-stall stable for thoroughbred race horses at San Luis Rey Downs training site burned late on Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported. An estimated 25 to 30 horses died, in addition to 29 horses killed in Los Angeles earlier in the week. A trainer suffered second- and third-degree burns over half her body trying to rescue horses, the newspaper said. She was airlifted to a San Diego hospital and placed in a medically induced coma. Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, a racetrack in a beachside community north of San Diego, said it was providing refuge for more than 900 animals, mostly horses as well as some goats and pigs. A horse hospital was being opened on Friday. On Twitter, animal lovers sought to reunite lost dogs with their owners and posted pleas for residents in the Los Angeles area to put out water for wild animals fleeing the fires. The wildfires forced producers of commercials, television shows and even student films to pause or seek alternate shooting locations. The Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday suspended permitted filming in zones near the fires as well as other areas deemed to be at severe risk of burning. Applications for filming in the Angeles National Forest were also halted this week. Smoke visible from space The largest of the blazes, known as the Thomas Fire, was in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles, and has charred 143,000 acres (57,870 hectares) and destroyed 439 structures, officials said. More than 2,600 firefighters from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Nevada, made progress against the blaze with 10 percent contained, up from 5 percent on Thursday. A huge plume of smoke flared from the fire in the Ventura County mountains on Friday and was visible on satellite images, the National Weather Service said. Astronauts have captured images showing the wildfires' smoke visible from space, and the National Weather Service said visibility was being affected in the San Francisco area. The Santa Ana winds, which blow hot and dry across Southern California to the Pacific, eased up on Friday, ranging from 5 miles per hour (8 km per hour) to 35 mph (56 kph). That turned out to be a mixed blessing for firefighters because the lingering smoke limited the use of water-dropping aircraft. “No wind is good because it decreases the fire activity but if its too smoky to drive and see where youre going, its too smoky to fly,” Clark said. Some 86,000 homes were at risk in the three large fires in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, according to CoreLogic Inc a California-based risk analysis firm, with reconstruction possibly totaling $27.7 billion. California is still recovering from wildfires in the northern part of the state that resulted in insured losses of more than $9 billion in October. Those fires, which were concentrated in California's wine country, killed 43 people.","Donald Trump on Friday issued a federal emergency declaration for California, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security to coordinate relief efforts.",2017-12-09T04:15:50Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Weather eases the battle as California wildfires grow,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/weather-eases-the-battle-as-california-wildfires-grow/article21378437.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article21378436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PICTURESOFTHEWEEKPHOTOGALLERY,the-hindu,The Hindu,Smoky Mountains,1
Megan Barber,"There's never been a better time visit a National Park It’s officially travel season, which means millions of Americans from all over will be headed to the country’s national parks to see some of the most beautiful places in the U.S. The National Park Service has seen a record number of visitors at parks the past few years, and this summer you can expect big attendance numbers at popular parks like the Great Smoky Mountains, the Grand Canyon, or Yellowstone. There's also no better time to support our national parks. The National Park Service views itself as a place for education, a ""laboratory"" for good science and for ""educating the public about how climate change affects us by impacting places we care about."" To help you plan a potential vacation to these truly gorgeous places —you can also support the parks in other ways —we've rounded up hotels and resorts near nine of America’s most beloved parks. It’s true that some visitors camp or backpack on the plethora of park trails. But most park-goers see nature’s wonders from the comfort of their car and return to a hotel or lodge at night, although it’s good to book as early as possible since hotels full up quickly. We’ve chosen an array of top-notch lodging options from which to base your explorations, with an emphasis on unique architecture and proximity to the park. From seaside cabins to grand lodges built on the edge of the Grand Canyon, there’s something for everyone. Behold, the absolute best places to stay near America’s most beautiful national parks. 1. If you’re visiting Rocky Mountain National Park... Shutterstock Sprague Lake at Rocky Mountain National Park The most popular national park in Colorado is also one of the nation’s busiest, but don’t let that deter you from exploring Rocky Mountain’s abundant hiking. From taking the easy walk to Sprague Lake to admiring some of the 60 mountains that are taller than 12,000 feet, this park provides gorgeous scenery just two hours from Denver. Stay at the Stanley Hotel. Wikicommons The Stanley Hotel Located in Estes Park, Colorado approximately five miles from the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, the 140-room, Colonial Revival Stanley Hotel was originally built in 1909. Allegedly haunted and best known today for its inspirational role in Stephen King’s novel, ""The Shining,"" the family-friendly Stanley provides gorgeous views and plenty of antique kitsch. 2. If you’re visiting Glacier National Park... Shutterstock Hidden Lake trail on Logan Pass in Glacier National Park. Called the Crown of the Continent, Glacier National Park in Montana is the headwaters for streams that flow to the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and to Hudson’s Bay. It’s also simply stunning. Don’t miss the quintessential Going-to-the-Sun Road that connects the east and west sides of the park, and other top spots like Lake McDonald and Many Glacier. Stay at the Snow Bear Chalets. All photos courtesy of Snow Bear Chalets Located at Whitefish Mountain Resort, the Snow Bear Chalets at tree houses set in a beautiful forest. If your idea of a great vacation includes both restaurants and unique architecture, consider Snow Bear Chalets near Whitefish, Montana. Located about 25 miles from Glacier National Park, the chalets are tree houses standing tall in the forest. With easy access to hiking and mountain biking on your doorstep, restaurants ten minutes down the hill in the town of Whitefish, and the national park an easy drive away for day trips, the luxury chalets provide an ideal getaway. Read more over here, or check out their sister property —a four bedroom house on the west side of Lake McDonald inside Glacier National Park. 3. If you’re visiting the Grand Canyon... Shutterstock Kaibab Trail in Grand Canyon National Park As one of the most popular national parks in the United States, most Americans recognize the Grand Canyon’s steep walls and otherworldly coloring. If you’re looking for photo opportunities, head to the South Kaibab Trail in Arizona on the south rim. It follows a ridge out to Skeleton Point and earns you 360-degree views of the canyon. Stay at El Tovar. Wikicommons El Tovar The Charles Whittlesley-designed El Tovar Hotel was built in 1905 and is located directly on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. While it’s no longer the most elegant hotel west of the Mississippi, the 78-room El Tovar is one of the prettiest of the national park lodges and serves as a top-notch base to explore the park. 4. If you’re visiting the Great Smoky Mountains... Shutterstock Spring sunrise in Great Smoky National Park The Great Smoky Mountains offers an abundance of hikes, wildlife, and rivers and is the most visited park in America. Located along the Tennessee and North Carolina border, this part of the Appalachian Mountains provides jaw-dropping vistas and a photogenic morning fog that gives the region its nickname. Stay at Blackberry Farm. Photo by beall + thomas photography Blackberry Farm Blackberry Farm sits at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains in eastern Tennessee and lives up to its name: the hotel offers up seasonal produce, an on-site creamery, a bakery, and a charcuterie program. With an award-winning dining program and on-point accommodations, Blackberry Farm provides a luxurious base to explore the nearby national park. 5. If you’re visiting Yosemite National Park... Shutterstock Yosemite National Park Protected since 1864, Yosemite is best known for countless number of waterfalls in its nearly 1,200 square miles. But you’ll also find picturesque valleys, expansive meadows, and giant sequoias. As one of our prettiest parks in the country, Yosemite never disappoints. Stay at the Majestic Yosemite Hotel. Courtesy of Majestic Yosemite Hotel Majestic Yosemite Hotel Formerly called the Ahwahnee, the Majestic is located inside the national park on the valley floor and has been serving park visitors since 1927. It’s Yosemite’s only AAA® Four-Diamond hotel and boasts views of Half Dome, Glacier Point, and Yosemite Falls. Don’t miss the year-round heated outdoor pool, the solarium, and the afternoon tea service. 6. If you’re visiting Yellowstone National Park : Shutterstock The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park The world’s first national park is also one of its most unusual; colorful hot springs, mudpots, and geysers can make visitors feel like they are on another planet, not in Wyoming. But all the crowds of people visiting Yellowstone are on to something. If you can brave the numbers, this is one of the best parks around. Stay at the Old Faithful Inn. Wikicommons The Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park Sure, some aspects of the 327-room Old Faithful Inn need a bit of updating. But there’s a reason this national historic landmark located inside Yellowstone is the park’s most requested lodging facility: The 1904 structure is considered the largest log structure in the world and set the standard for national park architecture. Throw in the massive stone fireplace and ideal park location, and the Old Faithful is an easy choice. 7. If you’re visiting Zion National Park... Shutterstock Zion National Park While other national parks are full of pine forests or massive redwoods, Zion National Park is unique. Massive sandstone cliffs rise from the base of valleys and paint the landscape in pinks, oranges, and red. Explore the narrow slot canyons and marvel at just how blue the skies look in the Utah landscape. Stay at Zion Lodge. Courtesy of Zion Lodge Zion Lodge in Zion National Park Serving as the only in-park lodging in Zion, Zion Lodge was designed in 1924 and maintains its rustic quality. But the location in Zion is first rate; the canyon’s gorgeous views surround the lodge, trailheads aren’t far, and guests are allowed to drive their cars into the park year-round. 8. If you’re visiting Olympic National Park : Shutterstock Sea stacks on the Wild Rialto Beach in Olympic National Park Olympic Park just might be one of the most diverse national parks in the country, especially given its vast size. The park boasts nearly a million acres in Washington state ranging from glacier-capped mountains, old-growth temperate forests, and 70 miles of photo-worthy coastline. Stay at the Kalaloch Lodge. Courtesy of the Kalaloch Lodge The Kalaloch Lodge If you’re looking to get away from it all, you can’t beat Kalaloch Lodge. It’s the only coastal lodge along a 73-mile stretch of Olympic National Park, lacks Wi-Fi access, and sits on a remote bluff overlooking the ocean. Comb the beach for seashells and be on the lookout for 30-foot gray whales every March and April. 9. If you’re visiting Grand Teton National Park... Shutterstock Grand Teton National Park With some of the most impressive alpine views in the country, Grand Teton isn’t lacking beauty. Lakes sit at the base of the mountains and the Snake River provides a gorgeous backdrop for fishing or a lazy float trip. Don’t miss the sunsets, when the entire sky comes alive. Stay at Jenny Lake Lodge. Courtesy of Jenny Lake Lodge Jenny Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park Located inside of Grand Teton National Park and not far from the base of the Teton Range, Jenny Lake Lodge is close to its namesake lake and charming as can be. As the only 4-diamond ""eco-resort"" in the park, Jenny Lake Lodge also offers both delicious dining and an ideal base to explore everything the Grand Tetons have to offer. 10. If you’re visiting Acadia National Park... Shutterstock The Bass Harbor Lighthouse in Acadia National Park Home to the tallest mountain on the U.S. Atlantic coast, the 35,000-acre Acadia National Park is the perfect stopover for those looking to explore Maine’s rugged seaboard. Try exploring the granite peaks and or take the opportunity to bike on the park’s old carriage roads. Stay at the Bar Harbor Inn. Courtesy of the Bar Harbor Inn The Bar Harbor Inn There are no hotels or lodges in Acadia National Park, but the small towns near the park offer a wide range of hotels and places to stay. Our pick is the Bar Harbor Inn, a waterfront hotel that overlooks Frenchman Bay and provides easy access to Acadia. Upscale amenities like a pool, terrace, and gas fireplaces make the nineteenth century hotel a luxurious spot to relax after a day of hiking.","To help you plan a potential visit to some of the most beautiful spots in the U.S., we’ve rounded up the best hotels and resorts near 10 beloved parks.",2018-05-16T17:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Curbed.com'}",Where to stay near 10 of America's best National Parks,https://www.curbed.com/2016/7/8/12123252/where-to-stay-national-park-best-hotels,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yASOx3c_46V4ZGRQD6RvgJ2vPwQ=/0x274:3877x2304/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10842079/shutterstock_220731535.0.0.jpg,,Curbed.com,Smoky Mountains,0
Andy Perdue,"Adelsheim Vineyard is one of nearly 100 global wineries featured in this year’s International Pinot Noir Celebration in McMinnville, Oregon. MORE THAN 45 years ago, David Adelsheim arrived in Oregon’s Willamette Valley and began planting wine grapes. He started with a 19-acre piece of land near the town of Newberg, in what is now the Chehalem Mountains American Viticultural Area. He didn’t choose this spot for any particular reason. And like many Oregon wine pioneers, he planted and sourced fruit from throughout the large valley that stretches from the Columbia River in the north clear down to Eugene. Since launching his eponymous winery in 1978 (there were just 10 wineries in Oregon then), the focus has been on crafting wines from the broader Willamette Valley. In the past three years, Adelsheim has begun to reshape his focus, returning to his roots in a way by sharpening his efforts on fruit solely from the Chehalem Mountains. Here are three Adelsheim Vineyard wines, all using grapes from the Chehalem Mountains. Adelsheim wines have good distribution, so ask for them at your favorite wine shop, or order directly from the winery. Adelsheim Vineyard 2015 Staking Claim Chardonnay, Chehalem Mountains, $40 : Aromas of kiwi, pineapple, star fruit and Golden Delicious apple, followed by flavors of firm orchard fruit and ripe pear, crisp acidity, savory mouth feel, mild smoky oak. Adelsheim Vineyard 2016 Bryan Creek Pinot Blanc, Chehalem Mountains, $25 : Bright, crisp aromas of Granny Smith apples, Asian pear and honeydew melon, followed by racy flavors of ripe pear, pineapple, kiwi and crisp apple. Bright and focused through the finish. Adelsheim Vineyard 2015 Breaking Ground Pinot Noir, Chehalem Mountains, $45 : Gorgeous blueberry and purple fruit, hint of sage, smoky oak, cocoa powder, smooth entry with notes of plum, blueberry, dark chocolate and smoked meat. Sometimes, being a pioneer means returning to where it all began, and that is kind of what Adelsheim is doing, seeing it as his duty to help define the wines coming from the Chehalem Mountains. Of the six small appellations that subdivide the northern Willamette Valley, the Chehalem Mountains is the largest, at more than 100 square miles, with about 1,100 acres of vineyards and 80 wineries and vineyards. It’s also home to the Ribbon Ridge AVA, which features highly sought-after pinot noir grapes. The federal government recognized the Chehalem Mountains as a grape-growing region in 2006. There are three soil types and different elevations mixed into this region. Pinot noir, more than any grape variety, is transparent, revealing its greatness based on the location of where it is grown. This model works in its ancestral home in France’s Burgundy, and it works in Oregon, where the industry’s pioneers continue to refine its style. In the case of the Chehalem Mountains, the emerging profile would seem to be purity of fruit that results in seductive wines. Adelsheim Vineyard is one of nearly 100 wineries from around the world featured in this year’s International Pinot Noir Celebration, July 27-29, in McMinnville, Oregon.","Adelsheim Vineyard is one of nearly 100 global wineries featured in this year’s International Pinot Noir Celebration in McMinnville, Oregon.",2018-07-18T14:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Seattletimes.com'}",David Adelsheim helps define the wines of the Chehalem Mountains,https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/david-adelsheim-helps-define-the-wines-of-the-chehalem-mountains/,https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9cb8f1de-7b2e-11e8-b461-552e583f17d0-1200x630.jpg,,Seattletimes.com,Smoky Mountains,1

Unfortunately, whoever took black spray paint to the Colorado National Monument last month apparently didn't get the memo, and the National Park Service is trying to find the vandal responsible. A local who lives nearby was the first to report the damage caused by the ""promposal"" — a term ascribed to a creative invitation to a high school prom — on May 23. On Saturday, the monument posted a few photos of the vandalism on Facebook, asking followers to contact the park's visitor center with any information. RELATED: Graffiti in national parks sparks debate The park tries to take care of any vandalism within 24 hours of receiving a report, as Ranger Operations Supervisor for the city of Boulder Geoff Jasper told local Fox31. The process is ""meticulous,"" so as to not degrade the natural features of the park. ""We know that most people come here and visit the parks because of their natural beauty, or habitat or the natural qualities that the park has,"" Jasper said, ""and then seeing something like graffiti or vandalism, it really detracts away from the beauty of the park."" RELATED: No easy solution to vandalism in parks, playgrounds The potential punishment for such vandalism is steep — it can include a $5,000 fine and up to six months in prison — but in this case, the park rangers are willing to be ""more lenient"" if the vandal turns himself or herself in. The Colorado National Monument asks anyone with information about the vandalism to call 970-858-3617 ext. 360. Alyssa Pereira is an SFGATE staff writer.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | Ventura | Published: December 9, 2017 12:12 pm Ventura policemen rush to check a home in a burning neighborhood as strong winds carry a wildfire into Ventura, California, U.S. on December 5, 2017 (REUTERS/File Photo) Growing wildfires chewing through parts of Southern California on Friday ravaged avocado farms, racehorse stables and a retirement community, even as milder weather aided firefighters in their efforts to slow the progress of six major blazes. Forecasters predicted weather would continue to challenge the 8,700 firefighters who have been battling fast-moving blazes for five days from the San Diego area up the Pacific Coast to Santa Barbara County. The fires killed at least one person, destroyed 500 structures, hurt six people and injured four firefighters. At the peak, about 212,000 people were forced to flee their homes. Evacuation orders were lifted in some areas, welcome news for many in shelters waiting to see if their homes survived. “The weather moderated today and the milder winds allowed for an increase in the number of both helicopters and air tankers that could safely complete mission dropping water and fire retardant, as well as conducting reconnaissance tasks,” the Ventura County Fire Department said on its website Friday evening. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday issued a federal emergency declaration for California, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security to coordinate relief efforts. A 70-year-old woman died in a car crash on Wednesday with smoke inhalation and burns along an evacuation route in Santa Paula, the Ventura County Star newspaper reported, citing medical examiner Christopher Young. Two of the most dangerous fires, in Ventura County and San Diego County, were zero to 10 percent contained, the CAL FIRE agency reported. Billions of dollars in property is at risk. A joint weather forecast by firefighting agencies said temperatures would remain “well above normal for the foreseeable future.” Winds were expected to continue, peaking in strength on Sunday then becoming much lighter on Monday. “Ongoing fires may see significant growth on Sunday,” it said. North of San Diego, the Lilac Fire swelled from 10 acres to 4,100 acres (1,659 hectares) in a few hours on Thursday, prompting Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for San Diego County. The fire destroyed 65 structures. Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards, burned, and homes were destroyed in its Rancho Monserate Country Club retirement community. Blazes approached the Camp Pendleton marine base. A 500-stall stable for thoroughbred race horses at San Luis Rey Downs training site burned late on Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported. An estimated 25 to 30 horses died, in addition to 29 horses killed in Los Angeles earlier in the week. A trainer suffered second- and third-degree burns over half her body trying to rescue horses, the newspaper said. She was airlifted to a San Diego hospital and placed in a medically induced coma. Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, a racetrack in a beachside community north of San Diego, said it was providing refuge for more than 900 animals, mostly horses as well as some goats and pigs. A horse hospital was being opened on Friday. On Twitter, animal lovers sought to reunite lost dogs with their owners and posted pleas for residents in the Los Angeles area to put out water for wild animals fleeing the fires. The wildfires forced producers of commercials, television shows and even student films to pause or seek alternate shooting locations. The Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday suspended permitted filming in zones near the fires as well as other areas deemed to be at severe risk of burning. Applications for filming in the Angeles National Forest were also halted this week. SMOKE VISIBLE FROM SPACE The largest of the blazes, known as the Thomas Fire, was in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles, and has charred 143,000 acres (57,870 hectares) and destroyed 439 structures, officials said. More than 2,600 firefighters from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Nevada, made progress against the blaze with 10 percent contained, up from 5 percent on Thursday. A huge plume of smoke flared from the fire in the Ventura County mountains on Friday and was visible on satellite images, the National Weather Service said. Astronauts have captured images showing the wildfires’ smoke visible from space, and the National Weather Service said visibility was being affected in the San Francisco area. The Santa Ana winds, which blow hot and dry across Southern California to the Pacific, eased up on Friday, ranging from 5 miles per hour (8 km per hour) to 35 mph (56 kph). That turned out to be a mixed blessing for firefighters because the lingering smoke limited the use of water-dropping aircraft. “No wind is good because it decreases the fire activity but if it’s too smoky to drive and see where you’re going, it’s too smoky to fly,” Clark said. Some 86,000 homes were at risk in the three large fires in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, according to CoreLogic Inc a California-based risk analysis firm, with reconstruction possibly totaling $27.7 billion. California is still recovering from wildfires in the northern part of the state that resulted in insured losses of more than $9 billion in October. Those fires, which were concentrated in California’s wine country, killed 43 people.

Heres a look at the best places to own a vacation rental property in 2019 according to Rented.com,&amp;nbsp; the worlds largest platform connecting owners of vacation homes with short term managers.&amp;nbsp; Consider these are short-term rentals with strong ROI for owners/investors. Rented.com's most recent report&amp;nbsp; looks at the Ultimate ROI&amp;quot; question, When buying a rental property, for investment purposes, what are the best markets?
Take a look at the five best places to own on the list which ranks 150 destinations. The results will surprise you. Youll find some affordable places, you might not have thought of. Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Panama City Beach, Florida, Killington, Vermont, and Palm Coast, Florida top the list.
The criteria pointing to short-term rental profitability include real estate prices, local vacation rental rates, insurance, taxes, maintenance expenses and the popularity of a tourist destination. The Southeast did extremely well this year, especially in non-luxury markets like the Smokey Mountains. There they have very friendly short-term rental regulations, its a four-season market and a five-hour drive from several major cities, explains Andrew McConnell, CEO of Rented.com
The take-aways I found the most interesting and where the biggest shift was is how urban destinations fell off as a good investment. A year or two ago some had the highest ROI and thats fallen dramatically, explains McConnell. Major cities like Chicago where the short-term vacation rental regs are in question brought down the popularity of urban areas as potential investments. Theres also been much controversy in Boston over short-term rentals.

Thanks to the continued growth and popularity of short-term rental options like VRBO and Airbnb, Rented.com also looks at the local climate for regulations either prohibiting or curtailing short-term rentals.
Florida came out on top of the list as the state with most destinations at 19. Surprisingly, California came in with 13 destinations, though because of high real estate prices, there werent any ranking higher than 44 on the list of 150. Texas hit the number three spot with 9 cities. Areas with a milder winter usually mean a longer tourist season.
A few things to consider before investing is simply doing your due diligence. Rented.com encourages the following: Identify opportunities in markets where asset prices are low relative to the markets attractiveness as a vacation destination. Obtain a clear and thorough understanding of necessary improvements, as well as maintenance, property tax, insurance, HOA, and other costs. Seek out markets with a strong vacation and or rental markets. Learn about the communities regulations regarding rentals properties.
Also, if the property youre looking at is a condominium, do check all condo docs for assessment history, reserves and the expected lifetime of basics like roofs and roads. Nothing hurts your pocket more than buying a property and shortly after being hit with a sizeable special assessment.

Heres a look at the best places to own a vacation rental property in 2019 according to Rented.com,  the worlds largest platform connecting owners of vacation homes with short term managers.  Consider these are short-term rentals with strong ROI for owners/investors. Rented.com's most recent report  looks at the Ultimate ROI"" question, When buying a rental property, for investment purposes, what are the best markets?
Take a look at the five best places to own on the list which ranks 150 destinations. The results will surprise you. Youll find some affordable places, you might not have thought of. Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Panama City Beach, Florida, Killington, Vermont, and Palm Coast, Florida top the list.
The criteria pointing to short-term rental profitability include real estate prices, local vacation rental rates, insurance, taxes, maintenance expenses and the popularity of a tourist destination. The Southeast did extremely well this year, especially in non-luxury markets like the Smokey Mountains. There they have very friendly short-term rental regulations, its a four-season market and a five-hour drive from several major cities, explains Andrew McConnell, CEO of Rented.com
The take-aways I found the most interesting and where the biggest shift was is how urban destinations fell off as a good investment. A year or two ago some had the highest ROI and thats fallen dramatically, explains McConnell. Major cities like Chicago where the short-term vacation rental regs are in question brought down the popularity of urban areas as potential investments. Theres also been much controversy in Boston over short-term rentals.

Thanks to the continued growth and popularity of short-term rental options like VRBO and Airbnb, Rented.com also looks at the local climate for regulations either prohibiting or curtailing short-term rentals.
Florida came out on top of the list as the state with most destinations at 19. Surprisingly, California came in with 13 destinations, though because of high real estate prices, there werent any ranking higher than 44 on the list of 150. Texas hit the number three spot with 9 cities. Areas with a milder winter usually mean a longer tourist season.
A few things to consider before investing is simply doing your due diligence. Rented.com encourages the following: Identify opportunities in markets where asset prices are low relative to the markets attractiveness as a vacation destination. Obtain a clear and thorough understanding of necessary improvements, as well as maintenance, property tax, insurance, HOA, and other costs. Seek out markets with a strong vacation and or rental markets. Learn about the communities regulations regarding rentals properties.
Also, if the property youre looking at is a condominium, do check all condo docs for assessment history, reserves and the expected lifetime of basics like roofs and roads. Nothing hurts your pocket more than buying a property and shortly after being hit with a sizeable special assessment.

It should arrive Tuesday night with winds slowly pushing out the smoke and ushering in the first of two rainstorms. “It won’t be an instantaneous clearing, but it will gradually clear as the winds pick up,” said Steven Anderson, a National Weather Service meteorologist. “By Wednesday, when the main rain comes through, any remaining particulates in the air should be gone by then.” But that means another day or two of unhealthy air conditions as the devastating Camp Fire continues to burn in Butte County, spewing smoke over much of Northern California and causing many people to avoid the outdoors. While Sunday brought moderate improvement, with some sunshine and a hint of blue sky, air quality remained in the unhealthy to very unhealthy level, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index. Since late last week, air quality readings throughout the Bay Area have mostly lingered above 150, which the EPA classifies as unhealthy regardless of medical condition. For most of the day Sunday, air quality in the Bay Area remained poor with readings exceeding 150, including 156 in San Francisco, 157 in Oakland and 155 in Berkeley. Farther east, the index hit 177 in Concord. In the North Bay, readings hit 159 in San Rafael and 177 in Vallejo. To the south, unhealthy levels of air pollution were reported in Redwood City, San Jose and Gilroy. Fine particles from the wildfire are considered hazardous. People are advised to avoid physical activity, and older people, children and those who have heart or lung disease should avoid all outdoor activity. For those trying to flee the Bay Area — either for fresh air or Thanksgiving — the smoky skies caused scads of flight delays and cancellations at San Francisco International Airport on one of the busiest flying days of the year. According to duty manager Jeff Rocheford, 175 flights had been delayed and six canceled because of smoke and haze that limited visibility. In the morning, a modicum of mist contributed to the mess. Rocheford advised patience and checking with the airlines. “Please call before coming out to the airport,” he said. Flights out of Oakland and Mineta San Jose international airports were unaffected by the hazy skies. Most Bay Area schools, many of which closed Friday because of dirty air, won’t open Monday, but mainly that’s because they had already scheduled a break for Thanksgiving week. Albany Unified School District, which closed Friday, will hold classes Monday. UC Berkeley classes were canceled for Monday and Tuesday and are to resume next week. Sunday’s air quality remained much worse nearer to the Camp Fire. In Chico, the air index jumped from 198 early Sunday morning to 253 around noon then remained around 200 in the afternoon. With winds pushing the smoke down the Central Valley, readings were unhealthy or very unhealthy in Gridley, Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto and as far south as Bakersfield. People living in much of the Bay Area may have awoken Sunday with a bit of hope, noticing slight improvement with light breezes off the ocean and a bit of early morning moisture for the first time in days. But while it was a welcome relief for some, it wasn’t yet a sign of major change, meteorologists said. “We’ve had a little bit of improvement in the Bay Area,” said Suzanne Sims, a National Weather Service meteorologist. “But things aren’t really going to change until midweek, when storms should finally clear us out.” The first of two storms could arrive in the Bay Area by late Tuesday, with a second front arriving Friday. The storms could deliver 1 to 2 inches in most of the Bay Area, a little more than 2 inches in the North Bay and 2.5 inches in the Santa Cruz Mountains. “It’s not insignificant, and it will help the air quality, definitely,” Sims said. As much as 5 inches of rain could fall in the area where the Camp Fire continues to burn near Paradise, which was decimated by the blaze that ignited Nov. 8. The fire had consumed 150,000 acres and was 65 percent contained Sunday afternoon. While rain should help extinguish the fire and clear the air, it could also bring mudslides and debris flows to the freshly denuded slopes of the Paradise, Magalia and Concow areas, which sit on mountain ridges that average 58 inches of rain per year.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | California | Published: December 9, 2017 8:05 am An aircraft drops fire retardant on the Thomas Fire, a wildfire in Fillmore, California, U.S., December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Gene Blevins Exhausted fire crews made little headway on Friday in containing the most troublesome of six major wildfires burning in Southern California as dry winds fanned flames that ravaged avocado farms, racehorse stables and a retirement community. Forecasters predicted weather would continue to challenge the 8,700 firefighters who have been battling fast-moving blazes for five days from the San Diego area up the Pacific Coast to Santa Barbara County. At least 500 structures have been destroyed, six people hurt and four firefighters injured. At the peak, about 212,000 people were forced to flee their homes. Evacuation orders were lifted in some areas, welcome news for many in shelters waiting to see if their homes survived. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday issued a federal emergency declaration for California, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security to coordinate relief efforts. Two of the most dangerous fires, in Ventura County and San Diego County, were zero to 10 percent contained, the CAL FIRE agency reported. Billions of dollars in property is at risk. “Critical fire weather is expected to continue for the next few days. Firefighters continue their aggressive firefighting!” the Ventura County Fire Department said on Twitter. A joint weather forecast by firefighting agencies said temperatures would remain “well above normal for the foreseeable future.” Winds were expected to continue, peaking in strength on Sunday then becoming much lighter on Monday. “Ongoing fires may see significant growth on Sunday,” it said. North of San Diego, the Lilac Fire swelled from 10 acres to 4,100 acres (1,659 hectares) in a few hours on Thursday, prompting Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for San Diego County. The fire destroyed 65 structures. Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards, burned, and homes were destroyed in its Rancho Monserate Country Club retirement community. Blazes approached the Camp Pendleton marine base. A 500-stall stable for thoroughbred race horses at San Luis Rey Downs training site burned late on Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported. An estimated 25 to 30 horses died, in addition to 29 horses killed in Los Angeles earlier in the week. A trainer suffered second- and third-degree burns over half her body trying to rescue horses, the newspaper said. She was airlifted to a San Diego hospital and placed in a medically induced coma. Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, a racetrack in a beachside community north of San Diego, said it was providing refuge for more than 900 animals, mostly horses as well as some goats and pigs. A horse hospital was being opened on Friday. On Twitter, animal lovers sought to reunite lost dogs with their owners and posted pleas for residents in the Los Angeles area to put out water for wild animals fleeing the fires. The wildfires forced producers of commercials, television shows and even student films to pause or seek alternate shooting locations. The Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday suspended permitted filming in zones near the fires as well as other areas deemed to be at severe risk of burning. Applications for filming in the Angeles National Forest were also halted this week. SMOKE VISIBLE FROM SPACE The largest of the blazes, known as the Thomas Fire, was in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles, and has charred 132,000 acres (53,418 hectares) and destroyed 439 structures, officials said. More than 2,600 firefighters from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Nevada, made progress against the blaze with 10 percent contained, up from 5 percent on Thursday. A huge plume of smoke flared from the fire in the Ventura County mountains on Friday and was visible on satellite images, the National Weather Service said. Astronauts have captured images showing the wildfires’ smoke visible from space, and the National Weather Service said visibility was being affected in the San Francisco area. The Santa Ana winds, which blow hot and dry across Southern California to the Pacific, eased up on Friday, ranging from 5 miles per hour (8 km per hour) to 35 mph (56 kph). That turned out to be a mixed blessing for firefighters because the lingering smoke limited the use of water-dropping aircraft. “No wind is good because it decreases the fire activity but if it’s too smoky to drive and see where you’re going, it’s too smoky to fly,” Clark said. Some 86,000 homes were at risk in the three large fires in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, according to CoreLogic Inc a California-based risk analysis firm, with reconstruction possibly totaling $27.7 billion. California is still recovering from wildfires in the northern part of the state that resulted in insured losses of more than $9 billion in October. Those fires, which were concentrated in California’s wine country, killed 43 people.

Christopher Null,"A full quartet of special mezcals from our friends at Craft Distillers, each with its own special provenance. We’ll discuss the particulars of each one in turn. Mezcalero Release #18 – “Don Valente’s masterful blend of Espadin with three wild/semi-wild agaves — Bicuishe, Madrecuishe, and Mexicano. This beauty spent 4 years in tank.” Savory, peppery, almost gamy at times, it’s very “wild” indeed. The nose is quite sharp and full of mushroom notes, with a palate heavy with notes of teriyaki beef jerky, more black pepper, and grilled portobellos. A moderate smoke pervades all of this, never quite integrating with the whole, and leading to a funky, vegetal-heavy finish. 94 proof. B- / $96 Mezcalero Release #19 – “Don Baltazar Cruz Gonzales in San Luis del Rio beautifully distills Cirial &amp; wild Espadin, then spends 2+ years in tank.” This one’s quite a bit brighter, with more citrus on the nose and on the palate. Here the smoky notes are folded well into an experience that brings together ruddy spices, forest floor, and lemongrass into a playful whole. Sunny and fresh, it is lively on the tongue but soulful on a finish that offers notes of campfire smoke, toasted marshmallows, and a squeeze of citrus juice on top of it all. Well balanced and quite refreshing. 95.6 proof. A- / $96 Mezcalero Special Bottling Release #3 – “ Genuinely special mezcal, hand-distilled in May 2015, by Rodolfo Juan Juarez in San Juan del Rio. Wild tobala (agave potatorum) is collected in the nearby mountains, whose soils contain limestone. Rested in tank for 2 years.” The nose is spicy and smoky, but the palate is gentle and fresh — absolutely full of fruit, running to apples and pears and bananas, plus a bit of cinnamon and toasty pie crust notes thrown in for good measure. On the finish, everything comes together in beautiful fashion, a celebration of sweet and smoky in perfect harmony, something like a fancy dessert at a five-star restaurant. Hard to put down, it’s the essence of what good mezcal should taste like. 97 proof. A / $135 Los Nahuales Metodo Antiguo – This is a different animal, commissioned to be produced in the fashion that was popular before regulations in 1994 changed things — namely, before ’94, the tails of a distillation run were used to bring mezcal to proof instead of water, which is now required. So here’s a throwback to those days, proofed with tails. Minimal smoke on the nose might have you wondering if this is mezcal or a standard tequila; particularly given its pungent, herbal agave notes and punches of black pepper. The smoky character is more evident on the palate, though it’s balanced by lots of sugarcane sweetness, juicy citrus, and touches of savory thyme. There’s lots going on here, which makes it all the more engaging. Though the body is slightly gummy, it’s a small ding on an otherwise well-balanced, vibrant mezcal. 104.8 proof.

Mike Gerrard,"Having recently reviewed two salted vodkas, how appropriate that next in line was a pepper vodka, albeit of the smoked jalapeño kind, known as chipotle. It’s a sweet and spicy flavor commonly used in Mexican, Tex-Mex, and Southwest cooking. This vodka, though, comes from the Pacific Northwest, Oregon to be precise.
Starting with water from the Cascade Mountains and using a corn base, each batch of the spirit is distilled and filtered six times, then infused with 38 pounds of slow-smoked jalapeños. Jalapeños aren’t the hottest peppers around, but that’s still a lot of heat.
The heat hits you on the nose first, alongside the smokiness — but there’s a vanilla sweetness in there too, a sweetness you’ll know if you have ever roasted a regular bell pepper till the skin is black and charred. There’s a touch of straw too, the dry smell of a hayfield under the summer sun.
Everything follows through on the palate, and then some. The vodka coats the whole mouth and tongue with the fiery taste of chipotle. Whether you like this or not depends on whether you like that smoky-spicy flavor. It pulls no punches with the smoky heat, and hangs on to some of the sweetness, though the presence of anything resembling straw is totally lost in the hot pepper flavors.
That intensity follows through on the finish, and after one sip, let alone a shot, you’ll know whether you like this vodka or not. Even if you do, it’s probably not a sipping vodka unless you’re happy to alternate sips of water with sips of the spirit. Mixing it with tonic or with orange juice showed its more natural place: in a cocktail. Creative mixologists will love it.

Nicole Javorsky,"Even in the awe-inspiring canyons of Yellowstone and mountains of Yosemite, the fresh air may not be so fresh: Concentrations of ozone in many U.S. national parks are similar to levels in America’s largest metropolitan areas, according to a new study in Science Advances by researchers at Iowa State University and Cornell University. Back in 1990, the biggest U.S. metro areas had higher average ozone concentrations and more exceedance days (when the EPA deems ozone levels unhealthy for sensitive groups) than national parks. But by the early 2000s, the study notes, ozone concentrations were “nearly identical” in national parks and large metro areas. In cities, average summer ozone levels decreased by more than 13 percent from 1990 to 2014. The same metric for national parks increased from 1990 to the early 2000s, but declined to 1990 levels by 2014. Average annual ozone concentrations in top 20 metros and national parks. (From Keiser et al., Science Advances, July 18, 2018. This work is licensed under CC BY-NC ) The researchers noted that these trends align with the timing of federal regulatory efforts, namely the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 (mostly focused on pollution in urban areas) and the EPA’s Regional Haze Rule (centered on national parks). The study’s authors looked at 33 national parks across the U.S., including the largest and most visited in the NPS system, such as Acadia, the Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. The 20 largest metro areas, led by New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, were selected based on 2015 population estimates. Sequoia National Park had the highest average ozone concentration of the parks studied, and its trend for exceedance days is similar to that of Los Angeles—the city with the highest ozone levels. Exceedance days at Sequoia National Park and in Los Angeles. (From Keiser et al., Science Advances, July 18, 2018. This work is licensed under CC BY-NC ) Ground-level ozone is the main ingredient in smog. It is created by chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in sunlight. Common sources of nitrogen oxides and VOC include emissions from industrial facilities and electric utilities, motor vehicle exhaust, and gasoline vapors. Ground-level ozone is different from stratospheric ozone, or “good” ozone, which appears naturally in the upper atmosphere. The study found that national parks had fewer visitors on days with poor visibility, presumably because some people followed air-quality warnings. Ozone exposure is associated with respiratory symptoms and increased hospitalization rates, and exposure during exercise worsens the effects. Although the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 expanded regulation of toxic chemicals to fight acid rain, urban air pollution, and toxic air emissions, the efforts largely centered on places where many people live. Substantive efforts to address air quality in national parks did not materialize until 1999, when the EPA created the Regional Haze Rule, which called for state and federal agencies to work together on the issue. This April, President Trump directed former EPA head Scott Pruitt to review the Regional Haze program. The rule has been controversial with some states and industry groups who cite the cost of regulation. Ivan Rudik, one of the researchers, told CityLab that about 10 percent of all park visitors since 1990 (or about 80 million people) have been exposed to ozone levels that are unhealthy for sensitive groups, including older adults, children, and individuals who have a lung disease or are exercising outside. “So pretty much everyone who goes to national parks,” he said. One of the most consequential findings, Rudik said, is that “there’s still quite a [number] of people being exposed to potentially unhealthy levels of ozone when they go to national parks.” Something to keep in mind the next time you escape the city for a dose of fresh country air.","Even at Yellowstone and Yosemite, you can’t escape from air pollution.",2018-07-19T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Citylab.com'}",Ozone Levels in Many U.S. National Parks Are Similar to Those in Large Cities,https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/07/ozone-levels-in-many-us-national-parks-are-similar-to-those-in-large-cities/565499/,https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2018/07/RTX2N86D/facebook.jpg?1531942307,,Citylab.com,Smoky Mountains,0
JONATHAN MATTISE,"GATLINBURG, Tenn. (AP) — Business owners are proceeding with new Great Smoky Mountains projects a year the area was decimated by deadly wildfires.

The cost of a seven-day pass to Grand Canyon and other popular national parks will rise to $35 per vehicle, a modest increase compared to the initially proposed $70 that would have been charged during peak times at the 17 most highly visited parks. The $5 increase, to be imposed at all national parks that charge entry fees, was instituted after the original proposal received harsh public criticism.

JONATHAN MATTISE,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Victims of deadly Tennessee wildfires that began in Great Smoky Mountains National Park are suing the federal government. The lawsuit in Knoxville was filed Wednesday by two survivors of the November 2016 Gatlinburg area fire — Michael Reed, whose wife and two daughters died, and James England, whose home burned. They seek a combined $14.8 million in damages. They blame their losses on federal parks employees violating established fire-management policies, failing to prioritize safety of citizens and property, and failing to notify and warn of threats posed by the fire. Hurricane-force winds blew embers from the park into Gatlinburg and downed power lines, sparking more fires. Fourteen people died and about 2,500 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Spokeswoman Dana Soehn said the Park Service doesn’t comment on active litigation.","KNOXVILLE, Tenn.
