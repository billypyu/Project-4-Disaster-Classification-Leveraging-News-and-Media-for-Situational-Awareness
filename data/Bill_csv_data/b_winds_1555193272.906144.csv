Miranda Katz,"For the past few years, reporting on far-right extremism and misinformation has been a messy free-for-all. Sure, there have been some attempts to delineate best practices, and certain approaches to storytelling, such as those that seem to normalize neo-Naziism, have come under harsh criticism. But few rules have guided the new genre of reporting—and, to date, no one has taken a hard look at how that reporting may be complicit in spreading far-right messaging and helping the movement grow. Until now. A new report titled “The Oxygen of Amplification” offers an unprecedented look the fundamental and paradox of reporting on the so-called “alt-right”: Doing so without amplifying that ideology is extremely difficult, if not downright impossible. The report comes out of the Data &amp; Society research institute’s Media Manipulation Initiative, and is written by Whitney Phillips, author of This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things: Mapping the Relationship Between Online Trolling and Internet Culture. It draws on in-depth conversations with dozens of journalists (including WIRED's Emma Grey Ellis, who reports frequently on the topic) to illustrate an uncomfortable truth: Journalists inadvertently helped catalyze the rapid rise of the alt-right, turning it into a story before it was necessarily newsworthy. Now, there’s no turning back. “We have to deal with the reality of a highly visible, activated, far-right element in our culture,” Phillips says. But there are ways for journalists to do better. It's not that the reporting was done in bad faith or ill-intentioned; many people thought that holding up a light to the hatred of white supremacist groups would force them to go away. But that didn’t happen. “If it were true that light disinfected, the alt-right would not have taken off in the way it did,” Phillips says. Instead, the very act of exposure, combined with stories that unwittingly framed extremism as a victimless novelty, legitimized and empowered an otherwise fringe perspective. The report also details how, even as white nationalism was thrust into the national spotlight, some journalists had trouble taking it seriously. Phillips discusses the impact of “internet culture,” or “meme culture,” on digital natives’ ability to spot extremist content; she describes one former reporter at The Daily Dot who joined a Facebook group called Donald Trump’s Dank Meme Stash and did not at first realize that most of the content was not, in fact, satirical. That assumption of irony is typical of many people raised around internet culture, says Ryan Milner, an assistant professor of communication at the College of Charleston who, along with Phillips, co-authored the book The Ambivalent Internet: Mischief, Oddity, and Antagonism Online. Blanket irony, which Milner describes as ""watching something from a distance and being able to detach yourself from its reality and its depth and its nuance,” was hard to break—and by the time many journalists realized the non-ironic, non-satirical truth about what was happening, the damage had already been done. Where Does the Media Go From Here? The study is careful not to lay blame place at the feet of individual reporters, instead seeking to address structural flaws in the way many outlets think about extremism and extremists. In doing so, “The Oxygen of Amplification” lays out several criteria for determining newsworthiness, such as: Has a given meme been shared beyond just the members of the group that created it? If not, Phillips writes, “all reporting will do is provide oxygen, increasing the likelihood that it will reach the tipping point.” In the case of the so-called alt right as a whole, that’s exactly what’s happened: in amplifying alt-right ideology even in cases where it wasn’t necessarily newsworthy, journalists made it newsworthy. But by keeping that tipping point calculus in mind going forward, journalists can help avoid the continuation of a vicious cycle. The report’s recommendations also include considering a story’s potential social benefit and considering the harm that reporting the story might cause. A common theme is a simple call for self-awareness: “An enormous first step in the issue is acknowledging that the system is being gamed, and individual reporters reflecting on the fact that they’re part of that system being gamed,” says Phillips. Unfortunately, that might be easier said than done, especially as long as ad-supported journalism is the status quo. (WIRED is supported in part by ad revenue, and in part by subscriptions.) A real reckoning with journalism’s complicity in amplifying far-right messaging would require a fundamental shift in editorial strategy in many newsrooms. Many of Phillips’s recommendations reflect the basic principles of good journalism, but those can also be at odds with the realities of an industry that emphasizes speed and traffic. ""It’s all of these other pressures, like time and competition and lack of expertise within an area, that can introduce problems into the content that we produce."" —Kathleen Bartzen Culver, University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Journalism Ethics Kathleen Bartzen Culver, director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Journalism Ethics, points to one of Phillips’s recommendations—that reporters make an effort to talk with people “who have direct, embodied experience with the interpersonal, professional, and/or physical implications of a given issue”—as an example of something that of course most journalists would aim to do, but that is not always feasible, given time pressures. “I don’t really know any journalists who get up in the morning, look in the mirror, and say, ‘Today I’m going to be unethical,’” Culver says. “It’s all of these other pressures, like time and competition and lack of expertise within an area, that can introduce problems into the content that we produce. But just because we have these pressures doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have conversations like this.” Phillips’s report also describes the “queasiness” felt by reporters who are conscious of the fact that their writing is feeding directly into far-right extremists’ agendas—but who are also rewarded for their coverage. As Roisin Kiberd, a freelance writer for Motherboard, told Phillips: “We’re all damned, because we all profit off it. Even if we don’t make money off it, we tweet and we get followers from it.” Between pressure to build a personal brand, meet quotas, and compete with other publications, the report argues, it is not easy for every writer to take an eminently thoughtful and nuanced approach to the stories they’re assigned, or to reject an assignment outright due to concerns about amplification. “Capitalism does not align with many of those recommendations,” admits Phillips. “If an organization is dependent on advertising revenue, and if these best practices are going to—and they would—result in less advertising revenue, then publishers would have to be willing to take a considerable financial hit to make the appropriate changes to minimize the spread of mis- and disinformation. The bottom line is that people have to be willing to sacrifice the bottom line.” And if they don’t? Phillips doesn’t sugarcoat what’s at stake: “We lose truth, and democracy becomes more untenable.” More Great WIRED Stories","A new study, by a respected scholar on internet culture, winds up a penetrating indictment of journalism's internal inconsistencies.",2018-05-25T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How the Media Helped Legitimize Extremism,https://www.wired.com/story/study-media-and-extremism/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b05f6ed4540814303aed841/191:100/pass/alt_right_amplify-02.jpg,wired,Wired,winds,0
Emily Dreyfuss,"This week, RSA, one of the biggest cybersecurity conferences of the year took place in San Francisco. Researchers demonstrated lots of new reasons to freak out about your data security, but they also highlighted new techniques for staying safe. Theres the clever new tool that can protect Macs using Apples video game logic engine. And the NSA even made an appearance, revealing an open-source version of a powerful cybersecurity tool that agency had developed in house.
But of course, even amid good news, hacks and security flaws persisted. Google announced it had found a new zero-day exploit in MacOS, dubbed Buggy Cow. It also said it patched a security flaw in Chromewhich reminds us, you should turn on auto updates everywhere you can! An email marketing company exposed some 736 million email addresses. Sign-in kiosks are a security threat you should probably be worrying about more. A new machine learning technique can scan tweets to spot critical security flaws. Oh, and voting machines are still in total disarray.
Speaking of stories that wont go away, this week the House freshly probed Cambridge Analytica for the role it played in Wikileaks publication of emails that Russian hackers stole from the Democratic National Committee. And the government is still looking for new tech ideas; the Air Force held a pitch day this week, looking for new military tech.
You also may have seen that Mark Zuckerberg announced he wanted to pivot to privacy, with a new platform that would be like Facebook but private. WIRED Editor-in-Chief Nick Thompson interviewed him about it, and then laid out nine questions Zuckerberg still needs to answer.

According to documents obtained by the local NBC 7 news station in San Diego, the US government has reportedly created a secret database to track journalists, activists, and at least one lawyer. What they had in common was their interest or involvement in the 5,000-person migrant caravan, which traveled from central America to the US border in Mexico at the end of last year, becoming headline news across the world. According to the stations reporting, the database contained information gathered jointly by the US and Mexican governments, and had details like photos, names, dates of birth, social media handles, and whether they had been arrested. In some cases, the report says US authorities placed restrictions on peoples passports as a result of their inclusion on the database. Prior to the revelation, journalists and activists around the border had reported being targeted by border security officials. NBC 7 found those names of those who had reported such treatment on the secret database. The news station reports that a Homeland Security source leaked the documents to NBC 7 on the condition of anonymity. The source told NBC 7 that officials created separate dossiers on each person in the database. A spokesperson for Homeland Security disputed that part of the report, but did not comment further.
Whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who was released from prison in 2017 after serving seven years on charges of violating the espionage act, is back in jail, according to NPR News. The government took her into custody Friday after she refused to comply with a subpoena to testify in front of a grand jury against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. WikiLeaks, famously, is there Manning published the documents she stole from the US military when she was an Army private. At the time, the files she leaked and WikiLeaks published cemented Assanges reputation as a vital supporter and enabler of whistleblowing. That was then. Now Assange is seen as a decidedly less idealist figure, reportedly raging around the Ecuadorian embassy in London where hes lived since 2012. Apparently Mannings testimony is wanted now to probe Assange's reported role in the DNC leak, though the details of the case are under seal.
This story from Gizmodo is delightful. It also just goes to show how hard it is to get passwords right. The above string of numbers look like a pretty random and strong password, right? Then why, wondered software engineer Robert Ou, does it show up so often in breaches listed by the site HaveIBeenPwned? The answer has to do with Mandarin and a phonetic keyboard that translates from that language to English. Just read the whole story, and then get a password manager, because your smart passwords arent as clever as you think.
Forbes reports that the FBI is undertaking a sting operation to ferret out pedophiles online, taking over the social media accounts of known pedophiles in order to find who they share illegal content with. In the case detailed by Forbes, the FBI got a search warrant to commandeer the Instagram and Kik accounts of a suspected pedophile. The feds then used those accounts for 18 months, letting child exploitation material spread whilst he tried to catch other criminals, according to the report. The account holder pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 48 months in prison for sharing and creating child pornography, after which the FBI convinced him to let them take over his accounts.
Six years after former security contractor Edward Snowden leaked the existence of a massive NSA spying operation started in response to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, the program may reportedly be coming to an end. According to what the national security advisor to Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy told the Lawfare Podcast, the program hasnt been operational for six months. The New York Timesreports that the Trump administration might not try to get Congress to renew it when its legal authority expires later this year. Though Snowdens revelation prompted a new era of skepticism about government surveillance, the program may be ending not because of outrage, but because the way people communicate has changed. Encrypted messaging and other services may have supplanted the role phone calls once played in planning illegal activity.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Mental health startup Lantern, which raised more than $20 million in funding, is winding down its commercial operations after a couple of acquisition deals fell through, TechCrunch has learned. As part of the wind-down, Lantern is laying off about 25 people, which is the majority of the staff, with a handful of former team members to focus on what’s next for the company. Their last days will be August 1, 2018. Lantern, which offers tools to deal with stress, anxiety and body image for about $50 a month, will continue to be available for paid customers through the end of the year. However, coaches are no longer available to users. All of Lantern’s programs were based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, which examines the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors. The programs were designed to empower people to learn how to manage their anxiety, stress and/or body images on a daily basis. Lantern also employed coaches, who were experienced behavioral change professionals trained in CBT to guide patients through the programs, give them feedback and help keep them accountable for reaching their goals. Since its founding in 2013, Lantern — formerly known as ThriveOn — served hundreds of thousands of people. Lantern’s ultimate goal was to sell to insurers, but in the interim, first sold directly to consumers and then through employers like Facebook and Intuit. But Lantern needed more customers in order to survive, Lantern CEO Alejandro Foung told TechCrunch. “What we’ve built, I still really believe in the value of it,” Foung told me. “We’re committed to finding a path forward for us.” Lantern’s goal was to bridge the gap that exists between those who need mental health services and those who receive them. If Foung knew what the end goal was for Lantern when he first started the company, he would’ve kept a smaller team, he said. He also, of course, would’ve started focusing on insurers a lot earlier in the process. “What I feel sad about is that we weren’t able to make that vision come to reality,” Foung said. “What I’m left with is knowledge that the product we built has a place in society. It can best be used in the future for markets people ignore.” As lantern winds down, Foung is focused on what comes next for the company with a handful of remaining team members. He wouldn’t get in to too much detail, but told me his team will be focused “on addressing gaps that exist for underserved populations.” When Lantern first came on the scene, there were very few startups addressing mental health issues. Since then, a number of startups have emerged, including Meru Health, Pacific Labs, and startups more strictly focused on mindfulness and meditation.","Mental health startup Lantern, which raised more than $20 million in funding, is winding down its commercial operations after a couple of acquisition deals fell through, TechCrunch has learned.

Patrick Allan,"Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path. They can form almost anywhere, in any season, and bring with them 300 mph winds and funnels that can be more than a mile wide. This is what you need to know to survive one of Mother Nature’s most brutal offspring. You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad. Not because you’ll get… Read more Read Where and When They Occur Most tornadoes in the U.S. occur east of the Rocky Mountains. They are especially concentrated in the central and southern plains (what’s commonly known as “ Tornado Alley ”), as well as the Gulf Coast and parts of Florida. That said, tornadoes can occur just about anywhere, so it’s good to be prepared for them wherever you live. Once they form, tornadoes tend to move southwest to northeast, but they have been known to change direction. While tornadoes can occur any time during the year, they’re most likely to strike in the spring and summer months. More often than not, they happen in the late afternoon and early evening when the pressure is rapidly changing, usually between 3 and 9 p.m. Know the Warning Signs Tornadoes can strike quickly and seemingly out of nowhere, but there are usually warning signs of some kind. Make sure you know what different weather warnings mean : Severe thunderstorm watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms may develop in your area. Severe thunderstorms are an early warning sign of a potential tornado. Severe thunderstorm warning : A severe thunderstorm has been observed by spotters or indicated on radar, and is occuring in your area. These storms can produce rain, lightning, hail, and wind of at least 58 mph. These warnings last for around an hour, or until the storm passes or upgrades to something more severe. Tornado watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms are likely and may develop into tornadoes in your area. If you see this warning, review your emergency plans and start preparing for the worst. Tornado warning : It’s happening right now! A tornado has been spotted or indicated on radar in your area, so engage in your emergency plan or take cover immediately. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read If you’re not near your phone, or in an area with poor coverage, there are other tornado signs. Look and listen for : Dark, greenish thunderstorm clouds Dark, low-lying clouds (especially if rotating) Large hail or heavy rain Whirling dust or debris on the ground (tornadoes don’t always have a funnel) Loud, continuous roar that sounds like thunder or a freight train (but never fades away) Knowing these warning signs can save you a ton of time, and time is of the essence in emergency situations. When the Tornado Strikes Once a warning has been issued, or you can see the storm approaching yourself, it’s time to seek shelter immediately. Do not hesitate! Keep in mind, wherever you end up, be sure to protect your head. Most tornado injuries involve flying debris. And never leave a building in an attempt to escape a tornado. You can’t outrun it. If you’re at home Go inside and move to a small interior, windowless room. The lower the room, the better. If you have a basement or cellar, go there. Stay away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. The idea is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible. Once you’re in a safe room, get under a sturdy table or desk, cover your head and neck with your arms, a heavy coat, a thick blanket, or pillows to protect from debris. If you live in a manufactured or mobile home, leave immediately and head to the closest sturdy building. Mobile homes offer very little protection. Keep pets on a leash or in a crate or carrier. If you’re at work or school Head to a pre-designated safe area, like a safe room, storm cellar, or a windowless interior room. If you are in a high-rise building, head to a small interior room on the lowest floor possible. If possible, avoid any buildings with long-spanning roof areas, like gymnasiums, arenas, or shopping malls. These buildings have a high chance of collapsing from pressure during tornadoes. Follow the instructions of your office safety officer or teacher. Remember when you bought a new can opener because you thought you lost your old one? What do you… Read more Read If you’re in a hotel or airport Hotels may have a basement or other designated safe area. Follow the instructions of hotel staff. Otherwise, seek shelter in interior bathrooms or closets near the center of the building. Protect yourself with pillows, blankets, and mattresses. Be sure to inform management of any injuries or damaged property when it’s all over. If you’re in a concourse or terminal of an airport during a tornado warning, airport staff should guide you to a safe area (often designated tornado shelters). You may be advised to leave your luggage behind, so do as instructed. If you’re in your car or truck Do not try to outrun a tornado—it’s faster than you and doesn’t have to stick to roads. Instead, safely drive to the nearest sturdy-looking building. Once there, park your car outside of any traffic lanes and get inside. If you’re caught inside your vehicle : park, make sure your seat belt is on, put your head down below the windows, and cover your head and neck with a coat, blanket, seat cushion, or your hands. The vehicle’s airbags and frame will offer some protection. Never seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. You’re safer in a low, flat, open location. If you’re outside If reaching shelter in time is not possible, you have a couple of options. If you can get next to a building, do so and crouch next to a strong wall. If you’re totally out in the open, get away from trees, cars, and other potentially deadly debris, then lie face down, flat in a ditch or other low-lying area. Cover your head and neck with whatever you have. After the Tornado If you’re trapped by debris, FEMA recommends you don’t try to move, kick up dust, or push your way out. You may be injured and could make things worse for yourself. Instead, tap on a pipe, wall, or other material that makes a sound. Whistle or yell if you can so rescuers can locate you. When the storm has passed, check in with your family and friends to make sure nobody is hurt. Keep them together during the aftermath. Switch on your radio and listen for instructions from local officials and emergency personnel. Use extreme caution as you begin to clean up. Stay away from debris, damaged buildings, and downed power lines, and watch for broken glass and other sharp objects on the ground. Be sure to wear protective clothing while you handle debris, and don’t try to lift heavy debris by yourself. If your power is out, use flashlights and lamps—not matches, lighters, or candles. You don’t want to have to add a fire onto your insurance claim.","Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path.

Angela Chen,"Saying that the upper half of North America is cold right now would be like saying that the Sun is hot. A polar vortex has caused extremely cold winds to sweep across the country, promising record-low temperatures, with highs still well below freezing. How cold is that? Not that many places are likely to beat the coldest inhabited place on Earth, Oymyakon in Russia, which is expected to see lows in the negative 40s Fahrenheit this week. But plenty of Midwestern cities are going to be chillier than areas in the Arctic, Antarctic, and even other planets. Here is a list of places that will be warmer than the Midwest over the next couple of days. Alaska While the Midwest shivers, Alaska has actually canceled its Willow 300 Sled Dog Race because it’s too warm. (The 300 Sled Race is a qualifier for the famous Iditarod.) Warm — which here means “above-freezing” — temperatures have led to pockets of open water on the trail, which would make the race dangerous. Similarly, the Yukon Quest race has been shortened because there’s just not enough snow. Siberia The low in Siberia is about 4 degrees Fahrenheit today. Milwaukee ? Negative 20. Major bragging rights, but at what cost? Mount Everest base camp Early on Wednesday, Indianapolis was already negative 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Indianapolis Star. In contrast, Everest’s base camp (which, to be clear, is not the peak of Everest) was a positively balmy negative 2 degrees. Antarctica By Thursday morning, Chicago is likely to reach its coldest-ever temperature of negative 27 degrees Fahrenheit, with a high of negative 15 degrees Fahrenheit, according to CNN. In comparison, Antarctica’s Priestley Glacier, which is part of the continent’s Deep Freeze Range, will have a low of negative 7 degrees and a high of 6 degrees. Mars High temps today across Canada and the upper midwest of the US didn’t reach Mars last reported high. pic.twitter.com/Zg0REwm8PI — Mars Weather (@MarsWxReport) January 28, 2019 To be fair, the Mars reading that Chicago and Madison are currently beating is a daily high, and it was recorded by one instrument on the Curiosity rover. Other places on Mars are probably colder. In fact, the last recorded low on Mars was negative 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit — way colder than the Midwest, but still pretty impressive. The dramatic temperatures we’re seeing this week are not an indication that global warming has slowed. A study last year found that extreme winter weather events like these are linked to a warming Arctic. That means that even as average temperatures rise, people living in those areas need to adjust to sudden cold snaps. The situation is so dire that experts who have worked in the Arctic and Antarctic are giving advice to Midwesterners on how to stay warm. Stay dry and combine layers of wool and silk, Akiko Shinya, an Antarctic researcher and the chief fossil preparator at Chicago’s Field Museum tells the Chicago Tribune. But no matter how cold it is in Chicago, Minnesota, or Wisconsin — even if it’s colder than some places on Mars — we need to keep things in perspective: at least we’re not with the spacecraft New Horizons, which has been plunging farther and farther into the Solar System. It’s somewhere near the Kuiper Belt, which has a temperature hovering not above zero, but above absolute zero, which is the lowest theoretical temperature possible. Take notes, #PolarVortex 2020.

The sprawling social service has offered a Trusted Contact feature for years. Pick one (or a few) friends or family members who would never be tempted to log in as you and root through your digital life, and theyll be able to help you regain access to your account should you ever find yourself locked out. When you use the feature, theyll receive a special code that theyll then need to give to you. Input the code, get back into your account, change your passwords and add some extra authentication security, and youll be set.
If you want to get a bit more grim, you can also set up a Legacy Contact that has the power to write a pinned post, respond to friend requests, update your profile and cover photos, and request your accounts deletion, should you shuffle off this mortal coil unexpectedly.

Better start brushing up on your courtroom skills; I havent found any way to officially designate another person as an account recovery option for your Apple ID. If disaster strikes and you need to access a family members account, its unclear if Apple will even allow you to do so (without legal paperwork, that is). As Apples Terms and Conditions states:
Unless otherwise required by law, You agree that your Account is non-transferable and that any rights to your Apple ID or Content within your Account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate your Account may be terminated and all Content within your Account deleted. Contact iCloud Support at https://support.apple.com/icloud for further assistance.
Your best bet is to manually give a trusted contact access to your Apple devices. Add one of their fingerprints to Touch ID or their face as an alternate appearance for your devices. Give them your Mac password, only to be used in case of emergency, or even your Apple ID password if youre feeling especially trustworthy (and they also have a way to pass any verification checks Apple sends out if they try to sign in from an unrecognized device).

1Password / LastPass
We love strong password managers, and what better way to give someone emergency access to your digital lifeall of itthan by letting them into your Scrooge McDuck-like vault of logins and passwords? (Again, for this to be useful, a person will also need a way to get past all the two-factor authentication youve set up, but this is an important first step.)
For 1Password, others can help you recover your account if youve previously set them up as family organizers or a team administrator. In other words, if youre just a normal 1Password user who isnt paying for the more expensive family plan, that option is out. You can, however, give someone your emergency kit, which gives them everything they need to know to log in as youincluding your ultra-important Secret Key for the service. Its a powerful package, so only share it with someone who promises to keep it safe. 
If youre a LastPass user, you can give a trusted contact the ability to view all of your saved logins and passwords via the services Emergency Access feature. Theyll need an active LastPass account to become your emergency contact, and theyll have to initiate the access request. Youll then have the opportunity to deny that request within a time period you pick. If you dont, or cant, then that contact will be able to access your entire password vault.","As the year winds down, now is a great time to get your digital life in order.

Devin Coldewey,"An ESA mission 20 years in the making is set to take off today, launching the first satellite to monitor the planet’s winds directly — and using a giant laser, at that. Aeolus takes off from French Guiana at nearly midnight there, about 2:20 PM Pacific time, and you can watch the launch live here. Aeolus, named after the Greek god who was the keeper of the winds, is a satellite designed and approved way back in 1999 but only recently completed and deemed ready for launch. It’s essentially a vehicle for a single payload, the Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument, or “Aladin,” essentially an orbital lidar system. Once in orbit, Aladin will blast the surface with a 10-megawatt ultraviolet laser 50 times per second, tracking the minute changes evident in the reflected beam caused by air molecules and other matter in the atmosphere. 20 separate measurements done on the laser light allow the satellite to determine the exact velocity of the wind where it’s pointing. Believe it or not, measuring the wind from space hasn’t really been done. Sure, you can observe cloud patterns and infer that air in some places is behaving in a certain way. But there has been no space-based, global-scale mission to directly measure the direction of the wind. This information should prove extremely valuable, since it will allow for much improved weather prediction, especially in areas like the tropics where there are fewer stations and weather balloons (yes, they use them) from which to collect data. As such the Aeolus mission may help understand and predict the genesis and paths of tropical storms, giving people more timely and accurate warnings. Weather in areas rich in balloons should also be improved by a few percent of accuracy — which doesn’t sound like a lot, but really is, especially for aerospace businesses, farmers, and others whose livelihood revolves around the weather. Ironically (though not particularly worryingly), Aeolus’s first intended launch date was scrubbed because of high winds. If only there were a satellite that could have helped predict that. Aeolus’s orbit is a slightly unusual one called a sun-synchronous dusk/dawn orbit. It will hover at 320 kilometers above the terminator, the line demarcating night from day, while circling around the poles every 90 minutes. So it’s zipping in the north-south axis at great speed, and takes a week to sample the whole globe. Data is fired off to a station in Svalbard, Norway once every orbit, and the plan right now is to distribute that data within three hours to the meteorological authorities who will be using it for their own purposes. The satellite has been in French Guiana since July and has been loaded up atop a Vega rocket since earlier this month. Live coverage should begin at 23:00 local time, 14:00 (2:00 PM) Pacific time, and liftoff is planned for 20 minutes after that. It should take almost an hour for the full deployment process to take place, so we’ll know shortly afterwards if all went well.","An ESA mission 20 years in the making is set to take off today, launching the first satellite to monitor the planet's winds directly — and using a giant laser, at that.

My concern is that I’m not going to be able to get out of the city later in the day.” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo warned New Yorkers of “an ugly, difficult commute.” “You have to expect a very rough day, right?” he said in an interview on NY1. “It is a combination of snow and wind and frigid temperatures. That is a bad mix. I have been driving around myself this morning. Look at the conditions, they are terrible and only going to deteriorate further through the day.” Cars were skidding and slipping in the suburbs outside New York City. Westchester County police officers removed a dozen disabled cars on four county parkways in the early hours of Thursday’s commute.

Most of the disabled cars have been spin outs.” The NYC Ferry suspended service to some of its docks on Thursday morning, but continued to operate other routes on the East River. Aside from a handful of delivery trucks and bike messengers, the major thoroughfares of Astoria were largely empty on Thursday morning, as the storm descended on this northwestern corner of Queens. Cars inched along, with a number of side streets still waiting to be plowed by rush hour. Commuters kept their eyes to the ground, fearful of being battered by the horizontal snow. On the aboveground subway platform at Astoria Boulevard, riders hid behind signs and advertisements to avoid the whipping winds. But on a morning like this, commuters brave enough to face the storm welcomed the unexpected: the subways, at least for the moment, seemed to be running on time.

Mark Kaufman,"It's the time of year when winds really kick up in California, and firefighters on Tuesday night captured footage of relentless gusts driving a new blaze over the parched terrain. Firefighters in San Bernardino County an arid region east of Los Angeles spent the night combatting the newly-born Sierra Fire amid potent seasonal winds, known as Santa Anas. Though this particular fire ( 147 acres and well-contained), is quite small compared to the expansive Camp and Woolsey fires, it shows how persistent 50 mph gusts can whip fire over the land land that has been parched by a confluence of dry winds and a long, scorching summer. In the video, a bulldozer, which had been clearing vegetation to limit the spread of fire into an adjacent community, can be seen working while the winds blow smoke through the air and stoke brush fires in the background. Santa Ana winds are notorious for stoking fall fires in California. These dry winds, traveling east from the great U.S. deserts, pick up in the fall and eventually peak in December, Sasha Gershunov, a research meteorologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in an interview. But typically by mid-November and certainly December some rains will wet the dry California vegetation. The winds will always blow, but these days they're increasingly gusting over dried-out terrain. This makes for perfect fire conditions. SEE ALSO: When will this terrible wildfire season in California end? ""Now were in our traditional fire season, but the fuels are untraditionally dry this late into the season,"" said Gershunov. ""This seems to be getting more common as the climate changes,"" he added. Some of the most destructive, deadliest wildfires occur in Southern California, a place not defined by pine forests, but shrubs and grasslands. Here, a confluence of Santa Ana winds, development in fire-prone areas, and climate change have boosted the state's growing wildfire woes. Overall, the amount of land burned in the United States has more than doubled over the last 30 years, and predictably, these fires have been enhanced by a warming globe.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":null,""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xYQczNj5of0ZdTSHBbAfO2mCAsg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fvideo_uploaders%2Fdistribution_thumb%2Fimage%2F87017%2Fef559f76-def4-4e94-8c9d-4c9418…",2018-11-14T17:49:40Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Watch California's powerful, relentless winds stoke the state's fires",https://mashable.com/article/california-fires-santa-ana-winds-video/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8uY6VnvrslCwLG_cUHFSBXnOvrU=/1200x630/2018%2F11%2F14%2F29%2F0c00b1ed7f4043cfb71bbeddea29e34f.425ed.png,mashable,Mashable,winds,0

The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept into the centre and north of the country overnight on Saturday. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries, but officials have warned people not to venture outdoors, and a number of flights have been cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now heading for Spain. Wind speeds of up to 176km/h (109mph) were recorded after the storm struck the mainland. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian Peninsula, and it is thought this could be the most powerful to hit Portugal since 1842. However, Hurricane Leslie, which formed on 23 September, was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. Portugal's civil protection chief Luis Belo Costa warned of possible flooding in coastal areas ahead of the storm's arrival.","The remnants of Hurricane Leslie left more than 15,000 homes without power after striking overnight.",2018-10-14T03:14:33Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Storm Leslie: Portugal hit by hurricane-force winds,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45853847,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/67C5/production/_103856562_aa8ad2cc-e15d-4c18-8620-77790ea21cc3.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,winds,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees Indian officials say the main reason the most recent dust storms were so catastrophic was because of the time when the strongest winds hit - at night, as people were sleeping indoors. Most of 125 reported deaths were because of the collapse of buildings and other structures. But meteorologists also point out how the devastating winds blew. They say it was an intense downward movement of air, known as downburst. Image copyright AFP Image caption Dust storms later became thunderstorms with lashing rains That vertical - and not horizontal - movement of the wind, they say, had damaging impacts on structures resulting in so many deaths. The storms followed very high temperatures in the region. Just across the border in Pakistan, local media reported 50.2C (122.3F) in the town of Nawabshah - a record for April. Scientists say high temperatures played a significant role in intensifying the storms that originated in the desert area of north-west India and further west. But they did not remain only dust storms. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption High-speed winds and lightning devastated many villages By the time they had reached states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and further east, they also became thunderstorms with lashing rains. Meteorologists say easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal brought in moisture that merged with the destructive winds from the west. Scientists say high temperatures, moisture and an agitated atmosphere make a perfect combination for storms of this type. The damage has been the worst seen in 20 years, according to officials with India's Met department. Media caption BBC Weather explains why the storms were so deadly They have also issued warnings that more bad weather is to come, with severe thunderstorms expected in several places in northern India over the next few says. The extraordinary dust and thunderstorms have come just when concerns have been mounting about the rapid rate of desertification in several Indian states. The environment ministry says a quarter of the country's land is undergoing desertification - while independent experts put the figure much higher. Increasing desertification would mean more intense and damaging dust storms. Climate scientists have predicted that droughts will become more severe in this part of South Asia with climatic changes.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption California wildfires continue to rage Strong winds have been fuelling California's deadly fires as search-and-rescue teams begin the grim task of searching for bodies among the ashes. Winds of up to 40mph (64km/h) are expected throughout Tuesday in the state's south, where the Woolsey Fire is threatening some 57,000 homes. Firefighters in the north are still battling the Camp Fire, which has left at least 42 people dead. Meanwhile, two new fires began in the south on Monday. They started within minutes of each other. The smaller of the two has since been put out, news agency Reuters reports. In the north, the Camp Fire, which has destroyed almost 7,200 homes, surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster to become the deadliest in California's history after 13 more bodies were found, bringing the total killed to 42. The earlier tragedy left 31 dead. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for, with coroner-led search teams preparing to comb the largely incinerated town of Paradise on Tuesday. Three portable morgue, as well as specialist dog units, forensic anthropologists and a ""disaster mortuary"" have been requested to help with the operation, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters on Monday. The Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu, a favourite with the rich and famous. More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California. US President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. What's the latest on the Camp Fire? Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in a nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate overnight. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many of the town's 26,000 residents have had their homes devastated Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she was first woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. She described the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"" and said she did not know if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened. ""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme. ""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised - I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it."" Many of the victims are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Media caption Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. What about further south? The separate Woosley Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Thousands of firefighters, some from across the US, have been brought in to help battle the blazes. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

GUY TREBAY,"PARIS When, at 12, Grayson Perry began covertly dressing in womens clothes, he assumed in his innocence that the impulse must have something to do with wanting to be a member of the opposite sex. For decades he pursued his cross-dressing adventures, first in private and then very publicly as a Turner Prize-winning artist whose performances increasingly incorporated his feminine alter ego, Claire.
It wasnt until 2000, the year he turned 40, that Mr. Perry experienced an epiphany about his cross-dressing. It was, as it turned out, really about me putting on the clothes that gave me the feelings that I wanted, he has been quoted as saying.
The most joltingly direct and concentrated emotional hit, he found, came from wearing frilly, flouncy, beribboned frocks, the kind of confectionary stuff you picture when you think of Little Bo Peep. Classic preadolescent dresses, in Mr. Perrys mind and also in his polemics, came to symbolize the antithesis of the macho. And it was Mr. Perry as Claire that came to mind often during the week of mens wear shows that ended in Paris on Sunday, and not only because Mr. Perry is the subject of an excellent exhibition at the Monnaie de Paris, or Paris Mint (Grayson Perry: Vanity, Identity, Sexuality, through Feb. 3).","The men’s show season winds down with Thom Browne, deconstructed; Dior Men on a moving walkway; and Comme des Garçons finding beauty in the dark.",2019-01-20T20:34:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Paris, the Hunt for Real Emotion",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/fashion/paris-mens-fall-2019-thom-browne.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/fashion/20parismens-AA/merlin_149425137_de6d78a8-9a69-417a-80e3-65b378f9c1b1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,0
"ALAN BLINDER, JACK HEALY, MATT STEVENS and AUDRA MELTON","Not far away, Granadas Baker, 38, was examining what was left of the white home with green trim where he, his wife and three children had ridden out the storm. The wind tore through one of the bathroom walls, the one with the door that Mr. Baker said he pushed for as long as he could as the force of the wind exploded into his home.
There wasnt even time to be afraid, he said. I mean, we were scared. But the Lord kept us. Things you can replace. Lives you cannot.
One of his neighbors died. The trailer next door, recently rebuilt after a fire, was nowhere to be found. Completely obliterated, Mr. Baker said.
He works servicing Coke machines and said he thought both his work truck and personal S.U.V. were salvageable. If he rebuilds, it would most likely be closer to town.

PALKO KARASZ,"LONDON — Storm Eleanor tore through Europe on Wednesday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour, bringing lightning and heavy rain, battering houses with hail, flooding streets and uprooting trees. The storm — named Burglind in Austria, Germany and Switzerland — arrived in tandem with a cold front, hitting Ireland before passing through Britain and on to Continent. Travelers were delayed, and the storm was expected to be felt as far north as the Baltics and as far south as Italy. Weather warnings were the order of the day, with forecasts of violent winds, mostly in coastal areas. Workers raced to restore power to thousands of homes, and to clear highways and train tracks of trees and overturned vehicles.

The US will shiver this week in a once-in-a-generation deep freeze, forecasters warn.
The most extreme arctic blasts, caused by a spinning pool of cold air known as the polar vortex, could bring temperatures as low as -46C (-50F).
Weather officials in the state of Iowa have warned people to ""avoid taking deep breaths, and to minimise talking"" if they do go outside.
States of emergency have been declared from Wisconsin down to Alabama.
John Gagan, a National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist, said: ""The intensity of this cold air, I would say, is once in a generation.""
The NWS is warning that frostbite is possible within just 10 minutes of being outside in such extreme temperatures.
Thousands of schools, predominantly in the Midwest, have been closed and more than 1,000 flights have been cancelled.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Wednesday afternoon, the Florida panhandle was hit with Hurricane Michael. It began as a Category 4 hurricane, and was placed in Category 3 by the time it reached Georgiaunprecedented for the area. Powerful winds and rains are expected throughout Thursday and Friday through North Carolina. One thing you can do to help in the long term is vote out climate change deniers this November. But for immediate aid, here are some places you can donate who are supporting people on the ground. GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots that work to restore areas hit by disasters, and their Hurricane Michael Relief Fund can be found here. They have a current goal of two million dollars, some of which will be directed toward immediate needs, and they also direct money to rebuilding efforts. World Vision works with local groups as well, though many of them seem to be churches in the area. This might be an effective strategy, as houses of worship often serve as shelters during storms. World Vision is putting together food, clean water, personal hygiene items, flood cleanup kits and more for families. They are not based in Florida, but seem to run programs worldwide. You can donate here. Volunteer Florida is urging people to register as volunteers in Florida with them to support Hurricane Michael victims, and suggesting the Disaster Fund as a place to donate money. The Fund is Floridas official private fund for helping communities recover from disasters. Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. They already have a number of members in North Carolina who are still helping with recovery efforts after Hurricane Florence. You can help them out here. Recommended by Charity Navigator, this group is a network of non-denominational evangelical Christian churches that has a long history of responding to disasters. They have equipment stationed and ready to move in along the Gulf Coast and in Albany, GA, according to their website. Direct Relief is also noted on Charity Navigator for their commitment to financial transparency. They are also firmly unaffiliated with any religion or political group and say they provide aid to anyone in need without regard to politics, religion, ethnic identities or ability to pay. They support in part almost 200 health facilities in Michaels path, and have outfitted ten of them with emergency medical packs in anticipation of the storm. You can donate here. Americares is a health-focused humanitarian organization. They announced on Twitter that they have deployed an emergency response to team to Florida.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Both ends of California are on fire. While firefighters battle the Camp Fire in Northern California, their compatriots in Southern California are facing an equally harrowing situation. Spurred by the Santa Ana winds, the Woolsey and Hill fires are wreaking havoc just north of Los Angeles with an estimated 75,000 homes under evacuation orders. The number is likely to rise as winds conditions pick up again on Friday. The twin blazes began in Ventura County on Thursday, forcing widespread evacuations in a region reeling from a deadly mass shooting earlier this week. As of late Thursday night, the Woolsey Fire had burned 7,500 acres and the Hill Fire was up to 10,000 acres. Both are running completely wild with zero percent containment as flames race up and down the steep hillsides. Powerful Santa Ana winds blasting up to 60 mph have made conditions even worse. The winds are annual occurrence in Southern California. As they flow from east to west, rolling down the mountains and into valleys, the air they move becomes compressed. That heats it up and dries it out, which in turn can create dangerous fire conditions. Pile that on top of a severe drought thats gripped the region for months, creating loads of fire fuel, and you have a recipe for the disaster currently unfolding. Mandatory evacuations went up overnight in large parts of Ventura County. The countys fire department reported that there were 30,000 people under evacuation orders, many forced to flee in the dead of night. The evacuation orders have spread to Los Angeles County as firefighters have been unable to keep pace with the fires racing across the landscape. The Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway on Friday morning and began to descend on the multi-million dollar homes of Malibu. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted that it posed an [i]mminent threat! Fire season is changing in Southern California in a variety of ways that are not good. That includes the global warming rigamarole every corner of the planet is dealing with to bizarre local impacts like the region losing its cooling cloud cover. Add in densely populated areas like Malibu and, well, you have a trappings of a very, very bad situation. Update November 9, 12:31 p.m. ET: Local officials held a press conference to update reporters on the state of the Woolsey and Hill fires. Los Angeles County Chief Deputy David Richardson said there are more than 2,000 firefighters currently battling the blazes in Southern California and that up to 60,000 homes could see mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders over the course of the day. If you have a mandatory evacuation order, leave., Linda Parks, a Ventura County Supervisor, said. We dont want any tragedies, any deaths, any injuries. In addition to the challenging conditions, theres also a resource challenge. Firefighters are being stretched thin between these fires and the Camp Fire, making it tough to set a proper fire line. Thats in part why the Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway and Malibu is being evacuated. The perimeter now is the Pacific Ocean, Richardson said.","Both ends of California are on fire.

Im especially interested in those last two, since Im willing to bet that we all have quite a few tech regrets this yearwhich could also include things like not deleting my Facebook even though I thought about it a lot, or botching that SSD upgrade and kicking myself for not having a recent backup of my data. 
While I have been thankful to not experience any catastrophic hardware issues this year, nor do I feel like I blew money on disappointing geeky toys, Im a little sad that I put offfor the second year in a rowmy grand plan to build a portfolio of my work on my personal website. 
I also took way too long to list some older computer components on eBaymy penultimate graphics card, mainlywhich didnt generate as much cash as they otherwise might have.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Tropical Storm Lane drenched parts of Hawaii with about four feet of rain as it crept past the state on Saturday, causing flash floods and prompting evacuations even as it dissipated over the islands’ rugged slopes. The storm had weakened over several days from a Category 5 storm, with maximum winds now reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. But its plodding pace — just 3 m.p.h. — prolonged the rains. Some 46 inches fell on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii, where landslides shut down roads and search-and-rescue efforts were underway. Flash flood warnings were still in effect on Saturday morning. Kelly Wooten, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense, which has been coordinating the emergency response in hard-hit areas on Hawaii Island, said the agency had not yet been able to assess the damage from the storm. She said police, fire and other departments were working to keep people off the roads, as some areas were still under water. Ms. Wooten said no injuries or deaths had been reported so far. The county would be clearing debris and opening closed roads over the next few days, she added, as it recovered from a series of landslides.","Although Lane was downgraded to a tropical storm and its winds are forecast to weaken, rainfall totals are increasing, and the authorities warn of dangerous flash flooding.",2018-08-25T18:45:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, Now a Tropical Storm, Batters Hawaii With Heavy Rain",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/hawaii-hurricane-lane-tropical-storm.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/us/26hawaii/26hawaii-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,1
Chaim Gartenberg,"George R.R. Martin has announced that he’ll be releasing a new book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series this fall — sort of. No, it’s not the long awaited The Winds of Winter, which promises to finally continue the saga that Martin begin back in 1996 and which fans have been waiting almost seven years to read. Rather, fans will be able to enjoy 640 pages of Fire and Blood, a collection of short stories that tell “the definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros.” Fire and Blood is said to be the first of two planned volumes of these historical stories, which Martin has alluded to before in the main series of the books, as well as in his companion history, The World of Ice and Fire. But Fire and Blood, along with its unnamed sequel, promise a more in-depth look at the tale. According to Martin, volume one “covers all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane),” while the rest will be coming in volume two somewhere down the line. (Martin promises that he’ll get to it in a “few years,” but take that with a grain of salt.) As a reminder: it’s been almost seven years since the last real A Song of Ice and Fire book was published Martin has actually published portions of the upcoming book as standalone stories in various anthologies — The Princess and the Queen, The Rogue Prince, and The Sons of the Dragon, but Fire and Blood will mark the first time that those stories have been published in a single volume, along with plenty of new material that will continue to flesh out the history of the Targaryens, along with 80 black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Unlike the main A Song of Ice and Fire books, Fire and Blood is written as an in-universe history, purportedly written by the Archmaester Gyldayn of the Citadel, in a style that Martin’s publisher describes as channeling the “scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” assuming that was something that you were looking for in your epic fantasy novels. As someone who’s read some of the previously published novellas, I can tell you that Martin has somehow achieved the almost impossible task of making a civil war between people with dragons seem dull, with dry prose that would fit right alongside Gibbon’s famed work. Fortunately for everyone, though, not only has George R.R. Martin decided to expand this into a 640 page long book, but there’s going to be TWO of them. As for The Winds of Winter — which I will again remind you has been anticipated since A Dance with Dragons was published back in July 2011, a seven-year gap that has seen Martin publish a different collection of Game of Thrones novellas, a different fake Game of Thrones history book, and a fake atlas for Game of Thrones — you’ll have to keep waiting, with Martin only commenting that “No, winter is not coming… not in 2018, at least.” Fire and Blood will be out on November 20th.","George R.R.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"A strong winter storm will spread across much of Colorado and parts of the central United States on Wednesday, sending hurricane-force winds and heavy snow across the region, meteorologists said.
The fierce winter weather, part of which was expected to classify as a bomb cyclone, was expected to pummel parts of Colorado and rapidly intensify throughout the day, the National Weather Service said.
Heavy rains turning to snow, blizzard conditions and high winds will also affect areas of the country from the Central Rockies across the Plains, and from the Mississippi Valley into the Upper Great Lakes, including Wyoming, Nebraska and South Dakota.
In Colorado, computer simulations showed a record change in pressure that suggested conditions for the bomb cyclone, also known as a winter hurricane.","The storm will spread across much of the state and other parts of the central United States on Wednesday, bringing with it hurricane-force winds.",2019-03-13T14:47:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘Bomb Cyclone’ With High Winds and Heavy Snow Takes Aim at Colorado,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/bomb-cyclone-colorado.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/us/13xp-storm/13xp-storm-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,0

CHRISTINA CARON,"The storm’s effects were felt as far south as Georgia and as far north as Maine. In Rhode Island, the winds were so severe that officials shut down the Newport Bridge. In New York City, most flights were grounded for a time on Friday afternoon. In the Washington suburbs, downed trees were strewn across the streets. Weather officials said more than three feet of snow blanketed some parts of New York State on Friday. Meteorologists confirmed Friday that the storm had become the second “bomb cyclone” in two months. (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Coastal flooding damaged homes, closed roads and sent at least one car floating down a street; many areas of New England got two to four inches of rain. In Quincy, Mass., there were more than 100 rescues on Friday as floodwaters drove people from their homes, the television station WBZ reported. “As far as a coastal storm, this is the worst since the blizzard of ’78,” said Mayor Thomas Koch of Quincy. “Across the board this is the most damaging, and I’m very concerned about the infrastructure damage.” Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts activated the National Guard, which mobilized 53 vehicles to help assist with evacuation and rescue efforts. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf activated the National Guard on Friday to respond to the severe weather in the eastern part of the state, where Monroe County, in the Poconos about 80 miles northwest of New York City, was hit with nearly two feet of snow and wind gusts that knocked electrical wires and trees into the roads. Cars and trucks spun out of control, shutting down Interstates 80 and 380, stranding hundreds of vehicles. “It’s quite a unique storm with the amount of snow that came down that quickly,” Sean Brown, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said in an interview on Saturday. “It has been nonstop,” Lorenzo Thompson, a manager at the Burger King in Gouldsboro, Pa., near Interstate 380, said in a phone interview on Saturday morning. “I have not stopped taking orders since 7:30 a.m.” One bus passenger, Angie Cortz, told WPXI on Saturday that said she had been on the vehicle on Interstate 80 since Friday afternoon. “They said that we were stuck due to accidents in the road,” she said. State troopers brought her and the other passengers some water as they continued to wait, she said. Travel ground to a halt elsewhere as more than 3,000 flights were canceled and more than 3,500 others were delayed across the country on Friday, many at coastal airports in the storm’s path, according to FlightAware. Amtrak suspended service along its Northeast Corridor. The wind gusts made for turbulent trips for those who did fly. A pilot on a plane headed to Washington Dulles International Airport sent a report to the Aviation Weather Center that painted an unsettling image of the flight. The center, which is run by the National Weather Service, recounted the report in a tweet that said: “Pretty much everyone on the plane threw up. Pilots were on the verge of throwing up.” As conditions began to improve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, winds and coastal flooding remained a concern, Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with the Weather Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a phone interview on Saturday. “One of the more pertinent threats that continues into the weekend is coastal flooding from Delaware on up all the way to Portland, Maine, and that would include Long Island and the New York City metro area,” he said. The winds had slowed to 45 miles per hour in some areas, a departure from reported winds on Friday that exceeded 65 m.p.h., Mr. Burke said. The highest recorded gusts were 93 m.p.h. in Barnstable, Mass. On the heels of the nor’easter, a “modest-sized storm” will be making make its way across the Rockies and Central Plains, eventually arriving in the Northeast on Wednesday, Tony Fracasso, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t look like it’s going to be as strong as the one that just went through yesterday,” he said, but it will bring at least a few inches of snow in the interior regions of the Northeast, and more rain to the coastal areas. “There’s always the potential for something stronger than what we’re forecasting,” he added.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Commuters in Brooklyn, New York City on Thursday morning A winter storm has caused travel chaos on the US north-east and is being blamed for up to 17 deaths. Over 3,000 US flights were cancelled and another 6,000 delayed on Thursday as snow falls on New York and New England, as well as eastern Canada. Boston could get up to 18in (45cm) of snow, while New York City is bracing for up 1ft, say forecasters. The storm, known as a ""bomb cyclone"", is expected to continue to affect eastern North America into the weekend. Media caption It snowed in Tallahassee, Florida, for the first time in 28 years Nearly 60 million people are in the path of the storm, with blizzard warnings in effect from Georgia to Maine in the US. Seventeen cold-related deaths have been reported across the US, according to the Associated Press news agency. Hurricane force winds of up to 60mph (95km/h) are expected to hammer the north-eastern US coastline. US railway operator Amtrak is running on a reduced schedule, and interstate buses are also being cancelled. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida. ""The situation has continued to deteriorate,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as he declared a state of emergency on Thursday. ""It's almost impossible to clear roads when you have those high wind gusts, because as soon as you clear the road the snow, the wind literally just brings the snow back on to the road."" Cars becoming stranded on the Long Island Expressway, he added, could cause a ""situation of life and death"" in which rescuers may be unable to reach trapped motorists. A ""bomb cyclone"" or ""weather bomb"" is an unofficial term for what is known as explosive cyclogenesis, according to BBC Weather. This occurs when the central pressure of a low pressure system falls by 24 millibars in 24 hours and can result in violent winds developing around the system. The winds can be strong enough to bring down trees and cause structural damage. The storm is forecast to undergo rapid cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean throughout Thursday and into the weekend, and current projections show areas north of New York as having the highest risk of significant impacts from strong winds and heavy snow.

On Tuesday, storm scientists predicted that Hurricane Michael would continue gaining strength as the cyclone approached the coast. They turned out to be correct, as warm ocean waters and a lack of wind shear which are powerful opposing winds that can topple hurricanes set the stage for the storm's intensification. Some 20 hours after making landfall, Michael still poses flash flooding threats to parts of Georgia, the Carolinas, and southeastern Virginia. Its strongest winds, while diminished, will still hit between 50 to 65 mph over the next few days.","When the steep-walled eye of Hurricane Michael passed over Stefan Melendez Wednesday afternoon, he stepped into the temporarily tranquil Florida environment and saw blue skies above.

At least 12 people died earlier in the week as strong winds buffeted large areas of Italy's north and west. Many victims were killed by falling trees. The worst-affected areas were in the far north, particularly Trentino and Veneto, where schools had to close. Mudslides closed a key road in the Dolomites, as it emerged that the winds had torn down a fabled spruce forest. Some of the worst damage was to roads around Belluno, after five days of storms had dislodged mud, rocks and water. Gales of up to 120km/h (75mph) brought down tens of thousands of trees in the Fiemme valley, where violin-maker Antonio Stradivarius sourced the wood for his instruments in the 17th Century. Downed trees were scattered like toothpicks and officials said the wind had knocked down more trees in a handful of hours than local woodcutters could have cut down in three years. In total an estimated 1.5m cubic metres of trees have been destroyed. The storms have played havoc with public services. Tens of thousands of people were without power on Friday.

Tom McKay,"Elon Musks prototype of the Starship spacecraftthe payload of a system formerly known as the Big Falcon Rocket, and the vessel that may one day shuttle SpaceX colonists to their likely deaths on Marsfell over in strong winds at its facility in Boca Chica, Texas on Tuesday.
The craft sustained serious damage to its fairing, photos show. According to the Verge, Musk tweeted that the Starships mooring blocks broke during 50 mile per hour winds and that the fairing will take weeks to repair, though its propellant tanks are fine.
The Starship spacecraft, a reusable second stage launch vehicle, is designed to launch from Earth on top of a large rocket booster called the Super Heavy.
However, Musk has characterized the project in south Texas as involving subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design, adding that it is not actually built to full height. Referred to as a test hopper by Musk and SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell, documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission and obtained by SpaceNews show the prototype is intended fly both low-altitude tests of no more than 1,640 feet (500 meters) and high-altitude tests of no more than 16,400 feet (5,000 meters).
As Popular Mechanics noted, the hypothetical finished craft will sport a much sturdier skin needed to withstand the journey out of Earths atmospherethough Musk has taken the unusual step of building it out of a double-walled stainless steel alloy shell he told the magazine will not buckle, will withstand extreme temperatures, and use water or fuel as the first-ever regenerative heat shield. According to Ars Technica, Musk has also tweeted that the prototypes three Raptor engines (seven on the finished craft and 31 on the Super Heavy booster) have been radically redesigned with materials from SpaceXs superalloy foundry.
On Jan. 5, Musk tweeted that he was aiming for the first tests of the prototype in four weeks, which probably means 8 weeks, due to unforeseen issues. Presumably, blowing over in the Texas wind will set back his timetable a bit.

"Judson Jones and Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)A winter storm will unload a messy mix of heavy snow, strong winds and frigid temperatures across parts of the Midwest and Northeast over the weekend. 
About 115 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. Snow will start Saturday evening in Boston and New York, which will then turn into a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. 
The National Weather Service in New York is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of sleet and snow plus possible ice. New York may warm up enough for rain Sunday morning, but freezing is expected by the evening when temperatures plummet. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state will begin Saturday at 3 p.m. ET. Amtrak will operate a modified service Saturday and Sunday due to the weather, it said. 
Thousands of flights canceled
Travel through Sunday will be affected, with nearly 2,000 flights involving domestic airports canceled, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, closed for several hours after a Southwest Airlines flight went off a runway while taxiing. The airliner slid onto a runway overrun area, Southwest Airlines said. 
None of the 150 passengers and six crew members was injured, the airline said. 
The storm system is associated with the same upper-level energy as one on the West Coast that dumped rain in Los Angeles and elsewhere as well as caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Blowing and drifting snow
The second storm will exit the Rockies and likely will begin to drop snow across Kansas over the weekend. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of a storm last week-- will get less accumulation this time. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could face through the weekend. Both cities may get more than half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, snow to the north and ice and snow across the states' centers. 
Icing is possible in New England
This second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up at least 6 to 12 inches deep, with some icing for added misery.
The Interstate 95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will form, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning Saturday at noon. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
Deep chill across the United States 
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough for rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. It's expected to happen so fast it would instantly freeze any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A stubborn Colorado wildfire grew by around a fifth on Saturday, consuming sparsely populated land as low humidity and high winds left firefighters bracing for it to spread, officials said. “Weather will be a concern this weekend as critical fire weather conditions are expected,” fire officials said in a Saturday email update on the so-called 416 Fire. “Southwest to west winds will be strengthening across southwest Colorado this weekend.” The Haines Index, used by firefighters to assess the stability and dryness of air over fires, is at its maximum level of six, officials said. “This indicates that there is a high potential for extreme fire behavior, intensity, and growth,” they added. As of Saturday morning, the Colorado fire remained at 10 percent contained, but it had grown by about 1,500 acres (607 hectares) since Friday, mostly in less inhabited areas to the west that officials said they were monitoring while they concentrate on protecting structures to the east, north and south. Officials said they ramped up their response to the fire, which had scorched 8,691 acres, up from 7,180 the day before, to a maximum Type 1 from Type 2, implying additional resources to battle the blaze. In 2017, a near-record 10 million acres (4 million hectares) were burned in U.S. wildfires, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The same agency issued a June forecast for “above-normal significant large fire potential” this month in Southern California and the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, because of a deepening drought and ample fuel for wildfires. Firefighters have kept the Colorado fire to the west of Highway 550 and away from structures, county commissioners in La Plata County, Colorado, said in a Saturday Facebook post. Fire officials said in the Saturday update that Highway 550 was closed from mile marker 32 to 47 and pilot cars were escorting traffic through there. A new blaze about 13 miles to the west, known as the Burro fire, prompted U.S. Forest Service officials on Saturday to close part of the Colorado trail in the San Juan National Forest.

CAITLIN DICKERSON,"Puerto Rico was already struggling with an increase in mental illness amid a 10-year recession that brought soaring unemployment, poverty and family separation caused by emigration. Public health officials and caregivers say that Maria has exacerbated the problem. Photo A photo of Ms. Serrano Ortiz with her two oldest children. Her home flooded up to the ceiling during the hurricane. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Many Puerto Ricans are reporting intense feelings of anxiety and depression for the first time in their lives. Some are paranoid that a disaster will strike again. And people who had mental illnesses before the storm, and who have been cut off from therapy and medication, have seen their conditions deteriorate. “When it starts raining, they have episodes of anxiety because they think their house is going to flood again,” said Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz, the clinical psychologist who treated Ms. Serrano Ortiz. “They have heart palpitations, sweating, catastrophic thoughts. They think ‘I’m going to drown,’ ‘I’m going to die,’ ‘I’m going to lose everything.’ ” With hurricane nearly two months in the past, the island is still in shock. Its residents are haunted by dozens of deaths caused by the storm, and many more life-threatening near misses. The reminders are inescapable. They lie in piles of rotting debris as tall as homes that still line many streets and in cellphones that are useless for checking on family members. Returning to a routine is the most important step toward overcoming trauma, according to physicians and public health officials. But for most Puerto Ricans, logistical barriers like scarce water and electricity, as well as closed schools and businesses, make that impossible. Since Sept. 20, when the storm came ashore at 6:15 a.m., more than 2,000 calls have overwhelmed an emergency hotline for psychiatric crises maintained by the Puerto Rican health department — double the normal number for that period of time, even though most residents still do not have working phones. Puerto Rican officials said that suicides had increased — 32 have been reported since the storm — and many more people than normal have been hospitalized after being deemed dangerous to themselves or others. At the emergency health clinic in Toa Baja, where Ms. Serrano Ortiz lives, Dr. Toro said that he had been frantically calling for help from colleagues in other cities because the facility was overrun with people in need of mental health care. Because it is in a flood zone, Toa Baja was one of the worst affected areas in Puerto Rico. At least four people died there and water levels peaked at more than 12 feet. The city of 80,000 west of San Juan flooded multiple times, each time that it rained after Maria passed. Photo Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz met with a patient at the emergency clinic in Toa Baja. Mental health experts fear that Puerto Rico is approaching a crisis. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times In his nearly 20 years of practicing medicine, Dr. Toro said he had never before hospitalized as many people with suicidal or homicidal thoughts in such a short time period. Of about 2,500 people who had been to the clinic since it opened two weeks earlier, more than 90 percent were referred for mental health screenings, Dr. Toro said. He and other practitioners at the clinic had already referred at least 20 people to psychiatric wards elsewhere on the island. “This is an emergency situation,” he said. “It’s still affecting us. There are people that we haven’t seen.” Health workers are bracing for effects similar to those seen in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, where cases of both moderate and severe psychiatric illnesses spiked. In New Orleans, many people experienced insomnia, cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss, which became known colloquially and among researchers as “Katrina Brain.” Prolonged losses of electricity, water communications or infrastructure have been linked to the onset of mental health crises, said Dr. Domingo Marqués, the director of clinical psychology at Albizu University, a prominent graduate school of psychology on the island with clinics in two major cities. All of those elements have been relentlessly present in Puerto Rico. “And this is all happening at once,” he said. “What we have lost is the foundation that holds a society together.” He said that Puerto Ricans would have to adjust their definition of normalcy in order to function: “It’s ‘I survived. My family didn’t die.’ That’s the new definition of O.K.” This hurricane season has caused mental distress, and strained resources for treating it, throughout the Caribbean, according to reports from the U n ited States Virgin Islands, Dominica and Antigua. Photo Laura Rodriguez relied on a strict daily routine to manage her borderline personality disorder, a routine upended by Hurricane Maria. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times The mental health division of the Puerto Rican health department received $3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate a response to Maria, said Suzanne Roig, the administrator of the Puerto Rican agency. Its doctors have been knocking on doors in the worst-hit parts of the island and visiting emergency shelters where people who lost their homes have been living. “We are trying to reach people to tell them that this crisis will pass,” she said, “and that they should not make permanent decisions.” The agency also started an initiative to monitor social media, and staged interventions in a handful of homes of people who posted what appeared to be suicide notes. During high-volume hours, its staff members have been taking on extra shifts and working overtime to respond to the increase in phone calls to the 24-hour emergency crisis hotline. In addition to struggling with their own emotions, Ms. Roig said that distressed callers had reported children who had not spoken since the storm or cried inconsolably when it rained. And people with serious mental illnesses who had experienced psychotic episodes had been locked inside rooms by family members who did not know what else to do. “People who have a prescription can’t get to a pharmacy,” Ms. Roig said. “If they can get to the pharmacy it might not be open. If it’s open, they might not have the medicine.” Before the storm, Laura Rodriguez, 39, managed her borderline personality disorder without medication by relying on a strict routine: Early morning CrossFit workouts, long hours at work as an interior designer, going to bed early and never having guests at her home in Río Piedras. But since Maria hit, her gym had been closed and her therapist had not been working. Neither had she. “I’m constantly anxious,” she said. “I get these urges to be violent and I can’t control it.” Memories of the storm were also tormenting her. She had been trapped inside her apartment for two days with her boyfriend, her mother and her mother’s cat. They used plastic tarps, towels, bedsheets and pieces of wood to try to plug the windows where rain water was surging through. Without access to any of the balms that she typically relied on to stabilize her mood, she was worried about resorting to self-harm, an impulse that she had struggled to control since she was 8 years old. “What if it’s like three months, four months?” she said. “I cannot do this for so long.” For Ms. Serrano Ortiz, another threat to her mental and physical health loomed. Before the storm, a scan of her throat had indicated that she may have cancer for the second time. But she has not been able to get any more information about her prognosis because her doctor’s offices have been closed. At the emergency clinic, she told Dr. Toro that she might not have the energy to fight the disease again. When she looked in the mirror, she said, she saw in herself a reflection of her home — something dirty, smelly and tainted. “I don’t feel like myself anymore,” she said.

Fans of A Song of Ice and Fire have been waiting since 2011's A Dance with Dragons for the sixth book of Martin's series, Winds of Winter, which has been teased since the last book's release. Some expected it to release before the HBO series Game of Thrones reached that point in the story, but we're way passed that now. SEE ALSO: George R.R. Martin Releases Chapter From New 'Game of Thrones' Book Instead of finishing Winds of Winter, it seems that Martin is more preoccupied with helping to produce and work on the TV show as well as adding to the Ice and Fire universe without actually progressing the main series. He has released a handful of books and short story collections that take place within the world of Westeros and Essos, but they're about events from before A Song of Ice and Fire. Fire and Blood, which Martin announced will be coming out on Nov. 20, falls right in line. The book is the first of two parts that describe the history of the Targaryens — the house of Daenerys Targaryen that was famous for its friendly relationship with dragons. In his blog post, Martin describes the book as ""hefty,"" but it's not quite as long as his other Ice and Fire novels. ""This first volume covers all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane), along with their wives, wars, siblings, children, friends, rivals, laws, travels, and sundry other matters."" Martin said. ""For those not up on your Westerosi history, that’s Aegon I, Aenys, Maegor the Cruel, Jaehaerys I (the Conciliator), Viserys I, Aegon II (and Rhaenyra), and Aegon III (the regency). Oh, and there are dragons too. Lots of dragons."" For anyone who are like me and wanted to wait to read the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire before watching or catching up on HBO's Game of Thrones, just bite the bullet and watch it. The show is great, as I learned just months ago (about five years since I first finished the novels). Winds of Winter could come out in 2030 for all we know. I'm trying not to even think about the seventh and final book, A Dream of Spring.","At this point, it seems like winter may never actually come for A Song of Ice and Fire. George R.R.

MATT FLEGENHEIMER and TAMIR KALIFA,"“Part of it is convincing people it’s O.K. to trust again,” said Mike Siegel, the Democratic nominee in a long-shot race to unseat Representative Michael McCaul from Austin. “It’s still David versus Goliath, but Goliath is vulnerable this year.” Democrats speak hopefully about how far the state has come, how the old and new can coexist — rural, urban, cowboys, hipsters, capitalists, livestock. Oil fortunes have spiked and receded — from $30 a barrel, to $140, to points in between — as technology jobs have flooded in. Hurricane storm-waters have pooled high, swamping areas represented by people dubious of climate science, and taxes have stayed low. Four of the nation’s 11 largest cities are now in Texas. Houston, the biggest, is considered the most diverse major city in America. Its last two mayors are a black man and a lesbian. Its most famous politician in office is Mr. Cruz. Then there are the politics of the border, amplified by Mr. Trump’s immigration policy of family separations. Even before that, some residents had long chafed at Republicans’ suggestions that they were overrun with crime. “They think we’re in a war zone,” said Alonzo Cantu, a prominent developer and Democratic donor from McAllen. “I’m in my house right now, the keys are in my car. My front door is open.” Democrats acknowledge that any electoral road map for Mr. O’Rourke, through a maze of entrenched red, will require voters in blue splotches of South Texas to turn out in record numbers. Mr. O’Rourke must also dominate in the large counties where Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump — Harris, Bexar, Travis, Dallas — outrunning her even in areas where she won by more than 100,000 votes and convincing Democrats, particularly black and Hispanic voters, to show up at presidential-year levels. The most difficult heave may be mobilizing new registrants, including new arrivals to the state who have settled in suburban areas and residents in rural counties where Democrats have often lost by more than 50 points. Mr. O’Rourke likes to say he is visiting areas so red “you can see them glowing from outer space.” He sees his crowds — several hundred people, consistently, in places where a Democrat might generally expect to draw tens — as evidence that the approach is working.","For years, a blue Texas has seemed both impossible and inevitable.

KATHARINE Q. SEELYE,"Three Republicans are vying Tuesday to take on Ms. Warren, who has no challenger in the Democratic primary and has already raised more than $31 million. The Republicans are: State Representative Geoff Diehl; Jon Kingston, a business executive; and Beth Lindstrom, a long time Republican operative and former cabinet official under former Gov. Mitt Romney. Mr. Diehl has long supported President Trump, while the other two have not. It is not clear how much weight that might carry in this primary. As for November, Mr. Trump lost Massachusetts in 2016 by 27 percentage points. (Read more here about how the president’s endorsements have shaped Republican primaries.) In the race for governor, the incumbent, Charlie Baker, a Republican who polls say is the most popular governor in America, is expected to fend off a primary challenge from Scott D. Lively, a far right pastor. Two Democrats — Jay M. Gonzalez, a cabinet member under former Gov. Deval Patrick, and Bob Massie, an environmental activist — are vying for the chance to run against Mr. Baker in November. In two other House districts, younger women are challenging long-serving male incumbents in the Democratic primary. In the First, in Western Massachusetts, Representative Richard Neal, first elected nearly three decades ago, is being challenged by Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, a black Muslim civil rights lawyer. In the Eighth, which covers parts of Boston and the South Shore, Representative Stephen Lynch, first elected 18 years ago, is facing a challenge from Brianna Wu, a video game developer.

ALAN BLINDER,"The language, familiar to people living along the Gulf, came as the state and local authorities readied for a storm whose primary threats appeared to be rainfall and storm surge. Some areas of the coast could record a foot of rain, forecasters said, and officials warned of the threat of flooding. The governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi declared emergencies. Many schools along the coast were closed Tuesday morning, with others expected to shut down in the afternoon. Some districts announced that their classrooms would also be empty on Wednesday. The City of Biloxi, Miss., ordered its harbors and marinas evacuated, affecting about 300 vessels, but local leaders were plainly trying to avoid wide panic. “We’re asking people to do the same things that we’re doing: prepare,” Mayor Andrew Gilich said in a statement. “There’s no reason to be alarmed. We’re being told to expect rain and wind, and we’re preparing accordingly. We expected our citizens to be doing the same.” Although New Orleans, the economic and cultural center of the coast, was not expected to suffer a direct strike, the city’s new mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued an emergency declaration and a voluntary evacuation order for certain neighborhoods.

Andrew Freedman,"The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurricane force winds, to cement-like wet snow that will bring down trees and power lines. The storm will undergo bombogenesis, a process in which the minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. In general, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. The rapid drop in air pressure will kick up extremely strong winds, which will help bring air travel to a halt in some of the biggest cities in the country, from Boston to Washington, D.C., due to high winds and heavy precipitation. SEE ALSO: Dangerous storm targets Northeast, Mid-Atlantic with high winds, coastal flooding, inland snow Along the Massachusetts shoreline, coastal flooding is likely to exceed all of the benchmark floods of the past, including the Blizzard of 1978, and possibly the highest water level on record in Boston, which was set earlier this winter. Up and down the coast of eastern Massachusetts, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge on top of high astronomical high tides, coupled with angry seas with building waves, will do significant damage to shoreline infrastructure, including homes and businesses. A man walks through a flooded section of Brant Rock in Marshfield, Mass., on Jan. 4, 2018, as the afternoon high tide struck during the blizzard. Image: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images On Jan. 4 of this year, Boston saw its highest water level on record when the ""Bomb Cyclone"" hit the city. That storm flooded a subway station and shut down portions of the city. This event has the potential to do even more damage in the low-lying, coastal city. Communities to the north and south of Boston, will also see major coastal flooding on par with some of the biggest coastal storms on record. Cape Cod looks to be in line for some of the highest winds and waves, and its beaches are prone to erosion. Chart showing atmospheric spin at around 15,000 feet, depicting a closed upper level low south of New England, a telltale sign of an intense Nor'easter. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The overall weather pattern in which this nor'easter is forming is going to prevent the storm from skipping east, out to sea, quickly. This will heighten the storm's impacts, making coastal flooding last through multiple high tides, as east to northeast winds drive water ashore in Massachusetts, parts of Long Island, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. A sprawling, intense area of high pressure parked over Greenland is serving as a giant stop sign in the atmosphere, pinning storms like this close to the U.S. coast. Such a high pressure area is known as a ""Greenland block,"" and it's a prerequisite for producing a severe winter weather event in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Here's what to expect in the big cities of the Northeast, along with more details on the threat of heavy, wet snow making it all the way to the coast, which could spread power outage closer to highly populated areas. Computer model projection showing sea level pressure and winds just above the Earth's surface on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia: In these cities, heavy rain on Thursday night and Friday, along with extremely windy conditions on Friday will be the biggest impacts from the storm. Some coastal flooding is possible in the Philadelphia area as well. Wind gusts could exceed 60 miles per hour on Friday in the D.C. area, as the region will be located between the deepening low pressure area offshore and high pressure to the west, causing a wind tunnel effect. New York City: In New York, the official forecast is for a sloppy, messy, windswept rainstorm. The precipitation may mix with or change to snow at times, but any accumulations are highly uncertain at this time. It's possible that the storm will manufacture enough cold air through dynamical cooling to turn the rain to heavy snow late on Friday into Saturday morning, which would create a host of problems in the city and nearby suburbs, but this is not a high-confidence forecast scenario. Winds will gust to at least 50 to 60 miles per hour along the coast, and moderate to major coastal flooding is possible at high tides, which is also the case in coastal New Jersey. Storm surge of 3-5 feet with big wave action is no joke. Take this storm very seriously if you are at the coast. Major flooding is expected. And remember this flooding is for 3-4 straight tide cycles. pic.twitter.com/QvMx7dPRuB — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) March 1, 2018 Hartford, Connecticut: Heavy rain and snow is expected from late Thursday night through Saturday in Hartford. Snowfall amounts, however, hinge on how much temperatures cool down during the storm, with anywhere from 3 to 6 inches of snow to a foot of heavy, wet snow possible. Snowfall exceeding 3 inches could cause widespread power outages, given the weight of the wet snow on trees and power lines. The Halloween nor'easter of 2011 dumped about a foot of snow in Hartford, causing a weeklong power outage. Boston: The strongest winds, most severe storm surge, and historic coastal flooding all appear to be focused on Beantown and other locations in eastern Massachusetts. Winds could gust to hurricane force — 75 miles per hour — in the area, and a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and destructive waves are likely to produce historic coastal flooding in many areas during multiple high tides.

Many neighborhoods may be at risk of being cut off for a time. pic.twitter.com/3IeOWcEilh — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 1, 2018 Like in New York City, there is also a wild card of precipitation type in Boston, with some computer models suggesting that heavy rain will change to accumulating snow on Friday night and Saturday, as the center of the storm drifts further to the south. The National Weather Service is using strong language to warn people about the likelihood of potentially historic coastal flooding from this nor'easter, calling it a ""LIFE THREATENING SITUATION."" A summary of talking points w/ the forecast high impact / long duration coastal storm. Please take this storm seriously! For those living along the coast, this is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation. Please heed the advice of local officials. pic.twitter.com/jOAMNeWSbl — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 1, 2018 It's not a coincidence that Boston may set back-to-back records for its highest water level in the same year. Coastal flooding is an increasing hazard in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in part because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Higher background sea levels make it easier for storm surges to break records and do more damage. This is similar to basketball players competing on a court with a steadily rising floor, making it easier for them to dunk. Over 40-feet significant wave height now forecast by ECMWF model for massive Nor'easter.

Just off the Massachusetts coast, waves may tower up to 35 feet, and some of the highest swells in years are likely well offshore. Any ships caught in its path could be in trouble, as high winds and waves present a serious hazard. Cruise ships in particular have had a habit recently of sailing directly into powerful East Coast storms, hopefully that won't happen again this time.","The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurr…",2018-03-01T20:28:13Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions",https://mashable.com/2018/03/01/noreaster-new-england-worst-coastal-flooding/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LhZYhGJ19GBNVsk3jSIjxNpx46E=/1200x630/2018%2F03%2F01%2Fa9%2Fe36ae33d5376495f8308a830613fdade.87678.jpg,mashable,Mashable,winds,1
THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Fire and smoke forced the closing of the 101 freeway — the main coastal route north from Los Angeles — between Ventura and Santa Barbara. In addition to evacuations, officials in Ventura County issued boil-water advisories. • Hundreds of schools were ordered closed for the rest of the week because of the thick blanket of smoke filling the skies. The Los Angeles Unified School District said at least 322 schools, including independent charters, would not hold classes on Thursday. • The National Weather Service, which warned of the risk of “very rapid fire growth,” said winds could diminish Friday into Saturday. Wildfires circled the Los Angeles area and threatened Bel-Air. A blaze erupted in Los Angeles’s Bel-Air neighborhood on Wednesday, near cherished landmarks like U.C.L.A. and the Getty Museum. Flames raced to the edges of the 405 freeway, which carries about 400,000 vehicles a day and is the nation’s busiest highway, prompting lane shutdowns and forcing some commuters to drive through a shower of ash as fires burned along the horizon. By Wednesday evening, the fire in Bel-Air had consumed at least 475 acres and a handful of structures, small figures compared with some of the other blazes. But in such a densely populated area, the prospect of warm, dry Santa Ana winds whipping the flames into other neighborhoods had many residents of Los Angeles’s west side preparing for possible evacuation. Officials ordered 700 homes in Bel-Air evacuated. Forty miles to the northwest, the largest of several fires had consumed 96,000 acres by Thursday morning and at least 150 structures — probably hundreds more, fire officials said — and threatened 15,000 others in the city of Ventura and neighboring communities, and was 5 percent contained. Emergency officials said early Thursday that the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, “continues to burn actively with extreme rates of spread and long-range spotting when pushed by winds.” Part of the region’s 101 freeway was shut down as the fire reached the highway and edged northwest of Ventura. Other major fires were burning in the northern San Fernando Valley and the rugged region north of Los Angeles. A lack of rain in recent months has raised the danger. Video From the deck on the roof of his home in Ventura, Tom Sheaffer has spent most of the week watching the fire move from Santa Paula all the way west to the ocean. Mr. Sheaffer, who was born and raised in Ventura, said he had never seen a fire as bad as this. “This is a whole different level,” he said on Wednesday. “The fuel around here is mostly grass, but it’s dry grass and it really hasn’t burned for many years. The confluence of the hot, dry winds and that fuel that’s been building for so many years has just created this awful situation.” The strong winds that are driving the fires are a normal feature of late fall and winter in Southern California. What is different this year — and what is making the fires particularly large and destructive — is the amount of bone-dry vegetation that is ready to burn. “What’s unusual is the fact that fuels are so dry,” said Thomas Rolinski, a senior meteorologist with the United States Forest Service. “Normally by this time of year we would have had enough rainfall to where this wouldn’t be an issue.” The situation in Southern California is similar to what occurred in Northern California in October, when high, hot winds fueled fires that killed 40 people and destroyed thousands of homes. But while Northern California has since had a lot of rain that has essentially eliminated the fire threat, the south has remained dry. “We haven’t had any meaningful precipitation since March,” Mr. Rolinski said. Reporting was contributed by Jennifer Medina, Richard Pérez-Peña, Alan Blinder, Mitch Smith, Henry Fountain and Mark Storer.

Devin Coldewey,"Tuesday’s Falcon Heavy launch made history, not only becoming the highest capacity rocket platform since the Saturn V but accomplishing the first double autonomous booster landing. And that’s just the start of what could prove to be an epic year for SpaceX — if Elon Musk’s ambitious timeline isn’t delayed, say by high winds. There are three major events in the works for 2018 — two likely in the summer and one at the end of the year. First there’s the next Falcon Heavy launch, which after multiple delays will hopefully be taking off in June with a handful of satellites both military and private. This could set a couple records — heaviest commercial payload, for instance, and if things go well it might even get that triple autonomous booster landing that was hoped for yesterday. The June launch, by the way, will carry a couple interesting payloads. You may remember the test flight of Lightsail, a prototype solar sailing spacecraft that launched in 2015. The new version should launch this year, built by the Planetary Society; Bill Nye is one of the project’s most outspoken advocates. And there’s also the Deep Space Atomic Clock, which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, keeping hyper-accurate time that spacecraft can check with for navigational purposes. SpaceX may also attempt the first water landing of its fairing, Musk hinted in the press conference following the Falcon Heavy launch. We can expect it in the next 6 months, he said, but the problem is that it’s not a guided landing and the fairing tends to drift on its way down. “Fairing recovery has proven surprisingly difficult. You pop the parachute and you’ve got this giant awkward thing — it tends to interfere with the air flow on the parachute,” he said. “My guess is next six months we’ll figure out fairing recovery. We have a special boat to catch the fairing, it’s like a giant catcher’s mitt in boat form.” That would be the “Large Barge,” though it hasn’t been put into play yet. Catching a falling fairing before it hits the water would be another historic feat, further reducing the cost of launch and recovery. (Clearly they’re saving the capsule catch record for another year.) “I think we might be able to do something similar for Dragon,” he added, half-jokingly. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon The last major item planned for this year is a crewed flight of the new Dragon capsule. Musk said at the press conference that “After Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Block 5 [the next revision of the platform], it’s all hands on deck for Crew Dragon. We’re aspiring to fly a crew orbit by the end of this year. I think the hardware will be ready.” Commercial crewed missions are the next major area of interest of commercial space industry, and SpaceX is competing with Boeing for the glory of it and, as a secondary consideration, the lucrative government contracts. But sending actual humans up in rockets that still occasionally explode isn’t an option — the reliability of the launch platform has to be rock-solid and any issues causing failures need to be addressed. SpaceX’s record has been clear for over a year; the last real failure was in 2016, when on September 1 a Falcon 9 exploded on the pad during launch prep, apparently caused by a pressure vessel failure. In late 2017 a Merlin engine exploded during testing, but that’s kind of what testing is for. And the mysterious Zuma payload from Northrop Grumman didn’t go right just last month, but it wasn’t actually SpaceX’s fault. Again, though, actual humans will be on this. As they say, “Failure is not an option.” Nevertheless, Musk seemed confident that they would be ready for a crewed Dragon orbit by the end of the year. Less clear timing-wise are early tests for the spaceship section of SpaceX’s BFR project. Musk gave a few hints about this at the press conference following the Falcon Heavy launch. “I think we might also be able to do short hopper flights with the spaceship part of the BFR, maybe next year,” he said. “By hopper tests I mean go up several miles and come down. We’ll do flights of increasing complexity. We want to fly out, turn around, accelerate back real hard, and come in hot to test the heat shield.” “The ship is capable of single stage orbit if you want to fully load the tanks,” he added, but real test flights probably won’t happen for 3 or 4 years. How that all will play out is very much in flux right now. And who knows when Starlink, or whatever it’s called, will happen. Whether the company will accomplish these 3 feats in the next year depends on quite a lot, but after Tuesday’s launch I’m feeling optimistic.","Tuesday’s Falcon Heavy launch made history, not only becoming the highest capacity rocket platform since the Saturn V but accomplishing the first double autonomous booster landing.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind. Earther can’t really give you any insights into our big button boy’s mindset on the nuclear front, but we’ve got you covered when it comes to this bomb cyclone thing that’s about to “ blast the East Coast.” Snow is falling in northern Florida thanks to moist air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with the frigid cold hanging over the eastern U.S. The impending storm will get really organized and march up toward the Mid-Atlantic this evening, where there are rare blizzard watches already in effect. By late tonight or early tomorrow, snow, storm surge, and powerful winds will smack the Northeast. Along the way, this extratropical cyclone will undergo “explosive bombogenesis.” Or, in less nerdy terms, it will bomb out. And that has got people on edge. You’ve probably seen the Washington Post tweet that sparked the whole bomb cyclone freakout (it is a Very Good Tweet): In some ways, the freakout is warranted. This is shaping up to be a massive, dangerous storm that could fell records and cause widespread power outages. Snow in Florida is really, deeply weird and wrong. The cold air rushing in after the storm passes could be deadly. But let’s step back for a sec and talk about what’s actually going on. In simple terms, bombogenesis describes what happens when a storm’s central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The lower the pressure, the more intense the storm. Those types of rapid drops can happen in hurricanes, but only extratropical cyclones—storms that have cold air at their core—technically qualify as bomb cyclones. That means you generally only get weather bombs in winter, and often in coastal areas where cold land meets relatively warm ocean water. The bigger the difference between warm and cold air masses, the bigger the potential for bombogenesis. “The contrast between the warm and cold air gives you an indication of the energy available to intensify an extratropical cyclone,” Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, told Earther. “In this case, large contrasts in temperature between Arctic air currently over the Northeast and warm Atlantic waters suggest the potential for an intense cyclone.” This week’s bomb storm could see pressure drop an unbelievable 45 millibars in 24 hours, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration model ensemble. It’s forecast to bottom out around 950 millibars, a central pressure typically associated with Category 3 hurricanes (though this storm will not bring Category 3 winds). While this storm could be one for the record books, storms bombing out isn’t that rare. Jonathan Martin, a meteorology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told BuzzFeed that you can expect about 10 of these types of storms across the northern hemisphere in any given winter. In the Northeast, many storms that bomb out take the form of nor’easters, winter storms that have their strongest winds out of the northeast. In Europe, they’re usually wind storms. Elsewhere like the Bering Sea, they’re just really nasty storms. Scientists have been throwing around some combination of the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather”,and “climatological” since the 1940s. They somewhat entered the mainstream lexicon in 1980. That year, MIT professors Fred Sanders and John Gyakumpublished the amazingly-titled study “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb.’” It’s one of the first papers to deconstruct the process of bombogenesis. Sanders attributes the focus on rapidly dropping pressure in storms to Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who also gave us our working theory of how precipitation forms in the 1930s. So, this whole cyclone bomb thing has been a known quantity for a while. That doesn’t mean this storm won’t be bad, or that you shouldn’t be prepared for power outages, especially considering the bone-rattling cold that will follow. But make sure to allocate your freakout between meteorological and existential threats accordingly.",Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Flash floods and landslides have led to fatalities in the Philippines Heavy rain and strong winds are lashing the south coast of China as Typhoon Mangkhut closes in. Authorities in the heavily populated province of Guangdong have issued their highest warning level, a red alert. More than 100 people were injured when the storm touched Hong Kong. Landslide warnings are in place. At least 25 people have already died in the Philippines as a result of Typhoon Mangkhut but the full impact on rural areas is not yet known. Mangkhut lost power as it made landfall but it is considered the strongest storm of 2018. Is China ready? In Hong Kong, authorities issued their maximum alert, with residents warned to stay indoors to avoid flying debris. Winds there reportedly reached more than 110 mph (117 kph). Some apartment blocks had windows blown out. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The typhoon has been lashing Hong Kong but the territory dodged a direct hit Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Authorities issue their highest alert Most shops and public services are shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Not everyone paid attention to the warnings, though. ""I went running this morning. I love fresh air and there's no one on the streets, no cars. On normal days we can't see this,"" Hong Kong resident Hao Chen told the AFP news agency. In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. Thousands of people have been evacuated from Guangdong, where Mangkhut is due to strike later on Sunday. The typhoon is the 22nd of the year but China's National Meteorological Centre says it could be the strongest one yet to make landfall. What's the impact on the Philippines? Most of the deaths in the Philippines were caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions, officials say. Among the dead are a baby and a toddler. Blocked roads and downed communications lines mean reports are still coming in. Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on Saturday, tearing through the main island of Luzon. Five million people were in its path and more than 100,000 sheltered in temporary centres. There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Image copyright AFP Image caption Farmland has been badly damaged by the storm Image copyright EPA Image caption The full impact is still emerging The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season but the strength of Manghukt evoked memories of the deadliest storm on national record - Super Typhoon Haiyan - which killed more than 7,000 in 2013. However, preparation and evacuation procedures have been improved since then. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance.

Andrew Freedman,"Severe weather has been hammering parts of the south central Mediterranean this week, with heavy snow falling in the Alps, torrential rains in lower elevations along with powerful winds, and high waves affecting Italy, in particular. Deadly flash flooding has also occurred in Greece, as the low pressure area sitting to that country's west vaults moisture northward around its eastern periphery. The storm system responsible for this inclement weather is just getting started, however. Computer models show the storm will become a small but powerful hybrid system with some of the characteristics of a tropical cyclone typically found in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin. SEE ALSO: Major federal climate report rebuts everything Trump administration has said about climate change Such storms, known as ""medicanes,"" are relatively rare, but not unheard of. The storm is expected to move south and east of Italy through Thursday while intensifying, and then hug the coast of Greece, where it could bring damaging winds, heavy rain, high waves, and other hazards. By late this week and into the weekend, the storm — be it a purely tropical system or a hybrid storm — will be located just southwest of the Greek coast, with heavy rain and severe thunderstorms affecting that country. During the Thursday through Saturday period, the low pressure area is forecast to move southeast of Italy, and to the west of Greece, while becoming better organized. Low atmospheric wind shear (meaning winds won't change much in direction or speed with height), is forecast for that area, and ocean surface temperatures are relatively mild. Computer model projections show a small, closed circulation system that could have subtropical to tropical characteristics, with a ring of thunderstorms and strong winds surrounding a calmer inner core. Surface wind forecast for Friday, Nov. 17, 2017. Note the donut-shaped circulation near the Greek coast. Image: weatherbell When tropical systems, either subtropical or fully tropical, occur in the Mediterranean, they are usually much smaller in area than their cousins in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, and there's actually some scientific debate over how to classify them in the first place. The structure of a storm matters because it governs how such storms may affect areas that they hit. Interestingly, medicanes typically occur during October and November, which is at the tail end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Satellite image of 2014 medicane that struck Malta. Image: eumetsat A medicane in 2014 struck Malta, bringing winds of up to 154 kilometers per hour, or 95 miles per hour. This was strong enough to knock out power, disrupt air and ferry travel, and cause other damage in three countries, according to the European satellite agency EUMETSAT. Regardless of whether this will truly become a medicane — a wet and wild few days is in store for Greece, and subsequently for Bulgaria and Turkey as well.","Severe weather has been hammering parts of the south central Mediterranean this week, with heavy snow falling in the Alps, torrential rains in lower elevations along with powerful winds, and high waves affecting Italy, in particular.

As the deadly storm moved through Panama City Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, NBC News' Kerry Sanders was covering it on camera when he nearly got swept away. Thankfully, Weather Channel's Jim Cantore was able to step in and come to his rescue. In a video NBC Washington shared on Twitter, Sanders can be seen struggling to find his footing in the face of the hurricane's fierce winds. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Cantore appears, and helps Sanders make his way to a pole so that they can both brace themselves. After the winds die down slightly, Sanders is able to head off to safety, while Cantore surprisingly walks back into the storm. (Fun fact: Cantore was almost impaled by a 2x4 while covering Hurricane Michael on Wednesday.) The footage just goes to show how vicious of a storm Hurricane Michael was.

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Photo With fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, California officials on Wednesday night sent out an alert to seven counties and at least eight million cellphones. Credit Kyle Grillot/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For the latest news on the wildfires, read our Thursday live updates here. From the desert along the Mexican border to the central California coast, a distance of more than 300 miles, cellphones squawked and shook all at once on Wednesday night, and displayed a simple, serious message. “Strong winds overnight creating extreme fire danger,” it said. “Stay alert. Listen to authorities.” The alert went to most smartphones across seven counties that are home to more than 22 million people — by far California’s largest use of a disaster warning system created by Congress and activated in 2012. “It is, for us, an unprecedented move,” said Kelly B. Huston, the deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services. The same alert system was not used in October, when fires swept through Napa and Sonoma Counties near San Francisco, destroying thousands of homes and killing dozens of people. Many survivors of those fires complained that they had little or no warning of the disaster. That experience was uppermost in the minds of state officials who decided to send the message at 8 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, Mr. Huston said, though he would not second-guess the decisions made two months earlier. Photo Smoke from the wine country fires hung in the air over Sonoma, Calif., in October. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times “We looked at the conditions that were present” in Southern California, he said, “and saw that they were eerily similar to the conditions just before the fires really blew up in Sonoma County. We had extraordinarily high winds, we had fire, and it was nighttime.” For generations, emergency alerts have been sent over television and radio broadcasts, but anyone who was not watching or listening at that time was left out. Many cities and counties now have systems that can ring every landline telephone with a recorded message, but people who are away from the phone may not hear the message right away, and landline use is declining. Local governments also send alerts through text messages or email — and they have made aggressive use of the systems during this year’s fire season — but they are sent only to people who sign up for the notices. The kind of warning that California officials sent on Wednesday, called a wireless emergency alert, is like a text message but uses a different system. The alert makes the phone vibrate with much more force than it ordinarily would, and makes it squawk loudly, alerting the user that the message is no ordinary one. All smartphones are automatically set by default to receive the messages, which are limited to 90 characters, though a user can alter the phone’s settings to turn them off. The alerts are most commonly used to send Amber Alerts about child abductions, but they are also sent to warn of disasters. Usually, the emergency alerts are sent by counties or cities, and Ventura County used the system this week before the state did. But the Office of Emergency Services, in consultation with Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, and the National Weather Service, decided that with fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, a consistent message was needed across a much wider region. The alert went to smartphones in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. Mr. Huston estimated that it was received on at least eight million phones. “I don’t think it’s possible to over-alert people,” under such serious conditions, he said. “It’s really simply ringing the bell to get people’s attention.” Continue reading the main story","With fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, California officials on Wednesday night sent out an alert to seven counties and at least eight million cellphones.",2017-12-07T22:16:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fire Alert Sent to Millions of Cellphones Was California’s Largest Warning Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/cellphone-alerts-california-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/08/us/08ALERTS/08ALERTS-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,0

ELIZABETH DIAS,"At Mr. Trumps rally in Illinois, many people seemed altogether unaware of the synagogue shooting, until someone offered a prayer from the stage. Asked who was to blame for the countrys strife, Patricia Mitchell, who drove more than two hours from St. Louis to attend, cited the globalists, which she then defined as somebody who wont allow or doesnt like for our country to just be themselves. They want to mold everybody into one big melting pot, she said. Thats not how were designed. But the violence shows that the turmoil is starting very much at home. Many voters, in interviews with The Times in recent weeks, have been divided over national identity and who gets to define values in America, especially on issues of immigration and race. Mark Hetfield, who leads HIAS, a global Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees and that appears to have angered the synagogue shooting suspect, said his organization was in a state of shock. Ive never seen anything like this in my lifetime, he said in a phone interview. People have to stop saying hateful things about refugees, about Jews, about Latinos, about transgender people, about the other, he continued. It has to stop in the context of everything that we are doing, not just in the context of this election. But in the final weeks of the midterm election, which has become in part a nationwide referendum on Mr. Trumps leadership, the climate has intensified, and escalating violence and fear are exacerbating divergent viewpoints among voters. At the halfway mark of his term, Mr. Trump faces a reckoning at home related to some of the words he spoke from the inauguration dais: This American carnage stops right here and right now. Pipe bombs against public officials, African Americans killed in Kentucky, continued physical threats against the press, an all-out campaign of fear directed at immigrants signal that hate is on the march in America, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday. Were facing a battle for the soul of this nation, added Mr. Biden, who is considering a run for president in 2020. Words matter. And silence is complicity. For some, a parallel that comes to mind for the current moment is the summer of the presidential election of 1968, which saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy two months apart, said Randall Balmer, who chairs Dartmouth Colleges religion department. The difference, however, is that those shootings appeared to be directed against specific individuals, whereas this years violence is more tribal against Democrats generally or Jews generally, he said.","Nine days out from an already divisive midterm election, the campaign’s finale has come amid a cascade of horrors that reflected the country’s fault lines.",2018-10-28T14:09:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Voters Brace as Election Winds Down Amid Gun Violence and Pipe Bombs,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/elections-synagogue-shooting-bombs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/world/29midterm-mood01/29midterm-mood01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,0
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Things that look unintentionally like dicks will never not be funny. And so I present to you, dear reader, the map above that depicts the odds of topical storm-force winds from Tropical Storm Walaka. This is truly the only funny thing on this horrible Friday so lets enjoy it. And while youre here, lets talk about how Alaska could improbably be hit by the dongicaneor at least its remnantsearly next week. Tropical Storm Walaka already occupies a special place in history as the last named storm on Central Pacifics list. But Walaka could go out with a bang by pursuing a weird track. After shooting to the west of Hawaii, the storm has continued its run northward. Walaka will tilt northeast over the weekend, which is how you end up with the phallic-shaped map of wind probabilities pointed squarely at Alaska. Its expected to transition to an extratropical storm or even just remnants as it cruises into the Gulf of Alaska, but Walaka seems very likely to hit the state in some form. The National Weather Service office in Juneau is forecasting that it will reach the state late this weekend with winds near 34 mph. Because it will still have a tap of tropical moisture, it should also bring a good amount of rainfall to the southern panhandle, though theres still some uncertainty. Typhoons in the northwest Pacific regularly make a huge C-shaped curve from China and Japan back toward Alaska, generating some of the Bering Seas most explosive storms. But storms like Walaka, which formed in the central Pacific, rarely find their way this far north or curving back this far east. You have to have a perfect confluence of conditions, Brian Brettschneider, a climate researcher with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Earther. You need a strong hurricane west of Hawaii that is tracking north. The position of the subtropical ridge has to be just right to cause the storm to recurve north and northeast. It has to be picked up by an upper-level trough but without being absorbed right away. Waters in the Gulf of Alaska are also nice and toasty for this time of year, running up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) above normal. That will also lend a hand to Walakas strength and longevity. Bettschneider highlighted the remnants of hurricanes Ana and Ignacio in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as storms that made the trip from the eastern Pacific to Alaska. But an unnamed storm in 1975 and Hurricane Oho in 2015 are among the only storms on record from the central Pacific to reach the Last Frontier, both as extratropical storms. That 1975 storm was closest a tropical storm has come to Alaska. So Walaka is in rare territory, which is pretty cool. But also, the wind map looks like a dick.","Things that look unintentionally like dicks will never not be funny.

Does anyone else feel like George is mocking us at this point? Image: Kevin Winter/Getty Images This latest round of depressing information began when a fan asked what writing Martin had planned for 2018. He responded that he was close to completing the first volume of his spin-off Targaryen family history series, Fire and Blood. Another fan asked how the timeline for that series would factor into the release of Winds of Winter. ""F&amp;B will be in two volumes,” he wrote, referring to Fire and Blood, then further explaining that “Vol 1 before [would come before Winds of Winter], vol 2 after."" In other words, Martin is currently focused on finishing Volume 1 of Fire &amp; Blood in 2018, then going back and Winds of Winter, then continuing on to Volume 2 after that's done. What's worse, Martin has said that a chunk of the Fire and Blood series will be... content he's already published in The Book of Swords anthology series or from ""sidebars"" in The World of Ice &amp; Fire companion book. These include the stories “The Rogue Prince,” “The Princess and the Queen” and “Sons of the Dragon."" But if our best guess is accurate, we only have to wait until 2019 for the 8th and final season of Game of Thrones. To quote the Targaryen Mad King that Martin is evidently keen to tell us more about, perhaps it's time to just ""burn it all.""","Ice and fire are once again at odds in the latest news of Winds of Winter, the long-awaited (and long-delayed) next installment of George R.

JACK HEALY,"He was sweating profusely after he loaded the sandbags, then moved on to clearing items from his yard to prevent them from becoming projectiles in the winds. “I’m wore out and the storm hasn’t even got here yet,” he said. Officials in the Outer Banks said there were already reports of water washing over the road on Hatteras Island, toward the southern end of the Outer Banks, where emergency officials estimated that a few thousand residents remained. “It’s just starting to make its approach,” Drew Pearson, director of Emergency Management for Dare County in the Outer Banks, said. In the middle of it was Myron Sykes. He was part of a four-person crew of state transportation workers scooping up sand and sludge on Hatteras Island in a losing battle to clear the only major road for emergency vehicles and any residents who wanted to evacuate. Saltwater spattered their windshields, and jets of ocean punched through the dunes that separated the road from the sea. “Mostly we’re just trying to keep the road open long as we can, before Mother Nature takes us over,” Mr. Sykes said. A half-mile up the road, Jeff Ryder sat in a pickup truck, directing the workers who were answering reports of flooded roads and the crews trying to buffer and build dunes being reshaped by Florence’s winds. Highway 12 was a “lifeblood” road that tied remote parts of Hatteras Island to the mainland, and Mr. Ryder was determined to keep it clear as long as possible. Calls rolled in. Someone reported a big hole in the road and wanted to know if emergency vehicles would still be able to make it through. Water levels were rising and the wind was hurling debris into the road.","Windows rattled, fields of cattails bowed and waved, and residents of the coast of North Carolina braced themselves in the strong winds that came ahead of Hurricane Florence.",2018-09-14T04:40:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Wind ‘Rocks the House’ as Florence Moves In,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/hurricane-florence-wind-outer-banks.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/us/14wind-1-print/14wind-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,0
Mariella Moon,"NASA plans to use the data it beams back to figure out how we can better prepare for solar winds, which are streams of charged particles emitted by the corona. Particularly strong winds could change satellites' orbits, interfere with their instruments and even affect power grids here on Earth. If we want to head deeper into space in the future, we must first study how solar winds can affect our vehicles. Besides, we need to take a closer look at the star nearest to us if we want to learn more about the other stars in the universe. Finally, studying the sun could shed light on the origin of life on Earth, since it's our source of light and heat. Before the Parker Solar Probe can soar as close as 3.83 million miles above the sun's surface, though, it first has to spend seven years encircling the sun again and again. It will use Venus' gravity to fly closer to the sun each orbit while picking up speed in the process. By the time it reaches its final orbits, it will be zooming around the sun at 430,000 mph. If you're wondering, Parker will be able to withstand the sun's intense heat, thanks to a heat shield made of carbon composite foam and plates. Some of its instruments use an alloy with a very, very high melting point, and it has an effective cooling system that can keep its arrays, instruments and mechanisms cool and functional. NASA will launch Parker on top of a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. If you don't mind waking up early to witness the historic launch, fire up NASA TV on August 11th before the launch window opens at 3:33 AM Eastern time.

Tropical storm-force winds could arrive on the Big Island by Wednesday afternoon local time, with hurricane-force winds to follow soon afterward, said Gavin Shigesato, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The storm would then continue north toward Maui and Oahu around Thursday morning, he said. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday in Hawaii, the storm, packing 155 mile-per-hour winds, was moving west-northwest toward Hawaii at about 9 m.p.h., he said. Hurricane-force winds were extending about 40 miles from the center. “It’s still a very strong storm,” Mr. Shigesato said. Mountainous areas could be particularly prone to flooding, and the southern shores could experience damaging surf levels, with more than 20 inches of rain possible. There is danger of tornadoes and large waterspouts, and the National Weather Service warned residents to prepare for considerable property damage, saying some locations “may be uninhabitable for weeks.”","Brianna Sugimura loading supplies into her car in Lihue, on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, in preparation for Hurricane Lane, which may hit the archipelago later this week.",2018-08-22T04:06:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 Storm, Closes In on Hawaii",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/us/hurricane-lane-hawaii.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22hawaii_xp/22hawaii_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,winds,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years. This week, we can add another one to the list.
Typhoon Wutip formed and brushed Guam late last week. That alone made it an oddity in terms of timing and location. But rather than weakening as forecast, the storm blew up into a Category 5 monster over the weekend. That makes Wutip the first Category 5 storm of any kindtyphoon, cyclone, or hurricaneever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere in February.
When we covered Wutip on Friday, all forecasts pointed to the storm wimping out over the weekend. Instead, the storm exploded into a super typhoon, a storm with winds in excess of 150 mph, on Saturday into early Sunday morning. Its sustained winds leaped from from 125 mph to 160 mph in just 12 hours with gusts reaching up to 180 mph, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That put it well above the previous February record holder, Super Typhoon Higos, which saw winds top out at 150 mph winds in February 2015. It also made Wutip the first February Category 5-equivalent storm to form not just in the Pacific but anywhere in the northern hemisphere.
Wutip also looked the part, with satellite imagery straight out of central casting. The storm had a wide and symmetrical eye at its peak. Both are characteristics of an annular cyclone, storms that tend to be exceptionally strong and usually form over open water. 
Typhoon Wutip as of Tuesday afternoon in a slightly less formidable state.

The storm has since weakened as it chugs toward the Philippines, but what caused the power up seems to have been a bit of meteorological luck. The normal recipe for rapid intensification is weak upper level winds and ocean waters warmer than 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). Those conditions are rare in the northern hemisphere in February, though El Niñowhich is currently in effectdoes tilt the odds towards them slightly in parts of the Pacific. In the case of Wutip, upper level winds were moderate and sea surface temperatures were around 29 degrees Celsius (84.2 degrees Fahrenheit), which was slightly warmer than normal.
Not prohibitive for rapid intensification, but also not a slam dunk. It appears Wutip simply beat the odds.","We’ve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and DAVID ZUCCHINO","Around lunchtime, Steven Swank, 23, was packing a few cases of water into a little sedan. In 1999, the Grid was inundated by river flooding after Hurricane Floyd, and Mr. Swank wanted none of it. He and his girlfriend were going to his sister’s house for a while. “She lives over behind the Cracker Barrel, not near any water,” he said. “We don’t want to be stuck here.” Worries were running equally high in inland South Carolina. Fifteen miles northwest of the gaudy spectacle of Myrtle Beach sits the quiet county seat of Conway, a nearly 290-year-old town shaded by live oaks and straddling the Waccamaw River. Time and again — in Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew, to name just two occasions — Myrtle Beach has been spared the worst damage, while Conway has taken a heavy hit: flash floods with the storm itself, then river floods in the days that followed. “The water collects really quickly, and people think that’s the flooding, but it’s flash flooding,” said Le Hendricks, the Conway fire chief. “That goes down pretty quick, and then they think they’re free. B ut then what happens is, the Waccamaw River gets backed up.” Chief Hendricks described a kind of hydrological traffic jam: Water trying to leave the Waccamaw meets flooded waterways and a surging ocean at capacity. The river has nowhere to go but over its banks, onto highways and roads and into people’s homes. This kind of flooding might not happen at its worst until two days after the hurricane hits, but when it does, the water can sit for weeks. Meanwhile, places on the coast might have already begun rebuilding from any damage wrought by the winds and the initial surge. “Myrtle Beach, they did fairly will during Matthew,” Chief Hendricks said. “They had damage but were back up and running within a couple of days.” Conway, at first, thought it had dodged a bullet, as well, he said. “But it was the flooding. And it took about 18 days for us to get back out of that.”","The storm surge in the Carolinas could be deadly.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The massive, dangerous bomb cyclone that barreled into the central United States this week hit as hard as its name would imply on Wednesday, CNN reported, with law enforcement officials in some areas forced to take shelter instead of assisting motorists involved in collisions.
This particular storm began far west, where moisture from the Pacific headed into the Southwest. As it pushed into the Central U.S., it grew in strength and its pressure dropped dramaticallya phenomenon known as explosive bombogenesis, hence the term bomb cycloneas it cycled moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico into contact with freezing air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. This particular phenomenon normally does not happen inland, and is more common on the East Coast.
Per CNN, an estimated 1,100 motorists were stranded throughout Colorado, with Wellington Fire Protection reporting a single incident in which 100 vehicles were involved in a pileup on Interstate 25. On the streets of Denver, some 125 accidents were reported. A Colorado State Patrol corporal was struck by a vehicle in Weld County while assisting another motorist who had driven off Interstate 76, losing his life.
Snowfall in parts of Colorado closed in on 20 inches as of 10:45 p.m. local time, according to ABC 7, though totals were wildly variable across the state.
While Colorado is one of the hardest-hit areas, the winter storm is huge and has caused hurricane-force winds over a massive area, with a train actually derailing in the northeastern New Mexico town of Logan, CNN wrote:
The storm is bringing hurricane winds to the Rockies and as far away as Amarillo, Texas. Winds gusts equivalent to Category 1 and 2 hurricane winds were reported at the Denver International Airport and in Colorado Springs, the National Weather Service.
In New Mexico, heavy winds contributed to the derailment of a 26-car train near the village of Logan, according to a tweet from state police. No injuries were reported.
78 mile per hour winds were reported as far south as Dallas, the Washington Post wrote, where an Amazon warehouse near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had its roof shorn off. A record-setting 80 mph gust was reported at Denver International Airport, which was shut down for the vast majority of air traffic.
The weather is finally settling down in New Mexico, KQRE reported, though gusting winds were the biggest problem on Wednesday. Los Alamos Police Commander Preston Bellew told the station that I know guys who have lived and worked here their whole lives and they have not seen the powerful winds, snow drifts, and the snow all in such a short period of time.
Heavy snow was reported in northern Colorado, including Denver, western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming, central South Dakota, and southeastern North Dakota, according to Accuweather. Blizzard conditions remained a danger in the northeastern part of Colorado as of late Wednesday night.
There is a considerable risk of flooding as precipitation continues and snow melts in the Midwest and Great Plains regions. There is also a risk of avalanches in mountainous regions that received heavy snowfall.
The South is not being spared, either. The Storm Prediction Center wrote that parts of the Mississippi River Valley, including eastern Arkansas, southwest Tennessee, and the northwest corner of Mississippi would be considered at enhanced risk for severe weather as the storm moves east, the Post noted. The paper added that reports indicate severe thunderstorms may still occur on a cold front stretching from Mississippi and Alabama to Southern Michigan on Thursday. According to CNN, the storm is forecast to rapidly intensify overnight east of the Colorado Rockies and bring extreme weather to the Midwest on Thursday.
By late on Thursday, however, the storm is expected to weaken considerably on its route towards northeastern Canada (where it will end up on Friday). States in the East should expect some rain.

Mark Kaufman,"The nor'easter that has shut down much of New England ion Tuesday s reaching its great arms into regions over both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, sucking moisture into the powerful storm. In a technical forecast discussion on Monday night from the National Weather Service forecast office in Boston, meteorologists said the storm was even importing moisture from as far away as the Pacific Ocean. The result — aided by the storm also drawing in cold air from Canada — is a blizzard wherein enough moisture and freezing temperatures can create copious snowfall and high winds.

Andrew Freedman,"Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes. The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, expanded from nothing to 31,000 acres in just a few hours thanks to fierce Santa Ana winds. The strong winds also caused power outages, plunging thousands of residents of Santa Barbara and Ventura into the dark as flames rushed in. SEE ALSO: 'We're just existing': What it was like to survive the deadly Northern California wildfires The fire has come close to downtown Ventura, a city of more than 100,000 people about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Social media images taken by evacuating residents show nightmarish scenes of onrushing flames. According to the Ventura County Fire Department, 27,000 people have evacuated. One of the structures that succumbed to the fast-moving flames was a large apartment complex. Santa Ana winds blow offshore, from east to west, tapping into warm and dry conditions inland. Close to the coast, these winds compress the air coming off the hills and mountains to the east, further warming and drying out the air mass, and helping to dry out already combustible vegetation. The fire threat had been anticipated, as the National Weather Service issued a rare ""critical"" fire outlook for Southern California on Tuesday due to the Santa Ana wind event. High wind warnings and red flag warnings were in effect for much of Southern California. The Thomas Fire was visible from space, via the Suomi-NPP satellite as well as other observing platforms. Heat signature from the Thomas Fire depicted from the Suomi-NPP satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: NOAA. Typically, the fire season in Southern California peaks in October, but it can occasionally flare up again in November and December. In this case, a strong area of high pressure has built in across the West, and the clockwise air circulation around that high pressure is responsible for triggering the Santa Ana wind event. The Storm Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service, issued a forecast discussion on Tuesday morning warning that fire weather conditions will further deteriorate during the day, as winds increase, humidity drops, and temperatures climb. The Weather Service has designated parts of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino, and Riverside counties as being in ""extremely critical"" fire weather risk, which is the highest category. These areas could see sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the Storm Prediction Center said, with gusts up to 80 miles per hour in hills and mountains. Relative humidity levels could drop to as low as 4 percent in these areas, the center stated. The immediate Los Angeles metropolitan area is included in the slightly less serious zone of ""critical"" fire danger. The October wildfires that killed more than 40 people and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in northern California also occurred during a period when strong, dry offshore winds were present. Such winds can allow a fire to spread quickly and erratically, including by spreading burning embers far out in front of the main blaze. This hampers firefighting efforts and can force hasty evacuations.","Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes.

Mallory Locklear,"Starting at the surface, one of the Nature papers describes some peculiar activity going on at Jupiter's poles. While we've known that the northern- and southernmost regions of the planet play host to rather large cyclones, new images taken by Juno show that these cyclones are arranged in a rather strange pattern -- eight cyclones surround one large one in the north while five surround a central cyclone in the south. You can see the southern arrangement in the image above. They've been situated this way throughout multiple Juno orbits, but how they became arranged that way or why they haven't merged aren't yet understood. Two other papers took a look at the hallmark bands on Jupiter's surface and set out to determine whether the activity going on within them was related to what's going on beneath the planet's surface. Jupiter has a very distinct surface pattern with its bright and dark bands of gas, each featuring strong winds flowing in opposite directions. But scientists haven't been able to say whether that activity extends below the surface. However, by measuring small differences in the signals Juno sends back to Earth as it travels around Jupiter, researchers were able to determine that Jupiter's gravitational field isn't the same across its north and south hemispheres. And that lack of symmetry suggests that what's going on at Jupiter's surface extends deeper. For surface winds to affect something as significant as a planet's gravitational field, they have to run deeper. And building on that observation, another group was able to show that Jupiter's surface jet streams extend around 3,000 kilometers deep -- much deeper than expected -- and make up around one percent of the planet's mass. Together, these two papers answer the long-standing question of whether Jupiter's surface activity continues below -- it does. Lastly, the final paper of the four looks even deeper. While Jupiter's core is known to be fluid, mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, researchers find that from Juno's measurements, Jupiter's fluid core likely rotates as a rigid body. The scientists think that the gases within the core are electrically charged and are therefore moved around together by the planet's massive magnetic field. These studies provide a look below Jupiter's surface and not only do they answer some questions about the planet itself, they give us insight into how gas giants like Jupiter function and evolve. The Juno mission hopefully has a few more years to go and we're certainly in for more discoveries about this weird and wonderful planet if so.","The Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016 and it has already provided us with a wealth of information about the gas giant.

Darrell Etherington,"SpaceX is making a second attempt to launch its PAZ mission today, which includes the PAZ satellite from client Hisdesat, and is set for launch during an instantaneous window at 6:17 AM PST, or 9:17 AM EST. The mission was scrubbed on Wednesday due to high upper level winds, and reset for this morning. The Hisdesat payload is a satellite with radar instrumentation on board, with a planned service mission of providing monitoring activities for both government and commercial clients over an intended linespace of five and a half years. The primary payload isn’t the whole story, however – this rocket will also be carrying two test satellites for SpaceX’s global broadband satellite internet service. These two satellites will pave the way for a constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites in orbit eventually that will aim to deliver affordable, fast and low lag broadband internet to underserved areas the world over. SpaceX hopes to use this service, which it calls “Starlink,” to add an additional revenue stream to its business beyond launch operations, helping it fiscally pursue its goal of making humans an interplanetary species with missions to Mars and beyond.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

George Dvorsky,"SpaceX is set to launch a pair of experimental internet mini-satellites after yesterday’s launch was cancelled due to high winds. You can watch today’s launch of the Falcon 9 live right here starting at 9:17 a.m. Eastern (6:17 a.m. Pacific). The primary cargo of today’s launch is a 3,000-pound radar observation satellite, called Paz, owned by the Spanish government, but all the buzz is about the secondary load: a pair of SpaceX internet satellites dubbed Microsat 2a and 2b. They are the first of a planned 4,000-satellite constellation system called Starlink. With today’s launch (finger’s crossed), the Elon Musk-led company will officially enter into the internet satellite business. The cargo is packed atop a Falcon 9 rocket, which is scheduled to launch from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9:28 a.m. Eastern (6:28 a.m. Pacific), or shortly thereafter. The livefeed will go active approximately 11 minutes prior to launch, at about 9:17 a.m. PT (6:17 a.m. PT). Yesterday’s launch was postponed in hopes of more favorable weather today. “High altitude wind shear data shows a probable 2% load exceedance,” tweeted Musk yesterday. “Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow [February 22], assuming winds are better then.” The Falcon 9 was originally scheduled to go up this past Saturday, but SpaceX scrubbed the launch to perform more tests of the rocket’s fairing—the part at the tip that deploys the rocket’s payload. Parts of this Falcon 9 have been recycled from previous missions, including a first-stage booster used to launch Taiwan’s Formosat-5 satellite in August 2017, according to Space.com. SpaceX will not recover the the Falcon 9's first stage following the launch. First announced in 2015, Starlink is designed to be a massive, space-based telecommunications network involving thousands of interlinked mini-satellites. Musk has said that SpaceX is “ going to try and do for satellites what we’ve done for rockets,” and the current plan is to have a low-cost global internet service in place by the mid-2020s. Revenue gleaned from the Starlink project could be used to fund eventual missions to Mars, according to The Wall Street Journal. This will be the first launch for SpaceX since the debut launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which delivered a Tesla Roadster and a manikin named Starman to space back on February 6.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Well that escalated quickly. Hurricane Aletta became the first tropical storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on Thursday, and by Friday morning it had spun up into a Category 4 monster. The storm might not be done ramping up, either. The meteorological marvel is thankfully not forecast to make landfall (though rip currents and swells are possible along Mexico’s west coast this weekend), which means we can safely gawk at its beastly nature. The storm’s rise has been a swift one. It became a tropical storm on Wednesday and puttered around throughout the day. But things changed in a big way on Thursday into Friday. At 3 p.m. local time on Thursday, the storm became the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season as a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds. The storm’s location—in the open ocean with no interference from land—and warm waters for fuel are what caused Aletta to blow up. By 9 a.m. local time on Friday, it had ballooned into a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. That 65 mph increase in less than 24 hours more than meets the criteria for rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm’s windspeed increases at least 35 mph in a day. Even the National Hurricane Center (NHC) seems a bit agog at what happened with Aletta. “The remarkable intensification of Aletta has continued through this morning,” forecasters wrote in their most recent update about the storm. “The short-range intensity forecast is particularly difficult since there are no obvious reasons why Aletta should cease intensification.” The forecast calls for Aletta’s winds to pick up a little more speed to 145 mph before it hits rough steering winds that will tear it back down to a tropical storm by the end of the weekend. Aletta may be a beast, but the eastern Pacific is no stranger to explosively powerful storms. You may remember that this same region spawned Hurricane Patricia—the most intense hurricane ever recorded—back in 2015. That storm rapidly intensified, peaking with winds at a mind boggling 215 mph (well above the 155 mph Category 5 threshold). Rapid intensification was also a hot topic last year during Atlantic hurricane season. Four storms blew up in the Atlantic last year, including Maria. How climate change affects rapid intensification is an active area of research. Some studies indicate the most intense storms are becoming, well, more intense in parts of the Atlantic. Other findings suggest climate change could cause Atlantic hurricanes to rapidly intensify more often as they approach land. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and after three weeks of relative quiet, it appears to be waking up. Another storm is on the horizon. NHC has an eye on an area of clouds and thunderstorms currently sitting off the coast of Central America that has a 90 percent chance of organizing into a tropical system in the next 48 hours, which would be named Bud. Early signs indicate that the storm could pose more of a threat to land, potentially getting sucked into the Southwest.","Well that escalated quickly.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received. The tropical Atlantic has spawned three hurricanes, but none is more worrisome than Hurricane Florence. The National Hurricane Center advisory at 11 a.m. listed Florence as a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. That’s the threshold for major hurricanes. A hurricane hunter aircraft passed through at noon, however, and found Florence had winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 storm. Forecasts indicate Florence will continue to undergo rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm see sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period. “Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the National Hurricane center wrote in its Monday morning update. The unfortunate forecast is due to a few factors. All weekend, Florence had strong upper level winds that kept it from really being able to wind up. But those winds have since slackened and Florence’s structure has become much more stable from Sunday night into Monday. Weekly sea surface temperature departure from normal in the Atlantic. Image: NOAA The second big factor favoring Florence’s rapid intensification is the remarkably warm ocean. The storm is cruising over an area where ocean surface temperatures are up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), providing more fuel to turbocharge the hurricane. Those temperatures are about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. “Now that Florence has these ingredients, and is developing a ring of intense storms around its eye, it will likely continue to strengthen to a major hurricane, likely a Category 4 storm soon,” Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, told Earther shortly before the Category 3 and Category 4 updates came in. Tang pointed to Harvey, Irma, and Maria last year as examples of other rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic. But Florence still stands out in how much it’s expected to intensify. University of Oklahoma meteorology PhD student Sam Lillo tweeted that Sunday’s Florence forecast from the National Hurricane Center called for it to be the most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm in the past 20 years. It’s a shockingly high-confidence forecast, but one that’s based on all available lines of evidence. “Given that these models have been unanimous, cycle after cycle, in predicting Florence undergoing rapid intensification, it has given forecasters at the NHC confidence to also forecast rapid intensification,” Tang said. Research published earlier this year indicates the magnitude of rapidly intensifying Atlantic storms is on the rise. Using satellite data from 1986-2015, the researchers found that rapidly intensifying storms saw wind speeds increase 4.4 mph per decade in the eastern and central Atlantic (there was no trend in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico). The researchers attribute this to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is marked by warm waters in the Atlantic. But they also don’t rule out a climate change, which has warmed oceans the world over. Whatever the role the AMO and climate change play in influencing Florence, the impacts of the storm will likely be acute and potentially deadly. The storm is expected to smash into the East Coast by late Thursday delivering powerful surge, winds, and torrential rains. If you live anywhere between Georgia and New Jersey, pay very close attention to the forecast in the coming days.","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received.

Rich McKay,"(Reuters) - With gusting winds, triple digit temperatures and almost zero chance of rain in Northern California this week, scorching weather poses a persistent threat to firefighters battling out-of-control blazes on parched land, officials said. “Unfortunately, they’re not going to get a break anytime soon,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “It’s pretty doggone hot and dry and it’s going to stay that way,” Hurley said early Monday. Some areas in Central and Northern California could see 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) and winds of 15 mph (24 kph) with higher gusts that could fan the flames and spread embers, he said. A massive, out-of-control Northern California wildfire called the Mendocino Complex Fire that destroyed 68 homes and forced thousands to flee has become the fifth largest in state history, officials said on Sunday, as crews battled high temperatures and strong winds. It has charred more than 266,900 acres (108010.6 hectares) as of late Sunday, making it the fifth largest blaze in California’s history, officials said. The Mendocino is one of 17 major wildfires burning across California that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to declare a “major disaster” in the state, ordering federal funding to be made available to help recovery efforts. Trump said on his official Twitter account Sunday, “California wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Another fire, the nearly two-week-old Carr Fire, claimed another life Saturday, a 21-year-old apprentice lineman, Jay Ayeta, officials with the PG&amp;E Corporation said on Sunday. Ayeta died when his vehicle crashed as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain to battle in Shasta County. He was the seventh person to die in that blaze, which has scorched more than 160,000 acres in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento, including two young children and their great-grandmother whose home was overrun by flames, and two firefighters. Firefighters had managed to contain 43 percent of the Carr blaze by late Sunday, and authorities were letting some evacuees return.

Kate Conger,"If your password winds up in a mega-breach like the ones at Yahoo, Dropbox, or Tumblr, it can be easy for a hacker to take over your account—especially if you reuse the same password across multiple services. But it’s not always easy to tell if your password has been stolen, and companies can sometimes take years to notify users of a breach. One of the easiest ways to find out if your password has leaked is by checking Have I Been Pwned, a breach database run by security expert Troy Hunt. And now the password management service 1Password is trying to make it even easier by incorporating Hunt’s Pwned Passwords data into its service, TechCrunch reports. Users will be able to check their passwords to find out if they’ve been breached, and will be nudged to change their passwords if they’re not secure. Here’s how the integration works: 1Password users can access the tool by opening their password vault and clicking on one of their credentials. They then need to press Shift-Control-Option-C (or Shift+Ctrl+Alt+C on Windows), and a “Check Password” button will appear next to their password. Click that, and 1Password will let you know if your password appears in the Pwned Password database. Hunt assembled hundreds of millions of dumped credentials to create the Pwned Password data. “The point of the web-based service is so that people who have been guilty of using sloppy passwords have a means of independent verification that it’s not one they should be using any more,” Hunt wrote. “Mind you, someone could actually have an exceptionally good password but if the website stored it in plain text then leaked it, that password has still been ‘burned’.” [ TechCrunch ]","If your password winds up in a mega-breach like the ones at Yahoo, Dropbox, or Tumblr, it can be easy for a hacker to take over your account—especially if you reuse the same password across multiple services.

Eric Berger,"Enlarge / The booster on the launch pad in Florida for a launch attempt Tuesday first flew in May, 2017. reader comments 4 SpaceX began its launch campaign this year on January 7, with liftoff of the highly classified Zuma payload for the US government. Although it is not official, multiple sources have said the mission failed to reach orbit. SpaceX has said its rocket performed nominally despite any failure, and the Air Force has backed the company up on that assertion. Perhaps the biggest vote of confidence in the company is that, less than four weeks later, it is prepared to launch again. On Tuesday in Florida, during a launch window from 4:25pm ET to 6:46pm ET, a Falcon 9 rocket will attempt to launch a satellite to geostationary transfer orbit for public-private partnership between the Luxembourg Government and SES. The GovSat-1/SES-16 satellite will be used for NATO communications as well as commercial purposes. This is the sixth time SpaceX has launched a used rocket. The core for this mission has previously flown once, in May 2017, to launch the NROL-76 mission. Although the rocket will have enough propellant to try a landing after pushing the four-ton satellite into its orbit, SpaceX will not attempt to recover the booster. This is partly because the ""Of Course I Still Love You"" drone ship will be needed for the Falcon Heavy launch next week. Winds are a concern for Tuesday's launch, with only a 40 percent chance of favorable weather. Conditions are expected to be much better should a back-up attempt be required Wednesday. For those eagerly awaiting the maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket, the GovSat-1/SES-16 mission is also important because it represents SpaceX's last flight before the heavy mission. SpaceX has set a tentative launch date of February 6 for the Falcon Heavy launch from Kennedy Space Center, at a launch pad near where Tuesday's launch attempt will take place.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time. Hurricane Bud is the second of back-to-back major hurricanes to form in less than a week. The Category 3 storm is currently churning toward Baja California, though it’s thankfully forecast to weaken before likely landfall this weekend. As of 3 a.m. local time this morning, Bud was still picking up steam roughly 235 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) put Bud’s winds at 115 mph, making it a Category 3 storm. That’s the threshold for classifying storms as major hurricanes. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted a more recent satellite image with data indicating Bud had reached Category 4 strength with winds around 132 mph. Either way, it’s quite a difference from how the storm looked yesterday. At 4 a.m. local time on Sunday, Bud had winds of just 50 mph, making it a moderate tropical storm. But just as Aletta before it, Bud underwent rapid intensification thanks to warm waters and low wind shear. Rapid intensification is a term used when a storm’s winds increase 65 mph in less than 24 hours. The outer bands of Bud’s winds could reach Mexico, prompting the NHC to issue tropical storm watches from Manzanillo north to the Puerto Vallarta area. The agency also forecast that up to 10 inches of rain could fall in isolated locations on Tuesday and “cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.” From there, Bud will continue to lumber northward. While the storm is expected to strengthen a bit more in the next day or two, it will then begin gradually decaying as it moves over cooler waters. It could reach Baja California near Los Cabos by Saturday as a tropical storm where floods and mudslides could again be a concern. From there, Bud or its remnants could push into the Southwest. While it’s too early to forecast what locations could be impacted or when they could get hit, it’s worth remembering that tropical systems can bring major flash flooding to the region, so keep an eye out as the forecast develops. The remnants of Hurricane Newton reached Arizona in September 2016, the last time a tropical system impacted the Southwest. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 without much fanfare. But the season has since gotten much more active. Bud follows Hurricane Aletta last week. That storm whipped up into a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, thankfully posing no threat to land. Aletta has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and is meandering westward into the Pacific as it weakens. No other storms appear to be on the horizon, but the next one that forms and attains a name will be Carlotta.","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Strong winds that have powered the third-largest wildfire in California’s history were expected on Sunday to further fuel a blaze that has burned 267,500 acres. Nearly 8,500 firefighters are battling the so-called Thomas Fire in Southern California, which began Dec. 4 and has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and threatened 18,000 more, including homes in the wealthy town of Montecito just outside the coastal city of Santa Barbara. While the winds were expected to ease on Sunday near Santa Barbara, northeast wind gusts up to 55 mph were forecast through Sunday for parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, National Weather Service forecasters said. The blaze, centered less than 100 miles (160 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, has forced evacuations that turned neighborhoods into ghost towns and filled the air with smoke. The fire is now 40 percent contained despite hot Santa Ana winds that have powered its expansion, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank. Firefighters were employing more than 970 fire engines and 34 helicopters to battle the blaze. Firefighters keep watch on the Thomas wildfire in the hills and canyons outside Montecito, California, U.S., December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Gene Blevins “It is a beast,” Santa Barbara County Fire Department Division Chief Martin Johnson told a news conference on Saturday. “But we will kill it.” Five of 20 most destructive fires in recorded history ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire. The Thomas fire, the seventh-most destructive in state history, forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. It was also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California. On Saturday, evacuation orders were issued for parts of Santa Barbara County as high winds whipped the fire through bone-dry terrain. In Montecito on Saturday, smoke billowing from nearby canyons and pushed by the high winds choked the air, hindering aircraft from dropping flame retardant, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. An evacuation order for the city of Ventura was lifted on Saturday morning. Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. The blaze’s first fatality, he died of smoke inhalation and burns, the Ventura County Medical Examiner’s office said.

Andrew Freedman,"Damaging winds associated with the rapidly intensifying nor'easter along the east coast of the U.S. virtually shut down Washington, D.C., on Friday, with the federal government and most school districts closing to protect people from falling trees and power lines. The storm, which is undergoing a process known as bombogenesis, in which the minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, is creating a wind tunnel across the Mid-Atlantic. SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions The air is rushing between the offshore low pressure area and a high pressure area inland, leading to winds gusting to near 70 miles per hour in the Washington metro area. This is making for some rocky flights in and out of the region. A pilot report from the captain of a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet approaching Dulles on Friday morning indicates just how bad flying conditions have been. Pilots often file pilot reports, also known as PIREPS, when they encounter turbulence. Typically they are in code, and indicate the level of turbulence encountered. The PIREP on Friday, though, was direct, and a bit shocking. Look at the first PIREP in this list from the D.C. area. It's unclear which airline was operating this plane. Here's a closer look, from a tweet via the Weather Channel's Stu Ostro: The pilot reported the following in plain English: ""Turbulence moderate to severe... very bumpy on descent. Pretty much everyone on the plane threw up, pilots were on the verge of throwing up."" Winds at Dulles have been consistently gusting above 50 miles per hour on Friday, and such strong winds are likely to continue throughout much of the day and into the evening as the intense storm meanders just off the coast of southern New England. The winds even forced President Donald Trump to take a motorcade to Dulles Airport instead of the usual departure point of Andrews Air Force Base, due to the fact that Dulles has a runway that is aligned with the wind direction. Crosswinds at Andrews Air Force Base would've made takeoff there unsafe. He likely had a heckuva takeoff from Dulles.","Damaging winds associated with the rapidly intensifying nor'easter along the east coast of the U.S. virtually shut down Washington, D.C., on Friday, with the federal government and most school districts closing to protect people from falling trees and power l…",2018-03-02T17:18:06Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Pilot reports hellish, vomit-filled landing in middle of strengthening nor'easter",https://mashable.com/2018/03/02/pilot-reports-hellish-turbulence-dc-flight-noreaster/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nj9QN0F74uYJSIo5LCpOZ5RauhY=/1200x630/2018%2F03%2F02%2Fba%2F35f635151c8b43fc9222a059b55b3220.208d1.jpg,mashable,Mashable,winds,0

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Nearly half the flights at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and around a quarter of the flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were called off. The Newark airport also sidelined its AirTrain because of high winds and replaced it with shuttle buses. • More than 200,000 people were without power in Virginia, Dominion Energy reported, mostly in the northern part of the state. Forecasters were warning that other parts of the East Coast might lose power, too. • The National Weather Service said coastal flooding from high seas and storm surge could impact areas from New Jersey to Massachusetts, and warned of inland flooding from the heavy rains. • New York City and Long Island can expect heavy rain — an estimated two to three inches — and some snow mixed in, but the biggest concern will be the damaging winds in the afternoon and evening. Read more in New York Today. • Some communities in Massachusetts, including Scituate and Newburyport, urged residents to evacuate ahead of the storm. The state’s governor, Charlie Baker, warned Friday’s storm could be more severe than the Jan. 4 storm that brought historic flooding to the city. Another ‘bomb cyclone’ is expected. The dire warnings prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Governor Baker of Massachusetts said he had called in the National Guard. The Jan. 4 storm gained much attention in part because some meteorologists described it as a “bomb cyclone.” (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Meteorologists say the pressure in the center of this weekend’s storm will plummet so fast that it, too, is likely to become a bomb cyclone. Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Taunton, Mass., said the storm was essentially an area of low pressure that was moving northeast — strengthening and spiraling before it comes to a halt for about two days. While the system spins north, the strong winds will whip out around it, Ms. Buttrick said, churning up the seas and adding to the conditions that, along with “astronomically high tides” and other factors, could create the catastrophic flooding. Video The rising waters are looking ‘really bad’ near Boston. At Revere Beach, north of Boston, the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean was churning up on the shore on Friday morning, and threatening to flood homes and businesses along the beach. “The water is bad, really bad,” said Fernando Loaiza, the manager of Antonia’s restaurant. Motorists were inching slowly along the boulevard that runs the length of the beach. All along the Massachusetts coast, residents were bracing for high tides. Combined with buffeting winds, seas were expected to surge beyond the record-breaking levels of the Jan. 4 storm, which caused major damage. Already, high winds have taken down trees and branches, hurling them across train tracks and stalling subway and commuter trains, and power losses have been reported across the region. Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood and Katharine Q. Seelye from Boston; Matt Stevens and Alexandra S. Levine from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

Rachel Becker,"After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is now pummeling the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm — the strongest hurricane on record to ever strike the region. Hundreds of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate as Michael’s winds top speeds of 145 miles per hour, NBC News reports. Storm surge is expected to bring flood waters reaching 14 feet high — and already, there are “life threatening storm surge and catastrophic winds moving on shore,” the National Hurricane Center says. For those who stayed put, it’s time to seek shelter out of the way of waves and wind, Florida Governor Rick Scott warned on Twitter: “The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone.” An extreme wind warning is currently in effect for locations between Laguna Beach and Eastpoint until 2:15PM ET. Wind gusts in excess of 130 mph are expected. Shelter in place IMMEDIATELY! #HurricaneMichael pic.twitter.com/jogpNWMwTv — NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) October 10, 2018 The storm is unusually strong because of a few things: warm water in the Gulf, favorable wind conditions, and humidity. “Those are the perfect ingredients for a storm like this to really blossom,” says Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric sciences program and former president of the American Meteorological Society. It’s possible the storm could get stronger still before landfall, the National Hurricane Center says. And after Hurricane Michael hits, Shepherd doubts we’ll see a hurricane with the same name again. “It’s a life-altering, society-altering situation,” he says. “Storms of this magnitude and impact, the name is typically retired. And I fully expect this to be the case for Michael.” The Verge spoke with Shepherd about Hurricane Michael’s unprecedented strength. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. How did Hurricane Michael get so strong? Overnight it’s really blossomed into a Category 4, and the primary reasons are that it was moving into very warm water, which is somewhat unusual for this late in October. It moved into a very favorable upper wind situation where there was not very much wind shear, and there’s a lot of moisture in the eastern United States out ahead of a cold front that’s coming from the west. When Michael was further south, it was in a very difficult wind shear environment. As you know, hurricanes don’t like wind shear — when the winds change direction or speed as you go up in altitude. One of the things that’s really interesting about Hurricane Michael is that it was very resilient. It was actually still intensifying even in an environment with a lot of wind shear, which was odd. So I knew once it got into an environment with less wind shear and over warm Gulf waters, the thing was going to just explode — and that’s what we’re seeing. From space, satellites from @NASAEarth + @NOAA see #HurricaneMichael as a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Our latest space views: https://t.co/BvWmva7yU8 Latest storm weather from @NWS : https://t.co/Qk1x9RNd0k Be prepared + @FEMA resources: https://t.co/q2cgBnVW3h pic.twitter.com/wFhoVKGbU2 — NASA (@NASA) October 10, 2018 Is there anything else that can explain how Michael intensified so rapidly? We’ve been seeing these hot towers — these tall thunderstorms that form in the eyewall of the hurricane. I’ve been talking about these since my days as a scientist at NASA, because there are studies that show that when you have these hot towers, they’re more likely to indicate that the storm will go through a rapid intensification phase because they’re releasing so much heat that all that water vapor is condensing into cloud water in the storm. When water vapor condenses to form cloud water, it releases this burst of heat called latent heat — that’s really the fuel supply for these hurricane heat engines. When you have these hot towers, they’re like the supercharged pistons in the engine, if you will. You’ve got this ample warm water, you’ve got not a lot of wind shear overnight when the storm really intensified, so you can have a very efficient engine where all this water vapor is being converted to energy. What sort of hazards can we expect from the hurricane? If it stays at this intensity, and there’s evidence that it’s even still intensifying at this moment, this is going to be the strongest storm, at least on record, to ever hit this part of Florida. I think a lot of times we can overemphasize, or over play, the wind threat in a hurricane. I don’t think that’s the case with this one. There’s going to be significant wind impacts, not only at the landfall point and around the Panhandle of Florida because the storm is so large, it’s so strong. And because of the pace that it’s moving, even inland in parts of Alabama and Georgia there are going to be hurricane strength winds. So the winds are going to be a significant impact. The storm surge could be record-breaking in the coastal regions to the right of the storm. We could be seeing record eight to 13, perhaps more, feet of storm surge. [We] can’t downplay the rain. It’s not going to be a situation like Harvey and Florence where the thing stalls out and dumps three or four feet of rain. But there still could be half a foot to a foot of rainfall. And then, of course, to the right of the storm as it moves into Georgia and the Carolinas, you’ll get the tornado threats, too. It’s a horrible situation. Is it late in the year to be seeing a hurricane in the Gulf? I thought we were past the peak of hurricane season. Keep in mind with water, it takes several months for the transition from cold to warm and warm to cold. Even though air temperatures are starting to cool down, the heat characteristics of water means that the water has residual warmth for a while. That’s why the peak of the hurricane season is typically in September even though the actual hurricane season starts in June. So there’s this lag. So the waters are gradually starting to cool down from that peak in September, but they’re still typically warm enough to support hurricanes. We get hurricanes all of the time in October, that’s not unprecedented. And frankly when we do get October hurricanes, they form exactly where Michael formed, which is down in the southern Caribbean and moving into the Gulf. This is exactly what we expect from an October hurricane. I’m just cautioning that there is nothing particularly unique about a hurricane in October that takes this particular track. But yes, it certainly is interesting that it has tapped into enough warm water to explosively develop. How is climate change contributing to Hurricane Michael’s intensification? Storms like this are undoubtedly pushing more water into the coast because sea levels are higher. So when we have these types of storms and storm surge, the storm will be pushing a higher level of water than it would 50 or 70 years ago. That is something that I’m very comfortable saying, but I think only the studies over time will play out whether the warmer oceans — because of our broader, background climate change — are fueling more higher-octane storms. Physically, we understand that that should be the case, I want to clarify that. We understand from a scientific standpoint that a warming climate is causing warmer oceans, and you would think from a physics understanding of how these storms work that would lead to more intense storms. Whether I can say conclusively that that’s why this particular storm is more intense, I just think it would be irresponsible for me to speculate on that. What’s your advice to people in the area? It’s almost too late if you’re in Florida to do anything. People should have been gone a day or two ago. If they stayed in, all we can do is pray and hope that they’re okay. As the storm moves further inland, I am concerned that people further inland in my state of Georgia, for example, may not be really aware of the fact that they’re going to experience strong tropical storm to weak hurricane force winds in some parts well inland. I think that might catch a few people off guard. So hopefully they’re prepared for long power outages, perhaps trees falling down on their homes or in their yards. And for Georgia, I’m even worried about crop damage. That part of Georgia is a very agriculturally intense region of our state. It’s harvest time for some crops, so I even worry about that. How fast are we expecting this storm to move through the region? This storm is going to move quickly, which won’t mean four feet of rain like we saw in Florence or Harvey. But the downside of a quick-moving storm is that places further inland still feel the impact of a pretty powerful punch from the hurricane, because it takes a while to weaken. This is a very different storm than a Florence and a Harvey, but it carries its own unique threats because of the fact that places inland will see hurricane force winds or strong tropical storm force winds.","After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is on track to pummel the Florida Panhandle on October 10th as a Category 4 storm.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","You might want to turn the sound on. I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it. New research released on Wednesday in Nature chronicled a bizarre experiment involving lizards from Turks and Caicos, a stick, and a leaf blower. The goal? To study how hurricanes influence natural selection, of course. Last year’s brutal hurricane season took a toll on wildlife in the Caribbean, as Hurricanes Irma and Maria rattled ecosystems from the Florida Everglades to Puerto Rico’s rainforest. Researchers are still digging into how wildlife bounced back from the pounding storms, but the new research goes one step further by looking at how the storms may have left an imprint on future generations of lizards in Turks and Caicos. Scientists’ ability to tease this out involved a weird twist of academic fate. An international team of researchers had been conducting studies of populations of Anolis scriptus lizards spread across two islands. They finished their fieldwork four days before Hurricane Irma slammed into their research sites with 165-mph winds. Two weeks later, Maria plowed through the area again with 124-mph winds. That gave scientists a rare opportunity to look at whether the lizards that survived were different, on average, from the pre-storm populations. They found that the lizards who weathered the storm had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs, and shorter back legs. The researchers hypothesize that the first two qualities allowed the lizards to cling for dear life with a stronger grip than their shrimpy-limbed brethren. Meanwhile, the shorter back legs allowed them to be more aerodynamic in the hurricane-force winds, acting like a wind sock rather than a piece of sheet metal. But why just hypothesize when you can test it out, amirite? The researchers took lizards to a lab of horrors to measure what they innocuously called “performance capacity.” In this case, it meant having the lizards do their best Jim Cantore impression by having them cling to a pole while a leaf blower tossed them about in hurricane-force winds (side note: leaf blowers are no joke apparently). Amazingly, the little buggers were able to hang on, even in winds up to 108 mph. While it may look like a lizard version of Saw, the researchers stressed that no lizards were harmed—when they finally lost their grip, they flew into a nice, soft net. All of them were returned to the locations where they had been collected. Even so, there’s no way to measure the psychological trauma potentially experienced by these poor lizards.

Miriam Kramer,"There are plenty of terms meteorologists use to describe storm systems. From ""atmospheric river"" to ""jet streak,"" meteorologists love to label weather phenomena in colorful and sometimes goofy ways. (Here's looking at you, "" vorticity lobe."") But perhaps the most exotic-sounding and useful weather term floating around these days is ""bombogenesis."" SEE ALSO: Upcoming nor'easter could be even worse than the 'Bomb Cyclone' While it sounds like a band name or a fancy new video game console, bombogenesis is really just a fancy way of saying that an area of low pressure is rapidly intensifying. Specifically, to qualify as a ""weather bomb,"" the minimum central pressure of a storm must drop by at least 24 millibars within 24 hours. Some storms meet or exceed this threshold. One of the best examples of this kind of rapid intensification was the ""Bomb Cyclone"" that hit the East Coast of the in early January 2018. That storm intensified 59 millibars in 24 hours, which was the fastest intensification rate ever observed in a winter storm in that part of the world since at least the mid-1970s, according to data from David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, and Andrea Lang, an assistant professor at the University of Albany. Bombogenesis is a fairly rare occurrence, happening in a particular region in the northern mid-latitudes, such as the Northeast, a few times a season. Such intense, large-scale storms are more common in the U.S. during fall, winter and spring. Storms that ""bomb out"" are typically accompanied by strong winds, since air rushes from higher to lower pressure, as well as heavy precipitation. For example, a storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in early March 2018 was undergoing bombogenesis. It knocked out power to hundreds of thousands in the Washington, D.C. area due to strong winds in excess of 60 miles per hour, and also brought hurricane force winds to Cape Cod and the Islands. Zoomed-in satellite image of the eye-like feature in the 'bomb cyclone' on Jan. 4, 2018. Image: NOAA The storms that go through this process are fueled by intense air and moisture contrasts, such as the presence of a polar air mass across the northeastern U.S., and a warm and moist air mass sitting over the Gulf Stream waters. Aided by jet stream winds and areas of atmospheric spin, these storms can generate a lot of lift, which is a trigger for heavy rain and snow. East Coast blizzards tend to be weather bombs, as are some of the more intense North Atlantic and North Pacific winter storms. Such a storm recently caused damage in Newfoundland, where winds exceeded 100 miles per hour. That storm featured a staggering 42 millibar pressure drop in 24 hours, which helps explain the strong winds. And in the U.K., winter storm Doris rapidly intensified, too, causing damage as well. Because bombogenesis often occurs over the oceans, the National Weather Service's Ocean Prediction Center maintains one of the best catalogs of weather bomb animations. They reveal how these storms are shape shifters, going from relatively innocuous-looking spins to full-fledged, backwards shaped commas. So remember, the next time you hear the word ""bombogenesis,"" or a storm referred to as a weather ""bomb,"" it means you should take that storm seriously.","There are plenty of terms meteorologists use to describe storm systems.

Alex Davies,"The next time you feel like complaining about flying, (so, the next time you fly) a report this morning from a pilot landing at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D, should put things into perspective: “Very bump on descent. Pretty much every one on the plane threw up. Pilots were on the verge of throwing up.” The members of the cleaning crew assigned to that wretched and retched-upon Bombardier regional jet were among the many victims of the Nor’easter currently slamming the East Coast. Winds as fierce as 70 mph have downed enough power lines to leave 450,000 in the dark, forced officials to suspend rail service and close bridges, and thrown planes about like a baby whacking the mobile above its crib. This kind of storm is no fun for anyone, except, maybe, the pilots. “It’s kind of fun,” says Doug Moss, a commercial pilot and aviation consultant, even if the people outside the cockpit don’t think so. “I’m sure it scares the living daylights out of a lot of them.” When they’re cruising, pilots can avoid most turbulence with a slight change to the flight plan. But the runway is where the runway is, and there’s only one path from the air to the ground. Which can mean having to land in crosswinds that can push planes to and fro. That may look scary, Moss says. But for a competent pilot, it’s just a matter of crabbing and slipping. When the winds are calm, coming in to land is a matter of lining up with the runway as you gradually slow down and lose altitude, and lifting the nose (that’s called flaring) at the last moment to reduce your vertical speed and soften the impact. A heavy crosswind, however, will push the plane off course as it makes its approach. When you crab, as you approach, you point the nose of the plane to the left or the right, angling into the wind. The plane is flying sideways, in a sense—the way a crab walks—but doing so keeps it on course. As you shed altitude and speed, you’ll turn further into the wind, using a mix of experience and trial and error to find the right angle. When you’re just 50 or 100 feet above the ground, about to lift the nose and put rubber to runway, you switch techniques, from the crab to the slip. That means using the rudder pedals to swing the plane so the fuselage is parallel to the runway, the way it would have been from the beginning in calmer winds. Now, to counteract the crosswind, you use the ailerons (those hinged bits near the tip of the wing) to bank the aircraft, tipping the wings into the wind. Because the plane isn’t quite level, you may put one set of wheels on the ground before the other. That’s why different planes are certified for landing at different crosswind speeds—aircraft differ in what structural forces they can handle when landing in suboptimal optimal conditions. “It’s a real finesse maneuver,” Moss says. The art of flying is doing all of that smoothly enough to keep your passengers safe and their barf bags untouched. And while modern autopilot systems can do a lot of this, they only work up to a certain wind speed. The most galling of gales call for a human touch. That’s why pilots start training to make these moves as soon as they start training to fly. “By the time you’re an airline pilot, you’re so used to them, that it’s second nature to you,” says Brian Strzempkowski, an instructor at Ohio State University’s Center for Aviation Studies. Much of that training happens in simulators, where pilots refresh their skills every six months or so. Like the simulator, real life landings come with second changes. If the pilots come in at the wrong angle, or just don’t feel comfortable going for the landing, they can always pull back on the throttle, climb back up, circle around, and try again. “One thing I always try to stress to my students is always assume that every landing is going to end in a go-around,” Strzempkowski says. “If you’re always planning to do it, you’re not surprised when you have to make that call.” Even with experience in the cockpit, crosswind landings can easily go … sideways. Witness this Lufthansa Airbus A320 clipping a wing on the ground before climbing back into the sky for another go. That’s why airlines, the most nervous of nellies when it comes to questions of safety, undertake an even more dramatic maneuver when the winds get bad enough: They keep the planes on the ground. On Friday, airlines cancelled about 3,000 flights because of the Nor’easter—giving lots of passengers, and more than a few fun-loving pilots, something new to complain about.

Andrew Freedman,"In a typical winter, residents of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast might see one or two big storms, known in the region as nor'easters, because of the strong northeasterly winds that accompany them. This winter, however, is not ordinary. The second in what may turn out to be a string of three back-to-back nor'easters is set to hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast starting late Tuesday night, and lasting into Wednesday night. Like the last storm that brought damaging winds, coastal flooding, and heavy rain and snow, this one will also have its array of hazards.

The storm could slow efforts to restore electricity to hard hit areas that lost power in the last storm. The forecast details still need to be worked out, but even the big cities of Philadelphia, New York, Hartford, and Boston, are likely to see at least some accumulating snow from this storm — although a rain/snow mix is possible for a time. Computer models had been showing this storm threat for about the past week, giving meteorologists higher than average confidence in calling for a significant event. Models are also hinting at a third storm to come late this weekend, which, if it were to occur, would make for an incredibly rare string of powerful storms in a part of the country that had seen relatively quiet and unusually mild weather since January.

This pattern includes a potent area of high pressure parked near Greenland, serving as a ""block"" to weather systems trying to move northeast, and out to sea. In addition, a see-saw pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic that meteorologists keep track of, known as North Atlantic Oscillation, or NAO, currently favors stormy weather.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific. A dangerous super typhoon currently packing 170 mph winds could make landfall in Japan early next week. Typhoon Jebi, which started getting organized east of Guam on August 27, exploded to life over the last few days, intensifying from a Category 1 to a Category 5-equivalent storm between August 29-30. Currently located 300 miles northwest of Saipan, Jebi is moving northwest at 16 miles per hour, continuing its trek over open ocean into the weekend before making an expected northward veer early next week. That turn will place it on a direct course for mainland Japan. Recent model runs show a high chance of the storm making landfall near Kyoto, potentially as a powerful typhoon. “Jebi was in a fairly classic environment for rapid strengthening,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email, citing warm ocean waters and favorable upper level wind conditions. “Its forecast track is also a textbook case of recurvature,” with initial movement toward the west or northwest before curving around to the north at mid-latitudes. Henson added that because Japan’s islands run southwest to northeast, “a small change in the track could have a big impact on exactly where Jebi makes landfall.” East of Shioku and south of Honshu, the storm could kick up waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high as it approaches Japan, creating a hazard for ships, according to AccuWeather. But the real concern is the impact on the heavily populated areas within the storm’s forecast cone of uncertainty, including Tokyo. Flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds are all possible impacts. If this feels familiar, it is because we’ve been here before. Japan has already seen heavy rainfall associated with two typhoons, a tropical depression and a tropical storm this month, AccuWeather notes. In July, western and central Japan experienced historic rainfall and deadly landslides brought on in part with Typhoon Prapiroon, with Typhoon Maria following closely on its heels and delivering even more rain to the nation’s southern Ryukyu islands. With northern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity often peaking in September and lasting through November, Japan may not be out of the woods for a while.","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike. The storm could bring hurricane force winds to the Aloha State for the first time in 26 years, along with pounding surf and torrential rain. Hawaii has only seen three hurricanes reach its shores in the historical record. That could end up being both a blessing and a curse for residents living on the island as they prepare. “Risks that feel unknown to an individual can increase someone’s risk perception, and perhaps, increase their attention to messages,” Gina Eosco, a social scientist supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Weather and Air Quality, told Earther. “On the other hand, given the rarity of such an event, some individuals may feel, ‘it won’t happen here.’ In other words, they’re using optimism bias.” As of Thursday at 2 a.m. local time, Hurricane Lane was packing winds of 130 mph, making it a very dangerous Category 4. Every island is under a hurricane watch or warning and forecasters are calling for 10-20 inches of rain over a large area. Some spots could pick up 30 inches—nearly double Honolulu’s yearly rainfall—with rainfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour. Hilo has already recorded nearly a foot of rain, and landslides have been reported. Lane is chugging along at just 7 mph, allowing it to stir up large swells, and storm surge could top out at four feet. To cap all this off, the strongest winds, rains, and surge impacts tend to occur on a hurricane’s northeast flank because of the way tropical cyclones rotate in the central Pacific. That’s right where the Hawaiian islands sit relative to Lane. This is the most dire forecast Hawaii has faced since Hurricane Iniki made landfall in Kauai in 1992. That storm caused $3.1 billion in damage and left an indelible mark on Hawaiians’ memories. Having it as a touchstone could help ensure Hawaiians take Lane seriously. “Hawaiians are pretty akamai, clued up,” John Marra, director of NOAA Pacific Regional Climate Services, told Earther. “The impacts [of Iniki] imprinted on a lot of folks.... We’re a little bit more aware than you might think.” That awareness already has Hawaiians following the same sorts of preparations you’d expect to see along the Gulf Coast: boarding up windows, filling up gas tanks, and stocking up on water and food. The state has requested and the federal government has already granted a disaster declaration, which could speed the response after the storm passes. All that being said, Karl Kim, the head of the University of Hawaii’s National Disaster Preparedness Training Center, pointed out that certain groups remain very vulnerable. “[P]oor people, homeless, persons with disabilities, seniors, and immigrant communities may be at-greater risk,” Kim told Earther. A May 2018 count estimates there are 6,530 homeless people across the islands. Police in Honolulu are canvassing tent communities urging homeless to seek shelter ahead of the storm, but there are a lot of people to reach and not a lot of time left. People living in poverty could also wind up homeless after the storm, something Houston saw in the wake of Harvey. Even the best preparations could still underestimate the impacts of Lane. Marra said the breadth of areas that will likely see massive rainfall totals could stretch resources thinner and leave people forced to fend for themselves for longer in flooded, muddy conditions. Then there’s the infrastructure on the ground. The state also upgraded its building codes in 2010 so that all new residential construction must withstand wind gusts of up to 130 mph. But older buildings don’t have to be up to that code and are at-risk from both winds and flooding. If those homes collapse or roofs rip off, the flying debris could put anyone in harm’s way. Marra also raised concerns about compound flooding from storm surge and rain that would have nowhere to go except into people’s basements. All of which is to say, Lane could test Hawaii in ways Iniki did as well as new ways. If you’re in Hawaii, pay attention to the forecast and stay safe.","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence, which was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm last week, was re-upgraded to hurricane status on Sunday and looks like it is destined to barrel straight at the U.S.’ East Coast. According to CNN, odds are good that it will have strengthened to Category 4 status—meaning sustained winds in the range of 130-156 miles per hour—before the time it makes landfall later this week, likely on Thursday or Friday. CNN wrote: “Maximum sustained winds are now 75 mph, and further strengthening is forecast over the coming days,” said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. “Florence continues on a track to impact the US mainland by Thursday or Friday.” The hurricane center said, “All indications are that Florence will be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane while it moves over the western Atlantic toward the southeastern United States.” Florence was some 1,500 miles away from the East Coast and moving west at roughly six miles per hour on Sunday morning, according to CNN. It’s projected to pass between the Bahamas and Bermuda on its way to land. According to CNN, weather experts say the storm is most likely to hit in the Carolinas. However, the Washington Post noted that the hurricane’s exact placement is “within a large cone of uncertainty” and residents anywhere “Florida to southern New England” should be aware of the storm’s progression. The Post’s weather team noted that Florence will pass over oceans that are warmer than normal, which will provide fuel and “favors at least a Category 3 hurricane landfall on the Southeast coast by week’s end” (emphasis theirs). It’s possible it could become a Category 5 storm. The National Hurricane Center warned on Twitter that there may be a high risk of “storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from a prolonged heavy rainfall event inland.” Accuweather added that storm swells are expected to stretch for hundreds of miles around Florence and impact, and there’s a possibility that the storm could stall right as hits land, resulting in sustained battering of the coast and flooding. The Post wrote: In these coastal areas, heavy surf and elevated water levels arrive by Wednesday morning, and rainfall could begin by Thursday morning. Tropical-storm-force winds could reach the coastline as early as Wednesday night, at which point all outdoor preparations should be completed. Extremely dangerous hurricane-force winds could batter coastal locations Thursday into Friday. Hurricane to tropical-storm-force winds could extend inland depending on the storm’s exact track. Two tropical storms are following behind it: Isaac and Helene. Helene is expected to veer north well before coming close to the coast, though Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane as it continues heading west towards the Windward Islands, the Miami Herald wrote. In preparation for the storm, the governments of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have all declared states of emergency and are mobilizing resources. As Axios noted, many areas in the path of the storm have not seen hurricanes of this strength for decades—like Charleston, South Carolina, where the last Category 4 storm was Hugo in 1989. Thanks to rising ocean waters from climate change, the area is already prone to the phenomenon of “sunny day flooding” in good conditions. As Earther noted on Friday, this course is unprecedented. Almost all of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s position at that time have curved out to sea, other than a handful which slammed into the Dominican Republic.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs. Following some summer doldrums, a number of factors have come together to fuel a run of tropical weather. That includes Hurricane Florence, which just became the first major hurricane of the season. The storm reached Category 3 status—the threshold for major hurricanes—on Wednesday morning. The storm was packing winds of 120 mph and the National Hurricane Center said it was “still strengthening.” The storm is still out in the middle of the Atlantic, which is good news. Hurricane-force winds extend only 15 miles from its center, making it only slightly bigger than Hurricane Beryl, this season’s first hurricane (though that said, tropical storm-force winds extend 90 miles from the storm’s its core). The bad news, though, is that Florence strengthened faster than predicted. It’s also now likely to maintain hurricane strength through the weekend as opposed to yesterday’s forecast indicating it would dip back into tropical storm status. All of this is a concern because recent weather model runs take it near Bermuda by the middle of next week, with a possible U.S. landfall after that. This is not say landfall in either location is by any means a given, but it does mean that Florence is worth watching if you live in either locale. September is usually the most active time of Atlantic hurricane season, and this year has proven to be no exception. Colorado State hurricane guru Philip Klotzbach tweeted that on average, one major hurricane has formed by September 5, so we’re pretty on schedule. The tropics are expected to stay active for the next few weeks as a parade of potential storms could form. That includes an area of low pressure currently sitting to the west of Africa that’s likely to become a tropical depression by the end of this week.","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs.

George Dvorsky,"In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee. Alarmingly, winds are expected to pick up in the coming days, making a bad situation potentially worse. The latest California wildfire started in early Monday evening in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, spreading quickly to more than 15 square miles in just a few hours. The fires, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions, are devouring vegetation that hasn’t burned in decades, according to fire officials. To date, around 10,000 people have had to flee their homes. It’s a destructive and dangerous climax to what has been a devastating wildfire season in the state. As of late yesterday, the blaze had burned over 100 square miles in areas just north of Los Angeles and east of Santa Barbara. Currently, there are five active major blazes. Some 150 structures have burned down, including the 82-bed Vista del Mar Hospital in northwestern Ventura. Officials say the number of homes damaged by the wildfires is likely much higher. The wildfire is also causing mass power outages and water disruptions. Around 43,000 homes are currently without power (with more expected), and the Casitas Municipal Water District has advised residents of the city of Ventura, Upper Ojai Valley, Casitas Springs, and Foster Park to boil their tap water for about a minute before drinking and cooking. Without power, some water pumping systems and fire hydrants are inoperable, complicating matters for fire crews. The largest of the five wildfires, the Thomas Fire, has reached and skipped across the 101 freeway just north of Ventura, burning through oil fields, and reaching the Pacific Ocean. This fire is moving extremely quickly, torching an acre per second. As of Tuesday, the Thomas Fire has spanned 50,000 acres, and is listed as “zero percent contained” by fire officials. No fatalities have been reported to date, but three firefighters in LA were hurt and taken to a hospital where they’re listed in stable condition. “This is life in Southern California. This is where we live,” Mark Gennaro, who’s home of 12 years was destroyed, told The Washington Post. “I stand on that back hill and I see all that brush and I’m like, ‘Something’s gonna happen at some point.’” About 150,000 people in LA have been affected by evacuation orders for the Creek Fire near Sylmar and Lake View Terrace. Curfews have been enacted in the city of Ventura from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am. In Ventura, more than a quarter of its 100,000 residents have been told to evacuate. And it’s not over yet. After a brief respite late yesterday, the Santa Ana winds are expected to pick up today and tomorrow, gusting as fast as 35 to 50 mph, according to National Weather Service. This will likely fuel the fires even further, and possibly start new fires as it blows embers and ash elsewhere. The dry Santa Ana winds are caused by high pressure in the Great Basin and lower pressure off the coast. In the previous two years, rains have arrived prior to this stage in the wildfire season, but the region hasn’t seen any rain in the past three months. California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared state of emergency for Ventura County, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said “We expect to be out here all week fighting and containing this fire,” Some 1,100 personnel are currently battling the wildfires. “We’ve been watching all these disasters on TV, you really don’t think about when it happens to you, and what do you pack in that moment?,” said Ventura resident Samantha Wells-Zuniga on KABC news. “Now, everything that I have, except for my lovely family, is gone.” Beginning Monday night, dry conditions combined with the most intense Santa Ana wind event of the… Read more Read [ CNN, LA Times, Washington Post ]","In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee.

Typhoon Jebi made landfall in the west of the country, bringing heavy rain and winds of up to 216km/h (135 mph). In Osaka Bay it swept a tanker into a bridge and in Kyoto parts of the train station roof came down. There are warned of high waves and mudslides. There are no reports of casualties and the storm is expected to weaken as it continues to move across the country. The storm made landfall on Shikoku island around noon on Tuesday local time and then moved across Japan's largest main island of Honshu. It already left tens of thousands without power and authorities have urged people to evacuate to safety. Hundreds of flights, trains and ferries had to be cancelled.

George Dvorsky,"With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting as high as 80 miles per hour, firefighters are bracing themselves for another challenging day in Southern California. Over the course of the week, destructive wildfires in the state have forced the evacuation of more than 230,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and torched over 80,000 acres of land. Since the wildfires began on Monday evening, at least 14 different blazes have swept through a region extending from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley. The fires are being fueled by unusually strong Santa Ana winds and large amounts of dry vegetation—ironically caused by heavy rainfall earlier this year—which are now parched and dried out. The fires have caused severe traffic disruptions, closed schools and museums, and triggered power outages. The largest of the fires, the Thomas Fire, encompasses an area measuring 115,000 acres, and it’s just five percent contained. States of emergency have been declared in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, including the city of LA itself. To date, some 230,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. No deaths have been reported, but several firefighters have sustained injuries. Flying above California aboard the ISS, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky took these photos of the wildfires. Earlier this week, California’s Office of Emergency Services sent a broadcast text alert to 12 million people across seven different counties warning of the wildfires. It’s the largest alert the office has ever sent. The state is hoping to avoid a repeat of early October 2017 when wildfires killed 44 people in the state. The text didn’t ask people to evacuate, but instead advised of dangerous conditions. Meteorologists have had to adjust to the severe conditions. A color-coded system used to convey wind strength reached uncharted levels, going past the red “high” level, moving into the purple zone, which indicates “extreme” winds. Incredibly, at 80 mph (130 km/h), the winds reached hurricane-force levels. “The forecast for tomorrow is purple,” said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection. “We’ve never used purple before.” These winds are fueling existing fires, turning small brush fires into raging infernos in a matter of minutes, and blowing hot embers into adjoining areas, potentially starting new fires. These high winds are also making it difficult—if not impossible—for firefighters to do their work. On Thursday, the wildfires swept through northern San Diego county, moving toward Oceanside and other coastal communities. The Lilac fire, which extends for 4,100 acres and is zero percent contained, made its way through the Bonsall area, torching areas along State Route 76 corridor and destroying 20 buildings. Earlier this week, 29 horses— including elite thoroughbred race horses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—were killed when the fire reached the San Luis Rey Training Center. Those rescued endured severe burns, and were treated for smoke inhalation, dehydration, and stress. In Bonsall, around 500 horses had to be rescued when the Lilac Fire began to threaten the region some 45 miles north of San Diego, according to CNN. “There was so much smoke it was difficult to see,” Dan Durhan, a horse trainer, told the Associated Press. “Some of the horses were turned loose so they could be safe. They were scattered around.” Despite these losses, firefighters are making some progress. Of the 14 wildfires, five are now classified as contained (the Oak, Riverdale, Little Mountain, Meyers, and Paper fires). In Bel-Air on Thursday, the 475-acre Skirball Fire failed to get any bigger, largely the result of firefighting crews who worked along its western and northern edges near the 405 freeway and several luxurious, multi-million-dollar homes. Fire crews are also testing new technology. On Thursday, the LAFD tested a drone that used thermal imaging to sniff out hot spots, directing firefighters to areas in need of attention. Sadly, southern Californians will have to stay alert, as high winds are projected to persist until Sunday. This year’s wildfire season can’t end soon enough.

The storm is expected to reach category three strength before it makes landfall on Wednesday. Forecasters say some regions may see 12in (30cm) of rain, and storm surges of up to 12ft (3.6m). Governor Rick Scott warned residents to get out of the way, saying on Tuesday: ""This is a monstrous storm"". Is it expected to crawl up the US East Coast after making landfall in the Gulf Coast, and could bring rains to the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, warned on Tuesday that warm waters will probably further strengthen Michael before it makes landfall. Over 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has cautioned. The agency warned residents in Florida and Alabama of the risk of storm surges, damaging winds and flash flooding. Gov Scott warned in a news conference that Hurricane Michael is a ""massive storm that could bring total devastation to parts of our state, especially in the panhandle"". He added that its predicted to be ""the most destructive storm to hit the Florida panhandle in decades"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path US President Donald Trump has issued a series of warnings to prepare for Hurricane Florence, which is gathering power as it approaches the Carolinas. Mr Trump tweeted that this was ""one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years"". Florence is at present a Category Four storm, with sustained winds of about 140mph (220km/h). On its current track it is predicted to make landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, late on Thursday. A number of mandatory evacuations have been ordered in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster has given the entire coastline until noon on Tuesday to leave. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington has also ordered a mandatory evacuation of students. In its latest advisory at 23:00 eastern time (0300 GMT). the National Hurricane Center said of Florence: ""Some strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday."" It said hurricane-force winds would ""extend outward up to 40 miles (65km) from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds [would] extend outward up to 150 miles (240km)"". The 23:00 report placed Florence about 465 miles south-east of Bermuda, moving west-north-west at about 13mph. This would see it pass between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and make landfall on the North Carolina coast at about 22:00 local time on Thursday. The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was a large storm and getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boarding up under way in Holden Beach, North Carolina He said the predicted heavy rain and storm surges could threaten areas such as Charleston, which is only a few metres above sea level, and that Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. Schools in affected areas will begin to close on Tuesday and lanes on some highways will be reversed to aid evacuations. Media caption Will hurricanes like those in 2017 wreak havoc yet again? ""We are not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina,"" Mr McMaster said. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". Rainfall could be up to 20in (50cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Carolina airmen are deployed for the expected rescue efforts National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham told the Associated Press news agency: ""It's not just the coast. When you stall a system like this and it moves real slow, some of that rainfall can extend well away from the centre."" A similar event caused devastation in Texas last year when Hurricane Harvey hit. 'We were nonstop' President Trump has signed approvals for the declarations of emergency in the Carolinas and said he had spoken to the governors of the affected states. He sent out five tweets over four hours warning people to heed advice and stay safe: The US Navy is sending 30 ships stationed in Virginia out to sea. Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. Hardware store manager John Johnson told Agence France-Presse news agency there had been a rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags at his Charleston shop. ""From eight o'clock 'til two we were slammed. We were nonstop,"" he said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","High winds have shredded the American flag and the high seas are rocking at the Frying Pan, located 34 miles of the North Carolina Coast. GIF: Explore.org With an ear-splitting howl and booming surf, Hurricane Florence has arrived. The storm could be a landmark event that breaks rainfall records, leaves waterways flooded for weeks, and reshapes the Carolinas coast for decades. Florence is a super-sized, powerful Category 2 hurricane with tropical storm-force winds extending 195 miles out from its core. Because of its prodigious size, the storm has yet to make landfall, but its winds have neverthless whipped the ocean into a frenzy. Those winds can heard howling at the Frying Pan, a decommissioned lighthouse 34 miles off the North Carolina coast. The surf and storm surge are already cutting through North Carolina’s Outer Banks and bands of rain are lashing the coast. Roads from the Outer Banks have been closed and ferries have stopped running as storm surge cuts across the islands, carving new inlets, stirring sea foam, and clawing at the foundations and stilts lifting homes above the normally tranquil beach. It’s the start of what will be a hellacious few days as Florence moves ashore at a crawl and then cuts inland. Storm surge is expected to reach up to 13 feet, inundating coastal lowlands. That soggy ground also means that winds will have an easier time toppling powerlines and leading to outages. Paige Sheehan, a spokesperson for local utility Duke Energy, told Earther on Wednesday that the company had 20,000 workers at the ready to restore power, but that it was warning customers they could be without power for weeks. “People who have spent their whole career here who have not seen an event like Florence,” she said. States of emergency have been declared from Georgia to Maryland, underscoring just how wide Florence’s impacts could be. North and South Carolina as well as Virginia have ordered evacuations for coastal counties. The orders affect 1.5 million people, though some have chosen to ignore them. The storm means business. We’ll be watching it closely and updating this post periodically. Earther also has a handy list of tools you can use to track the storm, whether you’re in harm’s way or watching from afar. Update 3:45 p.m. ET: Right now, the biggest issue with Florence is storm surge. Water pushed ashore by Florence’s winds is cutting through the barrier islands of the Outer Banks and slamming into the coast. The images are dramatic and the surge is only going to get worse as the storms moves ashore. The surge is bad news, but even worse news is how long it could last. Florence’s slow movement means we could see days on end of high tides, hampering rescue efforts and increasing the risk of home being washed away. Storm surge is one of the clearest climate change links when talking about Florence. Higher seas mean higher surge. But it’s an exclamation point on an unfolding disaster: Wilmington, North Carolina saw 84 days of floods on sunny days in 2016. Update 4:06 p.m. ET: The hurricane force winds have arrived. A buoy near Wrightsville Beach (no tie to the Wright Brothers) recorded a gust of 76 mph, just a smidge over hurricane force. The graph below also shows air pressure dropping like crazy, an indicator that more powerful parts of the hurricane are coming ashore. And yet Florence’s eye is still well out to sea. Things are only going to get more wild from here.","With an ear-splitting howl and booming surf, Hurricane Florence has arrived.

Andrew Freedman,"The wildfires raging across Southern California have scorched tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and disrupted countless lives. While the scenes of flames screaming up hillsides, and smoke trailing hundreds of miles out over the Pacific are dramatic, they're not unprecedented. In fact, they're not even that rare. However, they are likely to be more damaging in the future, and more common in certain parts of California and the American West in general, thanks to climate change and other factors. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Wildfires, particularly during the fall, are endemic to California. In Southern California, the biggest blazes tend to flare up when the dry, warm Santa Ana winds blow, sometimes unceasingly for days on end. This week, for example, the Santa Ana wind event began on Monday, and is not forecast to stop until Friday night. Flames from a wildfire leap above traffic on Highway 101 north of Ventura, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2017. Image: Noah Berger/AP/REX/Shutterstock Much of the time during these events Southern California gets lucky, and there are no major blazes to speak of. It's not one of those years. This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. Known as ""El Diablo"" winds in this area, the offshore airflow was instrumental in propelling the wildfires faster than people could get out of the way, let alone allow firefighters to squelch the flames. Santa Ana winds result from a particular weather pattern featuring a high pressure area anchored over the Great Basin, and a low pressure area southwest of California, over the Pacific Ocean. The air pressure contrast between these two systems results in a funneling of air from east to west. As the air descends from the higher elevations toward the coast, it warms and dries, leading to extremely low humidity. These background conditions set the scene for a major fire, provided there's a spark. This year, there's been added fire risk from repeated heat waves that have sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, further drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. “It’s the coincidence of an ignition,"" that determines whether a Santa Ana event will lead to major fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, in an interview. ""And the two big causes of ignitions during Santa Ana wind events are power lines that blow down from the strong winds and arson."" The winds themselves can initiate a fire by downing power lines, something suspected in the fires that affected Northern California in October. Power outages preceded the Thomas Fire in Ventura on Tuesday, as well. Upper level winds showing the huge area of high pressure, or ""ridge,"" in the jet stream across the West, highlighted with the blue box. Image: earth.nullschool.net Importantly, the winds also make the fires nearly impossible to contain, blowing hot embers well ahead of the fire line, allowing blazes to hop across 10-lane highways with unsettling ease. The National Weather Service has been warning of the likelihood for ""extreme fire behavior"" with any fire that starts during this long-lasting wind event, going as far as designating the fire danger as ""extremely critical"" in the Los Angeles area. Once the fires get going, they can create their own weather, sucking in air from surrounding areas and lofting it upwards, promoting further fire growth and unpredictable behavior. Longer term trends This week, the high pressure area, or ""ridge"" in the jet stream, is extremely pronounced, part of a tendency toward more extreme weather patterns across the country. Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change. Last summer was the state's hottest on record, following a wet winter, which in turn followed the worst drought in modern California history. These episodes of weather whiplash have left the Golden State's trees stressed, making them more susceptible to toppling over from strong winds. Multiple studies have found that long-term climate change, which is mainly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, is raising the risk of large wildfires in the Western U.S. However, according to the USGS' Keeley, this doesn't apply to the lower elevations of southern California. His research has shown that the warming climate is leading to more frequent and larger fires in Northern California, particularly in high elevation forests, he said. There are broader, non-climate forces at work, too. Population growth is placing more people in harms' way, including by building in areas at the so-called wildland-urban interface, or WUI, where areas that traditionally burn as part of their natural ecology butt up against homes and businesses. In short, urban sprawl is not helping solve our wildfire problem. Keeley emphasized this point, saying that it's not just climate change, but global change that will alter wildfire severity and risk going forward. Wildfires are likely to have more catastrophic human impacts due to population growth along with climate change, he said. California statewide average temperatures for June through Nov. 2017. Image: noaa/ncei. For example, he cited a 1964 wildfire that burned almost the exact same area as the deadly Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. However, back then, the blaze caused no fatalities and only destroyed about two-dozen homes. Since that fire, though, he said the population in that area grew fivefold. “We need to be thinking about all the global changes that are taking place,” Keeley said. In the near-term, though, the Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday night, and may hit 70 miles per hour in some spots of Southern California on Thursday. In other words, this latest round of fires, which is a sign of the state's heritage and future challenge in a warming world, may yet grow worse.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""These fires may be a glimpse into SoCal's future under climate change."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-UjmGCjSM8A3WRuM-dU4wz3FFDc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F12%2F2c93672f-2bfe-c7a0%2Fthumb%2…",2017-12-06T22:40:04Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires,http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/causes-of-southern-california-terrifying-wildfires-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/44W3cplqc12pcASZtA9Xo3fYuNs=/1200x630/2017%2F12%2F06%2F0c%2Ff6cdf617cb964daf939a45ff2bdc5e85.b9168.jpg,mashable,Mashable,winds,1

Amanda Kooser,"SpaceX's Starship hopper took a beating from windy weather.
SpaceX
Before it sends humans around the moon or all the way to Mars, SpaceX needs to get its ambitious Starship spaceship into operation. A prototype ""hopper"" designed for takeoff and landing tests suffered a setback when high winds knocked its nose cone over.
SpaceX watcher Maria Pointer captured images of the incident in Texas and shared them on Facebook on Wednesday. The photos show the nose cone fallen over on the ground.  
""Starship falls around 5 a.m. But we heard metal damage from 2 a.m. onward,"" Pointer wrote in another post. ""We did not have hurricane force wind warnings.""
SpaceX founder Elon Musk confirmed the damage on Twitter, writing that 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks and the fairing was blown over. ""Will take a few weeks to repair,"" he said, adding that the tanks on the bottom end of the ship are fine.

Andrew Freedman,"Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control. At least three large fires are currently burning in and around Los Angeles, including one — the Thomas Fire — which has already burned at least 90,000 acres near Ventura. Early Thursday morning, authorities closed the 101 Freeway in both directions due to strong winds pushing fire close to the road, cutting off movement between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Evacuation orders have gone out for idyllic communities in the Ojai Valley, as well as parts of Santa Barbara, as flames move toward the coast, according to the LA Times. More evacuations are likely on Thursday. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The weather conditions on Thursday are downright dire, with strong, damaging winds rushing through mountain passes and down hillsides toward the coast. This will create extraordinarily dry air, and make any new fires or ones that are already in progress extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control. California’s fire history is replete with Santa Ana-driven, damaging blazes. However, the combination of factors present on Thursday — powerful winds, preexisting fires, desiccated vegetation, and also population growth — make it stand out as an especially risky day for the state. According to news reports, more than 200,000 people have been evacuated due to the fires, and this number may climb as the winds interact with the fires to push them in new directions at a faster clip. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which forecasts the risk of wildfires based on anticipated weather conditions, fire weather is likely to be ""extremely critical"" — a rare designation reserved for only the most threatening situations — in a swath of Southern California on Thursday. These combustible conditions are going to affect about 9.5 million people, the SPC forecasts. Another 10.7 million people reside in a ""critical"" fire weather zone, including the city of Los Angeles. Elevated fire risk is forecast for Southern California straight through Saturday. ""Large fire spread and extreme fire behavior will occur with any new/ongoing fires,"" the SPC said in a forecast discussion. Average temperatures across California during the summer months (June, July, and August) in 2017. Image: NOAA The high winds may prevent aircraft, including helicopters and heavy water bombers, from doing their work, as well. This further inhibits firefighters' ability to contain these blazes. The National Weather Service is predicting strong winds to last all day on Thursday. The winds have already exceeded hurricane force in some high elevation areas, with gusts above 75 miles per hour. While wildfires are a typical occurrence in Southern California each fall, when the dry, offshore Santa Ana winds blow, the current blazes are occurring later in the year than normal. In addition, conditions in the region are far drier than they normally would be. These fires are an illustration of how short-term weather variability can interact with longer-term climate trends to create a precedent-setting, potentially deadly extreme event. A fire sends embers all over residential neighborhoods north of Ventura, Calif. on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: Marcus Lam/LA Times via Getty Images ""The risk of large wildfires in coastal California typically peaks in Autumn after the long dry summers — typical of California’s Mediterranean climate — increase the flammability of the vegetation that fuels wildfires,"" LeRoy Westerling, a scientist researching climate and wildfire at the University of California at Merced, said in an email. ""The overlap between the dry fuels and these warm dry wind events marks the peak fire risk for the year in coastal California,"" Westerling said. ""Usually, Autumn rains put an end to the fire season by wetting fuels and raising humidity, even though wind events may continue to occur."" The problem is, Westerling noted, it hasn't rained much in Southern California since March. The state also had its hottest summer on record, which dried out the vegetation that grew after one of its wettest winters, forming a perfect weather whiplash combo that is conducive to igniting large fires. ""Southern California has remained unusually dry through November and into December this year, extending the high fire risk fueled by the confluence of dry conditions and Autumn winds that are driving the large fires burning in coastal Southern California,"" Westerling said. While these fires cannot be directly tied to climate change, since they were most likely ignited by downed power lines or arson, they are consistent with what scientists expect to occur more frequently from a warming, drying climate in much of California. The entire American West, in fact, is likely to see — and in many cases has already seen — an increase in the size and frequency of large wildfires. ""Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation as well as increasing temperatures,"" Westerling said. ""This means that the probability of extremely large wind-driven fires in California occurring later in the year is increasing.""","Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control.

Andrew Freedman,"An unusually powerful storm is threatening the East Coast of the U.S. this week with heavy snow, high winds, and record-shattering cold not seen in some places since the early 20th Century — if at all. The storm will be the result of a combination of three strong pieces of atmospheric energy, known to meteorologists as shortwaves. Think of these shortwaves as protein bars for storm formation. This particular storm, which is already beginning to form off the coast of Florida, will devour enough of them to allow it to become so powerful that it will contain hurricane force winds by the time it moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast late Wednesday night. SEE ALSO: Niagara Falls is a frigid, beautiful wonderland right now Because of the cold air in place ahead of the storm, winter storm watches and advisories for this event have been issued as far south as Florida, all the way northward to Massachusetts, which is nearly unheard of. In fact, some computer model runs show that the storm could intensify far faster than what would be required for the tempest to be known as a weather 'bomb,' for a process called ""bombogenesis."" This term refers to a low pressure area whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. By feasting off of intense atmospheric disturbances as well as differences in air masses and ocean temperatures, including the moisture rich Gulf Stream waters, the upcoming tempest is projected to exceed that intensification rate by several more millibars in 24 hours. This intensification rate, if it comes to pass, would be astonishing. Some computer models are projecting a minimum central air pressure of below 950 millibars at its peak, which would be nearly unheard of for this part of the world outside of a hurricane. For comparison, Hurricane Sandy had a minimum central pressure of about 946 millibars when it made its left hook into New Jersey in 2012. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections show that this storm is likely to reach a peak intensity that is rarely seen off the East Coast, with a minimum central air pressure of about 950 millibars. This is comparable to the air pressure measured in a Category 3 hurricane. Storm track is key The big question concerns the storm's track. As of Tuesday morning, most computer model projections and human-made forecasts showed it heading just far enough out to sea to spare all but Cape Cod and the Canadian Maritimes from a punishing blow of heavy precipitation, damaging winds, and coastal flooding. Animation of projected satellite imagery, showing the explosive storm development along the East Coast. This is NAM 3KM model data. Image: tropicaltidbits However, even a 50-mile shift westward in the storm track, which is entirely plausible at this point in the game, would put Boston in the crosshairs for potential blizzard conditions, and a 100-mile shift — which is also within the realm of possibility, would put New York City in play. The forecast trend through midday Tuesday has been to move the track slightly to the west, given forecasters in New York, Philadelphia, and Connecticut heartburn. As of Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service was forecasting 2 to 4 inches of snow in New York City from this storm on Wednesday night through Thursday, but such amounts may have to be raised dramatically if the storm shifts west, and conversely if there's an eastward shift. The track of the storm depends on the subtle interactions between the two pieces of energy diving southeastward from the Pacific Northwest, as well as energy from the southern branch of the jet stream. Even with supercomputers and other modern assets at their disposal, forecasting storms such as this one still tests meteorologists' ability to anticipate what the capricious atmosphere will do. Nova Scotia is likely to take a direct hit from this storm on Friday, with widespread power outages from hurricane force winds, along with heavy snow, heavy rain, and battering waves. This could be a storm for the record books there, as well as Downeast Maine, again depending on the exact track of the low pressure area. Stupid-level cold follows this storm Even if the storm leaves a fluffy 3 to 4 inches of snow in New York and Philadelphia, rather than a crippling blizzard with snow measured in feet, it is still going to have one dangerous impact that is quite certain to occur in those locations. The heart of cold air over North America and parts of the Arctic is currently parked over Hudson Bay, Canada. Temperature departures from average projection from the Euro model for Saturday morning, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell The enormous circulation around this storm is likely to drag this cold air down behind it, as if the low pressure area itself is reaching around and slapping New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Washington, D.C. residents right in the face. How rude. The cold weather that will result is going to be more frigid than anything that residents of the Midwest and East Coast have experienced so far during what has been an unusually intense and long-lasting cold snap. Instead of breaking daily temperature records, as dozens of cities have been, all-time cold temperature records will be threatened on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. For example, the high temperature in New York City may not get above the single digits on Saturday, with overnight lows in the metro area plunging below zero. Forecast record cold high temperatures on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018. Broken records indicated by circles. Image: nws/weatherbell Record low temperatures that have stood for decades or longer could fall, and infrastructure from home water pipes to city water mains and fire hydrants could fail in such cold. As former Weather Service meteorologist Gary Szatkowski explained via Twitter on Tuesday morning, areas that don't get much snow from this storm, but that do get into the heart of the cold air mass, could have more infrastructure problems since snow cover acts as an effective insulator to the ground below it. For people venturing out into the cold this weekend, frostbite will be a risk on any exposed skin within minutes of being outside, particularly on Friday night, as gusty winds whip across the Northeast behind the storm.

Jennings Brown,"Last month, millions of people watched the American flag that flew at the Frying Pan Tower lighthouse about 39 miles off the North Carolina coast, as a livestream showed the flag being pummeled by the 100-mph winds of Hurricane Florence. Now, that symbol of dreams and natural nightmares will live on for a good cause. Charlotte resident Richard Neal purchased the decommissioned lighthouse in 2010 for $85,000 and converted it into a bed and breakfast. But millions of Americans found out about the tower last month via a livestream from a mounted camera on the premises, maintained by Explore.org with the help of solar power and a microwave signal, according to Charlottes NBC affiliate WRAL. During last months tempest, the camera mostly focused on Old Glory as North Carolina and South Carolina residents joined bored office-dwellers far from Florences danger in watching the flag as it was shredded into a frayed mop of salty patriotism. Neal suggested to WRAL that he saw the flag as a symbol for the storm that the nation is enduring right now. Knowing that that is kind of what were going through as a country really brought me together with so many people saying, We will rebuild, we replace that, we will continue on as America, he said.

Heres what the author teased about Fire &amp; Blood: 300 Years Before A Game of Thrones, which he notes is actually part one of two planned volumes: This first volume covers all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane), along with their wives, wars, siblings, children, friends, rivals, laws, travels, and sundry other matters. For those not up on your Westerosi history, thats Aegon I, Aenys, Maegor the Cruel, Jaehaerys I (the Conciliator), Viserys I, Aegon II (and Rhaenyra), and Aegon III (the regency). Oh, and there are dragons too. Lots of dragons. Of course, the story doesnt end with the regents of Aegon III. There is a lot more history to come, and Archmaester Gyldayn will get to all that too, in FIRE &amp; BLOOD, Volume Two. But that one is a few years down the pike.

Before it sends humans around the moon or all the way to Mars, SpaceX needs to get its ambitious Starship spaceship into operation. A prototype ""hopper"" designed for takeoff and landing tests suffered a setback when high winds knocked its nose cone over.
SpaceX watcher Maria Pointer captured images of the incident in Texas and shared them on Facebook Wednesday. The photos show the nose cone fallen over on the ground.  
""Starship falls around 5 a.m. But we heard metal damage from 2 a.m. onward,"" Pointer wrote in another post. ""We did not have hurricane force wind warnings.""
SpaceX founder Elon Musk confirmed the damage on Twitter, writing that 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks and the fairing was blown over. ""Will take a few weeks to repair,"" he said, adding that the tanks on the bottom end of the ship are fine.
Musk and SpaceX unveiled the shiny Starship earlier in January. This test version won't be heading into space, but Musk says SpaceX hopes to have an orbital prototype ready around June.

Andrew Freedman,"Europeans are feeling the effects of the ""Beast from the East,"" which refers to frigid winds blowing east to west from Siberia toward the UK. Temperatures have plunged as much as 20 degrees Celsius, or 36 degrees Fahrenheit, below average for this time of year, thanks to these frigid winds. For many cities in Europe, including Rome, Munich, Amsterdam, Paris, London, and Dublin, this is the coldest weather seen in several years, if not longer. The UK Met Office has issued ""Amber"" weather warnings for snow on Tuesday, which is the highest category of warning, as a low pressure system moving from east to west is expected to bring heavy snow squalls to areas near Newcastle. SEE ALSO: Temperature rises above freezing near North Pole, as frigid air slinks toward Europe Amber warnings are also in effect for areas southeast of London on Tuesday for the threat of heavy snow. ""There is the likelihood of travel delays on roads, with some stranded vehicles and passengers, as well as delays or cancellations to rail and air travel,"" the Met Office warned. ""Some rural communities could become cut off. Power cuts may also occur and other services, such as mobile phones, may be affected."" Already on Sunday and Monday, snow flurries were flying at 10 Downing Street in London, and the Met Office was warning people to check in on the elderly and other vulnerable people not used to this cold weather and who may lack adequate heat. In Rome, snow fell, virtually shutting down the ancient city. According to the Associated Press, Rome's transportation network was ""crippled"" as heavy snow fell. Computer projection of temperature departures from average in Europe on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com A record low temperature was recorded in the German Alps, where the temperature reached minus-27 degrees Celsius, or minus-16 degrees Fahreneheit. In Moscow, a city accustomed to the cold, the temperature dropped to minus-20 degrees Celsius, or minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit, on Sunday night, the AP reported. The weather pattern responsible for this cold features a sprawling and strong area of high pressure parked near Scandinavia. The clockwise circulation of air around this high is pushing an unusually cold air mass from Siberia into Western Europe. The cold is forecast to linger all week in parts of Europe, although milder conditions may move into Spain and France during midweek. It is down to mostly -15 to -30 °C in most of NE and N Europe this morning, with some values approaching -40 °C. Note the difference between N Scandinavia and Iceland!!

Andrew Freedman,"Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but even by historical standards, the events of early December 2017 stand out. The dreaded Santa Ana winds, which transport warm, dry air from inland toward the coast, have been unceasing. The air is dry enough to ignite any vegetation exposed to a spark, be it a downed power line, carelessly-discarded cigarette, or an arsonist's can of gasoline. Through December 7, wildfires had burned more than 100,000 acres in the greater Los Angeles area alone, with more than 200,000 people evacuated from erratic flames fanned by 50 to 80-mile-per-hour winds. The Thomas Fire, in Ventura, about 60 miles northwest of downtown L.A., has proven to be the biggest blaze so far, burning at least 96,000 acres. The weather conditions have been too difficult for firefighters to gain the upper hand against many of the wildfires, with the combination of the winds, lack of significant rain for at least 8 months, and some of the driest air ever measured in this part of California. In San Diego, the National Weather Service found relative humidity levels well below 10 percent on Thursday, with tinderbox dry air draped across the entire West Coast.","Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but even by historical standards, the events of early December 2017 stand out.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The sun isnt up on Hurricane Willa, but its clear the storm is a monster. GIF: Colorado State University It was a nice two weeks of quiet in the tropics, wasnt it? Unfortunately, that quiet is over. Over the weekend, Hurricane Willa rapidly intensified into a Category 4 beast thats beelining for the Mexican coast. It will bring fierce winds, powerful surf, and rains that could trigger landslides. Willa has unfortunately followed the Hurricane Michael playbook. The storm was named on Saturday morning, and then got to work rapidly intensifying. The textbook definition for rapid intensification is a storm that sees sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over 24 hours, a criteria Willa has met and then some. Its winds jumped from 40 mph to 100 mph between Saturday and Sunday morning and kept ramping up to 155 mph by Sunday evening. That puts it a hair below Category 5 strength. On Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that slight strengthening is possible today, and Willa could become a Category 5 hurricane later this morning. Willa could weaken a bit as it nears land on Thursday afternoon or evening, which is a welcome deviation from the Michael playbook. But regardless, the storm will still be formidable. A hurricane warning extends for 175 miles along the Mexican coast from the city of Mazatlan to San Blas. Tropical storm warnings stretch even further north and south across the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. In addition to powerful winds, the storm will also bring torrential rain. The NHC calls for a wide area of 6-12 inches of rain with up to 18 inches possible. That could cause flash floods and landslides. The inland desert will also see up to 6 inches of rain, but the smaller amounts in a dry landscape could still lead to dangerous flash flooding, too. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, the NHC warned. Willa is the Eastern Pacifics 23rd named storm of the year. Thats well above the average of roughly 16 for this time of year. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure that factors in how powerful and long-lasting storms are, is also pretty bonkers. As of this morning, the ACE value for the Eastern Pacific stood at 302.5, nearly two-and-a-half times higher than normal for this time of year. A burgeoning El Niño has likely given a boost to the season owing to the warm water and weaker upper level winds in the eastern tropical Pacific. Climate change has also warmed the oceans, another key ingredient for helping hurricanes spin up and sustain themselves. Some research has suggested future warming could make Category 4 and 5 storms more common in the region, though it remains an active area of study.","It was a nice two weeks of quiet in the tropics, wasn’t it?

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Your humble Earther weather correspondent went the roof of Gizmodo Media’s offices to capture the above picture. By the time he descended to the ground floor, all hell had broken loose. Powerful winds made umbrellas abstract sculptures of plastic, metal, and fabric. And that’s too bad for their owners, as torrential rains turned city streets into rivers as lightning forked across the sky and the National Weather Service New York office urged residents to “SEEK SHELTER NOW inside a sturdy structure and stay away from windows.” Which is why I am holed up in our offices (far from windows of course!) writing this blog instead of heading home. So, what the hell happened on a day that started sunny and stayed that way until 15 minutes before the gates of hell appeared over Midtown? If you’re a Twitter user, you’ve probably seen the term derecho thrown around today, as well as on Monday when the Washington, D.C. region was buffeted by powerful storms and the president drove through an area under a freaking tornado warning (pro tip: do not do this even if you’re leader of the free world). A derecho is basically a powerful windstorm that moves in a straight line unlike tornadoes, which spin in a tight area, or hurricanes, which spin over a much larger area. Making things even more confusing: some derechos can come with tornadoes. So, was this a derecho? Well, it’s complicated. The pattern of wild weather began this morning. Those same sunny skies helped heat the land up, while winds from the south drew even more hot, humid air into the region. Temperatures peaked in the upper 80s in New York and 90s further south. A cap of stable air in the atmosphere allowed all that heat to build up, a setup that Capital Weather Gang wrote this morning would help “rapidly destabilize the atmosphere this afternoon.” We saw that start in central Pennsylvania, where the powerful series of thunderstorms built into the afternoon before lumbering toward the I-95 corridor. Along the way, they dropped hail the size of baseballs and left a wake of lightning that looks like an open wound across Pennsylvania. The storms then plowed into New York right at rush hour. I didn’t have an anemometer on the roof of Gizmodo Media HQ, but I feel safe saying it was windy as fuck. Video showed gusts swirling water out of a rooftop pool. And wind gusts have already hit 40 mph in Massachusetts, which is next in line to get hammered. Forecasts indicate winds could top out at 70 mph in some locations. So yes, storm bad. But derecho bad? According to the Storm Prediction Center, “by the present definition, derecho winds must meet the National Weather Service criterion for severe wind gusts (greater than 57 mph) at most points along the storm path.” They also have to widespread. So far, at least, this storm hasn’t met the official derecho criteria. But you should still exercise extreme caution, avoid driving on flooded roadways, and stay away from rooftops and other areas that could expose you to lightning.","Your humble Earther weather correspondent went the roof of Gizmodo Media’s offices to capture the above picture.

South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency, and residents are stocking up on essential supplies. Officials say Florence is now a category three storm with 115mph (183km/h) winds, and gaining strength. It is expected to strike the Carolinas by Thursday. Florence - which was 1,200 miles (2,000km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Monday morning - could reach category four as its draws strength from the warm Atlantic waters, say forecasters. It would be the first category three storm to hit the region since Fran ravaged North Carolina 1996. It would be the first East Coast hurricane since Jeanne struck Florida in 2004. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Florence may bring catastrophic levels of rain and flooding to coastal and inland regions. The National Weather Service warned it may be ""an extremely dangerous major hurricane"" by the time it made landfall.

Action today can avoid losses due to Florence."" Red flag warnings are keeping swimmers off beaches, as residents sandbag their homes in the communities of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, and the Outer Banks in North Carolina. ""Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,"" Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. Naval preparations Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world, is preparing to send ships away from bases to weather the storm out at sea. Two other hurricanes are currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricanes Isaac and Helene are expected to accelerate over the next several hours, but at this point, are not expected to threaten the US mainland. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""

Credit Steve Heaslip/The Cape Cod Times, via Associated Press A sprawling winter storm barreled toward the Atlantic Coast on Thursday and was expected to pound most of it with a potent mix of rain, snow, gusty winds and storm surge that forecasters warn could flood neighborhoods, knock out power and destroy homes. “Take this storm seriously!” the National Weather Service’s Boston branch warned on Twitter late Thursday afternoon. “This is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation for those living along the coast.” The effects of the nor’easter, which could linger through Saturday or beyond, are expected to stretch as far south as Georgia and South Carolina, all the way north to Maine. Weather officials say 10 inches of snow — or perhaps more — could blanket parts of New York; some areas of New England could get three to four inches of rain; and some coastal towns are expected to be hit with winds of 50 miles per hour or more. Alerts have been issued up and down the coast, but experts are warning that some of the most severe flooding could occur in places like Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts where the Weather Service said roads, basements and other structures could become inundated by three feet of water or more. In those areas, officials said, the most severe coastal flooding was likely to occur during the high tides Friday night and Saturday afternoon. “Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time,” the Weather Service said in a written warning. “This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary.” Winter Storm #Riley will become an intense #noreaster with locally major, long-lived coastal #flooding, high winds, and heavy, wet #snow that could lead to widespread power outages. https://t.co/XjELnjHJis pic.twitter.com/KAAcpib2cC — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) March 1, 2018 The dire messages prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Also Thursday, Gov.

Swapna Krishna,"It had gotten to the point where I didn't think the rocket launch would ever happen. After all, the Falcon Heavy was supposed to take flight in the spring of 2016. It turns out, though, that the development of the rocket was much more difficult than anticipated, to the point where Elon Musk admitted to the press that the project was almost canceled three separate times. And yet, I knew that if and when it did take off, I needed to be there to witness it. I've spent the last year making tentative plans and warning my friends that I might have to cancel at the last minute if the rocket launch date was scheduled. (I, thankfully, have very understanding friends.) I refused to make Thanksgiving or Christmas travel plans in 2017 because of the Falcon Heavy. I have literally scheduled my life around this rocket launch. Was it worth it? Absolutely, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. The morning of the launch was a bright sunny day, and the always-crucial weather forecast looked favorable. I was optimistic when I arrived at the press site and settled down to work. However, the assembled journalists were soon greeted with unwelcome news: the high-level winds were out of bounds for the launch. Elon Musk had specifically mentioned the wind concern the day before, so we all knew SpaceX was going to be conservative with launch conditions. They quickly delayed the scheduled launch time from 1:30 to 2 PM ET, with a launch window that extended to 4 PM ET. We expected launch delays (it was a test, after all), but that didn't stop the despair from setting in. We were desperate, and the uncertainty was grueling. To make matters worse, the winds kept up and the time kept getting pushed back further. Everyone was on edge, staring at the countdown clock in the press room, helpless to do anything. Every time the launch clock reset, the entire room would groan in unison. Like the millennial reporters that we are, we turned to Twitter to express our frustration. The time left in today's planned launch window for the Falcon Heavy is now about the length of one episode of Stranger Things — Marina Koren (@marinakoren) February 6, 2018 We all started resigning to ourselves to the possibility we'd have to return the next day. Finally, a new launch time was set: 3:45 PM ET -- SpaceX was cutting it close to the end of the window. The launch would likely not happen if anything went wrong during the countdown. We were all basically walking bundles of nerves. Even our anxiety had anxiety. There should be a bar at the NASA press site — Loren Grush (@lorengrush) February 6, 2018 I honestly don't think I was this nervous before my wedding. This is ridiculous. — Miriam Kramer (@mirikramer) February 6, 2018 Our anxiety mixed with confusion as the clock counted down and propellant was loaded. Wait, nothing was going wrong? Suddenly, we were set for launch? The fueling proceeded as scheduled, the weather continued to cooperate and the upper level winds were quiet. Everything's going smoothly with the rocket. I've been waiting for this since 2011. I am not going smoothly. — Swapna Krishna (@skrishna) February 6, 2018 When we got to about 20 minutes before launch, it started to feel real. ""Is it possible this might actually happen today?"" I asked myself. I left my computer on its desk on the press room and headed outside, squinting in the bright light, to take a look at the rocket on its pad. It's close! pic.twitter.com/VWGQgynWHL — Swapna Krishna (@skrishna) February 6, 2018 Everyone was excited, but still a little in disbelief. As that clock ticked downward though, it became real. Thirty seconds before launch, I called out the time to reporters who weren't listening in on the feed from Launch Control; surprise rippled through the ranks that it was so close. And then, ignition. Smoke billowed out from the bottom of the rocket as it began to lift off. A few seconds later, it started to move upward. It felt like the rocket was in slow motion, while simultaneously moving blazingly fast. It's hard to describe the color of the flames shooting out from the bottom of the rocket; It looked like the brightest molten lava. A few seconds later, the sound hit those of us at the press site. It wasn't just a noise I could hear; I felt the rumbling deep in my chest. As the rocket ascended, the emotion (and the years I'd been waiting for this launch to happen) hit me, and I started sobbing. I may have been standing in the middle of strangers, but I felt no embarrassment. We were united in our exhilaration. As we watched the Falcon Heavy ascend into the sky, we whispered under our breath for it to keep moving upward (""please don't explode""). After it disappeared, we knew it wasn't over. It was time to search the skies for the first stages returning to land. A few minutes later, we spotted them: two flanking boosters in a perfectly synchronized descent. The launch of the Falcon Heavy was spectacular. But it was the sheer audacity of the twin booster landing that that transformed my joy into wonder. When I heard the two sets of twin sonic booms (four in all) as the rockets touched down on their respective pads, I couldn't help but scream, ""Holy shit!"" They'd done it. And with it, SpaceX had opened a door to a new era in American spaceflight. Watching that launch (and landing) is an experience I will never forget.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least. The latest potentially bizarre weather happening to add to the list? Florence, the first major hurricane of the season, could follow a highly unusual route from the center of the Atlantic into the heart of the Eastern Seaboard thanks to a weird atmospheric setup. There are a lot of factors that will affect the storm’s track over the coming days, and slight shifts in any of them could have major consequences. A U.S. landfall is not a given by any means, but Florence is a storm that bears watching into next week, especially with the latest model runs. The storm has already had a wild ride. On Wednesday, it whipped up into a Category 3 hurricane before running into turbulent winds that are part of the subtropical jet stream, a fast-flowing river of air in the atmosphere. By Thursday, Florence had weakened back to a tropical storm. It continued its subdued simmer into Friday with winds at 65 mph. That weakening is the start of the potential bad news for the East Coast, but it also means Florence will in all likelihood spare Bermuda. Hurricanes in the Atlantic usually follow a track that looks roughly like a backwards C owing to steering winds and the location of high pressure system known as the Bermuda High that generally sits parked in the middle of the Atlantic. If the storm had kept tracking northwestward, it would eventually have gotten sucked in by the high and spit back out into the North Atlantic, potentially clipping Bermuda in the process. But weaker winds and the storm’s interaction with the jet stream have nudged it on a more westerly track that’s very unusual. “It’s so far north for that longitude that storms in the area are historically in the process of recurving toward the north,” Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, told Earther. “Not Florence.” Of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s location as of late this morning, none have come close to striking the U.S. Most have curved out to sea with the exception of a few freak storms that skirted southwest toward the Dominican Republic. Florence’s northerly position is the East Coast’s first piece of bad news. The second is that an exceptionally strong ridge of high pressure air is building to the north that could essentially bottle up Florence and keep it rumbling westward. “No hurricane can turn north into that,” McNoldy said. In other words, if the ridge comes to bear at the strength recent model runs are showing, it would put Florence on a collision course with the East Coast. Not only that, it would steer the storm over a pool of very warm water, allowing it to roar back to life and potentially reach major hurricane status again. The vaunted Euro model has pretty consistently been pointing toward an East Coast landfall and the American weather model known as the GFS has been nudging that way, too. The Friday afternoon ensemble run of the Euro pushes Florence further westward with a likely landfall in the Southeast or Carolinas. If it happens, the storm will have essentially taken an unprecedented track across the Atlantic. Still, this is not the time to freak out. Florence remains 1,800 miles east of Florida. There are still a number of moving parts that will have to fall into place to make things go wrong for East Coasters. That said, it’s the time to listen to the National Hurricane Center and weather professionals and think about how you’ll prepare if the forecast continues to shape up poorly.","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least.

Claire McInerny,"Sisters Andrea and Claudia De La Vega stand in the yard of their home in Austin. Martin do Nascimento/KUT As politicians in Washington try and figure out what to do with the DACA program — Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals — across the country, DACA recipients are working on their own plans... trying to stay in the country if Congress doesn't act in time. Andrea De La Vega, 26, says she remembers when she first realized her immigration status could hold her back. In high school, she was the editor of the school newspaper, the lead attorney on the mock trial team. She was in the top 10 percent of her class, which all but guaranteed entry into the University of Texas Austin, one of her top schools, when she applied in 2009. But Andrea was born in Mexico and found out that she didn't have a Social Security number, so she couldn't apply for student loans or scholarships. She and her sister, Claudia De La Vega, 28, wound up attending Texas colleges that worked with students who don't have documentation, but after graduation, they had no way to work. Claudia De La Vega has her hair done the night before her wedding. Martin do Nascimento/KUT So, when the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program opened up in 2012, she applied. Now, she's among the nearly 800,000 young people who have work permits and protection from deportation under the Obama-era program. Unlike many other DACA recipients, Andrea and Claudia came to the United State with their parents legally. Their father, an architect, got a job in Texas, allowing him to get a work visa that covered the entire family. Once here, Andrea and Claudia's parents started the process to get permanent residency — a process that took more than 20 years. By that time they became citizens, three of the four De La Vega kids had aged out of their parents' protection and were left with no legal status. After their college graduations, they had no way to work. ""I had no source of income,"" Claudia says. She says she found ways to make ends meet, ""Like selling stuff, going to the thrift store and reselling it on eBay,"" she says. ""Anything I could do, literally, to get some money."" Andrea faced a similar situation and was paid under the table while working at a restaurant. They had college degrees and career goals. But their immigration status prevented them from getting jobs they were qualified for – until DACA. ""I got my DACA on Feb. 14 of 2014,"" says Andrea. ""I remember being like, 'This is my Valentine.' That's how happy I was to get it."" Now Claudia is an architect, like her dad, and Andrea is an office manager for a psychiatrist. The De La Vega family walks into the Austin courthouse where Claudia and Marc will marry. Jorge Sanhueza-Lyon/KUT ""As soon as I got it, I applied to jobs in Austin and immediately moved here because it's always what I wanted to do,"" says Andrea. ""This thing was a ticket to start what I wanted to do."" DACA allowed Claudia, who worked five years on an architecture degree, to get a job in her field designing custom homes for a firm in Austin. President Trump rescinded DACA in early September, giving Congress until March figure to out an alternative plan before protections start to phase out. Some Democrats in the Senate are working toward protecting DREAMers by including an update to the program — Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals — in the new spending bill. But the De La Vega sisters have had to figure out other plans, two very different paths forward. Andrea is eligible to renew her work permit for two more years — so that's her immediate plan, but after that, it's unknown. Claudia has a more permanent solution. She and her fiancé, Marc Jorge, who is a U.S. citizen, decided to move up their wedding. Once they're married, Claudia can apply for a more permanent status. ""If it would have been me, I would have been like - 'Let's wait, in the church, with our parents and the ceremony,' "" Claudia says. ""We have to do this the right way."" But he really wanted to move forward immediately, she says. Andrea De La Vega watches as her sister Claudia gets married at the Austin courthouse. Jorge Sanhueza-Lyon/KUT Claudia and Marc have dated for three years, but have known each other since they were 15. ""He's helped me grow as a person so much,"" she says. ""He's just the most genuine, kind-hearted person I've ever met."" So Marc, Claudia, Andrea and their parents went to the courthouse in downtown Austin where they had a short ceremony with a judge. Andrea signed the marriage certificate as a witness. Marc and Claudia are now legally married... ahead of their big wedding in December. Claudia can bring the paperwork to get permanent residency like her parents and youngest brother. But she still worries about her other two siblings. ""I feel so guilty about it,"" Claudia says. ""If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't know what to do."" Andrea says she's trying to stay hopeful. She wants Congress to address immigration reform so people like her can feel safe in the place they call home. ""It's very, very upsetting to feel like you don't really have a place where you belong,"" Andrea says. ""I mean, you don't really belong in Mexico – because most of us haven't been there in years and years and years – and you don't belong here because literally the government's telling you that you don't belong here.""","When these two sisters aged out of their parents' immigration protections, DACA let them stay in the country and work.

More than 60 people have died after a powerful storm struck the Philippines, with locals reportedly taken by surprise by its strength.
Storm Usman hit the Bicol region southeast of capital Manila on Saturday.
At least 17 people are missing and the death toll is expected to rise.
One official told AFP news agency that people did not take precautions as it was not classed as a typhoon under the government's alert system.
""People were overconfident because they were on vacation mode and there was no tropical cyclone warning,"" Bicol civil defence director Claudio Yucot said.
Although the storm did not have strong winds, it brought heavy rains which triggered deadly landslides.
The tropical depression has destroyed infrastructure and displaced more than 40,000 people nationwide.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast. But while the winds are generating headlines and there’s a lot of questions about what category it will be when it makes landfall, the real issue is the water. And there’s going to be lots of it. It’s not that Florence’s winds aren’t a big deal—they are likely to be extremely dangerous and produce deadly flying debris—but there’s going to be a potentially historic amount of rainfall inland and powerful storm surge along the coast. Together, they’re responsible for 76 percent of all direct hurricane deaths. “There’s an old saying that those that live near the water will eventually live in the water,” Stephen Strader, a geographer who studies disasters at Villanova, told Earther. So let’s talk about that water likely to inundate people. Florence is likely to be a copious rain maker owing to how it fast (or slow) it moves ashore. Unfortunately, the National Hurricane Center calls for it to slow down as it reaches the Carolinas and then crawl inland as the winds in the upper atmosphere steering it slacken. That means the storm will have more time to unload heavy rain over the entire area under its shroud. But the slowing also means the bands of the heaviest rain that swirl around the hurricane are likely to do what meteorologists call training, a phenomenon where rain bands pass over one location repeatedly. It’s essential a race track for rain and can cause massive amounts of water to pile up on the ground in a very short period. While the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting a wide area of 15-20 inches of precipitations, higher localized totals are likely because of training. Some model runs show upwards of 40-50 inches could fall, obliterating the rainfall record for wettest storm set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when it dropped 24 inches of rain as it strafed the North Carolina coast. Models are but one piece of putting together a forecast, but the guidance they’re providing right now is really worrisome. “When these environmental wind patterns weaken, there is no mechanism to continue moving the [tropical cyclone],” Sarah Griffin, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of Wisconsin, told Earther. “A similar set-up happened with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area last year, causing Harvey to move very little for about 2 days.” Harvey was, of course, the biggest rainfall event to ever hit the U.S. so this is an extremely worrisome comparison. Compounding the issue of flooding is the type of summer North Carolina has had. In a word, it’s been a rainy one. A number of weather stations right in the center of Florence’s cone of probability have had some of their wettest summers on record. That means soils are saturated and won’t be able to handle the deluge that’s coming. “A lot of regions are associated with soil that drains poorly to begin with,” Strader said. “One thing we do know is when you replace natural vegetation with parking lots and homes and impervious surfaces, you increase the runoff.” So the rain is a huge issue. But it will likely be compounded by powerful storm surge on the coast, which also has the potential to be exacerbated by the storm slowing down as it approaches land. “If it stalls offshore or near the coast, storm surge threat will increase dramatically,” Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Needham said the size of the storm will also play a big role. Right now, Florence is wrapping up an eyewall replacement cycle, a sign that the storm is re-intensifying and could grow larger. If it does grow, the bigger wind field will give it a wider reach to whip more water toward the coast. Since we’re more than two days away and surge is very localized, we don’t yet have specific forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. But again, there’s bad news preceding the storm. Areas in Florence’s path are already seeing floodwaters rising ahead of the storm and tides are projected to remain high in the run up to Florence’s arrival. You can in part thank sea level rise for that, as it makes sunny day floods more common. “Even if you don’t think you’ll have to evacuate, the best thing to do is treat this as a trial run.” We can’t talk about the potential impacts of this storm without talking about how many people now call the area in Florence’s path home. Strader pointed to the fact that since 1940, the population residing in Florence’s cone of probability grew 1,325 percent, including a large spurt in the wake of Hurricane Hugo—the last major hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas—in 1989. That includes growth ringing metro areas like Myrtle Beach and Wilmington on the coast and Raleigh-Durham inland. “I’m concerned people may be taken off-guard by a change in forecast track,” Needham said. “People need to think not only about their elevation but their evacuation route. I’m also concerned for people inland who may think they will not be impacted by this event.” All the growth also means there’s a lot more of the pavement, which increases runoff and flooding. “It’s a backhand forehand slap with this event with the removal of natural wetlands that protect cities and landscape,” Strader said. Both Strader and Needham urged residents to have a plan in place before the hurricane arrives and pay attention to local authorities. South Carolina has already ordered the evacuation of a million people, and residents in the Outer Banks and elsewhere in North Carolina being told to go inland, ideally out of the river flood zone. If you live in these areas or anywhere else evacuation orders pop up, follow them even if you don’t feel you’re in harm’s way.","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast.

Though its winds had slackened to a tropical depression by Sunday, the record-setting rains it unleashed have created a flooding catastrophe that is still unfolding. The scale of that catastrophe is now becoming apparent in aerial photographs. The storm has set tropical rainfall records for both South and North Carolina. Multiple locations in North Carolina saw more than 30 inches of rain, making this the wettest tropical system to ever hit the East Coast. The relentless rain also helped Wilmington, North Carolina break its annual rainfall record with three months left to go in the year. As Florence stormed ashore, it backed up rivers with its powerful surge. It also dumped copious rain inland, leaving water with nowhere to go but over the banks of rivers and streams. More than two dozen rivers in the Carolinas are currently in a major stage of flooding, and they could take all week to recede. One of the big concerns with Florence was the storm’s potential to wreak havoc on industrial farms and coal ash sites. At least one coal ash site has started leaking, and more could be in danger as water continues to worm its way into the earthen dams that hold it back. All this is to say Florence was everything forecasters expected and more. And with climate change increasing the odds of extreme precipitation and raising sea levels, we’ll almost certainly see more storms that can cause this kind of destruction.

Mallory Locklear,"The Shooting Star light show was pre-recorded, just like Lady Gaga's American flag, but that's because Pyeongchang can get very cold and very windy. Neither of those conditions are great for drone performance and the city's weather caused Intel to cancel the planned live version of the display. However, the company is planning on doing smaller-scale, 300-drone shows during the medal ceremonies and it has tweaked the Shooting Star's design a little in order to accommodate South Korea's weather conditions. The rotor cages were changed for more stability in high winds and the drones were tested in Finland prior to the Games in order to make sure they could function in low temperatures. For the remainder of the Olympic Games, Intel will have weather monitoring and air traffic stations determining whether the drone shows can go ahead, Wired reports. So while they may not happen every night, there's a good chance you'll get to see a few light shows if you're watching the Winter Olympics.","The Winter Olympics' opening ceremony took place today in Pyeongchang and it featured a light show from a record-breaking 1,218 drones, Wired reports.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"US officials are warning Hurricane Florence could kill ""a lot of people"" with risks of ""catastrophic"" flooding as the storm begins to lash the country's East Coast. Florence, although now downgraded to a category one storm, is slow-moving and could linger for days, bringing ""copious amounts of rain"". Image copyright NASA Earth Observatory Florence is expected to make landfall at noon local time on Friday and is moving towards land with wind speeds of 90mph (150 km/h). The National Hurricane Center says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Storm will hit east coast Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland have declared a state of emergency as forecasts showed Florence dumping historic amounts of rain on the area. Tens of thousands of homes are already without power and sea water is washing through coastal streets. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see,"" Fema spokesman Jeff Byard said. Evacuation orders are in place for more than a million people. More than 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, with most of the coastal region's airports closed. Storm surges could be devastating The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina. Meteorologists have warned some rivers may see their flows ""reversed"". Storm surges are caused when huge volumes of water are pushed by hurricane-force winds. When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides. Storm could dump record rainfall Florence is forecast to dump up to one metre (40 ins) of rain in some areas after it makes landfall. The torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said North Carolina is likely to see eight months' worth of rain in two to three days. Florence's winds are still strong The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category two level of 96-110mph to a category one level of 119-153mph. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Florence was being followed in the Atlantic by two other storms - Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Isaac. But Helene is now moving north east towards the UK and Isaac is moving west across the Caribbean. How hurricanes happen Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

Some regions could also see flurries and blowing snow on Sunday afternoon.
Officials say between five and 10 cm of snow is possible by Monday morning in some areas.
Environment Canada says travel may become hazardous as the fresh snow is whipped up by the strong winds, causing reduced visibility and white-out conditions.
Officials also warn that surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.
According to Environment Canada, there is still some uncertainty regarding the track of this low-pressure system originating in Texas.

Joshua Freeman,"The GTA is seeing a blustery start to the week as strong winds continue to pummel the region, affecting road conditions and knocking out power in some areas.
A blowing snow advisory and some snow squall warnings from Environment Canada remain in effect for parts of the region.
While a wind warning for Toronto ended at around 8:20 a.m. the blustery weather is still causing some trouble for drivers.
A major pileup involving dozens of vehicles shut down Highway 400 in Barrie and left drivers and passengers stranded late Monday morning.  
The conditions Monday morning prompted a number of school bus cancellations around the GTA.
Ontario Provincial Police are also warning motorists to use extra caution on the roads because of the windy and blowing snow.
The roads are still slick, the winds are blowing and the snow is coming across with that and it can make for slippery conditions, especially on those on-ramps and off-ramps, Sgt. Kerry Schmidt told CP24 Monday morning.
He said the weather has sent a number of vehicles into ditches this morning and noted that weather conditions can vary quite a bit from area to area. He said conditions in some parts of the region today are treacherous.
Be very careful. You may be travelling in different areas and experiencing much different environmental conditions, Schmidt said. Your walk from the car to the office is not going to be pleasant, so make sure youre bundled up.
In Dufferin and Wellington counties, OPP have closed all roads due to poor visibility. Police in York Region also reported whiteout conditions in some areas as a result of blowing snow off Lake Simcoe.
Thousands without power across the province
The windy conditions have knocked out power to thousands of people across the province, as breaking branches bring down power lines and interfere with equipment.
At around 10 a.m., Hydro One reported that some 36,000 customers across the province were without power.  By 2 p.m., that number was down to 13,400.
Toronto Hydro reported that there were no major outages in the city early Monday, while a number of other utilities around the GTA reported scattered outages.  
The winds are expected to taper off later in the morning, but it will still feel chilly.
A high of -5 C is expected in Toronto, but it will feel more like -18 with the wind chill.
The low wind chill values prompted the citys chief medical officer of health to issue an extreme cold weather alert for Toronto Monday morning. The alert triggers expanded shelter space and services for the homeless.  
A low of -12 C is expected overnight, but the wind chill will make it feel more like -20.","Wind, blowing snow hampering drivers around the GTA CP24 Toronto's Breaking News Toronto under extreme cold weather alert Global News Strong winds, snow and bitter cold kick off the week in Toronto, GTA CTV News Gusting winds, blowing snow continue to batter …",2019-02-25T11:36:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cp24.com'}","Wind, blowing snow hampering drivers around the GTA - CP24 Toronto's Breaking News",https://www.cp24.com/weather/wind-blowing-snow-hampering-drivers-around-the-gta-1.4311179,https://www.cp24.com/polopoly_fs/1.2116978.1416870354!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Cp24.com,winds,0
Michael Roberts,"The much-hyped bomb cyclone that hit Denver yesterday, March 13, packed a considerable punch, and it proved deadly for Colorado State Patrol Corporal Daniel Groves, who was struck and killed on I-76 while helping a motorist just after 11 a.m. Governor Jared Polis has ordered flags statewide to be flown at half-staff in Groves's honor until after his thus-far unscheduled memorial service.
The snow totals recorded by the National Weather Service don't compare to those posted during most of the entries on our list of Denver's ten most spectacular snowstorms: Denver International Airport (where all six runways were closed yesterday afternoon; four have reopened, but 662 flights have already been canceled) measured 7.1 inches. But high winds made driving a nightmare, particularly on the eastern side of the metro area, and roads are still closed across the plains. Those winds also caused a rash of power outages. This morning, there's still no juice at thousands of Colorado homes.
An update from Xcel Energy noted that as of 7 p.m. last night, service had been restored to approximately 235,000 customers, and efforts were being made to do likewise for another 165,000, with crews assigned to toil through the night.
Continue Reading""Restoring power is our main focus to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and customers — it is of paramount importance,"" said Xcel Energy-Colorado president Alice Jackson in a statement. ""We will continue to diligently work to restore electric service throughout Colorado as quickly and as safely as possible. As we all have experienced today, this storm has brought dangerous conditions, including high winds and road closures, which have slowed restoration efforts.""
To speed the company toward this goal, around 150 Xcel Energy employees working for the firm in states to Colorado's north are being transported here and should be on the job today.
In the meantime, though, plenty of folks in metro Denver remain without power.
The image at the top of this post is a screen capture from Xcel's online electric-outage map, grabbed around 5:15 a.m. on the 14th. The circled numbers correspond to the number of outages in a given area, and the digits change as a user zooms in and out.
In a wider-angle view, central Denver shows a cumulative 167 outages affecting 6,233 people. Near the nexus of Interstate 25 and Interstate 70, there are 96 outages listed, impacting 3,236 people. Near Edgewater, the figures are 81 outages that are keeping 2,017 folks in the dark.
A closer look at downtown Denver, as seen in the second graphic here (it's from 5:20 a.m.), allows visitors to drill down even further into outages. For instance, there are a slew of outages in the City Park West and North Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Some affect single homes, while one has resulted in an interruption of service for 174 people. Around 105 people living near Coors Field are also energy-free according to the map, and 947 people living near Downing west of Cheesman Park are experiencing the same situation.

Patrick Grafton-Green,"A map showing winds around Storm Eleanor as it approaches the British Isles. Earth Nullschool Storm Eleanor is due to hit Britain on Tuesday and Wednesday. Severe weather warnings are in place across the country. Coastal areas are at the most risk with high winds and high waves. This could lead to coastal flooding. Britain is set to be battered by winds of up to 80 mph as Storm Eleanor heads for the nation's shores, forecasters have warned The fifth named storm of the season will bring ""strong winds and heavy rain"" to the UK on Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to the Met Office. Several severe weather warnings have been issued across the country with disruption expected on roads and railways. Meanwhile coastal roads and properties along Britain's western and southern coasts are vulnerable to high waves throwing beach material onto sea fronts. Forecaster Greg Dewhurst told the Standard: ""We are going to experience wet and windy weather this evening which will worsen overnight as a low pressure system moves in from the Atlantic. ""Met Éireann have named this as Storm Eleanor, and it is likely to bring very strong winds and heavy rain, first to Ireland and Northern Ireland, and then the rest of the UK through into tomorrow. ""Tomorrow the storm will move out into the North Sea but throughout the country it will be windy with some showers. ""That will be the story for the rest of the week as more low pressure systems bring unsettled weather from the west."" The Environment Agency warned earlier that strong winds and high tides could bring coastal flooding from Tuesday until Thursday. Carol Holt, the Environment Agency's flood duty manager, said: ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast — take extreme care on coastal paths and promenades, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger trying to take 'storm selfies.' ""If you're travelling, please check your route before setting off and don't drive through flood water."" A yellow weather warning has been issued for between 6pm on Tuesday and 8am on Wednesday for north east and west England, northern Ireland and parts of Scotland.

Emily Price,"If youre in New York City of Chicago this weekend you might potentially be able to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights.
The experience is thanks to s geomagnetic storm that is expected to occur in the area Saturday. Typically geomagnetic storms create solar winds that cause gas particles in Earths atmosphere to radiate light when it hits them. Saturday that geo agent storm will be hit with a coronal mass ejections (CME), which is a collection of charged particles from the layer of gas that surrounds the sun, The Points Guy reports.
The one thing scientists dont know is how strong the storm will be, and that strength will play a direct role in where youll be able to see the Northern Lights.
As for where you might see them tonight, that answer is specifically extremely northern areas like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Maine. If the storm is a strong one, Chicago and New York could also see the lights. Canada, Scandinavia, and parts of northern Britain and Ireland also might have a chance of seeing the lights.

Reuters Editorial,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Firefighters in California will be tested by vicious winds on Friday morning as they battle a huge wildfire that has claimed the life of one of their colleagues and torched more than 700 homes. Cory Iverson, 32, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection engineer, was killed on Thursday while tackling the so-called Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. “Cory Iverson... made the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of others,” said Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean during a community meeting on Thursday night. Fire officials released little information about the circumstances surrounding Iverson’s death. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that he perished in an accident near the community of Fillmore, where a mayday alert was sounded. Santa Ana winds and humidity in the single digits has helped stoke the blaze that has swept through dry vegetation since it erupted on Dec. 4 near a small private college in Ojai. It has since blackened more than 249,000 acres (about 390 square miles, or 1,000 sq km) and is now the fourth-largest wildfire on record in California since 1932. On Friday morning powerful winds are forecast which will subside during the day, the National Weather Service said. “Winds will weaken Friday, turn westerly early Saturday, then become offshore and gusty again late Saturday night through Sunday evening,” the service said in an advisory. The wildfire remained a threat to some 18,000 homes and other structures in the communities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Summerland and Montecito along California’s coastline, especially if hot, dry Santa Ana winds return. The Thomas Fire, which was 35 percent contained as of Thursday evening, has burned 729 homes to the ground and damaged another 175. The blaze has displaced more than 94,000 people. The fire and others to the south in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have disrupted life for millions of people over the last 11 days. They have caused schools to close for days, shut roads and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes and into shelters. The fires are also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California, forcing some commuters to wear protective face masks, local media reported.

 Hot, dry conditions in the Southwest, combined with the storms ferocious windswhich reached speeds of over 70 miles per hour in some placescreated widespread fire danger this week. These conditions also allowed dust to get lofted high into the air before it precipitated out farther north. Winds were strong enough to transport dust from places like the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico.
People have been posting photos on Twitter of their slightly off-color snow. As weird as this may seem, its not a first. Just last year, Europe got hit with some orange snow full of dust from the Sahara.

George Dvorsky,"NASA’s Juno space probe has been circling Jupiter for the past 20 months, and it’s been transmitting scientific data back to Earth at a furious pace. Today, astronomers are releasing four new studies based on Juno’s measurements, all of which explore the gas giant’s turbulent atmosphere and the stuff that lies beneath its cloudy surface. As their results show, the largest planet in our Solar System is even more exotic than we realized. Most of what we know about Jupiter comes from studying its surface details. Jupiter features a broad diameter that would fit nearly a dozen Earths side by side, but the massive planet spins so fast on its axis that a single day lasts a mere 10 hours. Its iconic Great Red Spot, which measures 10,160 miles (16,350 km) across, is one of many storms currently raging on the surface. Jupiter features alternating, colored bands of gas, and surface winds that blow in opposite directions, sometimes reaching speeds of 225 miles per hour (360 km/hr). This much we’re certain about, but what lies beneath Jupiter’s stormy surface could previously be summarized thusly: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Gazing intently at the cloud tops, scientists have acquired a two-dimensional perspective of Jupiter. Its winds could be shallow, extending no more than 60 to 200 miles (100-300 km) in depth, or they could go much, much deeper. Scientists had no idea. At greater depths, the gaseous atmosphere transitions into a super-dense liquid comprised of hydrogen and helium; this massive, internal ball could feature currents, bands, and other hidden internal dynamics, or it could just be single, giant fluidic mass. Again, we just didn’t know. And as for the planet’s center, that’s one of astronomy’s biggest mysteries—Jupiter’s pit could be a solid rocky core, a metallic mass, a dense liquid, or something even more alien. Thanks to the Juno spacecraft, however, our two-dimensional view of Jupiter is quickly expanding out into three-dimensions. This space probe was designed to measure Jupiter’s magnetic field and polar magnetosphere, but it was also built to gaze through its opaque clouds and investigate the planet’s gravity field, mass distribution, and deep winds; Juno allows us to see past the gas giant’s churning upper layers and directly into its guts. The latest findings in this regard were published across four papers today, all appearing in the science journal Nature. In the first study, led by Weizmann Institute of Science astronomer Yohai Kaspi, scientists have shown that—get this—Jupiter’s atmosphere and its jet streams extend a whopping 3,000 kilometers, or 1,860 miles, below cloud level. To put that into perspective, Jupiter’s atmosphere is so deep you could fit more than two Earths on top of each other and still not reach its full extent. Put another way, Jupiter’s atmospheric flows extend for 1/40th of the planet’s diameter. Below 3,000 km, the winds gradually slow down and decay. The pressure down there is about 100,000 times more powerful than what we find at Earth’s surface. Jupiter’s atmosphere, according to Kaspi’s analysis, encompasses a whopping 1 percent of Jupiter’s total mass, which amounts to three Earth masses. By contrast, Earth’s atmosphere is less than one millionth of the mass of Earth, so the discovery of such a massive interior region, which is rotating in separate east-west bands, came as a complete surprise to the astronomers. These findings were made possible owing to Juno’s ability to detect minute differences in Jupiter’s gravitational field. “We cannot reach the interior with a probe, thus we need to use sophisticated remote sensing methods to reach it,” Kaspi told Gizmodo. “One of these is gravity measurements, which can tell us a lot of information about how the interior mass is distributed. This is how we have been able to learn about the depth of the jet streams and interior structure.” Kaspi says these findings are important for understanding the nature and possible mechanisms driving Jupiter’s strong jet streams. And because the gravity signature of the jets was found to be tangled up with the gravity signal in the interior, astronomers will now have a better understanding of the interior structure, core mass, and origin of Jupiter. “Galileo Galilei viewed the stripes on Jupiter more than 400 years ago. Until now we only had a superficial understanding of them, and have been able to relate these stripes to cloud features along Jupiter’s jets,” Kaspi told Gizmodo. “Now, following this study we know how deep these extend and what their structure is beneath the cloud-level.” The second study, led by Tristan Guillot from the Université Côte d’Azur in France, was an investigation into the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere and the stuff that lies deeper still. Using Juno gravity measurements and interior models, Guillot found that Jupiter’s zonal flows extend to about 3,000 km, which matches Kaspi’s findings rather perfectly. But whereas Kaspi’s team studied gravitational anomalies, or “odd spots,” Guillot’s team analyzed Jupiter’s gravitational consistencies. So these two independent teams reached the same conclusion using different techniques, which is a good sign. Guillot’s team also found that, below 3,000 km, Jupiter rotates uniformly, rather than with zones and belts rotating at differential speeds as in the atmosphere. This is something scientists didn’t know before. “It is an almost 50-year old puzzle in planetary science that is solved,” Guillot told Gizmodo. “We didn’t know whether a gaseous planet like Jupiter—but also Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and giant exoplanets—rotates with zones and belts all the way to the center or whether, on the contrary, the atmospheric patterns are skin-deep. Many lab experiments, numerical simulations had been performed but with no clear picture emerging. Now, thanks to Juno’s amazing accuracy—it measured Jupiter’s gravity field 100 times better than before—we have the ground truth.” As for the composition of Jupiter’s core, we still don’t know the answer, but these latest results suggests it’s not a solid, but a liquid, and that it’s bigger than previous estimates. Guillot said this will be a difficult thing to prove because the pressure down at the core is 50 million times stronger than Earth’s atmospheric pressure. Good luck replicating those conditions in a lab! Luciano Iess, an astronomer at Rome’s Sapienza University, led the third study. His team studied Jupiter’s gravitational field, which is known to vary from pole to pole. But in another complete surprise to scientists, they discovered a pronounced north-south “asymmetry,” meaning the planet’s gravitational strength doesn’t match at the poles. That’s a weird result, because Jupiter is a “fluid” planet that’s rotating quickly, making it oblate, or squashed at the poles. In theory, the gas giant’s gravity, or mass distribution, should be spread equally at the poles. So what could possibly account for this? “In short: the winds,” Iess told Gizmodo, explaining that the winds are distributing mass unevenly across Jupiter. “The measurement of the depth of the winds was one of Juno’s most important science objectives. The science team realized even before launch that the most promising way to achieve this objective was to look at the asymmetric part of Jupiter’s gravity.” He says this gravitational anomaly is likely the product of dynamic phenomena, such as flows in the atmosphere. “It therefore bears the pure signature of the flows below the cloud level,” he said. “By tracking the motion of clouds on Jupiter’s surface, we know that the winds are not North-South symmetric, so also the gravity cannot be perfectly symmetric.” In the fourth and final study, lead investigator Alberto Adriani from Italy’s National Institute of Astrophysics studied the storms at Jupiter’s polar regions—areas not visible from Earth. By looking at visible and infrared scans of the poles taken by Juno, Adriani’s team was able to document a series of swirling cyclones, all of which produced dramatic polygonal patterns. At Jupiter’s north pole, eight circumpolar cyclones were seen rotating around a single cyclone, and at the south pole, the researchers found five. The exact cause of these storms remains unknown. “The cyclonic structures we observed there, over the poles, do not exist in other planets of our solar system,” Adriani told Gizmodo. “Those kind of structures give a strong characterization to Jupiter’s atmospheric dynamics and all the other similar [exoplanets] recently discovered outside our solar system.” When asked to speculate as to the cause of these cyclones, Adriani said the fast rotation of the planet and the heat coming from the deeper layers of the atmosphere are a likely culprit. “The symmetry of the structures is due to their position around the pole, namely around the rotation axis of the planet,” he said. Looking ahead, Adriani would like to combine the new data with microwave radiometer data to investigate how the deeper atmosphere interacts with Jupiter’s most “superficial” upper layers. So, a lot of questions have been answered, but many new ones are now appearing. Future studies will investigate the depth and structure of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, along with the forces that might drive the planet’s jet streams. The astronomers are also planning to use Jupiter’s gravitational field to understand more about the planet’s interior structure, including the mass of its central core. This is now possible because, for the first time ever, scientists can finally measure differential rotation inside a gas giant. Scientists are also planning to measure the way Jupiters’ spin axis moves in time, which could reveal the way its density varies in the deepest layers. Finally, Juno will also be used to measure tides raised on Jupiter that are caused by Io and its other moons. This could provide new insights into the complex inner workings of the Solar System’s largest planet.

""Hurricane Michael is primed for additional strengthening prior to landfall because the key players in the atmosphere and ocean are all conducive for it,"" Brian McNoldy, a storm researcher at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said over email. One of these key players is wind shear, which are winds that hit hurricanes at their sides and weaken, or sometimes kill, the tempests. Without these winds, there's little threatening Michael's stable, cyclone-like form. ""That helps the storm remain intact, upright, and symmetric,"" said McNoldy. By fall, these hurricane-threatening winds often pick up in the Gulf, Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview. But not this year. ""This is unusual,"" noted Judt. SEE ALSO: An appreciation of the persistently grim tweets from the Norway Ice Service A second influential factor is the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes feed off of the bath-like temperatures of sea surface waters. Without these warm waters, they couldn't even form, nor sustain themselves. And in the Gulf right now, even as the waters begin to gradually cool as fall sets in, they're still plenty warm. ""It's always warm there,"" said Judt. Lastly, there are no masses of dry air in the lower or middle portions of the atmosphere where Hurricane Michael is headed, said McNoldy. A hurricane's thunderstorms need moisture to fuel their activity, but when storms suck up dry air, they threaten to ""wrap into the circulation and choke off the thunderstorm activity,"" said McNoldy. But Michael has mostly moist air ahead. Water levels will rise well in advance of the arrival of #Michael. It's essential that residents within the storm surge warning area finish preparations to protect life and property today. pic.twitter.com/0Xz3nNkAnr NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) October 9, 2018 The storm poses a particularly severe threat to the Florida coast places like Panama City and Apalachicola as well as inland Tallahassee, because the storm is not expected to weaken much as it approaches land. ""Usually they weaken before they hit land,"" said Judt. ""The models are predicting this will not weaken before landfall, which would be very unusual."" The question of why storms typically weaken as they approach land ""is still an open science question,"" noted Judt. Some scientists have proposed drier air from nearby land can temper the storms. But as of Tuesday, any such weakening isn't in the cards for Michael. If Michael follows its expected course, it will become just the fourth major hurricane to hit the Florida panhandle since 1950.","Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Trump: Puerto Rico hurricane response an ""unsung success"" President Donald Trump has been criticised for hailing the US response to the deadly Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year as ""tremendous"". The mayor of its capital tweeted: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all."" Puerto Rico only finished restoring full power last month, 11 months after the hurricane hit. A recent report says 8% left the island after the hurricane and many died due to poor health care and other services. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US. is home to some 3.3 million people. What did the president say? He was asked at the White House what lessons could be learned from Hurricane Maria as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas. Maria, he said, was the ""hardest one we had by far because of the island nature"", adding: ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about. Media caption Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard ""The job that Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and law enforcement and everybody did working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success."" Mr Trump had said recently: ""We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico and it was a very tough one. I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we've done."" What has the response been to his latest comments? The mayor of the Puerto Rican capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal critic of Mr Trump who earlier described his response to Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"", said his latest comment ""added ""insult to injury"". Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: ""Nearly 3,000 people died. That is not a 'success'. That is a tragedy and a disgrace."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""This is an offensive, hurtful and blatantly false comment from the president."" New York Democratic primary winner Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said: ""Some of my [Puerto Rico] family just got power a few weeks ago. People are developing respiratory issues partly due to airborne fungal spores from lack of proper cleanup. The admin's response to Puerto Rico has been a disaster."" Some Trump supporters on social media accepted there had been failures but said the president had done all he could and that it was Puerto Rican officials who were to blame. What happened in Hurricane Maria? Maria made landfall in mid-September last year having just been downgraded to a category four hurricane, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and driving rain. It caused catastrophic damage to the north-eastern Caribbean and was the most intense cyclone worldwide in 2017. Infrastructure was severely damaged in Puerto Rico and the territory struggled to make repairs to the power grid, only completing the work 11 months later. Maria was estimated to have caused $100bn (£77bn) in damage. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.

For long the government there listed the death toll at only 64, although it acknowledged it was probably much higher. The island's authorities finally accepted a revised toll of 2,975 after a government-commissioned report by experts from George Washington University. This counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. The report said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane.","The president called the response to Hurricane Maria, which killed 2,975 on the island, ""tremendous"".",2018-09-11T22:32:13Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Trump's claim of success in Puerto Rico hurricane response derided,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45492197,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06kxjs7.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,winds,0
Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige. Spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane has grown into a monstrous Category 5 storm, the most powerful type of hurricane with winds now reaching 160 mph. Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center called the cyclone ""an impressive hurricane,"" and forecast that the storm will ""move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands as a hurricane Thursday through Saturday."" SEE ALSO: Why Trump's EPA wants to kill the nation's most ambitious climate change plan Hawaii's residents should ""prepare for a significant impact"" from Hurricane Lane, Ige said. National hurricane scientists emphasize that even if the center of the storm — where winds are strongest — doesn't pass directly over the islands, the state could still face serious problems from the storm. A storm this sprawling and powerful can bring threatening downpours and winds ""well away from the center of the hurricane, and impacts could be felt on any of the islands,"" the National Hurricane Center said. It's rare for powerful storms to veer near these well-populated tropical islands, in large part because hurricanes feed on warmer waters, and the oceans around Hawaii are often relatively cool for tropical seas. Yet, the National Hurricane Center notes that ocean waters along the storm's predicted track are currently ""warm enough to support a major hurricane."" Hurricane Lane is only the sixth Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific, Federal Emergency Management Agency atmospheric scientist Michael Lowry tweeted. But, Lane is the closest Category 5 storm to Hawaii that scientists have ever observed, he added. Although any year can bring warmer waters to a marine region, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and university scientists published research last year arguing that the tropical Pacific will likely see more ""extremely active"" hurricane seasons as human-caused global warming boosts ocean temperatures. As the planet continues an accelerated rate of warming due to human-caused climate change, around 95 percent of accumulated heat gets absorbed by the oceans, increasing the background levels of ocean warming and making warmer-than-normal temperatures more likely. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recently said in an interview. A classic hurricane killer is wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes on their sides and can tilt them or blow off their top. But as of Tuesday night, government forecasters didn't expect increasing wind shear around Hawaii until Thursday evening, after some major effects are likely already felt in the state. As the storm skims the islands, or perhaps even makes landfall, severe and potentially historic flooding is expected. According to the National Hurricane Center, there will certainly be battering waves on the coast and potentially ""life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall"" as water pours down the famously mountainous Hawaiian terrain.","Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige.

In a warmer atmosphere, theres more moisture being evaporated from the oceans to feed into the heaviest rain events, Mr. Henson said. Where its dry, the warmth helps moisture to evaporate from that dry land. The same process can intensify drought impacts and intensify the heaviest rains.

Michael Page,"Saturday will be a very stormy day across New England, with numerous angles to focus on. TIMING The storm will arrive first in Southern New England before dawn, before spreading into Northern New England over the course of the morning. The storm will continue through the day, pulling away late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. RAINFALL Saturday is basically a washout, aside from a few dry hours during the morning in Northern New England. Rainfall will be heaviest in parts of Eastern New England, from Rhode Island into parts of Southeastern Massachusetts. Expect a widespread 1- to 2-inches. FLOODING Street flooding will be a problem during the day with so many leaves and pine needles blocking storm drains. If possible, clear the drains in front of your house. STRONG WINDS Many of those leaves will be blown down by powerful winds blowing in off of the water. Through the interior, expect gusts 30 to 40 mph. Of course, in hilly towns, there will be some gusts closer to 50 mph. Along the coast, from Maine to the Seacoast of New Hampshire, and into Eastern Massachusetts, expect gusts around 50 mph. Gusts will be closer to 60 mph for parts of Cape Cod, the Islands, and the South Coast. Isolated power outages are likely. COASTAL FLOODING The strong onshore winds, combined with astronomically high tides following this week’s full moon and offshore waves 10 to 20 feet, will result in areas of minor coastal flooding during the Saturday afternoon high tide. That happens around 1:40 p.m. in many towns. Extreme Weather Photos: Flash Flooding in France MOUNTAIN SNOW As the storm arrives in Northern New England, the precipitation will start as a wintry mix and snow. In the high terrain of Western New England, including parts of the Berkshires, expect a dusting of one inch before a switch to rain. Along the Greens and in the Northeast Kingdom, as well as in the Whites, Central New Hampshire, and the mountains of Northern and Western Maine, expect a widespread 1-to-3-inches of snow. The highest peaks in those areas, like Mount Washington, will get six inches or more in some cases. SUNDAY AND BEYOND While the storm pulls away on Sunday, we’ll still be left with mostly cloudy skies and a few spotty showers, especially during the morning. Temperatures will be in the 50s.

Rhitu Chatterjee,"The storm spread snow and freezing rain across the Southeast on Wednesday. It's expected to intensify as it moves up the coast. Stephen B. Morton/AP The eastern United States is about to be hit by a really powerful winter storm that scientists are calling a bomb cyclone. And yes, that is a scientific term. The National Weather Service forecasts that the storm, which has struck Florida and the Carolinas, will move northward along the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Friday. It will bring snow, ice, strong winds, massive storm surges and plummeting temperatures all the way up to Maine. Here is what created this monster winter storm. First, the jet stream brought cold, dry air from Canada southward this past week, casting an unusually cold spell on the entire eastern United States. That mass of cold air eventually collided with relatively warm, moist air off the southeastern coast, giving birth to this winter storm. ""Very warm air coming next to cold air mass creates a lot of energy,"" says Jeffrey B. Halverson, a climatologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. It also creates a dramatic decline in air pressure, he says. ""The pressure is going to drop very, very rapidly."" Winter weather will impact the entire East Coast today through Friday. Here are the latest expected snow totals and current winter headlines. Strong winds will accompany the snow in many locations. Stay informed at https://t.co/VyWINDk3xP or your trusted weather source! 📱💻📺📻 pic.twitter.com/RqCr3h6XR1 — NWS (@NWS) January 3, 2018 That's where the word 'bomb' comes in, says Jeff Weber, a climatologist at the the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. ""We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone."" The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic mid-latitude cyclone. This particular one has similarities to Superstorm Sandy, which hit the eastern United States in 2012. Unlike this winter storm, Sandy began as a full-fledged hurricane. ""As it moved north, it interacted with cold air and transitioned into a baroclinic mid-latitude cyclone,"" Weber says. ""And that happened literally as the eye was getting ready to make landfall."" Sandy was more powerful than this new storm, because it had more time to build up energy as it moved north from the Caribbean, he says. Nevertheless, this winter storm is expected to be very powerful. Scientists are forecasting that the air pressure in the storm will drop by ""about 50 millibars over the next 24 hours,"" says Weber. ""So this will be a big deepening and strong intensification of the storm over the next 24 hours."" ""This storm is a big, big wind-making machine,"" says Halverson. ""This is going to cause a lot of problems."" The National Weather Service predicts between 6 and 12 inches of snowfall between Virginia Beach and Boston. Northern New England could get more than 12-18 inches. Eastern Long Island and northern New England are likely to see blizzard conditions. There will also be coastal flooding and storm surges that can destroy coastal properties and cause beach erosion, especially up along the New England coastline, says Halverson. Massachusetts and Maine are likely to see widespread power outages due to gusty wind. But the storm's impacts won't end there. ""This storm is going to pull down a huge amount of arctic air,"" says Halverson. ""On Friday and Saturday, temperatures are going to be in the gutter."" Temperatures could drop down to single digits, or even below zero. ""And if you're going to be out of power, you're really going to be in trouble."" States such as Massachusetts and Maine should prepare to shelters for people, he says. ""Sheltering for warmth is going to be key, for potentially several days.""","This powerful storm was created by a cold jet stream colliding with warm air over the Atlantic.

Dolmarie Mendez,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. As the leader of a healthcare technology company,I have the responsibility to make sure my co-workers and I are ready for anything, in both the best and the worst of times. Related: Why Every Small Business Needs a Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan While having our company headquarters in Puerto Rico gives us advantages that I wouldn’t trade for anything, Hurricane María last September brought about circumstances impossible to foresee. Our building flooded, power and telephone lines were disrupted and supermarkets and hospitals were closed for weeks. To put the devastation into perspective, Hurricane María completely destroyed more than 87,000 homes in Puerto Rico (with more than 385,000 other homes sustaining major damage). Some 250,000 Puerto Rico residents were displaced to the mainland United States, in some cases permanently. One study from the New England Journal of Medicine said that Hurricane María claimed some 4,600 lives, though the authors added that even this staggering figure could turn out to be conservative. In terms of costs, it’s estimated that Hurricane María has cost more than $90 billion. We were one of 10,000 businesses affected by the hurricane. And yet, we knew that maintaining normal operations in the face of such obstacles was non-negotiable, given the vital technical services we provide to insurance companies and medical providers. And while not every tech company will have to deal with the catastrophe of a hurricane, there will almost certainly be unforeseen obstacles that test every company’s resilience. We're in the middle of hurricane season again. Now that we're in the middle of hurricane season 2018, here are the lessons we learned that other companies facing disasters similar to ours -- especially companies in technology -- can do to ""weather the storm"" when disaster strikes. Build a team and a company culture you can trust. Running a tech startup comes with its ups and downs, especially if your company is as ambitious as ours. At Abartys Health, our mission is to use a centralized data hub among stakeholders to reduce the $750 billion loss that’s incurred every year in the U.S. healthcare industry. Related: 5 Steps to Getting Your Company Ready for a Natural Disaster When Hurricane María hit, our culture of responsibility and accountability was put to the test: I went days without being able to get in touch with several co-workers. Yet, I was confident that the work was getting done. Our programming team, for example, worked on their computers locally and later made updates to the system once they were able to access the Internet. I was particularly amazed by how effective a communication channel Slack proved to be; team members took the initiative to check in and provide project updates whenever they had internet access. In short, our talented team members were determined to keep the operation running without anyone on the leadership team having to micromanage. The whole experience validated my belief that a great company needs to prioritize cultivating talented, self-motivated and resourceful people. It also taught me that whether a company makes this a priority may become the measure of its resilience. When storm clouds hit, this is what will decide whether your company will swim or sink. Have a dependable disaster plan -- and stick to it. Almost every company has a business plan. Some companies (especially well-established ones) have business continuity plans and policies. But few companies ever consider apocalyptic scenarios. Hurricane María taught me that every company -- and tech companies in particular -- need a plan for when key infrastructure fails. Logistical challenges, such as losing electricity or internet, might seem impossible for a tech company to overcome. Operations come to a screeching halt; banking is frozen; client account executives are pushed into survival mode; and development (a constant driving force at any tech company) is put on the back burner. So, what will your company do when a disaster brings about unimaginable logistical challenges? For me, a good disaster plan should include: 1. An emergency home base. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, many of our team members worked from my co-founder’s apartment, which had a stable source of power and internet, and wasn’t severely impacted by the storm. Some team members even made it a temporary home. The level of bonding this brought about was remarkable. Because you can’t foresee how long you might be unable to operate from your normal place of business, the value of having an emergency home base when things go haywire cannot be understated. 2. A designated person to leave before a predicted disaster. Before María brought catastrophic conditions, some team members left the island in order to maintain communication with our clients. My co-founder left for Atlanta where her family is from, and our lead architect went to Miami. This helped ensure that we’d have dependable communication with our clients as well as the peace of mind that our systems would continue to run smoothly. For tech companies, having team players who are strong communicators, competent both in the big picture of your company as well as the finer technical points and individual relationships is always an asset. 3. Logistical and technical considerations made beforehand. Electricity is something we all take for granted. But what do you do -- especially if you’re a tech company -- if the power goes out? We were fortunate that a board member had access to generators through a personal connection. We also purchased and delivered several generators for our team in the aftermath of the storm. Having a back-up plan for logistical needs in the face of calamity will provide much-needed aid in maintaining business operations and help staffers regain a sense of normalcy. 4. A means for maintaining contact with clients (and leads). Facing and overcoming unexpected challenges when it comes to delivering for a client is a natural part of entrepreneurship. If we hadn't appreciated this before Hurricane María, we could have been in serious trouble. As the hurricane approached, we were right in the middle of closing a major client. Before the storm made landfall, I forwarded my co-founder (who'd left for Atlanta) every piece of client communication I had, knowing that we would be without electricity for a few days (that loss would last for months for much of the island ). Not only was she able to close the deal, she also communicated the new client’s needs to our lead architect in Miami. Of course, some clients were dealing with the same catastrophe as we were. To give their businesses peace of mind,my co-founder called and emailed these clients to tell them their data was safe. The bottom line is that disasters happen. You need to maintain your calm with clients and maintain as much normalcy as possible. 5. Sensitivity to your team’s needs. A disaster like this can put everything into perspective. As important as it is to maintain normalcy with clients, providing support for your co-workers is just as important, if not more. Start by understanding the needs of every team member on a personal level. When María struck, the last thing we wanted was for our colleagues to have to choose between being there for their families and meeting a deadline at work. Our VP of engineering, for example, lives in a remote area of the island and has two small children at home. After the hurricane, he had to fill up his own water tank for months on end just to have water in his house. This often required him to leave the office early and, sometimes, he could make it in only a few times per week. Not only were we happy to make this concession, but we provided support for him and his family in other ways as well. The lesson is, if the leaders of a company don’t have genuine concern for the well-being of their team members, they can’t expect them to perform their jobs at a high level. This may seem obvious, but once again, the advent of disaster put this notion into stark relief. In sum, disasters are, by their nature, unpredictable. Even when we knew Hurricane María was coming, before the storm made landfall, the impact was far greater than we could have anticipated. Related: Hurricane Maria Almost Destroyed This Entrepreneur's $300,000 Franchise Investment. Here's How She Moved Forward.

Gael Fashingbauer Cooper,"The origin of the White Walkers may be revealed in the new show. HBO Game of Thrones fans celebrated last week when HBO revealed it's ordered a pilot of one of the five possible successor shows to the fantasy hit. But the premium cable network was about as generous with the details as Cersei is about sharing her wine. All HBO revealed was a fairly generic statement that hinted at details without really sharing any. The only real tidbit was that the show promised to explore the true origin of the creepy White Walkers. But author George R.R. Martin, whose Song of Ice and Fire book series inspired the series, spilled a little more news on his website on Monday. Martin reminded fans that HBO has only ordered a pilot episode, meaning the show might not come to series. He also reminded them that since it's set 10,000 years before Game of Thrones, none of fans' current favorite characters will appear. And he has high praise for Jane Goldman, who will serve as showrunner for the new series. There's no director, cast, location or title yet, Martin says -- but he does have a title idea. ""My vote would be The Long Night, which says it all, but I'd be surprised if that's where we end up,"" he wrote. ""More likely HBO will want to work the phrase ""game of thrones"" in there somewhere. We'll know sooner or later)."" In Martin's writings, The Long Night was a winter night that lasted for an entire generation, freezing and starving thousands of people. It was then that the undead White Walkers first came to Westeros, seeking to create an endless winter and kill or reanimate everyone and everything they touch. As for the other successor shows, Martin reveals that one of them ""has been shelved,"" but that the other three remain alive. ""Three more Game of Thrones prequels, set in different periods and featuring different characters and storylines, remain in active development,"" Martin said. ""Everything I am told indicates that we could film at least one more pilot, and maybe more than one, in the years to come."" And Martin knows what question is always on fans' minds: When is the long-awaited sixth book in the series, Winds of Winter, coming out? Sheesh, Westerosi, he's working on it. ""And yes, before you ask, work on Winds of Winter continues, and remains my top priority,"" he writes. ""It is ridiculous to think otherwise. If I wasn't busy with Winds, don't you think I'd be scripting one or more of these pilots myself?"" CNET Magazine : Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition.

Timothy J. Seppala,"For now, she's doing consulting work, a bunch of research and ""exploring a lot of VR stuff."" That she specifically mentioned working with virtual reality is interesting. Especially when you remember which company is doing some of the most aggressive investments in VR hardware and software -- Oculus. The company's vice president of content is Jason Rubin, who cofounded Naughty Dog in 1986. The last game Naughty Dog released under Rubin's leadership was Jak 3. He served as the sequel's writer and director. The latter is a title he shared with Hennig; Jak 3 was the first game she worked on at the studio. When I spoke with Evolve and Left 4 Dead studio Turtle Rock last fall, the team told me its push into VR was the result of an existing relationship it had with Rubin. As such, it wouldn't be unexpected if Hennig's indie studio, whenever it fully forms, winds up making games for Oculus devices. As for Hennig's last project with EA, the too-good-to-be-true Uncharted-style romp in a galaxy far, far away, which EA said would continue on? ""That project is on the shelf right now,"" she told Eurogamer. ""I have not worked at EA since January, technically, legally,"" she said when asked if she was still creative director on the game. ""I haven't been in [touch], but look I get along with all those people. I consider even the guys on the exec team friends.

MARK LANDLER,"VALPARAISO, Fla. For President Trump, it has become a recurring ritual of the fall. He and his wife, Melania, landed here on Monday to tour the damage from another hurricane, Michael, which tore through the Florida Panhandle last week, leaving a path of utter destruction behind it. Mr. Trump was scheduled to tour the Gulf Coast of Florida, where hurricane winds of 155 m.p.h. lifted houses from their foundations in towns like Mexico Beach, leaving piles of debris for miles. On the way back to Washington, the president is also scheduled to stop in Georgia, where the damage from winds was less devastating but the rains caused severe flooding, not unlike Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas several weeks ago. The White House issued little information about the presidents schedule. But if it follows recent practice, Mr. Trump will be briefed on the relief and recovery efforts by federal, state and local officials, then tour some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods.","Visiting storm-ravaged communities has become a ritual for President Trump.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida Hurricane Michael has all but rubbed a Florida beach town off the map after landing like the ""mother of all bombs"". The storm smashed into the state's north-west coast near the community of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon packing 155mph (250km/h) winds. Over 1.4m homes had no power in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas on Friday morning. One of the most powerful hurricanes in US history, Michael has now killed at least 11 people. Rescuers are still searching for survivors. The storm, which fell just 2mph short of a top-level category five, ripped apart entire neighbourhoods, reducing properties to kindling and rubble. Michael's shrieking winds and surging seas knocked row after row of Mexico Beach beachfront homes from their foundations. Image copyright AFP Image caption US Coast Guard photo of Mexico Beach, Florida Gone with the wind By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Mexico Beach, Florida One of the first things you notice as you walk into Mexico Beach is the stillness. No wind, almost no-one on the street, just the beating hot sun and the debris: debris everywhere, tossed and scattered - the calling card of a monstrous storm. And then you hear faint bleeping sounds coming from all directions - a dissonant symphony of high-pitched notes that turn out to be myriad small alarms, still transmitting their warnings from the batteries which power them. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Much of the damage in Mexico Beach, Florida was caused by the over-100mph winds. On the left, as we walk, there's a mattress slumped at the roadside, on the right a Dean Koontz novel lies in the dirt. Picking our way through a mass of rubble and detritus that was once a house, we spot an American flag on the ground; in amongst it all there is also a toy car and a cracked glass plate from a microwave. A little further on, and a woman, accompanied by a friend, is sifting through the remains of her home, loading what she can salvage into the boot of a car. This was her dream retirement place she tells me - the last four years spent doing it up. ""I'll never step back in there,"" she says through her tears. The sheer force of Hurricane Michael has been well analysed, but it's only when you see the everyday stuff of people's lives crushed, broken, smashed to pieces, that you realise they will be living with this long after we have gone. One weeping resident on CNN struggled to even find her street, let alone her home. Tom Bailey, the town's former mayor, told the New York Times: ""The mother of all bombs doesn't do any more damage than this."" The storm was so powerful that it snapped boats in two and knocked over 30-ton freight rail cars like toys. Some 285 people in Mexico Beach - population 1,000 - defied a mandatory evacuation order and stayed behind to ride out the storm. Linda Marquardt, 67, who hunkered down with her husband, told AP news agency: ""All of my furniture was floating. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man in Mexico Beach, Florida walks past a home that was knocked from its foundation ""A river just started coming down the road. It was awful, and now there's just nothing left."" An insurance firm, Karen Clark &amp; Company, estimated Michael caused about $8bn (£6bn) in damage. By early Friday morning, the storm was about 65 miles (105km) northeast of Norfolk, Virginia, with winds of 60mph, said the US National Hurricane Center. Motorists had to be rescued on Thursday from cars trapped by high water in North Carolina, a state still reeling from last month's Hurricane Florence.

Police said there were five suspected tornados in Virginia. But it was Florida's Panhandle that bore the brunt of the tempest. Thousands of National Guard troops, police and rescue teams are converging on the area. US Army personnel have been using heavy equipment to clear away fallen trees so rescuers can reach any trapped residents. Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) crews are using dogs, drones and GPS in the search.

""We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,"" Stephanie Palmer, a Fema firefighter, told Reuters news agency. Flooding destroyed 1,000 homes in the small town of Port St Joe, not far from Mexico Beach. Mayor Bo Patterson said: ""We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they're on the other."" Image copyright Getty Images The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to reach 20,000 across five states by Friday, said the American Red Cross. The 11 known dead so far are one in North Carolina, one in Georgia, four in Florida and five in Virginia. A 38-year-old motorist in North Carolina was killed when a tree fell on his car on a highway east of Statesville. Eleven-year-old Sarah Radney, who was visiting her grandparents in Seminole County, Georgia, died when a metal carport near their home was lifted by powerful winds and then slammed through their roof. Four people were killed in Florida's Gadsden County in storm-related deaths. One of the dead there was identified by local officials as Steven Sweet, 44, who was killed when a tree fell on his home. On Friday, police in Virginia confirmed five deaths related to the storm. Among the dead in that state was James King,45, killed after his vehicle was caught in flash flood water in Pittsylvania County. The waters were too deep and swift for rescuers to reach him, officials say. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

Bill Chappell,"A satellite image shows Hurricane Florence looming in the Atlantic Ocean as the sun rises over the U.S. Florence is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to North Carolina and South Carolina on Thursday. NOAA/STAR Hurricane Florence is blasting toward the Carolinas, carrying sustained winds of up to 130 mph and the threat of ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall,"" the National Hurricane Center says. A hurricane warning – meaning hurricane conditions are expected within 36 hours — is in effect for a long stretch of the coast, from the Santee River in South Carolina to Duck, N.C. — part of the Outer Banks. Hurricane conditions will likely hit on Friday, but tropical storm conditions will arrive on Thursday, the hurricane center said. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the agency says. The threat has sparked a rush of evacuation efforts in South Carolina and North Carolina, with more than a million people urged to get out of Florence's way. Governors of those states have already declared states of emergency, as have the governors of Virginia and Maryland. Hurricane Florence is now expected to head more directly west after making landfall, cross through South Carolina. The storm will bring dangerously high amounts of rain, forecasters say. NOAA/NWS, Esri, HERE, Garmin, USGS Forecasters have adjusted Hurricane Florence's predicted path, saying that after it makes landfall, it will likely take a more southerly route than had previously been expected. Rather than pushing up toward western Virginia, the storm's center is now predicted to move across the middle of South Carolina. For a swathe of the North Carolina shore from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout, the storm surge could range from 9-13 feet, the NHC said. In Myrtle Beach, S.C., and nearby areas, the surge could hit 6-9 feet. As of 8 a.m. ET, Florence was 530 miles southeast of Cape Fear, N.C., moving west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. ""An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft that was in the hurricane until just after midnight"" recorded a peak wind gust of around 150 mph, the hurricane center said. Florence is currently heading for ocean water with surface temperatures of around 85 degrees, meaning it will likely strengthen on its way to the East Coast. Even with some weakening that's predicted just before it makes landfall, the storm ""is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane as it approaches the coastline,"" the hurricane center said. Satellite images show the storm has maintained a distinct eye, and it's well organized. Its maximum sustained winds are expected to top 145 mph before it loses some steam near the coast. Current forecasts call for its winds to be at least a Category 3 storm when it arrives at the Carolinas. ""A motion toward the northwest is forecast to begin by this afternoon and continue through Thursday,"" the hurricane center says. ""Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday, and move slowly through early Saturday."" Rainfall totals from Hurricane Florence will top 20 inches in some areas, the National Weather Service says. National Weather Service The slow movement, combined with the massive amount of moisture this storm holds, will bring dangerous rains – from 20 to 30 inches in coastal North Carolina, with 40 inches possible in isolated areas, the weather service says. In South Carolina and inland parts of North Carolina, 5 to 10 inches of rain could fall, with 20 inches possible in some areas. ""This rainfall would produce catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding,"" the hurricane center said.","Rather than pushing up toward western Virginia, the storm's center is now predicted to move across the middle of South Carolina after it makes landfall.",2018-09-12T13:02:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Hurricane Florence Zeroes In On Carolinas, Bringing 130 MPH Winds",https://www.npr.org/2018/09/12/647005403/hurricane-florence-zeroes-in-on-carolinas-bringing-130-mph-winds,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/12/flo-satellite-color_wide-b1d67968e6ceb5343b2ec3d747874a434da725cd.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,winds,1

"Jay Croft, CNN","How are you preparing for Hurricane Florence? Text, iMessage or WhatsApp your videos, photos and stories to CNN: 347-322-0415 (CNN) Forecasts generally have Wilmington, North Carolina, as the city most likely to bear the brunt of powerful Hurricane Florence as it makes landfall. But no matter where the monster storm ultimately crosses the southern East Coast of the US, Florence's high winds and heavy rains will hit communities for miles north, south -- and even west. Damaging effects from the storm are expected to be felt far inland, particularly as it's projected to stall once it crosses the coastline. A big worry with Florence is that the system could linger for days, similar to the manner in whch Harvey hovered over Texas last year. That means high rainfall totals and consequent inland flooding could become a huge concern. The current forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls for more than 20 inches of rain where the storm makes landfall. But more than 10 inches is forecast for a larger area, including most of eastern North Carolina inland to just north of Richmond, Virginia. A new National Hurricane Center map predicting the likelihood of tropical storm-force winds stretches from northern Florida to eastern Kentucky and Ohio, and even up to the New York City area -- although there's only a 5% to 10% chance of those conditions stretching that far north. Tropical storm force winds have sustained speeds of at least 39 mph.

Gina Cherelus,"(Reuters) - Gulf Coast residents should “take this storm seriously”, the National Weather Service said early on Sunday, as Subtropical Storm Alberto drove north, threatening heavy rains and winds to the southern coastal states. Florida, Alabama and Mississippi declared states of emergency on Saturday as the storm threatened up to 12 inches of rain over the Memorial Day weekend and tidal surges and damaging winds, according to Patrick Burke of the weather service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “This is jogging more to the east and will hit the Florida panhandle,” Burke said. “We’re talking eight to 12 inches of rain this weekend, and storm surges on the Gulf Coast.” “It’s heavy rainfall on the entire coast,” he said. The first named Atlantic storm of 2018 is expected to intensify and bring wind speeds of up to 65 miles per hour to the Gulf Coast when it approaches over the holiday on Monday, he said. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Mississippi/Alabama border to the Aucilla River in Florida. Rainfall totals of between 5 and 10 inches, with up to 15 inches, are possible from eastern Louisiana to Mississippi, Alabama, western Tennessee and the western Florida panhandle, the NWS said. All 67 Florida counties were issued the emergency notice to give state and local governments enough time and resources to prepare, Florida Governor Rick Scott said in a statement. “As we continue to monitor Subtropical Storm Alberto’s northward path toward Florida, it is critically important that all Florida counties have every available resource to keep families safe and prepare for the torrential rain and severe flooding this storm will bring,” Scott said. His Mississippi and Alabama counterparts also declared states of emergency, citing the threat of coastal and inland flooding from storm rains. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey issued a state of emergency covering 40 counties beginning at 6 a.m. on Sunday. “Whether you’re a resident of this state or just visiting, you need to stay updated on this evolving tropical system,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement. “I ask everyone to please make final preparations to your family emergency plan, especially those that live in mobile homes and low-lying areas.” On Saturday evening, the storm was located about 95 miles north of the western tip of Cuba and 275 miles southwest of the Dry Tortugas, which is almost 70 miles west of Key West, Florida, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). Alberto, which spun up days before the formal start of the 2018 hurricane season, was moving north at about 13 mph with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph, and higher gusts, on Saturday, the NWS said. Gradual strengthening is forecast until the system reaches the northern Gulf Coast. Alberto’s projected storm track has shifted eastward since Friday, lessening its threat to the active oil production areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Royal Dutch Shell plc and Exxon Mobil evacuated some personnel from offshore Gulf oil facilities on Friday.

Rich McKay,"(Reuters) - Former subtropical storm Alberto, which threatened to clobber the southeastern United States on Memorial Day, fizzled into a subtropical depression, with winds dropping to 35 mph (56 kph) as it rolled into southern Alabama on Tuesday, officials said. At its height, it was blasting sustained winds of 65 mph (105 kph) with gusts that packed full hurricane punches of 75 mph (121 kph), said meteorologist David Roth of the National Weather Service. “It’s slowly weakening and it’s not regaining any strength,” Roth said. “The chances of it spinning off tornadoes now has dropped to virtually zero.” Forecasters had feared the storm could bring dangerous high water to southern coastal states and possible tornadoes. The National Hurricane Center canceled coastal warnings and watches. Minor power outages were reported in north Florida, and the state’s emergency response team started closing shelters on Monday, citing a “lack of public sheltering need.” Some areas on Gulf Coast barrier islands remained under evacuation orders as authorities weighed the flood risks, officials said. Alberto will probably weaken through Tuesday as it moves northward to the Tennessee Valley and then into the Ohio Valley, finally withering into a “remnant low pressure storm” by Tuesday evening, with winds around 25 mph (40 kph), Roth said. The NHC warned it would still deliver heavy, potentially damaging rains of 2 to 6 inches (6 cm to 15 cm), with chances of 12 inches (30 cm) in some spots in north Florida and Alabama through Tuesday night, possibly spurring flooding. It is expected to dump up to 6 inches (15 cm) of rain as it moves northward to lower Michigan by Wednesday evening, officials said. Alberto’s top winds weakened on Monday to 45 mph (75 kph) when its center made landfall near Panama City, Florida, weather officials said, with a city fire official adding that the wind and rain knocked down trees but did not force any rescues. Royal Dutch Shell Plc was returning workers to the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Chevron Corp restored some production on Monday after the storm’s passage. Shell plans to restore production at its Ram Powell Hub in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf as it soon as the platform can be operated safely, the company said in a statement. Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, spun up days before the formal June 1 start of the hurricane season, complicating holiday travel as it hit on the last day of the Memorial Day weekend. Authorities in Florida’s Franklin and Taylor counties issued mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of coastal residents. Deadly hurricanes in the United States and the Caribbean last year caused billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures.

Reuters Editorial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people remained without power in the U.S. Northeast on Wednesday after ferocious storms packing fierce winds and hail battered the region, killing three people. Hours after the storms knocked down power lines and trees across the region, some 360,000 customers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and West Virginia were without power, tracking service PowerOutage.us said. Schools canceled classes or delayed opening on Wednesday. Morning commuters in New York and Boston were expected to face patchy dense fog, the National Weather Service warned, while some commuter trains in the New York City metro area were suspended or delayed. An 11-year-old girl was killed when strong winds caused a tree to fall on a parked car in Newburgh, New York, during Tuesday evening’s storms. Two other people were killed in Connecticut in separate incidents when trees fell on their vehicles, local media reported. Local news showed footage of trees resting on top of crushed cars and houses, vehicles submerged in water and residents handling large hail, some the size of tennis balls. There were more than 100 reports of hail in states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut, the National Weather Service said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in several counties in southeast New York and deployed members of the New York National Guard to assist with the recovery. Officials in Brookfield, Connecticut, declared a town disaster and told residents to stay inside until they could assess the damage. “Please be aware that there are hundreds of downed trees, utility poles and electrical lines. AVOID all down trees and utility poles as they may still involve LIVE power lines,” the Brookfield Police Department said on Facebook.

Matt Simon,"Actions have consequences, as our parents likely told us as kids. But inaction has consequences, too. Life or death consequences, in the case of Californias new normal of massive, climate-change-driven wildfires.
After a series of devastating fires over the last few years, critics have turned their ire toward PG&amp;E, a utility that brings electricity to 5.4 million households and businesses in Northern California. Its equipment has been blamed for 17 of 21 major fires in 2017 alone. Facing the prospect that itll be officially implicated in last Novembers Camp Fire, which virtually destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86, the utility has announced that its seeking bankruptcy protection.
What happens to PG&amp;E nextwhether it sells off bits of the business to survive, or the state forces the company to split up, or its turned into a public utilityisnt clear. But safety will haunt the utility no matter what. They have a failed track record, says California State Senator Jerry Hill. They have no safety culture today.
Preventing electrical equipment from sparking fires is not some arcane art. But it does have its complications, and forcing a utility to get its act together might require forceful regulation of the kind typically reserved for a railroad baron.
The biggest threat to the electric grid is wind. In California this becomes particularly problematic in the fall, when seasonal winds tear in from the east. These winds are hot and dry, and desiccate the vegetation, making ignition all but certain.
High wind not only makes the fire spread very fast, but it also knocks all those power lines and knocks all the equipment, which can generate explosions of sparks, whether that's arcing between lines or transformers exploding, says Michael Gollner, a fire protection engineer at the University of Maryland. It's almost always due to either collapse of power utility poles or contact between different lines.
Those complications arent necessarily a problem if the equipment is surrounded by pavement. But miles upon miles of power lines are strung through the wildlands of California, where they are surrounded by unkempt brush.
Even before these seasonal winds arrive, the lines are a major liability. We hit these really, really dry periods throughout the west in the summertime, says fire ecologist Robert Gray. That means a whole lot of air conditioners running. There's more juice running through the line and it sags closer to lower vegetation.
One fix is to bury the lines, but that doesnt work in much of California, where a lot of rock sits at the surface. You could do it, but it would be enormously expensive. Even if lines were buried where theres dirt, digging them up to do repairs is still pricey.
Then why dont utilities just cut power to lines when they know strong winds are coming? They do, actually, but that call is far from simple. You also cut off certain communities from vital services, says Gollner. You can turn off medical equipmentthere's all sorts of things to consider when you make those decisions. They have to weigh both liabilities, which is bizarre.
The best thing to do now, experts say, is to take a page from the era of railroad barons and rein in the utilities. From the 19th century well into the 1920s, America had a serious problem with railway fires. Burning coal or wood threw sparks out of the engine, which easily ignited vegetation around the tracks. It was like dragging a flare across the countryside.
Then regulators said: Yeah, thats going to have to stop. They made the railroads adopt spark arrestors. They required inspections for brakes, says wildfire historian Stephen Pyne. There were laws passed.
Regulators dragged the railroads into court if they didnt comply. A century ago, this was a huge industry, big money, big political clout, says Pyne. That's not unlike the power line situation.
First and foremost: lines simply have to be kept away from brush. That means a whole lot of money spent in fuel management, which California has been historically terrible at. In California, utilities are legally liable for any fire their equipment starts, even if they arent deemed to be negligent, so they better be damn sure that that equipment is clear of brush. That costs money, but its a tiny investment compared to paying for the ravages of wildfiresPG&amp;E says its facing a liability of $30 billion from just two years worth of conflagrations. Hence bankruptcy.
(PG&amp;E declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a press release that says it will make investments in system safety as it works with regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to consider a range of alternatives to provide for the safe delivery of natural gas and electric service for the long-term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.)
Utilities know full well how to manage their risk. Both Pyne and Hill point to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which regulators found liable for the Witch Fire of 2007, as a model of current safety practices. For instance, it created a weather center that monitors for fire conditions. They created a new industry standard that has been ignored by PG&amp;E almost in every regard,"" says Hill. ""Ignoring those basic practices I believe resulted in the fires of 2017 and 2018.
In the long term, though, the solution may be for communities to become more independent about their power. Its not hard to foresee a future (however far off) in which electricity is much more decentralized: Instead of power coming from massive plants dotted throughout California, neighborhoods could establish their own hubs, using solar or wind power to charge large batteries throughout town. Outfitting your home with solar panels still aint exactly cheap, sure, but that price will continue to drop as the technology evolves. And decentralization in California very much depends on PG&amp;Es fate: If the state ends up breaking the utility into smaller entities, that might make things easier.
It's burying lines where we can, where it's feasible and appropriate,"" says Gray. ""It's decentralizing the hub so if you do have a power outage it doesn't impact huge areas. But it's also a system that uses a multitude of different sources of energy.
This is scary new era of climate-change-driven wildfires. But by reining in the utilities, just as we reined in the once-almighty railroads, perhaps we can help avoid catastrophes like Paradise.

Mark Kaufman,"Surging hurricane waters can throw around cars, boats, and houses like toys. Six years ago, Hurricane Sandy pushed storm surges into the streets of Staten Island, New York, wrecking entire neighborhoods along the small island off the coast of Manhattan. Homes are still being rebuilt, and some have simply been abandoned. Now, a more powerful tempest, Hurricane Florence, is set to hit the Carolinas late Thursday with winds reaching some 120 mph. SEE ALSO: Glowing snow is falling thousands of feet under the sea. Here's why. Regardless of exactly where it makes landfall, the storm's mass of winds will be destructive, forcing high surges of ocean water into coastlines, barrier islands, and neighborhoods. And the storm surge may be even worse due to the effects of human-caused climate change. The oceans off the southeastern coast of the U.S. have risen by about 9 inches in the last 100 years, boosted by some of the most visible manifestations of global warming, namely melting ice sheets and expanding oceans. NHC Advisory 46. Surge+tide levels ~ 10 ft above MSL near coast. Higher levels in converging estuaries that amplify the surge.

Flooding from rainfall will exacerbate conditions throughout the area. pic.twitter.com/kuugOzWU4c — Dr. Rick Luettich (@RLuettich) September 11, 2018 In light of this reality, how much worse might these Florence-caused storm surges be? ""The simplest effect is that any storm surge is amplified by sea level rise,"" Jaap Nienhuis, a researcher at Florida State University's Coastal Morphodynamics Lab, said in an interview. ""When a major event like this occurs, it's riding on top of sea level rise,"" added Rick Luettich, the Director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an interview. Sea level rise can certainly make the difference in whether or not hurricane waters surmount coastal dunes and comes flooding into communities, said Luettich, but it’s not yet as influential as normal tides in determining how a destructive a storm’s surge may, or may not, be. Off the North Carolina coast, tides rise and fall between 5 and 6 feet each day — substantially more than current contributions from sea level rise. It's important to remember that the Storm Surge Watch issued at 5 AM this morning covers the potential for life-threatening surge through 48 hours. Impacts beyond 48 hours will be covered by subsequent updates. pic.twitter.com/0RaE51d5Ws — NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 11, 2018 “The timing of the surge with the tide is enormously important,” said Luettich. “We might dodge the bullet if it [Florence} were to hit at a low tide.” Yet, a looming problem with Florence is that the expansive storm is expected to stall over the region — as more storms are want to do as the Arctic warms. This means strong winds could have more opportunities to hit the high tide cycle, bringing the worst of the surges. “If it’s a real lingerer, then it will undoubtedly end up going through a high-tide cycle,” said Luettich. The future of storm surges Any storm surge is dependent on a variety of factors — the shape of the land, winds, tide, etc. — and sea level is just one component. But sea level rise is now accelerating as ice sheet melt hastens and the warming ocean expands. Eventually, sea level rise will be a critical influence. “The effect today is not nearly what it’s going to be in 100 years,” said Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University. “Down the road — when the sea has risen a meter — then it’s going to be a factor.” Until then, however, sea level rise will still be a growing, relentless problem. Melting ice and expanding oceans “are going to persistent into the future,” Ben Hamlington, NASA’s Sea Level Change Team Lead, said in an interview. “You know they’re going to contribute going forward.” A NASA graph showing sea level rise since 1993. Image: nasa And as the surges grow, development along the coast has largely eliminated the natural barriers that once weakened storm surges — things like marshes and dunes. “There’s not a buffer zone anymore,” said Nienhuis. “It’s been developed immensely,” he said, specifically citing the Southeastern coastline. To counteract the disappearance of natural barriers, we’ve built impressive fortifications like seawalls to combat rising seas or surges, said Nienhuis. But these efforts are counter-intuitive, he said. Rigid walls reflect wave energy, rather than absorbing it, sending that energy to other portions of the coast, and bringing erosion and damage elsewhere. Worth mentioning the continued population &amp; exposure growth in the potential path of #Florence. Many spots show robust change since 2000. Such rapid changes means many new residents have yet to experience hurricane conditions and/or severe inland flooding. pic.twitter.com/gdLmHZDhjr — Steve Bowen (@SteveBowenWx) September 10, 2018 Hurricane Florence promises to be such a powerful tempest that it’s wise — if not imperative — to leave the coasts, should the right combination of high tides, surging waters, and ever-growing sea level rise combine to hammer coastal communities. Willoughby says it would behoove coastal dwellers to take a trip well inland — perhaps using the storm as an excuse to really get out of town. “There’s a lot of people in the coastal Carolinas that should be thinking about visiting Aunt Mabel in St. Paul, Minnesota,” he said.","Surging hurricane waters can throw around cars, boats, and houses like toys.

Photo Barriers were blown over outside an arena in Gangneung on Wednesday. Credit Carl Court/Getty Images Wind greatly affected the women’s slopestyle snowboard contest on Monday, a day after qualifying runs had been canceled because of wind. In the finals, athletes crashed or essentially gave up on 41 of 50 runs. Some approached the big jumps at full speed, only to pull up at the last moment because snow made it impossible to see or the wind socks on the jumps were completely stiffened. Tess Coady of Australia blamed the wind for a knee injury sustained in a training run before the competition. “Got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my ACL was not a big fan!” she wrote on Instagram. Several miles away on Monday, the women’s giant slalom competition was postponed, just as the men’s downhill had been the day before. (They both ultimately took place on Thursday, the first somewhat still day of the Games.) It threw off training cycles and complicated the hopes of skiers like Mikaela Shiffrin, the American star who is aiming to win multiple gold medals. Because of the wind, she faced three straight days of races, hardly ideal. For most of a week, the blowing snow created white-out conditions on the ski courses. Gondolas tilted uncomfortably in the wind, and chair lifts were shut down. Race flags were blown off their poles. Mislaid gloves blew away. But wind is a fickle foe to plenty of winter sports, and it has affected all of the outdoor events. On the biathlon course, it was even harder than usual to shoot straight. At the ski jump, the 45-year-old veteran Noriaki Kasai of Japan said he had rarely felt such strong wind at a competition. Photo Workers tried to stop a security tent from blowing away outside the Gangneung Ice Arena on Thursday. Credit Aris Messinis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “It’s unbelievable,” he said. “The wind howls so loud it’s frightening being up there.” The wind even put a scare into spectators milling around the complex of ice arenas close to the coast. “Due to high winds in the Gangneung area, all activities in the common domain of the Gangneung Olympic Park have been temporarily suspended to ensure the safety of all personnel,” the Pyeongchang Olympic Committee wrote in a statement Wednesday afternoon, as temporary tents, booths and fences were upended and blown over in a sudden burst. According to Reuters, 13 volunteers and three spectators receiving minor injuries from flying debris and 60 tents were damaged. The area was closed and fans shooed away. The giant circuslike tents that serve as workrooms for members of the news media were emptied. Who knew it could be so windy in such a lovely place? Actually, Olympic organizers did. The Pyeongchang 2018 Organizing Committee had a “meteorology and climate team” that supplied a 26-page report about weather, updated last year. The most dominant pattern this time of year, the report warned, was the “Siberian High,” as cold and dry winds from the northwest come with little obstruction all the way from Siberia. “High winds and low windchill temperatures are the most influential factors in particular during the Olympic period,” the report said.

Opinions expressed by Green Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Ten states have now legalized adult-use marijuana. That’s a remarkable number considering it stood at “zero” at the beginning of the decade.
Which states look likely to add to that number in 2019? Many believe the following states are close to making adult-use cannabis legal in 2019. All three are among the states with the highest populations in the country.
Potential Legal Marijuana States in 2019
Note the action has moved from voter referendums to legislation in these states. Previously,  all but one of the states that legalized marijuana did so through a voter referendum. The lone exception is Vermont. Politicians now seem ready to take the lead on making marijuana legal in 2019.

New York
In New York, with just shy of 20 million residents, Gov. Andrew Cuomo who once called marijuana a gateway drug has reversed his opinion. In 2018, shortly after winning reelection to a third term, he endorsed legalization in a speech given in Manhattan.
His reasoning followed that used by other politicians. Most hit on two key issues.
One is that legal cannabis will raise tax revenue. In New York, experts estimate a $1.7 billion annual market. The other is that legalization is social justice. That’s backed by statistics showing police arrest minorities and the poor for drug possession at higher rates.
Cuomo also focused on the social justice issue. “The fact is we have had two criminal justice systems: one for the wealthy and the well off, and one for everyone else,” Cuomo said, according to the New York Times.
New Jersey
Former Republican Gov. Chris Christie’s opposition to marijuana is a distant memory. Current Gov. Philip Murphy endorsed legalization during his campaign. Since taking office in January 2018, he and state legislators have made progress on making that a reality. They still must hammer out details for the state’s system and agree on tax rates. Many expect them to take up the issue in 2019 and potentially get legalization done.
While legislation to legalize marijuana has stalled over a host of issues from tax rates to the mechanics of expunging unjust criminal records, there is no major opposition to legalization in principle. Nine million Garden State residents are likely to have legal access to marijuana within another year.

Illinois
In Illinois, with 12.7 million residents, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and House Speaker Michael Madigan endorse legalizing adult-use weed. Most expect Sen. Heather Steans and Rep. Kelly Cassidy, who have pushed for reform, to lead the way.
Momentum is on their side. A recent survey found 66 percent of Illinois voters approve of legalizing marijuana. A University of Illinois study estimated that legal marijuana in Illinois would create 23,600 new jobs and pump $1 billion in the state’s economy. The study also projected $525 million in tax revenue.
That’s music to the ears of state officials who have been mired in a budget crisis for years.
Based on the July 1, 2018 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, legalization in these three state would mean another 41.1 million Americans would live in a state where recreational marijuana is legal.
Politicians in other states also have discussed legalization. They include Minnesota, Connecticut, New Mexico, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. The states that currently allow recreational marijuana are Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Michigan voters approved adult-use sales in November 2018.

Andrew Freedman,"The temperature at a weather station at the very top of Greenland, at one of the closest points of any land mass to the North Pole, has risen above the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees Celsius, during the past two days. This is an unusual, though not unheard of, occurrence, and it illustrates the extreme weather pattern currently unfolding in the Northern Hemisphere. Right now, unusually high temperatures are flooding the Arctic from the Pacific side to the North Atlantic side. Sea ice extent is at record low levels, with the likelihood that another record low winter peak in sea ice extent could be set by the end of March. SEE ALSO: The polar vortex just split in two. Get ready for some wild weather from Europe to the U.S. Sea ice loss is wreaking havoc on Arctic ecosystems. Missing sea ice cover exposes coastal villages to flooding from high waves during storms, and makes it harder for subsistence hunters to catch seals and other traditional sources of meat. It also threatens iconic species such as the polar bear. Temperature anomaly for Feb. 20, 2018, showing the unusually mild conditions (compared to average) in the Arctic, and cold in the western U.S. and Eurasia. The unusually mild (but still rather cold) temperatures in the Arctic are also related to a recent split in the polar vortex. The polar vortex is a semi-permanent area of low pressure in the upper atmosphere, with swirling westerly winds circulating around it. Typically, those winds are strong enough to keep the coldest air bottled up in the Arctic during the winter. But during the past two weeks, a phenomenon known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming event took place that disrupted the polar vortex, as if hitting a spinning top with your hand, causing it to wobble more slowly and erratically. In this case, the polar vortex has actually split into two sister vortices, or two spinning tops, to extend the analogy. One section of the polar vortex has set up shop over the Western U.S., where record cold temperatures are being set, along with heavy snowfall. Another is spinning its way across Eurasia, and is likely to cause snow to fall from Siberia to the Mediterranean beaches of Italy, France, and Croatia. The cold could set records across Europe, including in the United Kingdom, as easterly winds bring bitter cold into the region from Eurasia. The UK Met Office calls the frigid air mass associated with these easterly winds the ""Beast from the East."" The Met Office has also linked the coming cold snap directly to the Sudden Stratospheric Warming event. Sudden Stratospheric Warming events occur when energy propagates upward from the troposphere, where most weather occurs, into the stratosphere, setting in motion a complex series of events that can result in the polar vortex temporarily spilling beyond its usual boundaries, bringing exceptional cold far and wide. This February's stratospheric warming event was particularly extreme, possibly setting records for how sharply temperatures spiked in the upper atmosphere. Soon after these events, cold air outbreaks tend to occur in Eurasia and parts of North America, often delayed by a week or two. Adam Scaife, a meteorologist at the UK Met Office Hadley Center, said the Sudden Stratospheric Warming event could keep Europe, including the UK, in the grips of frigid air through early March. “Signs of this event appeared in forecasts from late January and last week we saw a dramatic rise in air temperature of around 50 degrees Celsius, known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming, at around 30km above the North Pole,"" Scaife said in a statement. ""This warming results from a breakdown of the usual high-altitude westerly winds and it often leads to a switch in our weather: with cold easterly conditions more likely to dominate subsequent UK weather.” There's another player in the picture, too, which is also raising the odds of extreme cold across Europe, and possibly some snowstorms for the U.S. East Coast in early March as well. A pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), is flipping into a particular phase that excites snow lovers on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. European model projection showing a steep drop in the NAO index during the next two weeks. Image: weatherbell analytics. When the NAO shifts into the negative phase, as it's predicted to do, the odds of cold conditions along with more chances of snowstorms are likely both in Europe and the eastern U.S. Computer models are showing a steep, possibly even record, drop in the NAO index during the next two weeks, which also supports the idea of a deep freeze in Europe. It's possible that the East Coast of the U.S. will eventually get in on the colder, snowier weather, but not until after a late February heat wave affects the area this week, with temperatures more in line with typical values seen during the month of May.","The temperature at a weather station at the very top of Greenland, at one of the closest points of any land mass to the North Pole, has risen above the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees Celsius, during the past two days.

Adam Rosenberg,"No one boarding the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship in New York on Dec. 29, 2017 expected to start the new year coping with seasickness and mortal terror. But in the end, that's what happened. It's not clear what led Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) to stick to the ship's planned itinerary as forecasts made as early as Dec. 31 pointed to a winter storm of historic proportions forming along the East Coast. But the decision left Ellen Leffak, her family, and many of the fellow passengers they commiserated with sick from the rough voyage and furious at what they see as negligence on the part of NCL's decision-makers. The passengers aboard the ship endured a horrific journey home despite the fact that the storm was accurately forecast days in advance by the U.S. government and private sector meteorologists. ""I know that sometimes we are just subject to forces of nature that we can't help,"" Leffak said during a post-cruise phone interview. ""But I think what went bad here was that the ship's decisions and responses to those forces of nature were totally inappropriate."" SEE ALSO: Norwegian Cruise Line sailed right through the nightmarish winter storm Our 96-hr forecast (valid 12Z January 4) highlights very dangerous #Atlantic marine conditions expected later this week. Rapidly intensifying low pressure is forecast to develop hurricane force winds on Thu as it lifts northward along the outer portion of our offshore zones. pic.twitter.com/LvqoTSTJnM — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) December 31, 2017 Trouble started midway through the trip, on Jan. 2, as the ship dropped anchor off the coast of Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas. The cruise line owns this private island and uses it as a sort of rest and play stop during the long journey up and down the East Coast to Key West, Florida, a place where passengers can disembark for beachside fun. By Jan. 2, weather forecasters from the U.S. government and private sector were unanimous in predicting that a storm of potentially historic proportions would form off the Southeast coast, near Florida, and spin up the East Coast toward Nova Scotia by Jan. 5. Computer models differed slightly in the storm track forecast, particularly on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, but they all agreed that the system would be incredibly intense — possibly breaking a record for the rate of intensification in such a short period of time. This aspect of the storm is crucial, because such a rapid pressure drop would lead to hurricane force winds of 75 miles per hour or greater as well as building seas. ""It was horrible to watch."" The waters off the coast of Great Stirrup Cay are shallow, which meant the Breakaway had to drop anchor in deeper waters and ferry passengers aboard smaller tender boats. Leffak and her husband opted to stay aboard the big boat that morning for breakfast before heading out on a later tender. Unfortunately, high winds and waves caused the crew to quickly recall all the tenders and set sail for New York instead. ""They were starting to bring people back to the ship because of the forecast of high winds up to 60 miles an hour and the water swells of 15 feet,"" Leffak said. No one mentioned anything about a storm, let alone a historic storm that would affect every coastal state from Florida to Maine. Never again on the #NorwegianBreakaway. That was the scariest cruise ever. All we knew was tenders couldn't make it to NCL private island. Then we just left, no information, no updates, 3+ days of rough waves, and entire family sick, locked inside a tilted ship. Disgraceful..... pic.twitter.com/5ecdPtTrlc — Los_Angeles (@LA4Life32) January 6, 2018 ""They were bouncing and bouncing,"" Leffak said of the small shuttle boats. ""If I was on one of those things I would have been as sick as a dog. It was horrible to watch."" After that, the long, tumultuous journey back to New York began, spanning the days between Jan. 2 and Jan. 5. The worst moments of 2018's historic winter storm hammered the East Coast on Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, which is when conditions aboard the ship deteriorated dramatically. As waves rocked the cruise ship and guests and staff became seasick, the ship's captain repeated the same message: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are in rough seas and we are optimizing our speed and course to minimize the movement of the ship."" He would then hand the mic over to the cruise director, who ran through ongoing activities and events aboard the ship. Leffak recited that message from memory with the cadence of someone who heard it too many times. ""The announcements were totally canned, totally repetitive,"" she said. ""The same words over and over and over and over again."" Leffak and her fellow passengers were unsettled by a lack of communication from the bridge — roughly a full day went by between Tuesday and Wednesday night without any updates — and the storm was in full swing, with the ship swaying in high winds and waves. ""[Wednesday] was the night that people were actually being thrown out of their beds,"" Leffak said. ""This ship was moving so much people were actually rolling out of their beds."" Image: ellen leffak The cabin experience got to be so uncomfortable that many guests sought rest in the ship's public spaces. Or they just gave up on sleep all together. On top of all that, the cruise's concierge service had no answers; ""We just take our orders from the bridge,"" Leffak recalls being told. They dispensed dramamine to sick passengers, but getting just a single dose came with a 20-minute wait. There's a big problem here that isn't evident in Leffak's telling of events: This storm and its intensity should not have been a surprise to the ship’s captain or crew. In fact, it's clear that the cruise line made a decision to proceed despite the storm, rather than being surprised by it. In an email from National Weather Service spokeswoman Lauren Gaches, the organization’s Ocean Prediction Center, which forecasts maritime conditions, ""... Was forecasting the potential for hurricane force winds associated with the storm as early as Sunday, December 31."" The storm was predicted to peak on Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 3 and 4. ""Warnings for storm and hurricane force winds were gradually expanded, and by Tuesday, January 2, storm and hurricane-force wind warnings were in effect. On Tuesday, in OPC forecast discussions, forecasters stated that ""marine interests should be rushing any avoidance plans to completion.""” This means that by the time the Norwegian Breakaway's crew decided to head through the storm and on to New York, the forecast was clearly calling for a dangerous event with high winds, building waves, and other hazards. They may have thought that cruising along the western side of the storm would minimize the waves, since the highest waves built ahead of the low pressure area, but computer models were consistent in showing an area of hurricane force winds on the backside of the storm as well. In a statement defending its crew’s actions, Norwegian Cruise Lines has said the ship encountered worse conditions than anticipated. But the Weather Service's Gaches said forecasts were progressively more certain starting on Sunday the 31st. ""Confidence was high on Sunday and only grew through Wednesday. Ocean Prediction Center forecast discussions indicated that confidence was high and growing,"" she said. Presumably that information was available to the ship’s crew, since it was available to the public on OPC’s website. The 12Z OPC surface analysis indicates that low pressure currently near Miami will rapidly intensify while moving NE in the W Atlantic over the next 24 hours.

Such a rapid drop in pressure caused air to rush inward toward the center, as if filling a growing void in the atmosphere. This resulted in powerful winds measured at 80 miles per hour over land. Waves as high as 51 feet were observed in Nova Scotia, though the waves that affected the Norwegian Breakaway were likely far lower in height, closer to 15 to 30 feet. The Norwegian Breakaway is just the latest cruise ship to wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. 24-hour OPC surface &amp; wind/wave forecasts from today indicate intense low pressure to develop in the W Atlantic by 1200 UTC (7AM EST) 01/04/18 with winds up to 80 kt and seas to 33 ft. pic.twitter.com/P4aGol8tbN — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 3, 2018 Royal Caribbean’s “Anthem of the Seas” ran straight into post-tropical storm Hermine in 2016, just one year after suffering damage when it encountered a storm off the coast of North Carolina. In response, the cruise line hired a meteorologist to advise on its ships' routing decisions. Ryan Maue, the chief operating officer of weather company weather.us, urged caution before judging the crew of the NCL Breakaway as reckless in the face of the storm. ""I think we should all be careful expressing an expert 'forensic meteorology' opinion on the decision-making in this specific case since we do not have the inside knowledge about the weather forecasts provided to the Captain, routes or how the company determines what is tolerable ocean-going risk,"" he said in an email. ""All that being said, once the ship's Captain decides YES we are going to go through the storm, then the task at hand is to find the safest and most efficient route — probably balancing those two factors,” he said. ""It's likely that the course chosen by NCL was indeed suboptimal."" Maue said the storm developed quickly and had an unusually large wind field for a weather system of its type. He said from a passenger perspective, it's clear that the route chosen was not one that maximized their comfort. ""... Even with our best global models and coupled-ocean wave tools, it's likely that the course chosen by NCL was indeed suboptimal in terms of waves, wind and the passengers comfort because the ship is moving too slowly to adapt or course change. It's like a bobbing cork in a very angry stream."" Maue did, however, criticize Norwegian’s statements for calling weather forecasts into question. ""Blaming the weather forecasts for 'more dangerous' sailing conditions than expected is disingenuous since you have already decided on purpose to sail into the storm, not avoid it,"" he said. The full text of the statement received from NCL's spokesperson reads as follows: During the early morning hours of January 4, Norwegian Breakaway encountered stronger than forecasted weather conditions due to winter storm Grayson. The safety of our guest and crew is always our top priority and the ship's Captain adjusted the ship's speed and itinerary accordingly to maintain the safest possible route, delaying the ship's arrival. ‎Norwegian Breakaway returned safely to port approximately eight hours later than scheduled. Due to the late hour and the weather conditions, the ship remained alongside overnight, departing one day late for the next scheduled cruise. We sincerely apologize to our guests for the stronger than expected weather conditions and any resulting discomfort or inconvenience they may have experienced. The spokesperson added that when inclement weather strikes, the company, as a rule, charts ""a route that has the least impact to our guests and crew."" The ship finally came into port in New York on the afternoon of Jan. 5, hours after it was supposed to have arrived. Ice build-up on the walkways slowed the disembarkation process, leaving Leffak and her family waiting with everyone else in a long line. It's here that the cruise staff's priorities became clear. Leffak suspects the decision to make the hellish trip through the storm was made in order to get the ship ready for the next trip. ""I went over to this bar and I asked the woman [if I could have] some glasses of water,"" Leffak said. ""I don't have any glasses,"" the woman replied. Leffak didn't understand. ""You have a whole bar here,"" she said. ""How could you not have any glasses?"" The bartender replied: ""I'm getting ready for the next group of people coming on, I don't have glasses."" Image: Mark Lennihan/AP/REX/Shutterstock The Breakaway was set to leave on a 14-day journey the next day, Jan. 6. It was originally supposed to leave on Jan. 5, but the ship's late arrival in New York prompted a delay for the next trip. It's unclear if the ship rushed back to New York — perhaps along a needlessly risky or uncomfortable course — with the next trip in mind, but even after the brutal journey, the crew's minds were on the next trip before departing passengers had fully disembarked. When Leffak's line finally did start to move, she remembers an anxious crewmember shouting ""C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!"" (She turned toward the woman doing the shouting and told her to ""shut the fuck up."") Now that the journey is over, Leffak is busy thinking about next steps. Days later, she said, she's still suffering from vertigo that her doctor recommended waiting out with continued sedation. But she's angry about what she and her family went through aboard the Breakaway, and she's in the process of bringing a class action lawsuit to bear against NCL. ""I am a lawyer. I don't know about this kind of law, but I know that there are people who do,"" Leffak said. ""My philosophy was always advising my clients, always, that if you screwed up, the best thing you can do is say, 'We screwed up. We know it's going to cost us some money, but we also know it's worth some good will and we know it will protect us better in the future.'"" ""You say, 'I screwed up. I have to make this right.'""","No one boarding the Norwegian Breakaway cruise ship in New York on Dec. 29, 2017 expected to start the new year coping with seasickness and mortal terror.

Announcing Hearthstone's newest expansion: The #Boomsday Project! https://t.co/dQGbLiaGlY pic.twitter.com/HxVgdOMkUz — Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) July 10, 2018 Boomsday introduces two new card keywords. If you have a minion of the 'mech' type, playing a card with the Magnetic tag will combine them into a bigger, stronger creature (kind of like an ad-hoc mechanical version of Deathstalker Rexxar's build-a-beast power). The second, Omega, empowers cards later in the game: Once you've gained ten mana crystals, playing a card with this keyword gives it a bonus effect. From an early look, this makes weaker cards more versatile, empowering them to go toe-to-for with higher-cost minions and spells. There are also 'Project' cards, spells that affect both players. There's a new card type, too: Legendary-rarity spells. Presumably, they'll have wondrous and specific effects, especially since you can only have one in your deck: The example shown, Myra's Unstable Element, draws the rest of your cards. Obviously this is foolish to play early on, but as the match winds down, this Hail Mary may just give players the right tools to secure a win. Also coming in the set are legendary minions -- excuse me, scientists -- that promise interesting interactions, like double-casting the next spell you play. Just like the last two expansions, Boomsday comes with a free player-vs-computer mode. Puzzle Lab is a dive into the Warcraft character Dr. Boom's laboratory, where players face bosses warped with gadgets and mad science. The previous Adventure-style excursions in December's Kobolds &amp; Catacombs and April's The Witchwood were decent fun and open to all players, so it's nice to see Blizzard continuing the tradition.

Miriam Kramer,"On Friday morning, Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina, bringing extreme winds, surging seas, and huge amounts of rain to the coast. While forecasters have been keeping a close eye on the storm from the ground, the International Space Station watched the slow-moving hurricane make landfall from above. SEE ALSO: Stunning astronaut photos show multiple hurricanes swirling in the Atlantic A new 5-minute video from the space station shows Florence coming ashore in the U.S. for the first time. ""Cameras outside the International Space Station captured views of Hurricane Florence on Sept. 14 at 7:41 a.m. EDT minutes after the storm made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina packing winds of 90 miles an hour,"" NASA said in a video description. ""The National Hurricane Center said Florence is moving very slowly to the west at only 6 miles an hour, then is expected to turn to the southwest, increasing the threat for historic storm surge and catastrophic flooding to coastline areas and inland cities in North Carolina and South Carolina."" NASA astronaut Ricky Arnold also captured Florence making landfall from his spot on the orbiting outpost. The photo shows just how huge Florence looks, with its wind field stretching for hundreds of miles. Forecasters are predicting that the storm will continue to weaken but still dump potentially record-breaking amounts of rain as it moves slowly inland. ""Heavy rain has been occurring in and around Oriental, North Carolina, where 20.37 inches of rainfall has been measured thus far,"" the National Hurricane Center said in an update. These types of slow-moving storms — like Hurricane Harvey — can be particularly dangerous because of the rain and flooding they can bring. According to a study in June, hurricanes and typhoons, on average, appear to be slowing down in part because of human-caused climate change. As the climate warms, the way air moves through the atmosphere can become disrupted, possibly blocking these types of storms in place more often. A warming climate also means that the atmosphere can hold more and more water vapor, fueling hurricanes with even more water that can fall on coastal areas.","On Friday morning, Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina, bringing extreme winds, surging seas, and huge amounts of rain to the coast.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out. The Ranch Fire can now officially take its place in the record books, having burned a grand total of 459, 123 acres. The Ranch Fire was part of the Mendocino Complex, which lit up on July 27. Paired with the River Fire, the complex became the largest fire in state history in early August. Just a week later Ranch Fire took the title of the largest single fire in California history, fanned by powerful winds over a hot, dry landscape. The Ranch Fire continued its smoldering march through Mendocino National Forest just northeast of Ukiah until it was officially declared out on Wednesday. Crews are doing mop up work, helping clean up fire lines dug to contain the fire and searching for any last hot spots. While the blaze is out, the California’s state fire agency warned plumes of smoke could still rise due to the warm, dry weather. As crews continue assessing the landscape, a large closure remains in effect for the forest, including the Snowy Mountain Wilderness Area. The Ranch Fire was one of a few notable fires in California this summer. The Carr Fire left a swath of destruction in Redding and spawned a firenado while the Ferguson Fire shut down parts of Yosemite National Park. And we may not be done yet. Southern California’s fall fire season is just getting started. The Santa Ana winds that usher hot, dry air into the region helped fan last year’s Thomas Fire, which held California’s largest fire crown for all of eight months. The winds are calm for now, but they may not stay that way. “So after the present reprieve, I would not be surprised to see a renewed surge in heat, wind, and fire activity before the winter rains arrive,” UCLA climate scientist and California weather watcher Daniel Swain wrote on his blog this week. “I’ll keep my fingers crossed that we get a break this year, though. It’s already been a rough few years as far as California wildfires go.” All fires now occur in the context of a warming climate. This was California’s second-hottest summer on record, which no doubt helped the Ranch Fire take the title of California’s largest fire yet. Hotter conditions melt out snowpack earlier and dry out vegetation, creating a landscape more prone to explosive conflagrations. Research has shown that climate change has essentially doubled the area burned in western forests since the 1984. It’s enough to make one wonder if we should keep building in these places.","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah. Now, a new satellite image reveals the extent of unloaded rainfall in the nearby desert of Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert and (normally) one of the driest places on Earth. The image, taken by NASA’s Operational Land Imager three days after the storm brought heavy rains to the region—Salalah saw 11 inches of precipitation in just 24 hours, more than double its yearly average—captures the arid desert’s typical large swaths of sand with ripples sculpted by wind. But there’s one novel feature: water lakes in the flat lowlands between the sand dune tops. This water lake phenomenon has not been seen in the desert in almost two decades, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. The desert, also known as the Empty Quarter, receives about 1.2 inches of rain per year on average. Aside from being quite the sight, these bountiful rainwater deposits could be beneficial for local business. “The land will need 30 days to sprout their summer plants,” Ali Al- Hatish, a regular visitor desert visitor, told Al Arabiya.net. After that, camel owners expect this vegetation to feed their camels for the next two years. The paper also reports that the rare sight of lakes interspersed with dunes could send to tourists flocking to the area. Tropical Cyclone Mekunu spun up in the Arabian Sea in late May. Extremely warm waters (31-32 degrees Celsius or 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit) fed the storm until its winds equalled that of a Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Arabian Peninsula, according to The Weather Channel. This made Mekunu’s landfall historic; the Arabian Peninsula sees a tropical cyclone every year or every couple of years, but a tropical cyclone making landfall with hurricane-like wind speeds is a rarity in Oman and Yemen. As myriad media outlets reported, Oman and Yemen bore the brunt of the tropical cyclone with destructive winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding wreaking havoc in cities. These new satellite images are a reminder that powerful storms have the potential to dramatically reshaping natural landscapes, too.","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","My eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures watchers, get hype. An El Niño Watch is in effect. The climate phenomenon that starts with warmer than normal waters in the eastern tropical Pacific and alters weather around the world has a pretty good chance of forming later this year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which announced the watch on Thursday, there’s a 50 percent chance El Niño conditions will emerge this fall. The odds go up to 65 percent by the time winter rolls around. The agency issues watches when “when conditions are favorable for the development of El Niño or La Niña conditions within the next six months.” Right now, models are showing a weak-to-moderate El Niño could be in the cards. But it’s way to early to speculate on the flavor of El Niño we could get at this point, which is about as useful as definitively saying where Lebron is going to end up (please let it be the Celtics). But we can talk about why the odds are tipping toward El Niño. For one, ocean temperatures just below the surface are pretty toasty. Subsurface heat content this May was the sixth-warmest on record for the month. Heat below the surface does not an El Niño make, though—you’ve got to get that hot water to the surface. Looking at the average temperatures on the surface of the tropical Pacific shows that things are decidedly neutral right now. However, there are key differences when you look on either side of the equator that could provide an opening for that subsurface heat to peek through. The Pacific is a bit warmer than normal to the north, and cooler than normal to the south. This pattern is the positive phase of what’s known as the Pacific Meridional Mode. And it matters because the trade winds—which blow from east to west along the equator—tend to weaken during this positive phase. That could, in turn, let the warm water beneath the surface work its way east and eventually burble up to the surface It will take months for these processes to play out, which is why we’re only in an El Niño Watch. But if El Niño does emerge, it could be a bit deal, because the pattern has a number of impacts on the world’s weather. If El Niño forms in fall, it could put the kibosh on the tail end of hurricane season: El Niño tends to increase upper level winds that can inhibit hurricane formation in the Atlantic basin. El Niño also generally means more precipitation along the southern tier of the U.S. and drier conditions in the Northwest during the winter.","My eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures watchers, get hype.

Associated Press,"FARIBAULT, Minn. – Several tornadoes struck as severe storms packing powerful winds and heavy rain left a trail of destruction across southern Minnesota overnight, the National Weather Service said Friday. The extreme weather late Thursday damaged homes and businesses, and turned a small airport upside down, but didn't appear to leave anyone with physical injuries. The weather agency confirmed that tornadoes struck near Granada and Morristown, and said radar data and spotter reports indicated a few additional tornadoes likely occurred elsewhere. Twisters were also reported near Waterville, Medford, Northfield and Randolph. The hardest-hit area was Rice County, around 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Minneapolis. A suspected tornado flattened a restored 100-year-old barn near Northfield that had been a popular venue for weddings. Owners Pat and Tammy Winter were beneath the building when the storm hit. They said on Facebook that they and their animals weren't injured, but that they are devastated by the financial loss. ""Our hearts are broken, last night's tornado left our precious Red Barn in pieces,"" they wrote. The municipal airport in Faribault remained closed Friday after sustaining heavy damage. Hangars collapsed on top of planes and several aircraft that had been parked outside were tossed around by the winds. Rice County Sheriff Troy Dunn said about 36 homes sustained damage in Morristown and around a dozen were uninhabitable. ""We've had no reports of injuries, which is surprising when you see the wrath that this storm brought on to our county,"" Dunn said. Up to 4 inches of rain fell in some places.

Jamie Rigg,"An attempt at a working replica (Science &amp; Society Picture Library via Getty) Zhang Heng's invention was initially met with skepticism. His views on certain topics made him unpopular with some of his peers, and worse yet, his seismoscope was unproven. But as the story goes, several years later, a ball finally dropped. This in and of itself wasn't evidence it worked, of course -- no earthquake had been felt in the capital -- but days later a messenger arrived to report of a serious earthquake that originated hundreds of miles away, off to the west of Luoyang in the direction the now empty dragon mouth faced. Zhang Heng called his seismoscope Houfeng Didong Yi, meaning an ""instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth."" While many people of his time believed earthquakes had spiritual catalysts, he and a collection of other scholars were of the opinion the events were caused by winds and changes in air pressure -- bearing in mind this was way, way before the seed of plate tectonic theory sprouted in the early 20th century. In the centuries after Zhang Heng's death, other Chinese intellectuals were said have created successor seismoscopes of his design. Since nothing tangible survived the passage of time, however, historians of our era have struggled to reconcile these centuries-old accounts with a working replica of Zhang's device. Some even speculated it never existed. While the ornate nature of the seismoscope was well described, the exact mechanisms driving it weren't. Attempts to reinvent it in the 19th and 20th centuries proved unsuccessful. It remained unclear, for example, how an ancient pendulum design could be sensitive enough to detect earthquakes hundreds of miles away. Furthermore, how could the movement trigger just one mechanism and spare the others? In 2005, a group of seismologists and archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced they had created a proven, functioning replica. In their version, the pendulum itself doesn't interact with any levers; instead, it's suspended above another ball perched atop a thin pedestal. When the pendulum swings, it nudges that central ball down one of eight channels, where it hits a trigger system that animates the external dragon mouth. We don't know this is exactly how Zhang's model worked, of course, but it shows that only a minor reinterpretation of how the seismoscope is described in historical texts can lead to the creation of a sensitive, direction-aware device. Even though Zhang's device is nearly two millennia old, the working principle behind it is still commonly used today. A popular form of modern seismograph uses exactly the same properties of inertia, whereby a static base and hanging pendulum move independently of each other when the ground shakes. Only nowadays the pendulum is a magnet, and the induced current its swinging produces in the conductive base is the record. Converting the fluctuations into a digital signal allows such seismographs to document tremor intensity, their timespan, etc. Zhang's invention noted the simple occurrence of an earthquake, hence the name seismoscope.","Modern seismographs are extremely sensitive pieces of equipment.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Florida Governor Rick Scott warned state residents that ""this storm could kill you"" Powerful Hurricane Michael is set to make landfall in Florida later on Wednesday, forcing mass evacuations in the southern US state. A category three storm with winds near 120mph (193km/h), Michael is expected to strengthen further when it hits the Florida Panhandle or Florida Big Bend in the north-west, meteorologists warn. More than 370,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in Florida. Florida, Alabama and Georgia have declared states of emergency. At least 13 people have reportedly died in Central America due to the storm. What are the latest developments? In its bulletin, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said: ""Strengthening is expected overnight and on Wednesday, and Michael is forecast to be near category four strength when it makes landfall."" The NHC warns that some regions of Florida may see storm surges of up to 12ft (4m). It said that at 00:00 GMT on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was about 255 miles south of Panama City, Florida. Michael is currently moving northwards at 12mph. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Residents put plywood up in Port St Joe, Florida ""Weakening is expected after landfall as Michael moves across the south-eastern United States,"" the NHC added. Florida Governor Rick Scott called Michael ""a monstrous storm"" and urged residents to listen to officials. ""Let me be clear - the storm surge that our coastal counties are facing is deadly,"" the governor tweeted. ""Do not ignore warning from local officials - this storm could kill you. We can rebuild your house, we cannot rebuild your life."" Despite the warnings, local officials believe a far fewer number of people have in fact moved away. Schools and state offices in the area are to remain shut this week. On Tuesday, Gov Scott said he activated 2,500 Florida National Guard troops in preparation for the storm. Heavy rains are forecast for the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama warned of possible tornados. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday: ""We are very well prepared for the incoming hurricane."" Image copyright AFP Residents face frightening ordeal By BBC's Gary ODonoghue in Florida Adrian Mahangos hopes he is one of the lucky ones. Sitting outside his home, reading a magazine, less than 100 yards from the water's edge in Wynnehaven, he knows Hurricane Michael is now due to make landfall 50 or 60 miles to his east. Mr Mahangos is not going anywhere. His house is 11ft above sea level, and if the 4ft-surge predicted for this part of the coast goes no higher, then he's confident his newly-built home will survive. Just an hour along the coast, it's different. The aptly named Lullwater Beach, just west of Panama City Beach, is quiet at the moment, but this whole stretch is looking a possible surge of up to 13ft. A man in the distance is gathering sand from the beach while it's still light, and pouring it into trash bags - making do with what's at hand to protect from the water. Local officials are warning that not nearly enough people have evacuated as they would wish. Florida is used to storms, but the Panhandle, with its low-lying coastal strip and scattered communities, hasn't seen anything this strong for more than a dozen years. Those that remain will be facing a frightening ordeal. Where has Hurricane Michael hit so far? The storm caused widespread destruction in Central America over the weekend, where at least 13 people have been reported dead. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Images on social media showed evacuating families wading through water to get to safety. Image copyright EPA Image caption Western Cuba, including Havana, was struck by Hurricane Michael on Monday Parts of western Cuba, which was hit by the storm on Monday, were forecast to receive up to a foot of rain. Offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated workers, halting nearly a fifth of daily production. Five drilling rigs have been moved out of the storm's path, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.
