Alessandra Potenza,"Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning that forced people to flee to higher grounds in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the tsunami waves were less than a foot high, and the advisories were canceled a little after 4AM local time. So why was Alaska so lucky? Powerful quakes that happen out at sea are known to cause destructive tsunamis. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in northeastern Japan triggered waves as high as 126 feet, killing nearly 20,000 people. In 2004, a similarly strong quake off the coast of Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. Alaska also has a history of strong earthquakes: in 1964, the state experienced the most powerful quake ever recorded in the US, a 9.2 magnitude tremor followed by a tsunami that killed over 100 people. “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes,” says Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Just south of Alaska, the Pacific plate is sliding underneath the North American plate, an area called the subduction zone. That’s why the state is highly seismic, Blakeman tells The Verge. Last night’s earthquake generated because of all the strain building up on the subduction zone, but it did not occur exactly on a fault where the Pacific Ocean seafloor is sliding under the North American plate, Blakeman says. Instead, the quake occurred a little farther out, in a place where the fault is moving horizontally. This type of quake, called a strike-slip earthquake, is less likely to trigger large tsunamis, and this is probably why Alaska only saw waves of less than a foot, according to Blakeman. When earthquakes happen on the subduction zone itself, where one plate is pushing down while the other is going up, then high waves form. “To get a tsunami, you have to have substantial vertical movement on the seabed,” Blakeman says. Those types of earthquakes were responsible for the massive tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia. Aftershocks in Alaska could continue for weeks or months, Blakeman says. If the quakes generate from the same zone as last night, then large tsunamis should not be expected. But because the state sits by the Pacific-North America plate boundary, it’s normal that new earthquakes will happen in the future. When and where, exactly? That’s impossible to say. Earthquakes are so complicated that scientists aren’t able to predict them — at least not yet. “Since we can’t predict them, all we can do is be prepared,” Blakeman says.","Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska.",2018-01-23T16:15:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A powerful earthquake in Alaska didn’t trigger a big tsunami — here’s why,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922914/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-pacific-north-america-plate-boundary,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQqh3BMKCmEiuTLq3ign4Cnb9ag=/0x97:704x466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082687/earthquake.png,the-verge,The Verge,magnitude,1

Dani Deahl,"Billy McFarland, the organizer behind disastrous music festival Fyre Fest, pleaded guilty today to two counts of wire fraud. In court, he told a judge he lied to investors and “grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude,” as reported by Bloomberg. On June 30th of last year, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York arrested and charged McFarland with wire fraud, also alleging that he misrepresented his company’s finances in order to attract investors for the festival. Speaking to US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan today, McFarland admitted he defrauded 80 investors and a ticket broker out of more than $26 million. “In an attempt to raise what I thought were needed funds,” he said, “I lied to investors about various aspects of Fyre Media and my personal finances.” McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and pleaded guilty to ripping off a ticketing vendor that spent $2 million to secure advance tickets for future iterations of Fyre Fest. Each count of wire fraud carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, but McFarland has struck a plea deal with the government which will reduce his sentence to eight to 10 years, with a fine of up to $300,000. McFarland will also pay restitution. Fyre Fest, which McFarland organized with Ja Rule, was originally billed as an exclusive festival that would be attended by celebrities and influencers in April of last year. When ticket holders arrived — some of whom had paid well over $10,000 for the experience — they found a haphazard setup and were stranded on the island of Exuma in what was called a “tent city.” It became a cautionary tale of why not to trust Instagram sponcon, nomenclature for describing a failed event, and spawned an avalanche of amazing memes. Currently McFarland is free on bail, and he will be sentenced on June 21st. Both he and his company Fyre Media are still facing over a dozen civil suits.","Organizer Billy McFarland told a judge he lied to investors and “grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude,”",2018-03-07T00:11:18Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Fyre Fest organizer pleads guilty to two counts of wire fraud,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17088402/fyre-fest-organizer-pleads-guilty-to-two-counts-of-wire-fraud,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_6Y8OIDWwerN1-zlRFwjkieFlQ=/0x12:800x431/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8784507/fyre_festival_0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,magnitude,1
Aimée Lutkin,"On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami. More than 1,200 deaths have been confirmed, and the city of Palu needs help. There are a number of ways to donate, but according to the New York Times, money is a much more immediate way to help rather than canned goods, water, or clothes. Its very easy for those items to be misplaced. NPR reports that the scale of the disaster was at first difficult to determine, because communications were knocked out. The U.N. is now estimating that 1.6 million have been or will be affected in the coming recovery. The NYT and NPR suggest ed a number of organizations you can send money to who have people on the ground (to make sure it gets where it needs to go). GlobalGiving This group focuses on local organizations and currently have a goal of $1 million to help people in Sulawesi. They focus on emergency supplies first, then long-term recovery assistance. CARE CARE is also focusing on immediate needs north of Palu and towards the center of the cityespecially clean drink water, sanitation and shelter.Their county director in Indonesia, Helen Vanwel, told NPR that its a difficult project, because access is limited. A landslide has blocked the main road into Palu, flights are restricted into the airport, there is a destruction of major seaports and a general lack of communication, she said. Indonesian Red Cross According to the group, theyve mobilized 70 tons of supplies, including baby kits, mattresses and tents as well as water trucks and 15 ambulances. They say they have 179 staffers in the area already. Humanity &amp; Inclusion This organization has been in Indonesia since 2005. The theme continues to be working on immediate relief, especially medical care and psychosocial support. Save the Children There are Save the Children volunteers in Palu who are trying to establish temporary shelters from ropes and tarps, and also clearing away areas for children to safely play, because kids continue to need some normalcy and freedom when their worlds are turned upside down. UNICEF This group is also working on clean water by bringing in a mobile water treatment facility. Theyve also been working with local authorities to find the families of children who were separated from them during the disaster. The Jakarta Post also shared a few groups that are much more local, and shared a message from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency saying things like fuel (diesel fuel and gasoline), drinking water, medical personnel, medicines and field hospitals, tents, tarps, blankets, stretchers, water tanks, food, lamps, generator sets, emergency kitchens, body bags, shrouds and baby food were all needed. They also boosted the Indonesian Red Cross as an option for immediate relief. Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT Indonesia) ACT Indonesia as been around since 2005 as well, and are extremely transparent with their money.

Tom McKay,"A “strong magnitude 7.1 earthquake” struck the southern coast of Peru on Sunday morning, leaving at least one dead, several missing, and dozens injured, CNBC reported. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck roughly 22.4 miles (36 kilometers) offshore centered about 25 miles (40 km) into the Pacific Ocean from the town of Acari. CNBC reported that local officials said one man was killed by a rock in Yauca. Beyond that, there were some indications that the damage may not be as grim as originally reported. Per the BBC, Health Minister Abel Salinas disputed reports that 17 miners had gone missing inside a collapsed shaft. Reports of another death in Bella Union were also disputed by local officials. Per CNN, the National Civil Defense Institute reported at least 65 additional injuries “in the cities of Arequipa, Ica and Ayacucho.” The casualty count is likely to rise as emergency personnel continue to look through rubble. Though the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned that a wall of water could come crashing onto the shoreline, fortunately no such tsunami actually occurred and the center later advised that the threat had passed. Earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher are considered major events with the possibility of serious damage or casualties; only an estimated 20 or so occur each year. A magnitude 8.0 quake in 2007 off the central coast of Peru was estimated to have killed well over 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru due to its proximity to massive fault lines, as the Christian Science Monitor noted in 2013: Peru is located on the “Ring of Fire,” the belt of earthquakes and volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean. All along its western coast, the South American plate is colliding with the Nazca plate, forcing the heavier ocean crust down into the Earth’s mantle. The collision of the plates is like a slow-motion car wreck. They’re colliding at only 3 inches per year, but that’s enough to cause frequent earthquakes—and build the Andes Mountains. The tectonically active region along the coast of South America, known to geologists as the South American arc, is more than 4,000 miles long, from just below the southern tip of Chile to just off the coast of Panama. Despite the high risk throughout Peru, though, the situation with regards to preparation for seismic events (particularly in construction and building standards) is not so good. A 2012 review found the capital city of Lima, with a population of over nine million, could suffer tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands injured if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake hits there.

Adi Robertson,"This week, the value of a single bitcoin officially cleared $10,000, a new high point that’s over an order of magnitude greater than its price at the start of this year. Bitcoin has defied market expectations before, but in 2017, it didn’t just become more valuable. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become an acknowledged part of the financial system — albeit a nebulous one. Bitcoin traded at around $960 at the beginning of the year, and it’s risen steadily since then, with a steep jump in the past two months. There are multiple, complementary explanations for this, but this latest boom was sparked partly by the CME Group, a futures marketplace that announced its intent to start listing bitcoin by the end of the year. It’s a stamp of approval that could help cement bitcoins’ position at other major financial institutions, many of which are already handling bitcoin-related trading in some capacity. Even JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has said he would fire anyone who traded bitcoin, is reportedly considering a plan to let its clients access CME’s futures. Bitcoin isn’t replacing cash, but it’s gotten a big stamp of investor approval Not everyone believes that bitcoin is ready to enter the futures market. Themis Trading principal Joe Saluzzi warned that the currency is dangerously unregulated: “It reminds me of the financial crisis all over again,” he told CNBC. And bitcoin is so volatile that spending it doesn’t make sense. Nobody knows how valuable a single bitcoin might BECOME — while Thomas Glucksmann of currency exchange Gatecoin said $10,000 was still “cheap in my opinion,” bitcoin has also suffered extended catastrophic crashes, including a long slump after passing $1,000 in 2013. As an example of just how surreal bitcoin fluctuations can be, Gizmodo writer Kashmir Hill tweeted about buying a sushi dinner in 2013 for the equivalent of $99,000 today. There are still places where bitcoin payments make sense, although they’re sometimes unsavory: far-right groups have used them after being dropped by payment processors, for instance. And the underlying blockchain technology has myriad uses that aren’t cryptocurrency-focused — from quickly processing international money transfers to tracking legal marijuana. But people have also found uses for cryptocurrency that go beyond replacing cash. The best-known example of 2017 might be initial coin offerings or ICOs, in which companies sell digital tokens based on cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. ICOs range from serious fundraising efforts to absurd but startlingly successful jokes, and some have earned endorsements from the likes of Paris Hilton and Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang Clan. And unlike Dogecoin or other earlier novelty currencies, they’ve attracted serious regulatory attention. Some countries have outright banned ICOs — China barred the offerings as a form of “illegal public financing,” and South Korea announced “stern penalties” for running them. But other countries have attempted to clarify how existing rules apply to them. The US Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that some ICOs fell under securities law, setting them apart from general crowdfunding efforts. Japanese regulators also outlined how ICOs may fall under existing financial rules. In the US, the SEC has even issued guidance for how celebrities can hawk them. Cryptocurrencies’ overall legal status is still complicated, but several countries have made major policy decisions around them in 2017. Some of these are negative: China shut down currency exchanges earlier this year, although traders have moved to other platforms, and the SEC rejected a high-profile application for a bitcoin stock fund. Many other countries have given more ambiguous signals. Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered regulators to develop a wide-ranging set of rules for miners and traders, even as officials have signaled a crackdown. India’s government launched a committee earlier this year to study digital currency regulation, and the Supreme Court recently urged it to speed up its work. People have been prosecuted for cryptocurrency-related crimes like Ponzi schemes in past years, and governments have issued guidance about bitcoin. Some of these new decisions just raise new questions: the SEC, for instance, didn’t address how it would punish a decentralized network for violating securities rules. Likewise, getting attention from investors and regulators doesn’t tell us whether bitcoin will succeed in the long run, or whether cryptocurrencies will play a major role in most people’s lives. But even if cryptocurrencies aren’t directly competing with their traditional counterparts, the past year shows how serious they’ve become to both regulators and investors.","This week, the value of a single bitcoin officially cleared $10,000, a new high point that’s over an order of magnitude greater than its price at the start of this year.

THOMAS ERDBRINK,"Iranian officials put the epicenter of the quake inside Iran, near the border town of Ezgeleh. The region is a patchwork of farms and is home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran. Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, some 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage. The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Kerbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake occurred. Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When ordinary Iranians learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts, some started organizing aid groups themselves. In 2003, more than 20,000 people were killed and an ancient citadel was destroyed in the southern city of Bam. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.

Devin Coldewey,"The volume of data particle physicists have to sort through at the Large Hadron Collider is staggering, and it’s about to increase by an order of magnitude. To cope with this torrent of data, CERN is turning to machine learning, offering prizes for AI models that can cut through the clutter and help make the next breakthrough. Inside the massive detectors that dot the rings of the LHC, protons accelerated to near light speed smash into each other with incredible energy and produce a fountain of exotic, short-lived particles that impact on sensors lining the walls. Improvements being made to the magnetic fields guiding these protons around the ring mean that where once you could expect a couple dozen collisions to draw data from, soon there may be hundreds. Great for the scientists, but with more collisions comes more data, in this case an order of magnitude more. The old methods of sorting and categorizing the data are too slow, researchers told Nature. So they’re doing what any modern data scientist would do when faced with a massive set of noisy data: hand it over to the AIs. I use the term loosely, of course — machine learning models are just really great at chewing through reams of data in search of what they’ve been trained to find. Medicine, astronomy, and of course psychology (courtesy of Facebook) have all been advanced by this convenient ability to separate the statistical wheat from the chaff. Particle physics is just another example of it. A little healthy competition, as always, is a good way to jump-start the field. So CERN established TrackML, a relatively low-key contest in which physicists and data scientists can download gigs of real collider data and train up models to classify it correctly. Of course, there are terabytes available for the picking, but you’ll want to use this particular dataset. The prize pool is relatively small, with a total of $25,000 available to the winners. Perhaps they used up all their money on… you know, upgrading the world’s biggest particle collider with state of the art cryomagnets. There’s no entry fee, so if you’re interested in giving it a shot, head over to Kaggle, where the contest is hosted, and download your own copy of the data. You’ve got plenty of time — submissions are due in August. Oh, and anything you submit will be open sourced, so don’t worry that they’re going to commercialize your algorithm.","The volume of data particle physicists have to sort through at the Large Hadron Collider is staggering, and it's about to increase by an order of magnitude.

Taylor Hatmaker,"The Washington Post is reporting that Facebook’s row with the FTC could result in fines an order of magnitude larger than any levied against a tech company by the regulatory body before. While the talks appear to be ongoing, The Washington Post spoke with two people familiar with the situation who said the FTC is negotiating with Facebook over a possible “multi-billion dollar fine” an amount more in line with the FTC’s massive $14.7 billion settlement with Volkswagen over emissions cheating in 2016.
In 2012, Google paid a record-setting $22.5 million to settle with the FTC over its own privacy infractions, an amount that is hardly a drop in the bucket by today’s terms. As we’ve previously reported, an FTC fine around that range or even a multiple of that amount would be easily shrugged off by the company, which brought in more than $13 billion in revenues in just one quarter of last year. Hitting Facebook with fines well beyond the millions is one of the only ways to punish a company so wealthy that paying out millions would be little more than a passing annoyance.
Assuming the FTC holds its ground in negotiations over a record-blowing fine against Facebook, the company is likely to push back hard in court, putting its vast financial resources to the work of insulating it from meaningful penalties both in the present and future. Whether the multi-billion-dollar fine materializes or not, the hefty sum would be a major symbol of Facebook’s recent privacy transgressions and the process would likely hold Facebook to account with some transparency and reporting measures that could be bruising, even if it didn’t pay up.","The Washington Post is reporting that Facebook’s row with the FTC could result in fines an order of magnitude larger than any levied against a tech company by the regulatory body before.

George Dvorsky,"On September 19, 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico, killing nearly 370 people. But something good has come from this tragic event: The quake damaged an ancient pyramid, revealing a previously unknown Aztec temple underneath. While checking for structural damage inflicted by the 2017 earthquake, archaeologists with Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) made a remarkable discovery: a temple located about six feet (two meters) below the top of the Teopanzolco pyramid, a structure the Aztecs dedicated to Tláloc, the Aztec rain god. It was not uncommon for ancient cultures to build upon older structures, but in this case, the archaeologists had no idea a temple was located within. While performing their survey, the INAH archaeologists noticed that some stones on the top of the pyramid were loose. The hidden temple revealed itself as the scientists were searching for firmer terrain. The newly discovered temple measures about 20 feet by 13 feet (6m x 4m), and it dates back to the Middle Postclassic period, sometime between 1150 to 1200 AD. The temple was built by the Tlahuica culture, one of several Aztec peoples living in central Mexico shortly before and during the time of the Spanish conquest, which started in 1521. The temple and the Teopanzolco pyramid built upon it, which dates back to about 1300 AD, are located in Morelos state, about 43 miles (70 km) south of Mexico City. The newly discovered temple is quite possibly the oldest evidence of human occupation at the Morelos site—an important finding that represents a very early stage of the Aztec period. “Despite what the earthquake meant, we have to be grateful that this natural phenomenon revealed this important structure, which changes the dating of this archaeological site,” said Isabel Campos Goenaga, director of the INAH Morelos Center, at a press conference held earlier this week. The walls of the temple were found next to the remains of a stuccoed column that once supported a roof. Intense humidity has obliterated most of the stucco walls, but the archaeologists managed to salvage some fragments for study. The INAH archaeologists say it likely represents the first constructive phase of the Teopanzolco pyramid, predating the famous Templo Mayor, which dates back to the Late Postclassic period (1200 to 1521 AD). “The internal temple that we found in that sense is the oldest at the pyramid of Teopanzolco,” explained INAH archaeologist Barbara Koniecza. “We have already detected two construction stages, and where we stand is considered to be built in the oldest phase before the second phase of the Templo Mayor.” Sadly, the 7.1 magnitude quake damaged the Teopanzolco pyramid, along with two temples. The floor of both shrines have sunk, and are now deformed, making the structures potentially unstable. More work is needed to assess the damage and to devise potential restoration strategies. Until then, the site, which has been closed to the public since last September, will remain off limits to tourists.

Adam Rosenberg,"Right on the heels of Thursday's volcano eruption in Hawaii, a pair of earthquakes struck the state as residents contended with ongoing evacuations and noxious gas in the air. The first, a 5.4-magnitude quake according to the United States Geological Survey, occurred at around 11:30 a.m. local time near the southern coast of Hawaii's Big Island, just south of Kilauea volcano. A second, 6.9-magnitude quake followed roughly an hour later. SEE ALSO: 3D Image of Sierra Negra Could Help Us Understand Volcanoes According to the USGS, the latter one was the state's strongest since a 7.1-magnitude quake that hit in ""almost exactly the same location"" in 1975. Lighter earthquakes continued into Saturday morning as a result of ongoing volcanic activity. You can keep track of them yourself right here. In a notice posted on Friday afternoon, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency had little to say about the tremors. The biggest threat continues to be the high levels of sulfur dioxide found in the evacuation area, released as volcanic activity causes fissures to open in the ground. That could change, however. ""The [evacuated areas around Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens Subdivision] continues to be unstable with multiple volcanic eruptions happening,"" the notice reads. ""No one is allowed into the area. Do not attempt to return to your home at this time."" Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard discussed the dangers of the noxious gas in a CNN appearance on Friday. ""Sulfur dioxide gas can be so toxic and thick in some areas that it can be fatal, especially to those who have respiratory illnesses,” she said. ""The wind can push [the gas] in different directions, so that’s a very serious concern given the high levels.... [People] don’t necessarily have the kinds of protective gas masks that they would need if they were right in the thick of this gas."" WOW...just look at this footage.

CHRIS STANFORD,"Hercule Poirot was fictional, but an obituary for Agatha Christie’s famous Belgian detective nevertheless appeared on the front page of The Times on this day in 1975. Poirot, fastidious and impeccably dressed, made his debut in 1920 in “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” and appeared in more than 30 of Christie’s novels. The actor David Suchet had a long-running role as Hercule Poirot on TV. Credit Acorn TV But “at the end of his life, he was arthritic and had a bad heart,” according to the obituary, which ran the month before Poirot’s final appearance, in “Curtain.” “Curtain” was published in 1975, but Christie wrote the book during World War II as a gift for her daughter should she not survive the bombings in London. It was locked away — alongside a final mystery for her other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple — for more than 30 years. Christie died in 1976, and received her own front-page obit in The Times, sharing the headline with Poirot. With a prolific output and global appeal, she remains at the top of Unesco’s list of the world’s most translated authors. “There’s a deep psychological level to Christie’s work,” Mark Aldridge, the author of “Agatha Christie on Screen,” said in an interview last year. “You can watch a film of her work purely for the plot, but you can also watch it for insights into the characters and the human conditions.”",A magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday destroyed thousands of buildings and left dozens of people dead.

Rhett Allain,"I don't know very much about bobsleds—but I know quite a bit about physics. Here is my very brief summary of the bobsled event in the winter Olympics. Some humans get in a sled. The sled goes down an incline that is covered in ice. The humans need to do two things: push really fast to get the thing going and turn to travel through the course. But from a physics perspective, it's a block sliding down an incline. Just like in your introductory physics course. So here is a block on a low friction inclined plane—see, that's just like a bobsled. You can see that there essentially just three forces acting on this box (bobsled). Let's take a quick look at each of these forces. In this situation, the gravitational force is the simplest because it doesn't change. When you are near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational force (also called the weight) just depends on two things: the gravitational field and the mass of the object. The gravitational field actually decreases as you get farther away from the center of the Earth—but even the top of the tallest mountain isn't that far away, so we say this value is constant. This gravitational field has a value of about 9.8 Newtons per kilogram and points straight down (and we use the symbol g for this). When you multiply the gravitational field by the mass (in kilograms), you get a force in Newtons. Simple. The next force is the force with which the inclined plane pushes up on the box. But wait! It's not really pushing up, it's pushing perpendicular to the surface. Since the force is perpendicular, we call this the normal force (the geometry definition of normal). However, there's still a small problem—there is no equation for normal force. The normal force is a force of constraint. It pushes with whatever magnitude it needs to to keep the box constrained to the surface of the plane. So really the only way to find the magnitude of this normal force is to assume the acceleration perpendicular to the plane is zero. That means that this force has to cancel the component of the gravitational force that is also perpendicular to the plane. In the end, the normal force will decrease as the angle of the incline increases (a block on a vertical wall would have zero normal force). The last force is the frictional force. Like the normal force, this force is also an interaction between the box and the plane. But this frictional force is parallel to the surface instead of perpendicular. If the block is sliding, we call this kinetic friction. In the most basic model, the magnitude of this frictional force depends on just two things: the types of surfaces interacting (we call this the coefficient of friction) and the magnitude of the normal force. The harder you push two surfaces together, the greater the frictional force (but you already knew that). Now we are ready for the important part—the relationship between force and acceleration. The magnitude of the total force on the object in one particular direction is equal to the product of the object's mass and acceleration. For the x-direction, this would look like this: The key here is that the acceleration of the object depends on both the total force and the mass of the object. If you keep the force constant but increase the mass, the object would have a smaller acceleration. Now let's put this all together. I will set the x-axis along the same direction as the plane. This means there are two forces that will influence the acceleration down the inclined plane: part of the gravitational force and the frictional force. The gravitational force obviously increases with mass—but so does the frictional force since it depends on the normal force. What we have are two forces that increase with mass. So the mass of the block doesn't matter for the acceleration down the incline. It only depends on the inclination angle and the coefficient of friction. In a race, a big block and a small block would end in a tie (assuming they started with the same speed). If mass doesn't matter, then why would a four person bobsled be faster than a two person one? Obviously, there must be some other force involved—one that doesn't depend on the mass of the object. This other force is the air resistance force. You already know about it: Whenever you stick your hand out of a moving car window, you can feel this air resistance force. In the basic model, it depends on several things: the density of air, the size and shape of the object, and the speed of the object. As you increase the speed, this air resistance force also increases. But notice that this does not depend on the mass. Let me show the impact this has on a bobsled with the following example. Suppose I have two blocks sliding down identical inclines and traveling at the same speed. Everything is identical except for the mass. Box A has a small mass and box B has a large mass. Although they have the same air force and same speed, the heavier box (box B) will have the greater acceleration. This same air resistance force will have a smaller impact on its acceleration because it has a larger mass. So mass does indeed matter in this case. Actually, the air drag matters quite a bit. That's why bobsled teams are also very concerned about the aerodynamics of their vehicle. When competing in the Olympics, every little bit matters.

THOMAS FULLER and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up.) The turnout was thin in Berkeley on Thursday for ShakeOut, an earthquake drill that has expanded to seismic-prone areas across the globe. Its the 10th anniversary of the drill, which was conceived as a way to remind California residents of the dangers of earthquakes and to remind them to drop to the floor, cover their head and neck, and crawl under a desk when they feel the shaking start. Forrest Lanning, the earthquake program manager in California for FEMA, warned the handful of reporters in attendance at the Berkeley event that many Californians will be on their own after an earthquake hits. FEMA is not going to be able to come in and save everybody, he said. Mr. Lanning, an engineer who lived for four years in New Zealand when that country was rebuilding after the series of earthquakes in Christchurch, said one of the biggest problems California will face after an earthquake is housing. In a state already suffering a homeless and housing crisis, a large earthquake could force hundreds of thousands of people out of their dwellings. Mr. Lanning said there were no good answers about how California will handle earthquake homelessness.","Inside an earthquake simulator trailer in Berkeley, municipal employees and others experienced the shaking of a magnitude 7.0 quake that pushed some of them off the seats they’d been sitting on.",2018-10-19T12:57:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: What an Earthquake Could Do to the State’s Housing Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/california-today-earthquake-drill.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/us/19californiatoday-1/19californiatoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,magnitude,1
"Ray Sanchez, Madeline Holcombe and Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) More than 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 1.5 or greater have shaken Alaska since Friday's big quak e knocked out power, ripped open roads and splintered buildings in Anchorage, US Geological Survey geophysicist Randy Baldwin said Sunday. The majority were of a magnitude of 2.5 or weaker, meaning they weren't likely felt. But more than 350 of the aftershocks were higher than 2.5, according to USGS data. Still, local officials said life was returning to normal after Friday's magnitude 7 earthquake, even as 4 to 8 inches of snow was expected Sunday. ""This is the second-largest earthquake we've had since 1964, which was a very significant earthquake,"" Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz told reporters Saturday, referring to the 9.2 quake that was the most powerful recorded in US history. ""In terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,"" Berkowitz said. ""I would characterize this as a demonstration that Anchorage is prepared for these kind of emergencies."" Alaskans resilient to damage No fatalities or serious injuries were reported, officials said. In Alaska's largest city -- with a population of about 300,000 -- airports, hospitals, emergency services and most businesses were operating. ""The power is up. The heat is on. The communication lines are opening,"" said Anchorage Municipal Manager Bill Falsey. Most of the aftershocks have not rattled Alaskans. But 12 as of Sunday morning more powerful than 4.5 struck near Anchorage and Big Lake, the USGS says. A 5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest since a 5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake, said Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist with the USGS. ""That would have given people a shake and probably a bit of a scare given what they went through yesterday,"" he told CNN. The 7.0 earthquake sent residents scurrying for cover when it hit about 8:30 a.m. Friday. The quake was centered 10 miles northeast of Anchorage. ""The most striking thing about this event was that it was so close to Anchorage,"" Hayes said. ""That's why it has caused the damage that we're seeing."" The earthquake was not unusual for the region and probably wouldn't have received much attention had it not struck so close to town, he said. Roads buckled under passing cars and products tumbled from shelves. In court, panicked attorneys scurried under tables as a room rocked from side to side. ""It was very loud when it came,"" Berkowitz said Friday. ""It was very clear that this was something bigger than what we normally experience. We live in earthquake country... but this was a big one."" Palmer resident Kristin Dossett described the initial jolt as ""absolutely terrifying."" It was the biggest quake she has felt in her 37 years in a region where temblors are common, Dossett said. One aftershock moved her piano a foot and half from the wall. ""It just didn't stop. It kept going and got louder and louder, and things just fell everywhere everything off my dressers, off my bookcases, my kitchen cupboard. Just broken glass everywhere."" Philip Peterson was in a multistory building in downtown Anchorage as the structure swayed and coffee mugs fell from tables and tiles from the ceiling. ""I just jumped under my desk and had to ride it out,"" Peterson said. Authorities don't have firm figures on damage yet, though the Anchorage Police Department reported ""major infrastructure damage"" around the city. Helicopters and drones were assessing infrastructure across the region. There were no reports of missing people, authorities saidala. Alaska Regional Hospital and Providence Alaska Medical Center suffered damage but were able to keep emergency rooms open. The Anchorage School District canceled classes Monday and Tuesday to assess damage. Gov. Bill Walker has issued a disaster declaration. The 7.0 earthquake was felt up to 400 miles away, said state seismologist Michael West. He called it the most significant earthquake in Anchorage since 1964. CNN's Sheena Jones, Amanda Watts, Dakin Andone, Shawn Nottingham, Chuck Johnston, Keith Allen and Matthew Hilk contributed to this report.","More than 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 1.5 or greater have shaken Alaska since Friday's big quake knocked out power, ripped open roads and splintered buildings in Anchorage, US Geological Survey geophysicist Randy Baldwin said Sunday.",2018-12-02T15:11:44Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","More than 1,000 aftershocks rock region after big quake in Alaska",https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/02/us/alaska-earthquake/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181130204949-11-alaska-earthquake-1130-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,magnitude,1

Rhett Allain,"This is a cooler physics problem than I initially realized. It goes something like this. A block has a mass of 1 kg and is placed on a vertical wall such that the coefficient of static friction is 0.5. With what magnitude force do you need to push on the block perpendicular to the wall to keep the block from falling? Here, a picture will help. Let's do this. I will start with a force diagram. There are four forces acting on this block: downward gravitational force, the force from the push, a frictional force, and a normal force from the wall. As a force diagram, it would look like this. Since this block is in equilibrium (at rest with zero acceleration), the net vector force must be zero Newtons. This means the net force in the x direction and the net force in the y direction must be zero. What forces are acting in the y direction? It's just the gravitational force and the frictional force. Yes, the magnitude of the frictional force must be equal to the weight. The friction is in the vertical direction because it is parallel to the wall (which is vertical). But how do you increase the friction force so that it's enough to keep the block from falling? In a basic model of friction, the magnitude of this force depends on two things: the types of materials interacting and the force with which they're pushed together. You can't really change the types of material in the block and the wall—but you can control the force with which they're pushed together. In the diagram above, this force is the normal force (labeled as N). In general, we can write this friction model as the following: So the pushing force ( F above) increases the normal force ( N ) and this normal force increases the friction force to balance the weight. I'll skip the rest of the steps (you should do this for homework), but in the end, the minimum force (which uses the maximum friction) would be: Does this answer even make sense? Yes. First, it has the right units (units of Newtons) since the coefficient of static friction is unitless and m g* is in Newtons. Second, this says that with a greater coefficient of friction, you don't have to push so hard. That makes sense. But really, this problem is just a warm-up. How about something better? Next question. What if I take the same block and push up at an angle? Like this: Would I have to push harder or not as hard to keep the block up? Go ahead and make a prediction. OK, now let's do it. Again, I will start with a force diagram. It's pretty much the same as before except that pushing force is at an angle. Except that it's not the same. Some cool things happen. First, since the force is pushing at an angle the x component decreases. This means the normal force also decreases, which decreases the frictional force. However, that's OK since the force now has a vertical component too. With this force diagram, I can again write down the sum of the forces in the x and y directions. I will skip most of the steps (so that you can do it for homework), but here is what I get for the magnitude of the force pushing at an angle (I also used the friction model from above). That's nice. Right? But again, we should check this equation. Does it have the correct units? Yes—the denominator of this expression just has μ s and trig functions which do not have units. This means that overall the expression has units of Newtons. That's good. What would happen if I push with an angle of zero degrees? Putting in zero for θ in this expression I get the same answer as the first question (pushing horizontal)—so that makes sense. Finally, what if I push straight up with θ equal to 90 degrees? This would give a force magnitude equal to the weight of the block—again, that seems reasonable. But wait! What about the answer to the question about pushing horizontal compared to pushing at an angle? Which requires more force? As long as the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees, the stuff in the denominator will be bigger than just μ s such that the force will be smaller at an angle. Is there a ""best"" angle that requires the least amount of force? Yes! Let's find it. Of course you could take the equation for the force as a function of θ above and take the derivative with respect to θ and then set it equal to zero. This would be your standard max-min problem from calculus class. What if I just sort of use brute force to solve this problem? I can calculate the force required and a bunch of different angles and then just find the angle with the smallest force. Since I don't actually want to do this by hand—I will use Python. And here is that program (so that you can play with it too). Just push the Run button to run it and then you can go back and edit the code if you want to play with it. Don't worry, you can't really break anything. This is a fairly straightforward program. But the cool part is that there is a minimum pushing force at some angle. It's easier to see with larger values for the coefficient of friction, so in the code above, I have it set at 0.6. With this value, a push angle of about 59.9° gives the lowest possible force. This force is lower than pushing it horizontal and lower than pushing straight up. In fact, every angle gives a lower force than pushing it horizontal. What happens as you change the coefficient of friction? Just for fun, I made the program a little bit more complicated so that I can create this plot. ( Here's the code if you want it ) I don't care what you think. This is cool. See, you thought it was a boring physics problem, but you were wrong. Oh, what is this good for in real life? It doesn't matter. I still think it's awesome. Homework Other than playing around with the code, I just have one homework question for you. Given the same values for mass and the coefficient of static friction and pushing angle—what is the maximum force you can push on the block before it slides up ? Hint: you will need to change the direction of the frictional force. Also, you should try changing the angle and see what happens—you know... for fun.

Rhett Allain,"No one can deny that there are some great physics videos out there in the wild internet. Today, I found this one floating around—featuring what appears to be a worker that needs to get out of a cone-shaped hole. Oh sure, he could possibly climb up the side or maybe even use a rope as an assist. But no. This guy studied his physics. He knows a great trick to get out of this hole—by running in circle. But how does it work? Climbing Up the Side Suppose this was just an ordinary worker that tried to walk straight up the side of the hole. Of course there must be some force on him to prevent him from sliding back down the incline—that's the frictional force. The frictional force is parallel to the surface of the hole, and its magnitude depends on two factors. The first is called the coefficient of static friction, which is normally represented by the variable μ s. Depending on the two types of surfaces interacting, the coefficient will have a value between 0 and 1; the higher the value, the rougher the interaction. The second factor is the normal force: the force the surface exerts on the object that is perpendicular to the surface. If you have a flat surface with an object at rest, the surface pushes up with the same force as the gravitational force pulling down. However, as you move to a sloped surface, this value decreases. Overall, I can write the maximum frictional force as: How steep of an incline can you walk up? This depends on both the coefficient of friction and the incline angle. If a person is moving up at a constant speed, then the net force must be zero. Here is a force diagram showing a human moving up a slope that is tilted θ above the horizontal. Yes, I am using a box to represent the person. It's fine. The normal force pushes just enough to cancel the component of the gravitational force that pushes perpendicular to the plane. In the above diagram, if the normal force was equal in magnitude to the gravitational force the box would accelerate off the surface. That would just be super weird. Instead, this normal force only provides enough to prevent the box from moving into the surface. As the angle of incline increase, there is less gravitational force pushing into the plane, so the normal force decreases. This is why it's difficult to walk up a very steep slope. The steeper the slope, the lower the normal force. With a smaller normal force you will have a lower maximum frictional force. At some point, you just start sliding down the slope. That's bad. Running in a Circle Here's where the physics trick comes into play. If you could increase the normal force on a human, you would also increase the frictional force. But how could you do this? Imagine that you're riding in a car and this car is driving around in a circle turning to the left. If the car is turning to the left, there must be some force pushing you in the direction of the turn (and towards the center of the circle). This force might be from the door or maybe from the seatbelt, but there must be a force. When an object moves in a circle (even at a constant speed), it must have an acceleration component perpendicular to the velocity. The magnitude of this acceleration increases as you increase the speed and decreases as you increase the size of the circle. If you have an acceleration, you have to have a force. So in order to move in a circle there needs to be a force. Now back to the construction worker. When he runs in a circle, he needs that extra force to push towards the center of the hole. This extra circular force (technically, it would be call the centripetal force) would have to come from the normal force. Yes, the total magnitude of the normal force would increase so that there would a larger component of this force pointing towards the center of the circle. With a larger normal force, you get a larger frictional force. Boom. That's just what he needs—a larger frictional force to escape the hole. It's a brilliant move.",You could climb out of a hole with a ladder or a rope—or you could call on your formidable physics knowledge.,2017-11-14T21:45:36Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How to Hoist Yourself Out of a Hole With Physics,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-hoist-yourself-out-of-a-hole-with-physics/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a0b5aef81f0642e8fbda99a/191:100/pass/running-TA.jpg,wired,Wired,magnitude,0
"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In 2011, a colossal tsunami set off by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake slammed into the eastern shores of Japan. Not long afterwards, some of the 1.5 million tons of floating debris created by the waves, from buoys and boats to entire fishing docks, began washing up along Americas northwest Pacific coast. As revealed by a recent study, dozens of species of algaeglobally abundant, as well as those found in Asia and across the northern Pacificsnuck along on this debris and turned up in Oregon and Washington. Spending several years collecting, classifying and observing these tiny beasties, researchers found that most of them were opportunists that had arrived in an environment not dissimilar from their starting points. Had they been given the chance, a full-scale invasion of this brave new world might have taken place. Algae might not sound like much of a danger, but dont forget that these little critters can disrupt entire regions when they get out of hand. Just look offshore from Floridas gulf coast, where a red tide bloom has slaughtered wildlife and devastated the tourist industry. Its even become a hot button issue for voters there in this weeks midterm elections. Thats why this (fortunately averted) incursion matters. Writing in the journal Phycologia, the researchers suggested that if it werent for an extensive and prompt clean-up operation, many of the invaders were likely to have quickly colonized their landing sites. Although its been previously acknowledged that species can ride buoyant debris thousands of miles across the ocean, a 2017 study on the Japanese tsunami was one of the first to document it happening in real time over such a huge scale. It revealed that nearly 300 larger species, from crabs and sea stars to sponges and fish, turned up alive in North America and Hawaii. This new study proves to be an equally eye-opening companion piece. Lead author Gayle Hansen, a marine phycologist at Oregon State University (OSU), explained that the first piece of biota-carrying debris found was the Agate Beach dock, which turned up in June 2012, just over a year after the tsunami occurred. Immediately starting to gather specimens, they ultimately captured 42 pieces of debris between 2012 and 2016 as they washed up in the Pacific Northwest. The debris were found to contain a staggering 84 different species and varieties of algae and cyanobacteria. We did not expect debris to arrive with hitch-hiking biota as we did not think the Japanese species would survive the cross-Pacific journey, she told Earther. Of these, 83 percent were reproductive and dropping spores on examination, while all were capable of becoming fertile. Although many were short-lived, they often had a high colonization potential. Some species had been seen in the Pacific Northwest before, but others were alien, and several were known to be incredibly effective at invading new territory. All things considered, Gaylealong with colleagues at Kobe Universityconcluded that 49 percent of the species that arrived represented an invasion threat to the region. This invasion may have been cancelled, but Hansen referred to numerous earlier examples that hint at what may have transpired. A classic example can be found in Hawaiis Caulerpa taxifolia algae: after having been accidentally introduced to the Mediterranean by an aquarium, it colonized large swaths of the shallow subtidal area, outcompeting the local seagrass. The fish, not willing to eat the toxin-producing invader, experienced a precipitous decline in their populations. John Chapman, a fisheries expert at OSU not involved in the new workand an author of last years tsunami rafting studytold Earther that the environmental threats from introduced algae are very likely underappreciated. Chapman noted that the vast majority of algae are small, which makes them difficult to identify or even detect. This study also found that the smaller species proved to be the longer-term survivors, and were more likely to succeed in invading. This is all problematic, as these critters are likely to be influencing ecosystems in ways that arent yet recognized. And tsunamis are just one part of the problem. Chapman noted that hurricanes, floods, mudslides and pure human messiness all generate floating debris, which is building wider bridges between continents that an enormous diversity of organisms are riding. This article has been updated to clarify that 83 percent of algae varieties the researchers examined were actively reproductive, while all were capable of becoming fertile.","In 2011, a colossal tsunami set off by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake slammed into the eastern shores of Japan.

Robin George Andrews,"Between Mozambique and Madagascar lies the island of Mayotte. Since May 10, the French Geological Survey has been keeping an eye on a collection of earthquakes taking place just off the islands eastern shores, which peaked with a magnitude 5.8 shake. This swarm was curious enough all by itselfand then, on November 11, things took a peculiar turn. That day, seismographs all over the world registered a very low-frequency tremor, a strange grumble that lasted for around 30 minutes. One segment of the signal also featured several high-frequency blips, each separated by roughly a minute of time, a bit like a regular, ticking clock. Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton, highlighted the phenomenon in a November 12 tweet. Something biggggg, yet strangely slow, sent seismic rumblings around the surface of much of the planet yesterday, he wrote. Today, that succinct summary still holds, even as discussion of the event continues between geoscientists of all kinds over on Twitter. To date, no one is quite sure what caused it. It wasnt a tectonic earthquake, a landslide, nor a meteorite impact. Some experts baffled by the seismic enigma have not-so-seriously suggested that perhaps, finally, its sea monsters. The strange sound was almost certainly not Godzilla taking a submarine stroll, but scientists are starting to coalesce around what they suspect may be the answer: strange and unseen movements of magma, far beneath the seafloor. In order to understand why, though, we have to go back to the very beginning. Robin Lacassin, a geologist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics, told Gizmodo that Mayotte is part of the Comoros archipelago, a chain of volcanic islands that first saw fireworks 20 million years ago. Eruptions have flared up in recent times on other islands, most notably Grande Comore. Conversely, Mayotte, a comparatively dormant presence, hasnt seen any fresh lava for around 4,000 years. In any case, volcanism in the regionpowered by a small rising mantle plume or a deformed tectonic plateis alive and kicking. The swarm of earthquakes taking place near Mayotte, although new for the area, resemble those produced by magmatic processes of some kind, including the movement of magma and other superheated fluids. The November 11 signal, however, is a very different kettle of fish. No specific natural process has yet been linked to the seismic data, and the lack of monitoring at the site of the event means even its precise location is currently unclear. First, lets look at that low-frequency hum. Representing surface waves traveling across the planet, this dominated the global signal. High-frequency waves were not picked up by distant stations. Hicks told Gizmodo that a good analogy here is someone living down the road from a nightclub. You might not be next door, but as long as the energy behind the beats is high enough, what youll hear is the bass, not the higher-pitched stuff, which weakens relatively quickly. Potent bass lines can be created by many slow, powerful events, from tectonic earthquakes to submarine landslides and even glacial calvings. In this case, the tide gauges failed to show any changes during the event, meaning there were no mass movements on the seafloor of any kind. The few GPS stations in the region recorded some local seafloor movement, but just a little, suggesting the signals source was fairly deep. The only plausible explanation remaining was some sort of volcanism. Thats perfectly reasonable; after all, Mayotte is volcanic, and the swarm resembles volcanic activity. Anthony Lomax, a consulting seismologist, told Gizmodo that its probably volcanic activity, causing earthquakes. Although a submarine eruption cannot be ruled out, there are as yet no observable signs that one took place, like fresh lava on the seafloor or a floating raft of pumice at the surface. Instead, Lacassin said that all the data points to the movement of magma within the crust. But where exactly was it going? A day after the event, researchers at the ENS University in Paris suspected magma was draining from the site, causing the roof of a reservoir of magma to collapse and cause quakes. In a statement, they reckoned that 0.3 cubic miles of magma draining from a reservoir would fit the GPS data well. A good comparison here, according to Lomax, is what was seen recently at Kilauea in Hawaii. During that eruption, magma continuously drained from the summit crater. The crater deflated, causing earthquakes, and magma escaped underground to the volcanos eastern flanks. However, Hicks initial analysis of the available data seemed to indicate magma was moving into a reservoir and inflating it. Jean Paul Ampuero, a seismologist and director of research at Frances Research Institute for Development, agreed. Collapse events or inflation events have opposite signs, he told Gizmodo. This one is of the inflation type. At the time of writing, Hicks analysis is leaning toward drainage again. Either way, its got to be moving magma, but nothings certain yet. The deficit of instruments near the signal site means there are no real before-and-after datasets, Helen Robinson, a geothermal expert and PhD candidate at Glasgow University, told Gizmodo. Useful information as to what physically changed at that spot near Mayotte doesnt really exist. The key piece of evidence here is the seismic signal, which certainly shows the ghost of something strange. The signal is so utterly weird, though, that its proving difficult to decipher. Ampuero said he spoke to a colleague of his whose expertise is in the seismology of volcanoes. They confirmed that the internal chaos of volcanoes can cause very low-frequency hums, but the incredibly long 30-minute duration of this one was currently inexplicable. In order to get this sort of prolonged, low-frequency grumble, youd need something big to resonate. Its like a ringing bell. If you want to get a very low frequency, a very low tone, you need that bell to be huge, Ampuero explained. Maybe the magma reservoir has been hit by a wave of little quakes, and then kept ringing for a little while. Then, there are those clockwork-like high-frequency blips, which revealed themselves after seismologists began filtering out the signals deep hum. Robinson explained that such blips are like those detected when rock is being fractured as magma forces its way through. What baffles me is how evenly spaced out they were, she said. I have no idea how to explain that. Neither, as it turns out, can anyone else. Signals with very regular intervals tend to be artificially generated, but they can have natural origins. Just take pulsars : When these rapidly rotating, lighthouse-like objects were discovered in the 1960s, the regularity of the flashes were briefly suspected of being generated by intelligent life. The original source was even dubbed LGM, for little green men. Here, the high-frequency blips instinctively brought industrial or military activity to Robinsons mind, but there is no sign of anything of the sort in the region. In this case, the regularity could perhaps be magma moving at a constant rate through the rock, causing repeating fractures. Like much about the signal, this interpretation is far from certain. Lomax brings up the parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant, which tells the tale of said men encountering an elephant for the first time, with each trying to identify what it is by touching just one part of it. Similarly, researchers of different geoscience stripes are giving their own interpretation of the curious signal. Thats a good start, because you want different takes from different directions, Lomax said. Cracking the case, however, is a team effort. Fortunately, judging by the frenetic scientific discussion still taking place on social media, thats already in full swing.","Between Mozambique and Madagascar lies the island of Mayotte.

Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale.

Rhett Jones,"Amazon is on a mission to redefine the brick and mortar businesses that it disrupted out of existence. With its Amazon Go convenience store, Amazon is pioneering locations with no checkout lines. But innovators spawn imitators and an emerging startup thinks it can retrofit any store with its AI-powered item tracking system starting next year. AiFi has been developing its system under the radar since 2016. Its founders, Steve Gu and Ying Zheng, have previously worked for Apple and Google on big projects like 3D Touch and Google Glass. On Tuesday, they started promoting their work in an interview with TechCrunch and if what they say is true, the age of the cashier-free checkout will soon be upon us. Gu characterizes the company as an artificial intelligence startup that just happens to be focused on launching a system for stores to track customers and their purchases. He and a 25-person team have been working to perfect a network of cameras and sensors powered by AI that allows a customer to walk into the store, pick up an item, walk out, and be automatically charged through an app on their smartphone. Amazon launched its first cashier-less pilot store in January, and people lined up around the block for the opportunity to see what it’s like to shop without standing in line. But that store is quite modest in size. Gu tells TechCrunch that AiFi’s system can track “up to 500 people, and tens of thousands of SKU item numbers.” In a press release, Gu writes: “Our pilot will roll out in one very large store, orders of magnitude bigger than the Amazon Go store, at the end of this year, with many more large stores to follow so thousands of consumers will experience the delight of no longer standing in long and tedious checkout lines.” According to TechCrunch, an initial demo store will open in San Francisco, and an unnamed, “larger grocer” will try out the tech in New York next year. The company claims that retrofitting almost any store will be a relatively simple task. AiFi calls this business a “trillion-dollar opportunity” and that doesn’t exactly sound crazy. Almost 16 million people work in the retail industry—that’s a lot of payroll costs. And AiFi is looking to continually make money from its retail clients through subscriptions rather than hardware sales, which raises the question of who will have access to all that data that AiFi plans to use for personalized shopping. We asked a spokesperson for the company if it will share that data with its clients, if it’ll be anonymous, and if it will be sold to third-parties but the company did not immediately respond. As far as the human cost this could have by eliminating job opportunities, Gu is taking the sunny outlook that the AI community loves to tout, telling TechCrunch that the system will just handle “the tedious part of the job” and free up “human labor to do something that’s emotionally more engaging or more creative.” God knows retail behemoths spend a lot of time fretting that they don’t have the budgets to hire low-wage workers for emotionally engaging and creative tasks. I have to say that I’m a little skeptical about Gu’s grand claims and timetable. The company is still young and has only raised $4 million. Of course, today’s press push is surely designed to act as a coming out ceremony that may bring in more cash. A company as big as Amazon has struggled to perfect its system and, for now, it’s just tolerating some of the shoplifting that slips by. If AiFi is really on the brink of doing something that’s comparable or better than Amazon’s system, retailers will likely line-up to compete with their arch-enemy and roll-out the store of the future. Have fun being followed by personalized ads and never having to interact with a stranger again.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

Scott K. Johnson,"Enlarge / Map of shaking intensity around the epicenter of the September 8, 2017 magnitude 8.2 earthquake. reader comments 2 September 2017 saw a pair of weird earthquakes in Mexico. A magnitude 8.2 on September 8 just offshore the state of Chiapas was followed by a magnitude 7.1 on September 19this time much closer to Mexico City, causing considerable destruction there. While the two earthquakes were not connected, they were the same type of earthquake, which is unusual in the region. Mexicos western coast is a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific plate collides with and dives beneath the continent. That means that earthquakes along that boundary are typically the result of compressive force that squeezes rock to slide up the plane of the fault. Both September earthquakes were the result of stretching, however, which is almost as much of a head-scratcher as finding that part of your cars engine was pulled apart during a head-on crash. The explanation here is that as the oceanic plate disappears beneath the continent, it sinks downward into the mantle. First of all, the bending of the plate downward causes stretching, just as the skin over your elbow has to stretch. Second, the sinking plate pulls downward as it hangs from the part of the plate that is still up at the surfaceanother stretching force. Occasional earthquakes within this bending, sinking plate can reflect that stretching. A new study led by the University of Oregons Diego Malgar found something even weirder, though. Counter to what we thought possible, the fault seems to have broken clean through the entire tectonic plate. The tectonic plate boundary known as a subduction zone, where an oceanic plate dives down beneath another plate. The shaking recorded at seismometers can be used to pinpoint the location of an earthquake, but more detail can be extracted if you have things like GPS sensors in the area detecting ground movement. Seismologists can model the process backward from the measured surface movement and figure out how the fault moved underground. Thats what Malgar and his colleagues did here, producing estimates of the portion of the fault plane that slipped and how much it moved. The results show that a 150km-long section of the fault slipped three meters or so. Vertically, the portion of the fault that slipped starts at the top of the oceanic plateabout 15km below the Earths surfaceand continues all the way down to a depth of about 80km, which is roughly the bottom of the plate. The movement started at a spot about 46km down and spread outward along the plane of the fault from there. The equations for the physics of all this tell us that the fault movement should have been restricted to the upper half of the oceanic plate. This is partly because hotter temperatures at greater depths make the rock less brittle and partly because the inside of the bend in the plate should be feeling squeezing rather than stretching. Look around to make sure no ones watching, and then stare at your elbow. As you bend it, the skin stretches around the outside of your elbow, but relaxes on the inside as your forearm and bicep come together. Similarly, faults moving because theyre being pulled apart on the outside of the bend should be clamped together on the inside of the bend. So why did this earthquake break the rules? The researchers say a couple additional factors must be at play. First, seawater percolating down into the cracks that formed as the oceanic plate first bent to head beneath the continent could have cooled the rock and reacted with minerals, making the rock more brittle than it would be otherwise. And second, the sinking portion of the oceanic plate must be pulling downward pretty hard. Lets not pull on your wrist hard enough to stretch your elbow joint, but doing so would counteract the squeezing on the inside of your elbow as it bends. Explaining this little puzzle has practical implications. Not only do these earthquakes produce dangerous shaking, but if they occur close enough to the point on the seafloor where the two plates meet, they can push up seawater and create a tsunami wave. Understanding Mexicos hazards requires understanding what these oddball earthquakes are capable of. Since the plates there seem to break rules followed by plate boundaries elsewhere around the world, the local rules need to be better understood. Protecting people during earthquakes is all about minimizing surprises, so while they are always interesting, we want to limit the earthquakes that make you go ""Huh."" Nature Geoscience, 2018.

Mark Kaufman,"A cluster of earthquakes hit Oklahoma over the past few days, unsettling thousands of the state's residents. As of 11 a.m. ET Monday the U.S. Geological Survey says that 2,274 people reported feeling a 4.3 magnitude quake Sunday night. There have been at least 16 noticeable earthquakes (above 2.5 in magnitude) observed by the Geologic Survey since Friday, April 6. While nerve-rattling, the quakes are normal for the area — at least since 2009. That's when the problematic quakes began, Jeremy Boak, Director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: Hey, how about we helicopter grizzly bears into this remote National Park? ""It's not out of the ordinary,"" said Boak. ""In the frame of what’s been going on, it’s normal."" Oklahoma's dramatic rise in quakes has been stoked by oil and gas extraction activity in the region. This quake activity — associated with the ""fracking revolution"" that has also propelled historically high U.S. oil exports — comes in two forms. The first is fracking itself, an oil extraction process more formally known as ""hydraulic fracking."" Broadly, this means injecting millions of gallons of water, sand, and a small percentage of chemicals into a deeply-drilled hole. This breaks apart rocks to release oil deposits, sometimes creating earthquakes. But most Oklahoma quakes aren't caused by fracking itself, but by a secondary process called ""wastewater injection."" After water is used to fracture apart rocks thousands of feet below, it comes back up as ""wastewater,"" and is usually injected back into the ground nearby (the mixture has to go somewhere). Water is extremely heavy, so, this can put pressure on deep-lying faults. And if enough pressure is applied to these cracks in the Earth's crust, they'll rupture and move, causing sizeable quakes. While a U.S. Geologic Survey spokesperson said it's too early to officially confirm the cause of the northwestern Oklahoma earthquake burst, Boak said it's almost certainly due to wastewater injection. That's the common cause of quakes in this part of northwestern Oklahoma, and generally, has been the prevailing story for years. Earthquakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher measured in Oklahoma as of July 2017. Image: U.S. Geologic survey But, overall, earthquakes have been on the decline in Oklahoma since the especially rattling years of 2014, 2015, and 2016. The year 2015 saw nearly 900 quakes of 3.0 or higher in Oklahoma (around 2.5 or above is noticeable to most people). For perspective, before 2009, Oklahoma usually recorded one or two quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher each year. By 2015, earthquake activity peaked for a time at around 4 and a half quakes each day, Boak previously said. But this year, Boak expects around 200 noticeable quakes to occur in Oklahoma. This recent cluster of quakes, then, is ""part of the continuing pattern which in general is declining,"" he said. There are two major reasons for the decline, said Boak. One is the falling price of oil. This means that oil and gas extraction isn't quite as lucrative as it once was a few years ago (it's a famously boom and bust industry). Accordingly, there's a bit less fracking activity. Oklahoma resident Lisa Griggs believes cracks in her home have been caused by Oklahoma's manmade earthquakes. Image: The Washington Post/Getty Images The second reason is mandatory state requirements that oil and gas companies find ways to reduce quaking. The rattled citizens of Oklahoma made quite clear to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the gas industry, that the quakes must stop — or at least be limited. ""We needed to shut this down and it actually appears to have worked,"" said Boak. Oil and gas companies accomplish this reduction in a variety of ways, which includes stopping wastewater injections when seismic activity begins. As for Boak, he has still yet to feel one of Oklahoma's big quakes — even though he studies them. He's too far south of most the activity, in the quieter confines of Norman, Oklahoma. ""I’ve never had the privilege of feeling one of the Oklahoma earthquakes,"" he said.","A cluster of earthquakes hit Oklahoma over the past few days, unsettling thousands of the state's residents.

Tom McKay,"A Japanese nuclear power station in Hokkaido is operating on emergency power after the region was hit by a 6.7-magnitude quake in the early hours of Thursday morning, Reuters reported. However, though the event carries unsettling overtones of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, authorities say there is currently no danger of any similar radioactive release occurring. 100 people are injured and 19 missing following the quake on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK. The seismic event knocked out local power, forcing Hokkaido Electric Power’s Tomari nuclear plant to switch to emergency generators to keep its three reactors from overloading. Reuters wrote: The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. The Fukushima incident occurred after an earthquake off the coast of Tōhoku prefecture on Honshu, Japan’s largest island, caused a tsunami. The disaster killed some 19,000 people, as well as knocked out power to and swamped backup generators at the Fukushima facility. The result was three nuclear meltdowns and hydrogen-air explosions that spread a radioactive plume up to 25 miles away, as well as resulted in authorities dumping massive amounts of contaminated material into the oceans. Scientists say most of that radiation quickly faded or was otherwise diluted. Most, but not all, also agree that there is likely a low risk to public health outside of the immediate region of the plant. The primary danger is to the thousands of workers involved in its cleanup. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported, the Japanese government acknowledged the first death of a worker from radiation exposure at the plant, a subcontractor for its operator Tokyo Electric Power Company that developed lung cancer in 2016. Japan idled all of its 54 nuclear power facilities after the incident, but seven have since been reactivated “after a protracted relicensing process,” Reuters wrote. The Conversation wrote last year that the Japanese government estimated the total cost of the Fukushima at around $188 billion, while polls indicated the Japanese public had lost faith in the safety of nuclear power. The cleanup effort at the facility still generates huge amounts of nuclear waste, and Tokyo Electric doesn’t expect to begin clearing fuel debris from the destroyed reactor cores until into the next decade. According to Reuters, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that he is coordinating emergency response for the earthquake on Thursday. A government spokesman added that a Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing plant in the city of Muroran also caught fire, but is being brought under control.

Katrina Filippidis,"With investments from Didi Chuxing, Hyundai Motor, Honda Motor and its recent acquisition of Uber's Asia business, Grab has been slowly cementing its dominance in the sector. To give you a sense of its magnitude, Grab revealed it owned a whopping 95 percent chunk of third-party taxi hailing in Southeast Asia, and handled 71 percent of private vehicle rides in July last year. During that period, it was running about three million rides per day. Naturally, Toyota wants in while the going is good. But Toyota's master plan doesn't necessarily involve securing a market monopoly -- even if the emergence of ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber are pressuring car makers to keep up to speed. The way Atlantis Investment Research Corporation president Edwin Merner sees it, Toyota's partnership with Grab is more about ""getting access to technology that fits in some place in Toyota's broader business."" Merner stressed that increasing the company's knowledge portfolio -- particularly information concerning automated navigation -- would deliver value in terms of future research and development. Toyota has already pumped $2.8 billion into autonomous technology research, although it decided to delay testing on public roads following the fatal crashes of self-driving cars belonging to Uber, Tesla and General Motors. Instead, Toyota will be carrying out trials in a closed facility in Michigan starting from October. It remains to be seen whether Toyota's dream to make flying cars a reality in time for the Tokyo Olympics will eventuate -- that might require a dedicated research facility of its own.","Who knew that ride-sharing investments would become a large facet of Toyota's business strategy.

Alessandra Potenza,"The popular myth that strong earthquakes happen during certain Moon phases has no basis in science, according to new research. Susan Hough, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, pored over 400 years of data from over 200 earthquakes of magnitude eight or larger. She looked at the day the earthquakes occurred, and what phases the Moon was in. And she found no link between the ground shaking and the position of the Earth and the Moon in the sky, according to a study published this week in Seismological Research Letters. 400 years of data from over 200 large earthquakes Previous research has shown that tides — which are influenced by the Moon — can nudge faults to unleash earthquakes. “But if you read those papers, you’ll see that the authors are very careful,” Hough said in a statement. “They never claim that the data can be used for prediction, because the modulation is always very small.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other, or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Scientists have been trying to predict earthquakes throughout history, but to this day, it’s proven impossible. And that has given rise to several popular beliefs, such as how animal behavior can predict earthquakes. However, anecdotal evidence of weasels and snakes acting weird before the ground starts shaking hasn’t been backed up by science yet ( though some researchers are looking into this.) “Of course, humans are pattern-seeking animals so after the fact we think, oh yeah my dog was behaving weirdly or I noticed, you know, animals got really quiet,” Ned Field, a research geophysicist at the USGS told The Verge last year. “We always remember things after the earthquake, but those could just be random things and nothing has really turned out to be consistently reliable in terms of predicting earthquakes.” Now, Hough is saying that the phase of the Moon also can’t predict a strong earthquake. In her analysis, Hough didn’t find any kind of pattern that was statistically significant. Her paper reports her findings quite firmly: The headline reads, “Do Large (Magnitude ≥8) Global Earthquakes Occur on Preferred Days of the Calendar Year or Lunar Cycle?” And the abstract simply says, “No.” So, take her word for it — although Hough isn’t very hopeful. “Sooner or later there is going to be another big earthquake on a full Moon, and the lore will pop back up,” she said. “The hope is that this will give people a solid study to point to.”","“Sooner or later there is going to be another big earthquake on a full Moon, and the lore will pop back up.”",2018-01-20T14:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","No, the Moon can’t help you predict the next earthquake",https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/20/16910510/moon-phases-earthquake-prediction-usgs,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PeJO3V7vIQYOcaFZgZv_ygkEnMc=/0x371:5184x3085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10064655/900548830.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,magnitude,1
,"A magnitude 5.3 earthquake was reported Thursday afternoon off the coast of California near Los Angeles. It was the largest earthquake to strike the Channel Islands region since a 6.0 temblor in 1981, Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson told the Los Angeles Times. No significant damage has been reported after a magnitude 5.3 earthquake in the Channel Islands region off the Southern California coast, but some bricks fell from a chimney at a historic ranch on one of the islands, according to the Associated Press. Channel Islands National Park spokeswoman Yvonne Menard told AP that the bricks fell Thursday at a ranch building on Santa Cruz Island that dates to the 1860s. Menard says the quake was felt by visitors and staff on the island. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The National Tsunami Warning Center said there is no tsunami threat to the California coast.","The Weather Channel Earthquake Shakes Southern California; No Injuries Reported, But Historic Ranch Damaged in 5.3 Magnitude Tremor The Weather Channel Meteorologist Kait Parker reports that a 5.3 magnitude earthquake was felt off the coast of Southern Califo…",2018-04-05T21:41:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Earthquake Shakes Southern California; No Injuries Reported, But Historic Ranch Damaged in 5.3 Magnitude Tremor - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/news/news/2018-04-05-earthquake-southern-california,https://s.w-x.co/screen_shot_2018-04-05_at_3.42.53_pm.png,,Weather.com,magnitude,1
Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports of damage except to a chimney on one of the Channel Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. in the Channel Islands region, about 38 miles (61 kilometers) southwest of the mainland city of Ventura. Some bricks fell from a chimney at an 1860s ranch on Santa Cruz Island, but no one was hurt, said Yvonne Menard, spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles (27 kilometers) from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it went into ""earthquake mode"" and firefighters from all 106 of its firehouses began surveys of their territories, including bridges, dams, large buildings and power lines. ""We currently have no reports of damage or injuries,"" spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena said the earthquake warning system under development for the West Coast gave about 10 seconds of warning before shaking arrived. Earthquakes of such size usually occur about once a year in Southern California, although the most recent one was in 2014, according to veteran seismologist Lucy Jones, recently retired from the USGS. The 96-square-mile (248-square-kilometer) Santa Cruz Island is the largest in the chain of eight Channel Islands, five of which are in the national park. Most of Santa Cruz Island, including the historic ranch, is owned by The Nature Conservancy, which cooperatively manages the island with the Park Service.","CBS News Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California ABC15 Arizona LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports …",2018-04-06T03:09:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abc15.com'}",Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California - ABC15 Arizona,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/los-angeles-earthquake-magnitude-53-quake-strikes-off-california,https://mediaassets.abc15.com//photo/2011/09/19/earthquake_20110919135506_900_675.JPG,,Abc15.com,magnitude,1
Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck near the northernmost tip of Haiti late on Saturday, injuring a number of people and causing some damage to buildings including an auditorium that collapsed, authorities and media reported. The quake struck about 12.3 miles (20 kms), west-northwest of the port of Port-de-Paix, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. Local media reported at least one death. The quake was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude quake struck near the capital Port-au-Prince in 2010, killing thousands of people in the impoverished Caribbean country. In a post on Twitter, Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise urged people to remain calm after the civil protection agency said the quake caused injuries and panic in northern towns. Le Nouvelliste newspaper said one person died when an auditorium collapsed in the town of Gros Morne, and that detainees were released from a police holding cell that was damaged. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The tremor damaged the facade of a church in the town of Plaisance and a house next door collapsed, Frantz Duval, a journalist with Le Nouvelliste, said on Twitter. Initial reports on social media said Saturday’s quake was felt in Port-au-Prince but had not caused major damage there.

Jennifer Brett,"The magnitude 4.4 earthquake that shook many metro Atlantans awake on Wednesday morning felt more powerful than a quake of the same strength would have on the west coast. “Eastern United States earthquakes travel farther. It’s because we have really strong rock beneath us,” explained Andrew Newman, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. “A magnitude 3 here radiates a lot farther, and shakes like a magnitude 4 in California.” » MORE: The earthquake struck two miles from a nuclear plant How common are earthquakes in Georgia? The temblor emanated from east Tennessee, where it was the strongest on record, at about 4:15 a.m. While it took many by surprise (and, naturally, began trending on social media), the event wasn’t out of the ordinary, Newman said. “These little events are kind of nice, kind of a wake up call,” he said. “We don’t necessarily live in an ‘earthquake zone,’ but our earthquake risk is not zero.” No place is entirely free of such activity, he added, although certainly the west coast is far more commonly considered quake country. “Our topography is a lot older,” he said. “The Appalachian Mountains used to look like the Himalayas.” Millions of years of erosion has whittled down the eastern U.S. mountain chain, while on the other side of the country, “the topography is active and dynamic,” Newman said. The powerful 1886 earthquake that struck Charleston is the most significant seismic event in modern history in this region. It caused at least 60 deaths and more than $5 million in damage. Thousands of buildings, including Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church, were leveled. Here’s an exhaustively researched, 200+ page government report about it. The powerful quake, estimated to have been a high-6 magnitude event, was felt in Atlanta and throughout the southeast. It was front-page news in the Atlanta Constitution for days. It’s possible that other such events have been felt in this region, but records don’t exist to reflect it. “It’s really because we haven’t been around long enough,” is how Newman put it. As with hurricanes, measured in category 1-5 strength levels, earthquake strength grows exponentially from one magnitude to another. Experiencing a magnitude 3 event in our region isn’t at all unusual, but more powerful quakes happen with far less frequency. “The unfortunate thing is we never know when a magnitude 7 is going to strike,” Newman said. He didn’t actually realize metro Atlanta had experienced an earthquake until he read about it. “I woke up but I wake up pretty frequently at that time,” he said, figuring the shaking might have roused him but that he didn’t realize it at the time. “I looked at the clock and went back to sleep.”","NEW DETAILS: Why Atlanta felt an earthquake that struck in Tennessee Atlanta Journal Constitution Two earthquakes shake eastern Tennessee; felt in Atlanta WPTV West Palm Beach Earthquake, magnitude 4.4, rattles Tennessee, Georgia Fox News Magnitude 4.4 Earthq…",2018-12-12T16:15:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ajc.com'}",NEW DETAILS: Why Atlanta felt an earthquake that struck in Tennessee - Atlanta Journal Constitution,https://www.ajc.com/news/why-atlanta-felt-earthquake-that-struck-tennessee/pLFA3va5UjMlWRwitvB1TO/,https://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Wires/w2/Local_Wsbtv/2018/12/12/Images/887604283_Earthquake1_1525031547819_11515855_ver1.0_640_360_1544609512612_13972815_ver1.0_640_360.jpg,,Ajc.com,magnitude,1
Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A powerful earthquake struck Taiwan today, causing damage and a partially collapsed hotel building, sources report. The USGS reports that the magnitude 6.4 quake struck 21 kilometers (13 miles) north of the city of Hualien at 10:50 U.S. Eastern Time, at a shallow 9.5 kilometers (6 miles) below the surface. No tsunami warnings have been issued. The English-language Taiwan News and the BBC report that a number of buildings have collapsed in Hualien City, including a roof of a hotel. There are no reports of injuries yet. Residents as far away as Taipei (around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north) could feel tremors. This is the second powerful earthquake in the area in just a few days. A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck in nearly the same spot on Sunday (Monday Taiwan time). Taiwan’s location on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire means they’re no stranger to tremors. Many of the country’s buildings are built to withstand some shaking. With a quake of this size there’s always the potential for aftershocks. “We haven’t seen any large enough here to record yet,” John Bellini from the USGS told Gizmodo. “But don’t have the local instrumentation they would have.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Speaking with reporters following the quake, Alaska Governor Bill Walker said that resulting disruption and needed repairs could last quite some time. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck around 8:29 a.m. local time followed by ensuing, smaller earthquakes. Citing United States Geological Survey research geophysicist Gavin Hayes, CNN reported Saturday that a magnitude-5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest event since a magnitude-5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake. Despite earthquakes being common in the area, Fridays event was still significant. Videos shared on social media captured widespread damage across Anchorage and the surrounding area. One video shared by climatologist Brian Brettschneider on Twitter captured drone footage of cracks in ice at Anchorages Waldron Lake. According to Brettschneider, the ice was 8 inches thick. Nat Herz, a reporter for Alaska Public Media, told NPR that he was sitting at a coffee shop in Anchorage when he just felt like sort of a rumble or a buzz. But then things kind of got louder, and things started really shaking and shaking hard. And people were kind of looking around, he told NPR. And then I think, you know, someone went for the door, and everyone else went for the door. And, you know, everyone kind of hurried outside. And kind of once things settled down, everyone went back in. At least two highways were closed down following the earthquake, with local CBS affiliate KTVA reporting that areas Glenn Highway endured significant damage that included a massive sinkhole. Power losses also reportedly affected tens of thousands of people following the initial earthquake. Governor Walker said in a phone interview Friday that theres a possibility that some infrastructure damage could take weeks or months to repair, especially given the winter season. Walker also said he spoke with President Donald Trump, after which call KTVA reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved assistance for the area. Its going to be a disruption for quite some time, Walker said. Weve been on the phone with the White House a number of times today [and] took a call from President Trump. They talked about their desire to help us, and we appreciate that very much. According to Alaska Public Media, schools in the area are expected to be closed until at least Wednesday of next week.","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska. Tsunami watches were issued for California, Oregon, and Washington State. A few hours later, all watches and warnings had been canceled, leading many Twitter users still-half asleep at their computers to wonder: Why is it so damn hard to predict a tsunami’s strength ahead of time? The reason has to do with the fact that the ocean is very large, and our earthquake and tsunami monitoring infrastructure is relatively limited. As geophysicist Mika McKinnon explained to Earther, a tsunami did arrive, and we predicted its timing pretty damn well. The thing that was—and always is—difficult to predict is the tsunami’s size. “It’s easy to predict when a tsunami will arrive, it is very difficult to predict how big it is going to be,” McKinnon said. “There is a tsunami right now, it just happens to be under a foot tall.” To understand why, it’s useful to start at the source of the event. Tsunamis are essentially massive ripples, emanating out from an area where water was displaced. Think throwing a stone in a pond, only now, the stone is a meteorite the size of a bus, or an undersea volcanic eruption. Or, in this case, a large earthquake. All of these events displace water, creating ripples. Trouble is, it’s very difficult to tell how much water. “How can you tell how the displacement of water was distributed?” McKinnon said. “You’re not going to be able to measure it in the open ocean, where the distance above background is a few inches over a few kilometers. You have to wait for the wave to come to shore and shoal,” the process by which tsunami waves bunch up on shore, the crest-to-crest distance becoming shorter as the height of the wave grows taller. That said, tsunami forecasters aren’t entirely in the dark. McKinnon explained that after an earthquake occurs, the event is thrown into a tsunami modeling system, which gives “a good estimate on travel time.” To determine if a tsunami wave is going to propagate widely, forecasters then turn to the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) network, a series of ocean buoys maintained by NOAA that detect the pressure of waves from a passing tsunami. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami.” A series of graphics tweeted out by the National Weather Service Tsunami Alert Center this morning show the location of those DART buoys relative to the recent quake, and predicted arrival times for the tsunami wave. Looking at the prediction maps tweeted out over the last few hours, you can see that arrival times don’t change very much—again, the speed of a tsunami, which depends largely on the depth of the ocean, is something we’re quite good at predicting: The final piece of the puzzle for understanding a tsunami event is tide gauges (those orange dots on the Tsunami Alert maps), which measure ocean surface displacement near the shore. It isn’t until we have that tide gauge data—plus any human observations—that we can really say how big the tsunami event is going to be. Tsunamis look different from the normal ebb and flow of the tide. As the National Weather Service explains, when they come ashore they move like a “fast-rising flood or a wall of water.” Another tell is if the water drains away suddenly, exposing the ocean floor and appearing like a very low tide. Powerful tsunamis that cause large changes to the water level can lead to flooding over a mile inland, according to the NWS. Sometimes, as was the case this morning, we get lucky and tsunami events are minor. But it’s important to note that even if a tsunami generates little flooding, it can still be deadly. Monster waves or no, tsunamis carry a lot of energy. Plus, the first wave isn’t necessarily the largest one, and depending on the bathymetry of the shoreline, waves can pile up and become bigger in certain locations. (Bays can funnel water in, causing waves to interfere constructively and get taller.) That’s where human reports are very useful, but in the case of this morning’s tsunami, such reports were few and far between. Fact of the matter is, there just aren’t that many people living on the south coast of Alaska. Given the complexity of the situation, McKinnon said it’s a good idea to stay out of the water for a few hours after a tsunami warning is lifted. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami,” McKinnon said. “They get in the water because it looks like a normal surf, and there are really intense currents and they die.”","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska.

Melody Schreiber,"Venezuela is in the midst of ""a major, major emergency"" when it comes to health.
That's the view of Dr. Paul Spiegel. He edited and reviewed a new report from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the international group Human Rights Watch, released this week, that outlines the enormity of the health crisis in Venezuela and calls for international action.
The health crisis began in 2012, two years after the economic crisis began in 2010. But it took a drastic turn for the worse in 2017, and the situation now is even more dismal than researchers expected.
""It is surprising, the magnitude,"" says Spiegel, who is director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health and a professor in the Department of International Health at the Bloomberg School. ""The situation in Venezuela is dire.""
Things are so bad that, according to the report and other sources, patients who go the hospital need to bring not only their own food but also medical supplies like syringes and scalpels as well as their own soap and water.
""The international community must respond,"" Spiegel says. ""Because millions of people are suffering.""
The government of Venezuela stopped publishing health statistics in 2017, so it can be difficult to track exactly how bad the crisis is.
But by interviewing doctors and organizations within Venezuela, as well as migrants who recently fled the country and health officials in neighboring Colombia and Brazil, the researchers pieced together a detailed picture of the failing health system. Some of the data also come from the last official government health report, issued in 2017. (The health minister who released the report was promptly fired.)
Diseases that are preventable with vaccines are making a major comeback throughout the country. Cases of measles and diphtheria, which were rare or nonexistent before the economic crisis, have surged to 9,300 and 2,500 cases respectively.
Since 2009, confirmed cases of malaria increased from 36,000 to 414,000 in 2017.
The ministry of health report from 2017 showed that maternal mortality had shot up by 65 percent in one year from 456 women who died in 2015 to 756 women in 2016. At the same time, infant mortality rose by 30 percent from 8,812 children under age one dying in 2015 to 11,466 children the following year.
The rate of tuberculosis is the highest it's been in the country in the past four decades, with approximately 13,000 cases in 2017.
New HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have increased sharply, the researchers write, in large part because the vast majority of HIV-positive Venezuelans no longer have access to antiretroviral medications.
A recent report from the Pan American Health Organization estimated new HIV infections increased by 24 percent from 2010 to 2016, the last year the government published data.And nearly nine out of ten Venezuelans known to be living with HIV (69,308 of 79,467 people) were not receiving antiretroviral treatments.
In addition, the lack of HIV test kits may mean there are Venezuelans who are living with HIV but don't know it.
Cáritas Venezuela, a Catholic humanitarian organization, found that the percentage of children under 5 experiencing malnutrition had increased from 10 to 17 percent from 2017 to 2018 ""a level indicative of a crisis, based on WHO standards,"" the authors of the report write.
An estimated 3.4 million people about a tenth of Venezuela's entire population have left the country in recent years in order to survive. Venezuela's neighbors, particularly Colombia and Brazil, have seen a huge uptick in Venezuelans seeking medical care.
Health officials in those countries say that thousands of pregnant women who have arrived received no prenatal care in Venezuela. The flow of migrants include hundreds of children suffering from malnutrition.
Despite all the headlines about Venezuela's collapse, researchers were still surprised by the scope of the crisis.
Venezuela is a middle-income country with a previously strong infrastructure, Spiegel says. ""So, just to see this incredible decline in the health infrastructure in such a short period of time is quite astonishing.""
Despite the severity of the health crisis, the government continues to paint a rosy picture of its health care system and to retaliate against anyone who reports otherwise, according to the report.
Dr. Alberto Paniz Mondolfi, who was not affiliated with the report, spoke with NPR about the situation in his home country. Paniz practices in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, and is a member of the Venezuelan National Academy of Medicine.
Paniz says he's seen children in hospitals who appear to be malnourished and there aren't even catheters available to hook them up to IVs. He's seen people on the streets searching the trash for food to eat.

Tampa Bay Times,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  An earthquake of at least magnitude 5.5 struck in southern Iran near the country's sole nuclear power plant on Thursday morning, shaking countries across the Persian Gulf. There was no immediate report of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck at 0634 GMT some 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bushehr. That's home to the Bushehr Nuclear Power, the only operating nuclear power plant in the Islamic Republic. The USGS put the earthquake's magnitude at 5.5 while Iranian state television, citing officials, described the quake as a magnitude 5.9. Varying magnitudes are common immediately after a temblor. Iranian state TV, which put the earthquake's epicenter near the town of Kaki, did not report any damage at Bushehr plant, which has seen other earthquakes in the past and is built to resist damage from a temblor. Authorities later said the quake did not affect routine operations at the plant, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The Iran Red Crescent described the epicenter as being in a sparsely populated area. In Bahrain, an island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia, people said they felt the quake and evacuated from high-rise buildings. Some in Qatar also felt the quake and evacuated tall buildings in Doha's West Bay area. People in Kuwait City also felt the temblor. The USGS put the earthquake's depth at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) below the surface. Shallow earthquakes often have broader damage. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn't damaged at that time. In November, a major 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck a mountainous region of Iran near the Iraqi border, killing over 530 people and injuring thousands in Iran alone. In Iraq, nine people were killed and 550 were injured, all in the country's northern Kurdish region. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Hussain al-Qatari in Kuwait City contributed to this report.","Magnitude 5.5 quake strikes southern Iran; felt in Bahrain Tampabay.com DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 5.5 earthquake has struck in southern Iran near a nuclear plant, shaking Bahrain and other areas around the …",2018-04-19T07:23:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Tampabay.com'}",Magnitude 5.5 quake strikes southern Iran; felt in Bahrain - Tampabay.com,http://www.tampabay.com/magnitude--quake-strikes-southern-iran-felt-in-bahrain-ap_world776eeab078ea43389d8563dd2acc31f8,http://www.tampabay.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/facebook_icon.png,,Tampabay.com,magnitude,1
"Sarah Rahal, Mark Hicks","Amherstburg is east of Grosse Ile. (Photo: USGS) A small earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and southeast Michigan on Thursday night and sent startled residents outside and online looking for answers. A magnitude 3.6 quake originated near Amherstburg, Ontario, just across the Detroit River, about 15.5 miles south of Detroit, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was felt at least 40 miles away in parts of Downriver and Dearborn. After the rumbles radiated across the region, those who felt it posted reaction on social media and websites, some saying they thought it was lightning, an explosion or a crash on an interstate. “It was so weird &amp; scary!” one user wrote on Twitter. “I heard a boom noise and then 3 seconds later I felt a tremor beneath my feet.” The temblor occurred about 8 p.m., said Ian Lee, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “They’re relatively rare, but it’s not the first time there’s been an earthquake in the area,” Lee said. The last earthquake that struck Michigan — not counting the 2.0 quake that followed a meteor strike in Metro Detroit in January — was a 4.0 in Galesburg, near Kalamazoo on May 2, 2015, he said. The USGS considers 3-3.9 a minor earthquake, “felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings,” according to its website. “Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck.” Soon after the first trembling began, comments on CSEM-EMSC, an independent scientific organization and provider of real-time earthquake warnings, flooded the site. “It was loud like thunder that kept rumbling not a lot of shaking just vibrating,” said a post from Amherstburg. “Very loud, dogs freaked. Lasted maybe 30 seconds total,” said another post. Remarks from Woodhaven said residents felt the quake in their homes. Residents from Trenton reported shaking for 30 seconds. “I’ve been in a few Earthquakes from the Michigan fault line,” another post said. “This one felt different. We could hear it coming, before we felt it, which I don’t ever remember hearing before. Wife actually commented: “What’s that noise?”... then we felt the tremor go through the house.” The relative rarity of a quake alarmed many area residents. One user likened the shaking to feeling “like someone hit the store with a truck.” Another wondered if the rumbles came from the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in southeast Michigan. “The epicenter was a few KM from our house,” the user tweeted. “Very sharp and loud initial Bang. Followed by a minute or two of low booms and rumbles. Thought Fermi 2 blew up.” The Monroe County plant is run by DTE Energy Co. The facility was not affected by the temblor, said Je’well Pearson, a utility spokeswoman. “It’s all quiet over here.” Thursday’s heaving was the second uncommon disturbance to ripple through southeast Michigan in 2018. The meteor hit Earth around 8:10 p.m. Jan. 16, sparking a 2.0 magnitude earthquake in the Detroit area, the USGS reported. Meteorite hunters soon went on a spree to find pieces of the fireball. srahal@detroitnews.com Read or Share this story: https://detne.ws/2vw7OT6","The Detroit News Magnitude 3.6 earthquake hits near Windsor The Detroit News A magnitude 3.6 earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and Downriver in Michigan on Thursday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

While there weren't many of them, the mechanism reduced the number of installations by an ""order of magnitude"" over 2016, Google said. It added that it took down over 250,000 copycat apps (those trying to piggyback off the success of popular apps) and ""tens of thousands"" of apps violating policies against apps that feature hate speech, illegal acts and porn. Google is fully aware that its system isn't foolproof, and that some apps will still slip through the cracks. The improvements do make a better case for sticking to Google Play for app downloads when you can, though. Of course, it's important to stress that this is just one part of the Android security puzzle, and that there are lingering issues that may be difficult or impossible to completely address. Although Google Play Services helps make Protect and other security measures available across a wide range of Android versions, it's still true that most Android phones aren't running recent editions of the operating system. If there's a fix that requires a newer OS, you're stuck. And remember, many Android users in China and elsewhere don't have access to the Play Store. They have to go through third-party outlets, some of which have poor malware screening.

 The ash cloud is seen from the city of Catania, to the south of the volcano
Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna in Sicily, erupted on Monday, with officials reporting more than 130 earthquakes of up to 4.0 in magnitude.
The Mount Etna observatory said lava had spewed from a new fracture near its south-eastern crater.
A local vulcanologist said it was Etna's ""first flank eruption"" in more than a decade.
Volcanic ash covered nearby villages, while planes into Catania airport had to be halted temporarily.
A large explosion was felt close to Etna during the morning.
A video filmed 2,500m (8,200 ft) up the 3,350m volcano showed the fast spread of ash. People on the mountainside were told to escape quickly.
Catania airport said later that the airspace had been reopened to allow four planes to land per hour and that the situation was being monitored on a regular basis.
Italy's INGV volcanology institute said that during a three-hour period from 08:50 (07:50 GMT) on Monday more than 130 earthquakes took place.
The biggest tremor of 4.0 magnitude was on the north-east side of Etna near Piano Pernicana, while another of similar magnitude was felt on the northern flank.
That was followed by intense eruptions from the volcano's new south-east crater.

 The 41st anti-submarine wing of the Italian air force released images of the volcano from the Mediterranean
Although Etna has seen frequent eruptions, the INGV said in August that the volcano had grown faster than ever before in recent years.

Rhett Allain,"Occasionally there are physics lab demonstrations that I think are pretty awesome but that my students just think are ""meh."" This is one of those cases. The basic idea in this demo, which I used in my class at Southeastern Louisiana University, is to swing a mass around in a horizontal circle. But wait! There's a cooler part: By running the string through a vertical tube and attaching it to another mass, we can control the tension in the string. It's loads of fun. What am I talking about? Maybe this will help. Yes. That is me. I have a confused look on my face because I have to concentrate to keep the swinging length constant. Maybe this is why the students dislike this lab. Oh well. There are a few important features of this swinging mass. Let me draw a diagram. If you want to swing the mass around with a lower angular velocity, the string will need to be longer. If you want a shorter string, the mass will have to spin around faster. This is the only way to make it work since the tension in the string is constant. Why is the tension constant? Consider the mass hanging down at the bottom of the tube (I have labeled this M 2 ). Since this mass is just hanging there (and not spinning in a circle) then it is in equilibrium with an acceleration of zero meters per second squared. Since the acceleration (in the y-direction) is zero, then the net force must be zero Newtons. There are only two forces in the vertical direction, the downward gravitational force with a magnitude of M 2 g (where g = 9.8 N/kg) and the upward tension (T). That means the tension has to have a value of M 2 g—no matter how you are swinging the other mass. What about that angle that the string makes as the mass moves around in a circle (labeled as θ above)? How does this angle change as you swing at different speeds? Let me start with a force diagram for mass m 1. Although this mass is moving in a circle, it's just a horizontal circle. There is no motion and no acceleration in the vertical direction. This means the net force in the y-direction must be zero. Looking at the tension, the component of tension in the y-direction depends on the magnitude of the tension (which I already know) and the angle (which I don't). I can write this as the following equation. Using the value of the magnitude of the tension (from before), I get the following expression for θ. That's it—θ. It doesn't even depend on how fast you swing the mass or the string length. That sort of seems crazy, but it's true. Since the tension in the string is constant and the vertical component of the tension force must be constant, the angle must also be constant. Let me just check with a quick measurement. Here are two swings with the same masses, but different lengths. From this, it seems I get 30.4° and 22.8°. That's not exactly the same—not quite sure why there is such a difference. One problem might be that I am not exactly swinging it in a horizontal circle. Maybe I will have to do a bit more exploration here. OK, there is one more thing to look at. What about the relationship between the angular velocity and the length of the string? Looking at the force diagram above, there is only a component of the tension force acting in the horizontal direction. This means the net horizontal force can't be zero. In fact, it has to be equal to the mass (m 1 ) multiplied by the acceleration. In this case, the mass is accelerating to the right since it is moving in a circle. The circular acceleration would be the product of the angular velocity squared (we like to use the symbol ω for this) and the radius of the circle. Notice that the radius of the circle is not the length of the string—instead it is the length of the string multiplied by the cosine of θ (to get that adjacent side of the triangle). Putting this together, I get the following. This equation says that the square of the angular velocity should be proportional to one divided by the length of the string. That seems simple enough to test. All I need to do is to swing the mass around with different length strings (the length from the top of the tube to the mass). I can do this by watching a small piece of tape at the bottom of the tube to make sure the length is constant. Of course I need to also keep the masses constant. I can determine the angular velocity by measuring the time it takes the mass to make one rotation. The angular velocity will then bey 2π divided by this time. I did this for five different lengths using a hanging mass of 50 grams and a swinging mass of 15.8 grams. Here is a plot of ω squared vs. 1/L: That looks fairly linear. But the important part is the slope. Looking back at the relationship between ω 2 and 1/L, the proportionality constant should be M 2 g/m 1. I know the masses and I know g, so this constant should be 31 m/s 2. The linear fit has a slope of 43 m/s 2 —so not quite the same, but still close. Still, if this was a student lab report, I think that data would be acceptable. I'm still slightly concerned that the swinging angle isn't constant and this slope isn't closer to the expected value. I have a feeling that there might be some friction between the string and the rotating glass rod. Friction at the contact point would mean that the tension in the string at the swinging mass is not M 2 g, but something else. Maybe I need to come up with a different method to measure the tension. Honestly, this is a great reason why you should always work through the lab experiments—even if you are pretty sure you know how stuff works. You just never know how things will turn out.","With a specific setup, you can control the tension in the string.",2018-05-09T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Physics of Swinging a Mass on a String for Fun,https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-of-swinging-a-mass-on-a-string-for-fun/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5af238d714823b60460cfe32/191:100/pass/MassOnString-149868420.jpg,wired,Wired,magnitude,1

Communication blackouts and blocked roads are hampering rescue efforts as Papua New Guinea works to get a better grasp of the damage wrought by a massive earthquake amid fears of its economic impact. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images Days after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the interior of Papua New Guinea, the death toll is continuing to rise as rescue workers strive to reach isolated communities despite blocked and damaged roads. Officials said that at least 31 people were killed by the quake and subsequent landslides, more than double the initial reports, and that the toll is expected to rise further, Reuters reported on Thursday. The wire service continued: ""Remote hamlets closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake in the Southern Highlands were buried, killing 13 people, said James Justin, a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby in an email, citing a two-way radio call from a mission station in the region. ""Most of the other confirmed fatalities were in or around the provincial capital of Mendi and the town of Tari 40 km (25 miles) from the epicenter, where aftershocks continue to be felt and people afraid their homes may yet collapse have been sleeping in their yards. "" 'Tari is completely shut down,' Mark Mendai, head of the district's Development Authority told Reuters by phone."" As NPR previously reported, the quake was followed by a number of aftershocks and landslides, and damage to phone lines made it difficult to immediately assess the scale of the disaster. Now blocked roads and cracked runways are continuing to hamper efforts to bring aid to affected communities. Damage to a road near Mendi in Papua New Guinea's highlands region, is shown on Feb. 27. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images ""Rescuers are still trying to reach some of the hardest-hit areas in the rugged and mountainous highland region of the Pacific nation,"" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR on Wednesday. There are concerns about the earthquake's economic impact as well as the human toll. Oil and gas production has been halted at several facilities, and work at coffee plantations and a gold mine has also been interrupted, The Associated Press reports. On Wednesday, the AP spoke to Southern Highlands Governor William Powi, who described the situation in dire terms: "" 'We are looking at massive, catastrophic havoc and destruction,' Powi said.... "" 'There are people who are traumatized, people in terrible devastation who have never felt this kind of destruction before,' Powi said. 'It has really brought a lot of fear into people's lives.... "" 'We need massive assistance... We need food, infrastructure maintenance, and to bring comfort to our people who are homeless and displaced.'

THOMAS FULLER,"The building code is usually looking to make sure you survive the earthquake, Naomi Kelly, the San Francisco city administrator, said in an interview on Thursday. We want to go a step further and make sure you can go back into the building. The report calculated that buildings constructed to the current code could suffer damage that could take two to six months to fix. In a city filled with tech companies that rely on uninterrupted connections to the outside world, officials fear that many companies would pull up stakes after a large earthquake. San Francisco is surrounded by active faults, including the San Andreas, which is capable of producing a catastrophic 8-magnitude earthquake, and the Hayward fault along the eastern shores of the San Francisco Bay, which is capable of around a 7-magnitude earthquake, also very powerful. The report, which defines tall buildings as 240 feet and higher, also expresses concern about existing buildings in the city and suggests steps to check their safety. As part of the effort, the city created a public database of the 155 tallest buildings and included details on how they were constructed. Many steel-frame buildings in the city are known to have a construction flaw made evident by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Theres never been a systematic reassessment of those buildings, said Gregory G. Deierlein, a Stanford University professor and a co-author of the report. Some buildings may have suffered structural damage in San Franciscos 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that has not yet been inspected, Professor Deierlein said.","Struggling to explain construction flaws in two high-profile new buildings, city officials are calling for stricter seismic building regulations.",2018-10-04T23:10:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","As a San Francisco Skyscraper Leans, a Call for Stricter Building Codes",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/san-francisco-building-codes-earthquakes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/05/us/05sfbuildings/05sfbuildings-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,magnitude,1

Kanupriya Kapoor,"MATARAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Daybreak revealed chaos and destruction across the Indonesian resort island of Lombok on Monday after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed at least 83 people and prompted an exodus of tourists rattled by the second powerful quake in a week. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise with initial reports of hundreds injured and thousands of buildings collapsed or badly damaged. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening’s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. “I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,” said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. “This is it for me in Indonesia,” she said. “Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.” Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok’s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave, and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights. SCREAMS, SHAKING BUILDINGS Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east. “All the activities are shut down. We can’t dive, we can’t do anything so we will go to another island,” he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. “We are cutting short our holiday because I can’t walk and we’re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,” said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged. “We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.” About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said via Twitter. No tourists died on the Gilis, he said. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. “It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,” he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice on Monday, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. “We were knocked certainly to the floor. We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone’s a bit shaken but all well,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, who was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel, told Australian radio.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"One of the year’s most active meteor showers, the Perseids, will peak overnight Saturday into Sunday and Sunday into Monday, with 60 to 70 meteors per hour. But lots of Gizmodo readers live in cities. So, inspired by a friend’s tweet, I wondered—will city dwellers see the meteor shower? The short answer is, if you find a dark spot away from the streetlights and get your eyes adjusted, weather permitting, you might be able to see some. The show gets better further from the lights. First off, the Perseids are an annual meteor shower caused by dust, left over from the 109P/Swift-Tuttle comet, streaking through the atmosphere. The name comes from fact that the meteors appear to shoot out from the Perseus constellation. The shower is known for its large quantity of meteors, including the possibility of bright fireballs. It’s best seen in dark skies after 10pm, with more meteors closer to dawn. So how dark should the sky be? One paper from 1956 found that many of the meteors were brighter than a magnitude of 5, and many brighter than a magnitude of 3. If that’s accurate, it means that if you can see the stars of the Big Dipper, you should be able to see many of the Perseid meteors, astronomer Steven Bellavia from Brookhaven National Laboratory told Gizmodo. But meteor magnitudes work a little differently from star magnitudes, University of Chicago astronomy professor Leslie Rogers told Gizmodo, since the meteors also have streaks. Bright city lights might still obscure some of the more interesting parts of the show. But if you just look up while you’re walking on the sidewalk, you still probably won’t see them. “Even if the sky is dark enough, if you are exposed to any bright light nearby, your eyes will not be dark-adapted,” said Bellavia. If you’re out looking for meteors in the city, it’s worth finding the darkest spot you can, far from streetlights, and getting your eyes used to the dark for a half hour or so. Even if you find ideal urban viewing conditions, there are a lot of other factors that can affect whether you see meteors, including whether the sky is clear and the properties of meteors themselves. Speaking from experience, I used to watch the show as a kid living a mile from New York’s JFK airport, and I generally saw a handful of meteors from my backyard with all the house lights turned off. If you’re willing to travel, you can also seek out a darker sky for a truly spectacular show. Good luck out there, and if you get any good shots of the meteors, feel free to post them in the comments!","One of the year’s most active meteor showers, the Perseids, will peak overnight Saturday into Sunday and Sunday into Monday, with 60 to 70 meteors per hour.

The two morning earthquakes struck two days after a magnitude 7.9 quake in the Gulf of Alaska, which resulted in a tsunami watch that was later canceled. The 5.8 earthquake struck at 8:39 a.m. about 115 miles west of Eureka, Calif., at a depth of 5 kilometers. The closest quake to shore came at 9:24 a.m. and had a magnitude of 5.0, according to the USGS. That one had a depth of 4 kilometers and was about 112 miles west of Ferndale. ""Historically this is a very active area, "" said Keith Knudsen, deputy director of the Earthquake Science Center at the USGS. He said the quakes occurred at ""the boundary between two plates that are moving relatively fast, past each other and we call this area the Mendocino Triple Junction, which implies there are three plates, and there are, but these particular quakes occurred in a boundary between two plates."" The USGS initially reported a third quake during the same hour with a 5.1 magnitude, but that turned out to be a duplicate report of the second, Knudsen said. He added that almost 150 people in the area reported light shaking. The operators of the Victorian Inn in Ferndale said nobody on staff felt the shaking, but there was some talk around town about it.

Katie Roof,"Amazon reported quarterly financials after the bell Thursday for its fourth quarter, the all-important holiday season for the e-commerce giant. And its numbers had some people doing a double take, after earnings per share came in at $3.75, more than double the $1.85 that analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance were estimating. Net income was $1.9 billion for the quarter. For the full 2017 year, it was $3 billion. It’s a far cry from the days when Amazon was unprofitable. For years, Amazon was able to get away with convincing investors that they should bet on its future growth. Net sales grew to a massive $60.5 billion, up 38% from the prior year. Analysts had been expecting $59.83 billion. The stock ticked up 3% in initial after-hours trading. “Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them. We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, in a statement.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Landslides have cut off some of the worst-affected areas Tens of thousands of people in Papua New Guinea are in urgent need of supplies after last Monday's powerful earthquake, aid agencies say. Landslides and damaged roads have made it impossible to reach the worst-affected communities in isolated areas. Many people are thought to be living under canvas roofs in the rubble of damaged buildings. The 7.5-magnitude quake rattled villages and a large gold mine in the country's Enga province. US seismologists said it struck 90km (56 miles) south of Porgera at 03:45 local time on Monday (17:45 GMT on Sunday). There have been dozens of aftershocks, including a 5.7 quake on Tuesday afternoon. Local reports say dozens of people have been killed but there has been no official confirmation. ""The challenge is road access; it's still not accessible to trucks and four-wheel drives,"" Udaya Regmi, of the International Red Cross, told Reuters news agency. ""Big trucks cannot go there. It's one of the reasons the food is becoming less and less. There are no fears of starvation yet but we've not got the full picture."" Mr Regmi - who is based in the country - said that 147,000 people were in severe need of food, water and sanitation. A state of emergency has been declared but the full scale of the damage will not be clear until relief workers can complete a full assessment. In a statement, Darian Clark, of the Australian High Commission in Papua New Guinea, described the extent of the damage. ""This was the biggest earthquake in 100 years and it spread 150km across the fault line,"" he said. ""A number of urban settlements, as well as villages, have been affected, many in the form of landslides and landslips, which means that roads have been cut off, water contaminated and power knocked out.""

Vanessa Romo,"Rescuers are seen entering a building that collapsed onto its side from an early morning 6.4 magnitude earthquake in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, Wednesday, Feb. 7 2018. Tian Jun-hsiung/AP A series of earthquakes is rocking Taiwan, leaving two dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Associated Press, which cites Taiwan's Premier William Lai. The temblors started late Tuesday night, toppling buildings, destroying one bridge, and buckling paved streets along the island's eastern coast. The quakes continue to jolt the area near Hualien County through early Wednesday morning. The latest AP tally reports 144 people are injured. Four buildings have collapsed and one bridge has been damaged, Taiwan's National Fire Agency told ABC News. The largest quake so far was reported at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday night local time, registering at 6.4 magnitude by the United States Geological Survey. The Central Weather Bureau, which tracks seismic activity in Taiwan, reported the epicenter of the earthquake was at sea about 18.3 kilometers north of Hualien City. The Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. According to ABC, ""there were over 100 guests in the hotel at the time of the quake, and at least three people remain trapped, the department said. Firefighters are continuing to deal with gas leaks and fires as a result of the quake."" And, the AP says, Taiwanese media reported that a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel is tilting. Compilation footage posted to Twitter by the China Global Television Network shows a building tilting on its side over a line of cars parked along the street. People can be seen running down the street, carrying ladders to climb over the rubble and reach people still inside the collapsed building. Another clip shows the damage caused inside a store. A handful of employees race out of frame as merchandise is shaken off the shelves and onto the ground. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center, says the temblors have continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday. There have been three aftershock quakes over 5.0 so far. And, he added, these are just the latest in a series of quakes that began last week. The AP reported the 6.4 temblor followed one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien, which lies along the famed ""Pacific Rim of Fire"" known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia.

Reuters Editorial,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week. The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage. In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean. But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat. “There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist. Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said. She called the lack of information dangerous. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said. “If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said. In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare. But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission. “There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said. “If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill. And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.” DEADLY THREAT Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University. Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes. They have a deadly history. The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people. A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator. In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said. The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone. There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones. But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said. “In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger. “Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.” California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey. In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare. But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out. “If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said. “I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.” Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Frances Kerry","SACRAMENTO, Calif.

Mariella Moon,"Festival-goers paid anything from $490 (day pass) to $250,000 (VVIP) for the two-weekend event, which was heavily promoted by huge Instagram influencers, including Kendall Jenner, Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid. McFarland's Fyre Media and partner Ja Rule promised them hotel-like luxury tents to live in, gourmet meals by celebrity chef Stephen Starr's catering company, the chance to rub elbows with models and headliners like Blink-182 and Migos. Instead, they were met with USAID disaster-relief tents, sloppy cheese sandwiches and chaos. McFarland apparently bought a $150,000 yacht for Blink-182, but the band pulled out of the event before it even started. According to the Justice Department, McFarland has been misleading investors since 2016. He manipulated income statements to show that Fyre Media was earning millions from talent bookings -- the company's main business -- when it only earned $57,443 from May 2016 to April 2017. Since those fake millions had to come from somewhere, he also falsified documents to show that his company made 2,500 bookings for artists in a month, when in truth it only booked 60 within the entire year. It doesn't end there, though. The Fyre Media chief also falsified stock ownership statements, showing investors that he owns more stocks in a publicly traded company than he actually does. He also forged emails from banks showing approved loans that were actually declined. Further, he lied and told them that a famous venture capital vetted Fyre Media and decided to invest in it. In truth, the VC couldn't vet the company properly, because McFarland couldn't provide the documents it needed. He used the same tactics to convince a ticket vendor to pay for $2 million worth of advance tickets for future Festivals over the next three years. In court, McFarland said: ""While my intention and effort was directed to organizing a legitimate festival, I grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude."" The Fyre Media chief will be sentenced on June 21st by a federal judge.

At least 844 people are confirmed to have died in the disaster, but the number is expected to rise as remote areas are reached. The aid and rescue operation is being slowed by damaged infrastructure and continuing strong aftershocks. There are fears some survivors may still be trapped under the rubble. Media caption Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" The bodies of the students were found in the Sigi district, just outside Palu, which was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami on Friday. Aid workers told BBC they were still in the process of retrieving the bodies, and were being hampered by mud. ""The mud conditions in that area are terrible, we have to walk about 1.5 hours to reach [the mudslide area], that makes it very difficult,"" Ridwan Sobri, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross told the BBC. Mr Sobri said the identities and ages of the students could not yet be confirmed. According to AFP, 86 students had initially been reported missing from a Bible camp in the Jonooge Church Training Centre in Sigi Biromaru. It is unclear if the students whose bodies have been found belong to the same group.

Rhett Allain,"It's tough being a parent. Sometimes I try to help my kids with their physics homework because I like to pretend that I'm sort of OK with physics. Recently, my daughter wanted me to check her answer for this question. Where do you weigh more, at the equator or at the North Pole? Oh boy. I'm not sure what answer to give. OK, I think I know the answer and I also think I know the answer that the teacher wants (and these two answers might not be the same). Really, it's not the best question. It's sort of ambiguous. Here are the thoughts that go through my head in my attempt at helping. What do you mean by ""weigh""? There are actually two common definitions of ""weigh."" Let me start with the most physics-like (and more technically correct) version. Weight : Weight is the magnitude of the gravitational force between an object and a planet (typically, the planet is the Earth). On the surface of the Earth, the weight of an object is approximately the product of object mass (m) and gravitational field (g) where g is 9.8 Newtons per kilogram. I tried to make that a formal definition—just to be complete. In short, weight is the gravitational force. Here is the other definition that could be used for weight. Weight : The reading a scale produces when you stand on it. But are those two definitions the same thing? Nope. Let me give you two situations with a human standing on a scale. In the first case, there is a human just standing on a scale (on a non-rotating planet for now). In this case, the human is stationary and not accelerating. This means that the total force on the human must be zero. There would be a downward pulling gravitational force and then there would be an upward pushing force from the scale (this is what the scale reads). These two forces have to have the same magnitude in order to add up to zero such that the scale force and the weight would be the same. In this case, it doesn't matter which definition of weight is used. Next case. Again, it's a human standing on a scale but this time the scale is in an elevator on the 9th floor. Yes, it's important that it's on the 9th floor. The human lets the elevator door close and then presses the button for the ground floor. Right after this, the elevator accelerates down for a short time. Since the human is accelerating down, there needs to be a net downward force. This means that the downward gravitational force must be greater than the upward pushing force from the scale. The scale will give a reading that is less than the gravitational force. So yes, it does indeed matter which definition of ""weight"" you want in this question. What changes when you move from the equator to the North Pole? The obvious change in going from the equator to the North Pole is your clothes—because it's probably quite a bit colder at the North Pole. Also, you might drown since there is no land up there, only ice (at least for now). But there is another difference between the two locations. At the equator, you would be moving around in a giant circle because the Earth rotates around its axis once a day (technically slightly less than 24 hours) while at the pole you just turn around in a zero radius circle. So, what does moving in a circle have to do with weight? Whenever you move in a circular motion, you accelerate—it's true. Just think back to the last time you were in a car going around a circle. You can feel the car accelerating as you get pushed towards the center of the circle the car is traveling in. An object moving at a constant speed and moving in a circle does indeed accelerate. The value of this acceleration points toward the center of the circle and increases with speed but decreases with increased radius. When you're at the equator, you are sort of like the human in the downward accelerating elevator. The force of gravity should be greater than the force of a scale in order to make the net force push towards the center of the Earth. So, here is your answer (probably). The gravitational force on the two humans (assuming equal mass) would be identical at both locations but the force from the scale would be greater at the North Pole. I suspect the ""correct"" answer to the question is that you ""weigh"" more at the North Pole. I hope I get that question right. But wait! The more I think about this question, the more uncertain of the correct answer I become. I need help. There are two things that might make a difference in this question. First, the Earth is not spherical. Instead, it is an oblate spheroid. This means that the Earth is wider at the equator than it is from North to South pole. The Earth is like a slightly (ever so slightly) squished ball. This non-spherical nature of the Earth means that the gravitational field (and thus the real weight) would be different at the pole vs. the equator. The second problem is that the Earth does not have a uniform density. This means that there is a variation in the gravitational field at different locations on the Earth. Oh sure, the change is small—but it's still there. If you are at a location on the equation near a mountain or some other place with higher than normal density, the weight will also be different. In the end, I'm not even sure how to answer this question. Maybe it was a bad idea to show it to me.",In which a physics professor very severely overthinks his daughter's science homework.,2018-04-05T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Do You Weigh More at the Equator or at the North Pole?,https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-weigh-more-at-the-equator-or-at-the-north-pole/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac561a15d6b7160f7e186f4/191:100/pass/scale-111953044.jpg,wired,Wired,magnitude,1
Mark Kaufman,"At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999. The 7.6-magnitude quake collapsed entire apartment buildings on top of unsuspecting people, killing at least 20,000. Known as the Izmit quake, in 2011 scientists said they found convincing evidence of a precursor to the tragic temblor: A series of often small, unnoticeable quakes — known as foreshocks — occurred in the same area for around 44 minutes before the major quake struck. This, the scientists argued, was evidence of something unique happening before the massive earthquake. And if this foreshock activity could somehow be reliably detected, perhaps we could predict future earthquakes with plenty of notice for people in any given area — an ability that has completely eluded scientists. SEE ALSO: Can Your iPhone Double as a Cutting-Edge Earthquake Detector? But seven years later, earthquake researchers have put a damper on this optimism. In a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience, scientists found that these series of small quakes were not a unique sign of a looming earthquake, but instead a domino-effect of tremors that happened to have ultimately triggered a far bigger one. ""They’re knocking down the idea that something happens before earthquakes,"" Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview. Foreshocks are earthquakes, emphasizes Angew, but they only earn the title “foreshock” when they happen before a big one. A leveled apartment building in Istanbul in November 1999. Image: Anja Niedringhaus/EPA/REX/Shutterstock “They are something you can only see in retrospect,” Angew, who had no role in the study, said. “There’s absolutely no way to tell them apart otherwise. That’s like trying to predict the weather, except you can’t see anything.” ""For decades, people have been thinking about how we can distinguish foreshocks from ordinary earthquakes,"" William Ellsworth, a Stanford University geologist and lead author of the study, said in an interview. ""They [2011 researchers] made this rather bold suggestion that the foreshocks were different — we just came up with the opposite result."" By analyzing additional measurements from the 1999 quake, Ellsworth and coauthor Fatih Bulut, a geologist at Turkey's Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute, found that a series of foreshocks before the quake did not all happen in one place, as previously suggested. Instead, “we found that none of them were at the same spot,” said Ellsworth, adding that more than two dozen imperceptible quakes “popped off all over the place.” From this, the study's authors conclude that nothing special was happening, but a “cascade-like” effect of small earthquakes rippled around the area, until one happened to have triggered massive underground movement — and, ultimately, a tragedy. The fault comparison between the infamous San Andreas fault in California, and the fault in Turkey. Image: USGS However, perhaps there's something else still happening before earthquakes that geologists haven’t yet discovered, or been able to measure. “It’s possible there are clues out there that we don’t know yet,” John Vidale, Director of the Southern California Earthquake Center who had no role in the study,” said in an interview. “We don’t know what we don’t know.” Or, there could be no clues at all — no true, precursor of a coming quake. “It may not be there — that’s the thing we don’t know,” said Ellsworth. But even so, we do have a solid grasp of areas that are earthquake prone, and when a region is overdue for a large quake. Digging into the ground along fault lines — cracks in the Earths’ crust where pressure builds and eventually slips — gives scientists a good understanding of how often big quakes have happened in the past, and whether or not we’re due for another one. “If it’s been a long time since the last one, the odds are somewhat higher now,” said Vidale. Though, “somewhat” is the key word here. Geologists know we can’t predict quakes, but are well aware they can hit at any time — sometimes with small foreshocks, and sometimes without. “If it happens in the next 20 minutes I won’t be surprised,” said Angew, of the next big rupture of the San Andreas fault in California. “If it doesn’t happen in my lifetime, I won’t be surprised.” A boy stands in front of his destroyed home in Adapazari, Turkey, in 1999. Image: Kerim Oekten/EPA/REX/Shutterstock In the end, while earthquake prediction is a much-desired ability, perhaps it doesn’t matter as much as we think it does. “It really doesn’t matter when they happen if we’re prepared,” said Ellsworth. “We’ll get through them.” For those that live in quake country, this means heeding the advice of the U.S. Geologic Survey. And on a larger scale, it also means building structures that are safe during earthquakes. In the case of Turkey two decades ago, many buildings simply weren’t built to withstand a big quake. “Turkey has very good building codes,” said Ellsworth. “The problem is buildings were not being built to the code.” “Earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings kill people,” he added. Scientists will still keep searching for the elusive clues that might foreshadow a looming quake, perhaps giving people 10 or 20 minutes to prepare. Today, the best we have are early warning systems, like that being tested in California and in use in Mexico City. These don’t predict earthquakes, but can give people perhaps 30 seconds notice that a big quake has happened, and that seismic waves will soon hit their area. For now, preparation isn’t just the smart option — it remains the only option. There’s much that isn’t known about what happens before earthquakes, and that isn’t likely to change soon. “What we want to know about is buried under miles of solid rock,” said Ellsworth.","At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999.

Tom Simonite,"Rockets, electric cars, solar panels, batteries—whirlwind industrialist Elon Musk has set about reinventing one after another. Thursday, he added another ambitious project to the list: Future Tesla vehicles will run their self-driving AI software on a chip designed by the automaker itself. “We are developing customized AI hardware chips,” Musk told a room of AI experts from companies such as Alphabet and Uber on the sidelines of the world’s leading AI conference. Musk claimed that the chips’ processing power would help Tesla’s Autopilot automated-driving function save more lives, more quickly, by hastening the day it can drive at least 10 times more safely than a human. “We get there faster if we have dedicated AI hardware,” he said. He didn’t say how far along Tesla is in developing a chip, or when it will start shipping inside vehicles. This may not be the ideal time for Musk and Tesla to be juggling a new complex and expensive technical project. Some 400,000 people have plunked down $1,000 to join the waitlist for the company’s new Model 3 sedan, but last month Musk conceded production was months behind schedule. Musk took the stage Thursday in a historic Spanish revival building in Long Beach, California. Alongside him were Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s director of AI, and Jim Keller, a veteran chip engineer who became vice president in charge of Autopilot hardware last year. Their audience comprised 200 or so lucky attendees of NIPS, a premier academic machine-learning conference that has become a vital bragging and recruiting venue for leading tech companies. Musk pitched his party as a kind of group hug with the AI community, parts of which he has sometimes been at odds with. He swore that he and Tesla care deeply about the field, and spoke of the company’s need for AI talent in software and hardware. Musk joked self-deprecatingly about his habit of using public appearances to warn that AI poses an existential threat to humanity. “You’ve all heard me sound the alarm bell—there he goes again,” he said, to friendly laughter from the free-drink swilling crowd. “I also think there are things where AI can really be useful, well before you get to godlike uber intelligence.” As the evening wore on, Musk spoke of his worries about military uses of AI. And he suggested a regulatory agency of some kind might someday require very advanced AI systems to include ethical foundations. But Tesla’s primary use for AI is making sense of data from the cameras, radar, and other sensors through which its Autopilot system perceives the world. Tesla owners are instructed to only use the system on highways today. Musk has said that a future software upgrade will permit “ full self-driving ” using the hardware inside existing vehicles. He repeated that claim Thursday, saying that the new chip in the works would improve the reliability of what was already possible. “If you have an order of magnitude more computing power, at a first order approximation that’s an order of magnitude more reliability,” he said. Reliability will be crucial for self-driving cars. Software hiccups matter when you’re propelling thousands of pounds of machinery around the streets. A Tesla owner died last year when his Model S steered by Autopilot drove into the side of a tractor trailer pulling across the road ahead. The car’s vision system failed to register the white trailer against the bright sky. Tesla’s AI director Karpathy said Thursday that vision algorithms can be troubled by things like trucks with reflective rear ends, or walls painted to appear like roads. Musk hastened to add that he believes cars will soon be harder to fool than people, noting how they can use multiple sensors such as radar and cameras to verify what they’re seeing. It might seem unlikely that an auto company could design a chip better than a chip company. But Musk’s chip guru Keller told the audience Thursday that nothing on the market is a good fit for Tesla’s mixture of sensors, or the reliability requirements of an auto. “You can get something a lot better if you really design what you want,” Keller said. He previously worked at Apple, AMD, and storied computing pioneer Digital Equipment. In designing its own chips for AI, Tesla is following other big tech companies. The technique known as deep learning used by Tesla and others for tasks like interpreting camera data is taxing for conventional computer chips. Google, Microsoft, and Apple, have all created custom chips to power deep learning in the cloud or on mobile devices. Those projects pose a challenge to established silicon suppliers, and Tesla’s chip effort could too. Tesla announced last year that all its vehicles would be powered by a computer for automated driving from Nvidia, the graphics-chip company that has morphed into the leading supplier of high-powered silicon for machine learning. Nvidia said queries about its relationship with Tesla should be directed to the automaker. Tesla declined to comment. Musk dodged a question from WIRED Thursday about the nature and exact function of the chip his team is working on. But he did say it had features that address shortcomings of graphics chips that limit their efficiency—perhaps a reference to Nvidia. Musk said Tesla engineers calculate their chip will match the performance of existing products while consuming a tenth of the power, and costing a tenth of the price. The chip project reflects Musk’s high expectations for Autopilot, and progress in competing self-driving projects. Last month Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving unit, said it no longer needed safety drivers in the front seat of its prototype automated vehicles in Phoenix. On Thursday night, Musk predicted that his cars will be able to fully drive themselves better than a human in less than two years, and 100 times better in three years. The assembled AI experts roared with delight and astonishment.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the automaker is designing its own chip to run its self-driving software, to make its cars safer.",2017-12-08T18:09:48Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Elon Musk Says Tesla Is Building Its Own Chip for Autopilot,https://www.wired.com/story/musk-says-tesla-is-building-its-own-chip-for-autopilot/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a29dac7ce96b23b14dfcc20/191:100/pass/Elon-FX070P.jpg,wired,Wired,magnitude,0
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","If there’s a final frontier on the surface of our planet, it’s East Antarctica, a vast region of largely-unexplored mountains and canyons covered in a mantle of ice thousands of feet thick. The latest indication of how little we know about East Antarctica? We basically just learned it’s seismically active. Until now, exactly nine seismic events had been recorded across all of East Antarctica, beginning in 1982. The largest, coldest, and seemingly most stable of Antarctica’s three major sections (the two other sections are West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula), East Antarctica’s geologic lethargy had been attributed to low levels of tectonic stress and the prodigious weight of the overlying ice sheet. But the real explanation is apparently far simpler. “It’s really just we didn’t have the ability to fully observe what’s going on, Drexel University seismologist Amanda Lough told Earther. Lough’s latest research, published this week in Nature Geoscience, confirms as much by tripling the number of recorded seismic events in East Antarctica. Following the installation of a seismic array in the ice sheet’s remote interior, 27 small quakes—ranging in size from magnitude 2.1 to 3.9—were recorded in 2009. Most of these quakes occurred in basins near the Gumburtsev Subglacial Mountains, believed to be part of an ancient rift system where Earth’s continental crust is being pulled apart. East Antarctica is an old, stable continental landmass that geologists call a craton. Most cratons, such as the Canadian Shield that stretches across much of Canada, feature seismic activity, which made it a bit of a puzzle why East Antarctic didn’t, according to NASA cryosphere scientist Thomas Wagner. The new findings put East Antarctica more in line with its cratonic brethren. “The seismic ‘quietness’ of the past required some explanations that we can likely retire,” Wagner told Earther via email. It’s the latest evidence that we’re just scratching the surface of what lies beneath Antarctica’s thickest ice. Just last week, Earther reported on a separate study that revealed three monstrous canyons lurking beneath the South Pole, a finding that could shape our understanding of how ice in East and West Antarctica will change as the planet warms up. Lough said East Antarctica’s newfound seismic activity won’t have much bearing on the overlying ice’s future stability. Instead, the discovery will inform our understanding of the geologic history of Antarctica and its behavior as a tectonic plate. “This paper highlights how we are still working on answering first-order questions in Antarctica,” Stanford University glaciologist Matthew Siegfried, who also wasn’t involved in the paper, told Earther via email. “Antarctica is a continent just as complex as the other six, but the remote, harsh conditions of Antarctica make collecting the data we need to understand what lies beneath up to miles of ice orders of magnitude more difficult.” Indeed, the biggest story of all here may be the fact that these measurements happened at all. The researchers traveled to one of the most inaccessible parts of East Antarctica via aircraft to deploy equipment that ran on lithium batteries throughout the dark and brutally cold winter. Miraculously, it worked.","If there’s a final frontier on the surface of our planet, it’s East Antarctica, a vast region of largely-unexplored mountains and canyons covered in a mantle of ice thousands of feet thick.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"The tsunami that killed hundreds of people on Sumatra and Java in Indonesia late Saturday is a reminder that such destructive waves are not always caused by earthquakes.
This disaster, which struck without warning and killed at least 222 people and injured more than 800 others, appeared to have been caused by volcanic activity.
No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said. But there had been an eruption on the volcanic island of Anak Krakatau about half an hour before, they said, one of a series of eruptions there in recent weeks.
Tsunamis are created when large amounts of water in the ocean, a bay or even a lake are quickly displaced. In an earthquake, that displacement can occur when the ground moves as a fault breaks.
This was the mechanism by which a 9.1 magnitude earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, off Aceh Province in northern Indonesia, spawned large waves that traveled across the Indian Ocean and killed 250,000 people.
Many other tsunamis have also followed earthquakes, including those in September that devastated the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude quake.
Volcanic activity creates tsunamis differently. One possibility is an explosive eruption, or general weakening of the flanks of a volcano by hot magma passing through it. Either way, part of the volcano perhaps, in the case of Anak Krakatau, a part that is underwater can collapse, creating a landslide that displaces water.
Another possible mechanism is the collapse of a magma chamber below the volcano as it empties during an eruption.
Volcano-related tsunamis are not uncommon. An eruption in 1792 in Japan created waves that were several hundred feet high. Landslides during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington spawned large waves in a lake nearby.
Perhaps the most famous volcanic disaster in history, the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, also called Krakatoa, triggered tsunamis that killed tens of thousands of people. (Anak Krakatau island was built up in place of Krakatau, which was obliterated in the 1883 event.)
Landslides hitting water can sometimes create huge waves. The largest wave ever recorded was caused by a landslide into Lituya Bay, in southeast Alaska, in July 1958. It followed an earthquake, not an eruption, but created a wave that wiped vegetation off the hillside on the opposite side of the bay.
A United States Geological Survey geologist, measuring the scouring marks, determined that the height of the wave had been more than 1,700 feet.","No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said.

Associated Press,"(JAKARTA, Indonesia) — A strong earthquake shook the Indonesian capital Thursday and other cities on the country’s most populous island of Java, killing an unknown number of people amid reports of collapsed buildings. Authorities issued a tsunami warning for parts of Java’s coastline after the quake struck just before midnight Friday. People ran out of buildings in panic in many areas and Indonesian television showed heavy traffic on roads as people left coastal areas. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said there were deaths and injuries reported in the Ciamis region of western Java but could not immediately provide details. He also said there were reports that buildings had collapsed in the city of Tasikmalaya in western Java and in several western Java districts. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5 and was about 91 kilometers (56 miles) deep and located just inland. Indonesian authorities reported a quake of similar magnitude offshore of Java. Nugroho said strong tremors were felt for about 20 seconds in the capital of Jakarta and in cities and villages. Indonesia’s MetroTV said a general hospital in the central Java town of Banyumas was damaged and patients were evacuated.

Alexandra Ulmer,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Venezuela’s eastern coast, home to largely poor fishing communities, on Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings as far away as Colombian capital Bogota and knocking power out in parts of Trinidad. But the quake’s depth - 76.5 miles (123 km) below the surface - appeared to have mitigated the damage. Venezuelan officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries and two sources at state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] told Reuters the OPEC member’s refineries and oil fields were operating normally. PDVSA did not immediately comment. Venezuela is not in a good shape to deal with a natural disaster. It is already wrestling with a crippling economic crisis with medicine running short, hospitals barely able to function and some severe shortages of basics such as chicken and milk. The tremor - one of the country’s strongest ever - hit at 5.31 p.m. (2131 GMT). Along Venezuela’s picturesque palm tree-dotted northern coast, residents said the long quake was terrifying and frightened people into dashing into the streets. “I had gotten into bed to watch the news on TV and my bed started to move as if it was made of water,” said Elia Sanchez, a doctor in Cumana, the capital of the eastern state of Sucre that was the closest to the coastal epicenter. “We had to go down nine floors, it felt like it would never end.” Rosymer Rodriguez, also in Cumana, said she could not see any significant damage but that people were still fearful. “There are still people in the street. There are people packing bags in case there are aftershocks,” said Rodriguez. Damage in Caracas was limited, but the quake did tilt the top five floors of an abandoned 45-story skyscraper known as the ‘Tower of David’, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. The tower, originally intended to be a bank center but abandoned since 1994 and later occupied by squatters for years, dominates Caracas’ skyline. It features in the U.S. television spy drama “Homeland”. Pictures after the quake showed the building’s top floors, which are unfinished, leaning sideways. Out east, the governor of Sucre called for calm. “Do not fall victim to psychological terror, messages about a tsunami and all that,” said governor Edwin Rojas, who belongs to President Nicolas Maduro’s Socialist Party. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for additional information. ANDES, CARIBBEAN HIT The quake was felt in capital Caracas, neighboring Colombia and nearby island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia, to the west and north. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were initial reports of some cracks to buildings, cars damaged when concrete debris fell on them, and loss of electricity. Traffic jams formed on highways in Port of Spain, but there were no immediate reports of casualties there either. Colombia’s government said the country was unharmed too, although workers dashed out of high-rise blocks in the mountainous capital Bogota. “It was a moment of panic, we thought the worst,” said Jimena Valencia, a 29-year-old administrator in the north of Bogota. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Center canceled an earlier warning of a possible tsunami along the coast near the epicenter, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Cumana. United States Geological Survey geophysicist Jessica Turner said the quake’s depth would have dampened some of the shaking. “A 7.3 magnitude quake is going to cause some damage, particularly as in this area, structures are vulnerable. The Earth is able to absorb some of the energy, but a 7.3 quake produces a lot of energy,” she said by telephone.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"It’s not often that science can answer questions with an easy “yes” or “no.” Usually it’s more of an “evidence suggests” or “this correlation proposes” sort of situation, even if the public’s understanding is generally a little less nuanced. So USGS Seismologist Susan Hough found the right question: “Do large (magnitude ≥ 8) global earthquakes occur on preferred days of the calendar year or lunar cycle?” And her abstract, published recently in Seismological Research Letters, reflected it: This wasn’t the first time an earthquake-related research question was answered with a single word. Another paper from 1974 posed a similar question, basically, do earthquakes occur randomly in time, and answered it “yes.” In this case, the evidence suggests something similar: Earthquakes don’t occur on preferred days of the year, solar or lunar. “That was the point of the exercise, in fact: to boil lunar/tidal triggering down to the questions that most people think about,” Hough told Gizmodo in an email. “Once it was clear there is no evidence for a significant correlation, the abstract wrote itself =)” The work itself is more nuanced than a simple yes or no, though. Hough isn’t really disproving a relationship between the moon, tides, and large earthquakes. She references some rigorous studies that have, in fact, shown a link between the moon and powerful quakes with specific faults or different datasets. Instead, she’s looking to do something more useful for the general public—assuage concerns that the moon phase is something you should worry about when it comes to earthquakes (as we ourselves may have once suggested). So she analyzed the global earthquake catalog from the 1600s until now, recording the day and lunar phase of large magnitude quakes to see whether there were clusters of earthquakes around certain dates or phases. There weren’t. The work isn’t cut and dry itself, and still leaves a possibility that large earthquake rates “fluctuate systematically but weakly with the lunar date.” It’s just that there isn’t enough earthquake data to show a link. “What we really need to do is wait 4,000 years and redo the exercise. Short of that, there are more sophisticated statistical tests that one could do, but in the end, the catalog is the catalog, and clever statistics are not going to overcome that limitation.” Hough’s abstract isn’t the first one-liner. There’s been one regarding faster-than-light neutrinos (which don’t exist, as far as we can tell), a completely empty abstract for a 1974 paper on writer’s block, and Gardner and Knopoff’s 1974 paper I cited earlier. Lots of people are talking about these papers now on social media. So science can come with yes-or-no answers—but this requires asking the right question. Perhaps there’s some link between the tides and large quakes, but there is definitely not a correlation between any calendar dates and large earthquakes today based solely on the past 400 years of data, given the right constraints. On final reflection, Hough told Gizmodo that when science intersects with public concern, it can lead to a disconnect. “Scientists nowadays are asking complex questions and often getting complex answers,” she wrote. “The papers I referenced were careful to say that tidal modulation is subtle, and of no practical use for prediction. But I think we need to do a better job of explaining science, focusing squarely on things people care about.” [ SRL via Alexandra Witze’s Twitter ]","It’s not often that science can answer questions with an easy “yes” or “no.” Usually it’s more of an “evidence suggests” or “this correlation proposes” sort of situation, even if the public’s understanding is generally a little less nuanced.

Rhett Allain,"Everyone should probably know that I'm obsessed with both physics and smart phones. If I can use my phone for a physics experiment, I'm good to go. That's exactly what I am going to do right now—use some physics to find the location of the accelerometer in the iPhone 7. Your smart phone has a bunch of sensors in it. One of the most common is the accelerometer. It's basically a super tiny mass connected with springs (not actual springs). When the phone accelerates in a particular direction, some of these springs will get compressed in order to make the tiny test mass also accelerate. The accelerometer measures this spring compression and uses that to determine the acceleration of the phone. With that, it will know if it is facing up or down. It also can estimate how far you move and use this along with the camera to find out where real world objects are, using ARKit. So, we know there is a sensor in the phone—but where is it located? I'm not going to take apart my phone; everyone knows I'll never get it back together after that. Instead, I will find out the location by moving the phone in a circular path. Yes, moving in a circle is a type of acceleration. Of course you already knew that circular motion was a type of acceleration. Yes, you knew this because you have been in car (you have probably been in a car). It turns out that the human body can also feel accelerations—although we sometimes confuse these accelerations with gravitational forces, but we can still feel them. If you are sitting in a car seat and the vehicle speeds up, it accelerates and you can feel that. Now if that car is turning in a circle, you can also feel it. That turning car is accelerating—even if it travels at a constant speed. If you want to really understand why circular motion is a type of acceleration, you need to start with the definition of acceleration. Here the Δ means ""change in"". So the acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the change in time—that is a rate. But here is the key point. Both the acceleration and velocity are vector quantities. This means that they depend on direction as well as magnitude. Since the velocity is a vector, you can have an acceleration just by changing the direction of the velocity. Moving in a circle at a constant speed means there is indeed an acceleration. If we have an object moving in a circle, the acceleration is pointed towards the center of the circle and depends on two things: the angular velocity (ω) and the circular radius (r). If you increase either of these values, the magnitude of the acceleration will also increase according to the following: So perhaps you can see where this is going. If I move a phone around in a circle, I can measure both the acceleration and the angular velocity. From this, I can calculate the radius of the circle—which will be the distance from the center of the circle to the accelerometer. That shouldn't be too difficult. Actually, I have done this experiment before but it was a slightly different setup. Actually, you can do this yourself. Really, all you need a device that rotates the phone such that it moves in a circle with a constant radius. For me, I used this nice rotating platform. Notice the addition of the ruler so that I can accurately measure the distance from the center of the circle to the bottom of the phone. I also put a small clamp at the end to prevent the phone from flinging off the platform. That would be bad. The other thing you need is a way to measure both the angular velocity and the acceleration. Most phones have a type of gyroscope to measure rotations so that you can get both measurements with your phone. Although there are several apps to record sensor data on your phone, but I really like PhyPhox (for both Android and iOS). Now we are all set. Start recording data and rotate the phone. As the angular velocity changes, so does the acceleration (since the radius is fixed). Since the acceleration is proportional to the square of the angular velocity, I can plot acceleration vs. ω 2 2. It should look something like this (hopefully). It seems to be linear—so that's good. The slope of this line is 0.14138 meters with an intercept of 0.093 (rad/s) 2 (that's close to zero). That slope is the important part. It's the distance from the center of the circle to the sensor. I recorded the distance of the bottom of the phone to the center with a radius of 0.09 meters. This means that the accelerometer is 5.1 centimeters above the bottom of the phone. But wait! What about the side-to-side location? I can repeat the experiment with the side of the phone facing the center of the circle. Here is the data for that run. In this case, I had the screen facing down with the ""sleep"" button side of the phone facing the center of the circle at a radius of 15.9 cm. The slope of the line above is 17.7 cm. That means the sensor is 1.8 cm from the side. OK, this is technically wrong, but I'm going to use it anyway. The 17.7 cm is actually the radial distance to the sensor. This will only give me the distance from the side of phone if the sensor was half way from the top of the phone. Oh well, this will be close enough. So here is a diagram of my iPhone (looking at it from the back). Pretty sure that's where the sensor is located. Now I just need to take apart my phone to verify this result. Oh wait. I'm not going to do that.","Don't take apart your phone!

"Eugene Hoshiko, Haruka Nuga and Mari Yamaguchi / AP","(ASAHIKAWA, Japan) — Rescuers were rushing to unearth survivors and restore power Thursday after a powerful earthquake jolted Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, buckling roads, knocking homes off their foundations and causing entire hillsides to collapse. Residents in Sapporo were shaken from their beds when the magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. Video cameras showed cities going dark as the quake disabled power systems, leaving nearly 3 million households on the island without electricity. The island’s only nuclear power plant, which was offline, switched to a backup generator to keep its spent fuel cool and nuclear regulators said there was no sign of abnormal radiation — a concern after a massive quake and tsunami in March 2011 that hit northeast Japan destroyed both external and backup power to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, causing meltdowns. Japan’s Meteorological Agency said the quake’s epicenter was 40 km (24 miles) deep. But it still wreaked havoc across much of the relatively sparsely inhabited island. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that seven people had been confirmed dead. The national broadcaster NHK put the number of people dead or “lacking vital signs” at eight — police only confirm deaths when victims are fully identified. Rescuers were using small backhoes and shovels to sift through the tons of soil, rocks and timber in hopes of finding survivors in the town of Atsuma, where steep mountainsides collapsed, crushing homes and farm buildings and leaving scores of brown gashes in the deep green hills. Disaster officials in Hokkaido said about 30 people were unaccounted for. Airports and many roads on the island were closed and trains were idled by the power outages. NHK showed workers rushing to clean up shattered glass and reinstall ceiling panels that had tumbled down in the region’s biggest airport at Chitose. Japan is used to dealing with disasters, but the last few months have brought a string of calamities. The quake came on the heels of a typhoon that lifted heavy trucks off their wheels and triggered heavy flooding in western Japan, leaving the main airport near Osaka and Kobe closed after a tanker rammed a bridge connecting the facility to the mainland. The summer also brought devastating floods from torrential rains in Hiroshima and deadly hot temperatures across the country. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that up to 25,000 troops and other personnel would be dispatched to Hokkaido to help with rescue operations. As Japan’s northern frontier and a major farming region with rugged mountain ranges and vast forests, Hokkaido is an area accustomed to coping with long winters, isolation and other hardships. But the blackouts brought on by the quake underscored the country’s heavy reliance on vulnerable power systems: without electricity, water was cut to many homes, train lines were idled and phone systems out of order. In the prefectural capital of Sapporo, a city of 1.9 million, the quake ruptured roads and knocked houses askew. A mudslide left several cars half buried. Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters that the extensive power outage was caused by an emergency shutdown of the main thermal power plant at Tomato Atsuma that supplies half of Hokkaido’s electricity. The hope had been to get power back up within hours and some electricity was gradually being restored. However, damage to generators at the Tomato Atsuma plant meant that the restoration of power could take more than a week, Seko said. He said utilities were starting up several other thermal and hydroelectric plants but even with those stopgap supplies thousands would still be without power for some time. In the meantime, authorities sent power-generator vehicles to hospitals and other locations. Reacting quickly to the disaster, troops deployed water tanker trucks in Sapporo, where residents were collecting bottles to tide them over until electricity and tap water supplies come back online. The city hall announced it had set up charging stations to help residents charge their mobile phones. The quake’s impact was widespread. To the north, in the scenic town of Biei, residents lined up outside of supermarkets and convenience stores, quickly clearing shelves of water, toilet paper and food. “Only a few cartons of instant ramen were left,” said Mika Takeda, who lives in the town of 10,000. The one local gas station was limiting customers to only 20 liters (5 gallons) of gas, she said.",The magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m.,2018-09-06T08:27:15Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Rescuers Rush to Unearth Survivors in Northern Japan After Earthquake Kills Seven,http://time.com/5388312/japan-hokkaido-earthquake-rescue/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ap18249226895047.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,magnitude,1

It was not immediately obvious to some that the alert of an impending, destructive force of nature was a test—and at least one-third party app, AccuWeather, reportedly pushed it out as a genuine alert in multiple states.

Accuweather itself has restated that the NWS alert was a test, but has not clarified why it was not sent out as such by its mobile app. For what it’s worth, Tsunami.gov currently shows two earthquakes on the entire planet, and both are more than two Richter points shy of the 7.5 magnitude usually required to cause a tsunami.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said. 
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years: 
- 2004: A massive 9.1 magnitude quake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh. 
- 2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April. Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra. 
- 2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people. 
- 2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province. More than 1,100 people were killed. 
- 2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people. 
- 2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami. No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings. 
- 2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island. 
- 2018: More than 2,000 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi island.","A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said.",2018-12-25T04:45:59Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Factbox: Indonesia regularly hit by quakes and tsunamis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-tsunami-factbox-idUSKCN1OO06D,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181225&t=2&i=1338773568&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEEBO04J,reuters,Reuters,magnitude,1

Aimée Lutkin,"Getting an immediate warning on your phone that an earthquake is about to begin is now an option in the Los Angeles County area with the new ShakeAlertLA app. Finally, a use for my phone.
The app is available for download for Apple and Android phones, ABC News reports, and is capable of alerting people up to twenty seconds before a quake hits. That may not sound like much, but it can be the difference between life and death.
California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic

Previously, the system has only been available to a limited group of beta testers, and had seen some satisfactory results in 2018. The app significantly expands access to the system. Warnings are only issued when the magnitude of the quake is 5.0 or larger and when they will be felt in the Los Angeles area. The notification is fairly intense, but that may be what you need to read to get moving:
EARTHQUAKE, EARTHQUAKE, EXPECT STRONG SHAKING. DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON. PROTECT YOURSELF NOW!
The app was originally developed with the intention of expanding to the entire West coast, but the federal budget for creating the sensor network was eliminated. However, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has announced plans to expand again after the alert system is tested at the regional level, according to the Curbed Los Angeles. The app was made possible in LA through a partnership with the city, the Annenberg Foundation, and AT&amp;T.
In addition to providing a warning, the app also offers checklists for an earthquake survival kit, and what else you can do to prepareor recover. The app doesnt need to be open to send you a notification, but it does track your movements. It basically has to in order to know if youre in a danger zone. If youre able to take advantage of this service, you should. 
And if youre in an area that could use it, demand it: 20 seconds of warning might be exactly what you need. Contact local representatives; the implementation in Los Angeles couldnt have happened without the support of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti. The Los Angeles Times also reports that Early Warnings Lab, which also works with the USGS, is hoping to release their version of a similar app called QuakeAlert to serve statewide. You can register with them to become a potential beta tester. The more people who are interested, the more likely it is that systems like these will be completed.","Getting an immediate warning on your phone that an earthquake is about to begin is now an option in the Los Angeles County area with the new ShakeAlertLA app. Finally, a use for my phone.

ERIC BISHOP,"Credit Adnan Abidi/Reuters Epic. Historic. Unprecedented. When New York Times editors talk about the 2017 news cycle, we find ourselves reaching for words that our Stylebook calls too hyperbolic for all but the rarest of circumstances. They feel appropriate here. The Times sent over 750 breaking news alerts — the buzzing, light-up-your-phone kind — to millions of devices and email inboxes around the world in 2017. That’s a 30-percent jump from last year, election and all. A disruptive president, a harassment reckoning and other ground-shaking stories forced new debates in the newsroom about what is “alertable” (e.g., when does a tweet from President Trump deserve a push notification?). Here are the 10 breaking news stories that pulled in the highest readership this year, and the corresponding alerts that compelled readers to pause and take notice. Oct. 2 One way to judge a news story’s magnitude is by the number of notifications it merits. Five alerts for one news story in one day is a rarity for The Times, and a grim marker of this shooting’s gravity. Aug. 12 The news from Charlottesville, Va., began with an emergency declaration — not the sort of thing that immediately registers as a presidency-shaking moment. But what came next laid the groundwork for days of controversy. March 24 The first big legislative push of the Trump presidency ended in dramatic disappointment for House Republicans. Although they would later pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the effort died in the Senate. Sept. 10 Hurricane Irma’s march up the Florida coast followed catastrophic storm damage in Texas and the Caribbean and a major earthquake in Mexico. It was beginning to feel like a season of endless disasters, and that anxious sense of déjà vu most likely contributed to the resonance of these notifications. Sept. 3 These three alerts greeted many Americans just as they were waking up on a holiday weekend. Coming a month after Mr. Trump threatened “fire and fury” on North Korea, this nuclear test intensified a climate of fear, reciprocal threats and speculation about Kim Jong-un’s intentions. Oct. 30 A burst of notifications before lunchtime announced a major advancement in Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. The latter two thrust George Papadopoulos, a little-known campaign aide, into the public eye. May 9 The abrupt dismissal of James B. Comey altered the course of the Trump presidency, and The Times was among the first to alert readers. But speed can come at a price: Our notification misspelled the attorney general’s name. Sept. 8 In a busy year, September was a particularly busy month. This earthquake was Mexico’s most powerful in decades, but it wasn’t even the country’s deadliest of the month. Just 12 days later, a 7.1-magnitude quake killed more than 300 people. Aug. 17 Assailants in Spain’s worst terrorist attack in years followed a grisly template, using a vehicle as a weapon. But in other ways, this attack was a departure: It was the work of a 12-man extremist cell, the police said, and the driver got away. The police found and killed him four days later. Oct. 31 A haze of uncertainty often obscures the early details from fast-moving news events, as the first alert shows. (“Shots may have been fired.”) Only when our reporters confirm additional facts can we fill in the blanks. Eric Bishop is an editor on the news desk at The New York Times.

TODD HEISLER,"Along with the New York Times reporters James Glanz and Frances Robles, we traversed the island by following the path of darkness left by Hurricanes Maria and Irma, visiting communities that are slowly regaining power and those that are still without it. The story tracks the early decisions officials made as hurricanes bore down on the island, and the substantial challenges of repairing a long-neglected power grid buffeted by back-to-back hurricanes. Bulldozers cleared paths up mountain ridges for utility workers, while in other places workers trudged through muddy tropical terrain to reach their objective. In some places, like San Germán, helicopters lowered poles into place atop steep ridges in a laborious process that would restore power to roughly 30 homes. But not all of the obstacles are physical. Supplies were slow to make it to the island in the days and weeks after the hurricanes. Contractors with little experience in disasters of this magnitude were hired, further slowing recovery. Whatever the case, there is one thing not being disputed: More than six months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria swept across Puerto Rico, people are still without power. In late February, Yabucoa was only at 18 percent power. On May 1, just before publication of our story, the town was up to 60 percent.","Reggie and Sylvia changing the batteries in their LED lanterns before going to bed.

"Aaron Mak, Aaron Mak","Japanese policemen work during a rescue operation in the area affected by landslides triggered by the earthquake. A 6.7 magnitude earthquake left at least seven people dead, 30 missing, and more than 150 injured on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on Thursday morning. The earthquake further crumpled roads, triggered landslides that knocked over houses, and damaged power systems. First responders, who include more than 4,000 defense force soldiers, have been searching for survivors and working to restore electricity. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the defense force may eventually deploy up to 25,000 troops if needed. Much of the destruction occurred in Sapporo, a city with a population of 1.9 million people that serves as the prefectural capital of Hokkaido. Atsuma, a small town of 40 residents located near the epicenter of the earthquake, was also particularly hard hit by the landslides. At least four people died in the town, and rescuers are still digging through soil, rocks, and wreckage to locate survivors. According to the Hokkaido Electric Power company, almost 3 million households lost electricity after a main power station ceased operating. Though some residents had their power back within hours after the quake, it could take more than a week to fully restore service to the island because of damage to the generators. Hokkaido’s Tomari nuclear power plant was also relying on emergency generators for 10 hours, which was a source of anxiety on the island given the meltdown at the Fukushima plant in the aftermath of Japan’s catastrophic tsunami and earthquake in 2011. However, no abnormal radiation had been detected from the Tomari plant. Japan has suffered through a series of natural disasters over the last few months. In July, 200 people died across the country as a result of landslides and flooding. That same month, a heat wave killed 65 people and hospitalized 22,000 others. And on Tuesday, the strongest typhoon to hit the country’s mainland in 25 years killed at least 10 people. Japan is still recovering from the typhoon, and now must address the fallout from the earthquake as well. If you think Slate’s work matters, become a Slate Plus member.

Andrew Freedman,"Arctic scientists are poring over data coming in from the vast, normally frozen region, after the North Pole's version of a heat wave swept across the area for the past week. Not only was the region near the North Pole the warmest it has been during the month of February since at least the 1950s, but one of the northernmost land-based weather stations, known as Cape Morris Jesup, exceeded the freezing mark on an unprecedented nine separate days during the month. On Feb. 25, that weather station remained above freezing for about 24 hours, which is virtually unheard of during February, when there is no sunlight reaching the ground there. Arctic sea ice in the Bering Sea and to the north of Greenland actually declined during February, a time when sea ice usually expands toward its seasonal maximum in early to mid-March. SEE ALSO: 'Beast from the East' brings snow to UK, mainland Europe along with frigid temperatures Scientists interviewed for this story say that the Arctic warming event, technically known as a warm air intrusion, may be a common feature of the Arctic climate, as comparatively mild and moist air from the midlatitudes is transported north by storm systems. However, this event was not like the others, researchers said. In Greenland, monitoring stations registered unprecedented warmth at the top of the world's largest island. The recent persistence and widespread coverage of above average temperatures in the #Arctic is particularly noteworthy to me. Map shows the air temperature departure (anomaly) so far this winter (to-date). pic.twitter.com/RgaA6i22NS — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) February 26, 2018 ""I think it's fair to say that this event is unprecedented in our record — both in terms of the magnitude and (for Kap Morris Jesup at least) the duration,"" said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, in a Twitter message, using the Danish spelling for Cape Morris Jessup. ""The warm event at KMJ is not record breaking in terms of the highest ever recorded temperature in February, but that event in 2011 was very short-lived compared to what we have seen this year...,"" she said. ""A prolonged period like this has definitely not been seen before."" She said some of the warmth in northern Greenland was likely due to downsloping winds known as Foehn winds, which can increase air temperatures. But that doesn't explain the warmth in the Arctic overall, when compared to average February conditions. ""But when we look at the high Arctic overall, the temperature record since 1958 has never seen a warm spike of this magnitude in February,"" she said. ""Having said that, the last few winters have seen similar events of very warm air coming in to the Arctic, though not nearly as large in magnitude,"" Mottram said. Temperature departures from average on Feb. 26, 2018, showing the red splotch of warmth across the Arctic. Image: climate reanalyzer. ""I'm pretty surprised by quite how large the temperature anomaly is this year and how persistent."" Noting cold temperatures on the west side of Greenland, Mottram emphasized that this was a weather event that was superimposed on top of rising average temperatures in the Arctic. The rising baseline makes it easier to attain all-time record highs, like a rising basketball floor making it more likely that a player will be able to dunk the ball in the net. A study published in 2017 found that these types of warming events have been increasing in frequency and duration during winter as the Arctic continues to warm at more than twice the rate of the rest of the globe. The northerly warm airflow opened up the sea ice north of Greenland. This large open water area is very unusual. I haven't seen a similar event like this before in the almost 25 years I now work with satellite data. pic.twitter.com/RJcONASaO4 — Lars Kaleschke (@seaice_de) February 26, 2018 ""What’s exactly driving these changes is not clear, but having storm tracks move further north (i.e. the North Atlantic storm track) may be tied to the northward retreat of the ice edge,"" said Julienne Stroeve, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, in an email. ""Thus, while having temperatures exceed freezing during winter is not uncommon, but it may be becoming more common as the climate changes and the ice edge continues to retreat."" Stroeve said that it's not just summer and fall sea ice showing steep declines, but that this is occurring year round now. ""What it shows us too is that the winter sea ice is now also starting to respond as every winter now for the past 4 winters has been more extreme than the year before in terms of record low sea ice,"" she said. The Arctic heat wave — though most wouldn't consider temperatures in the mid 30s to low 40s Fahrenheit to be ""hot,"" this the Arctic in the dead of winter — has its roots in a weather system that pumped mild and unusually moist air into the Arctic from the Atlantic, while another storm system did the same from the Pacific side of the Arctic. Winds blew from the southeast off the east coast of Greenland for the past week, driving this mild and moist air northward, toward the North Pole, where temperatures were about 45 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average for this time of year. The warm air intrusion followed two other related and noteworthy weather events, a sudden warming of the stratosphere, known as a sudden stratospheric warming event, and a splitting of the polar vortex. These are both complex phenomena, but a sudden stratospheric warming event typically occurs when energy from the lower atmosphere travels upwards, and this can disrupt the area of low pressure and high westerly winds that comprise the polar vortex. One area of the vortex wound up in the Western U.S., while the other went to Eurasia, where it's helping to cause an Arctic outbreak in Europe known as the ""Beast from the East."" The net result of these events was that the ultra-cold air typically found in the Arctic during February drained out of the region, as if someone opened the Northern Hemisphere's freezer door and left it ajar. Daily 2 meter surface air temperature for the Arctic averaged above 80°N. Individual years from 1958-2017 are shown by the sequential blue/purple to yellow lines. 2018 is indicated by the red line. The white line shows the average temperature. Image: zack labe Zack Labe, a climate scientist at the University of California at Irvine, has a knack for creating compelling visuals of Arctic sea ice trends and air temperatures. His data corroborate this narrative, and this analogy, showing a sharp and persistent spike in air temperatures during February to the north of 80 degrees North Latitude. ""The duration of this warmth is remarkable and a common feature of the last several winters,"" Labe said in a Twitter message. He said that while warm air intrusions occur every winter, this one is unusual for occurring during February, lasting longer than a week, and for ""the extent/magnitude of the moisture transport into the Arctic."" ""I think the takeaway is that the dramatic wintertime warming of the Arctic continues in addition to a long-term trend in decreasing sea ice. These effects, along with others, have significant physical, environmental, social, and political consequences for the Arctic and beyond,"" he said.","Arctic scientists are poring over data coming in from the vast, normally frozen region, after the North Pole's version of a heat wave swept across the area for the past week.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"By contrast, the fault that ruptured on Friday was a so-called strike-slip fault, in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami. But under certain circumstances it can, Dr. Patton said. A strike-slip fault might have some amount of vertical motion that could displace seawater. Or the faults rupture zone, which in this case was estimated to be about 70 miles long, may pass through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, so that when the fault moves during the quake, it pushes seawater in front of it. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly. The violent shaking during the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that would have displaced water and created waves. Such events are not uncommon; several occurred during the 1964 9.2-magnitude Alaska earthquake, for example. Dr. Patton said a combination of factors may have contributed to the tsunami. Studies of the seafloor will be crucial to understanding the event. We wont know what caused it until thats done, he said.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

Telephoto view of a small lava flow (lighter in color) and spatter (blue-gray) that were erupted from a section of the crack on the west flank of Pu'u 'Ō'ō on May 1. U.S. Geological Survey Geologists say the ongoing temblors — more than 600 in the last three days — are an indication that lava could break through the surface at any time. Most of the quakes have been in the magnitude-2.0 range and until Thursday morning, the largest recorded was a 4.2 magnitude. The agency that operates the county's emergency preparedness and response program has warned residents to prepare for evacuation in case of an eruption. ""A lava breakout remains a possibility and it could happen quickly,"" Janet Babb, an HVO geologist told NPR, adding that these types of events are nearly impossible to predict. Babb explained that the rumbling in the region goes back to mid-March when the cone of the Pu'u 'Ō'ō crater began to swell and the pressure trapped inside caused the crater floor to collapse on April 30. That forced an intrusion of the magma, which means that rather than gushing upward through the crater of the volcano, it starting seeping underground. As it moves beneath the surface, the molten lava is breaking up rock and causing the ground to shift. That process results in earthquakes. And the fear is that lava will spew out of cracks created by those earthquakes and destroy nearby homes. The collapse of the Pu'u 'Å'Å crater floor April 30 produced a large amount of red ash that was deposited around the crater and blown farther downwind. U.S. Geological Survey Since Monday the magma has moved under major highways and also to a neighborhood called Leilani Estates, nearly 25 miles from the Kilauea Volcano. Hawaii News Now reported several quakes Wednesday ""created cracks in the roadway,"" measuring up to 18 inches long and 2 inches wide in some places. National Park Service officials have shut down 16,000 acres of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as a precaution. And a local charter school was also closed on Thursday. Babb compared this week's volcanic activity to an eruption of Kilauea in 1955 that lasted 88 days and covered about 3,900 acres in lava destroying nearby communities.",The quake Thursday is one of 600 that have been shaking the area near the Big Island's Mount Kilauea since Monday. Geologists fear magma will break though the surface causing widespread destruction.,2018-05-04T00:18:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",5.0 Magnitude Earthquake Rattles Hawaii As Residents Ready For Possible Lava Eruption,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/03/608136978/5-0-magnitude-earthquake-rattles-hawaii-as-residents-ready-for-possible-lava-eru,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/03/multimediafile-1931_wide-f919be618bb4e8db8708ad0330674d012eded79c.jpeg?s=1400,,Npr.org,magnitude,1
Andrea James,"The small but bright fissure at the left edge of Kilauea's lava field can already be seen from space via infrared imaging, but it's dwarfed by the magnitude of previously existing flows. Though Kilauea has been erupting continuously from the Pu’u O’o vent since 1983, the eruption took a dangerous turn on May 3, 2018, when new fissures opened in the residential neighborhood of Leilani Estates. Three weeks later, some fissures have become less active but several others have emerged along the Lower East Rift Zone, including a few just northeast of Leilani Estates. As of May 25, 2018, geologists with the U.S. Geological Survey were tracking 23 fissures. One of the most active is fissure 22, which has shed enough lava to create a channel that extends all the way to Hawaii’s southeastern coast. That lava is entering the ocean near MacKenzie State Park. Though it is routine for lava from Kilauea to reach the ocean, this is a new entry point. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 acquired the data for this false-color view of the lava flow as it appeared on the night of May 23, 2018. The image is based on OLI’s observations of shortwave infrared and green light (bands 6-5-3). It was cloudy when the data was acquired, but a small break in the clouds made it possible to image the lava flows. The purple areas surrounding the flows are clouds lit from below. The animation also makes use of a daytime-image from OLI, with information about the location of roads and coastlines.

Associated Press,"(ANCHORAGE, Alaska) — A 6.6 magnitude earthquake rocked buildings Friday morning in Anchorage and caused lamp posts and trees to sway, prompting people to run out of offices and seek shelter under office desks. The U.S. Geological Survey says the earthquake was centered about 7 miles (12 kilometers) north of Alaska’s largest city. An Associated Press reporter working in downtown Anchorage saw cracks in a 2-story building after the quake. It was unclear whether there were injuries. People went back inside buildings after the earthquake but a smaller aftershock a short time later sent them running back into the streets again. Shortly after the quake, a tsunami warning was issued for the southern Alaska coastal areas of Cook’s Inlet and part of the Kenai peninsula. The warning means tsunami waves were expected. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said it was a 6.7 magnitude earthquake and then reduced the magnitude to 6.6.

Kirsten Korosec,"Electric scooter startups Bird and Skip have landed permits to operate in Portland under a new pilot program that aims to gauge how the controversial form of micro-transportation will fit in the city. And already there’s a bit of drama, or call it skeptical-scooter feelings, scuttling about. The permits issued by Portland Bureau of Transportation will run until November 20, when the pilot program is set to end. Scooters could be available for rent as soon as this week, PBOT officials said. The PBOT will conduct an evaluation of the program and survey Portlanders to determine whether scooters are compatible with the safe, efficient and equitable operation of Portland’s transportation system, the department said. And while the official line from PBOT is neutral, there’s at least one staffer whose snarky tweet suggests that the scooters are something more repugnant: just another toy for tech bros. It all started after PBOT tweeted a PSA about the rules for scooters. In response, one person wrote “Instead of preemptively shaming and chastising e-scooter users PBOT should be bending over backwards to encourage this alternative. I would like @PBOTinfo staff to reread the climate action plan, bike plan, and comp plan to come to grips with the magnitude of their failure.” Instead of preemptively shaming and chastising e-scooter users PBOT should be bending over backwards to encourage this alternative. I would like @PBOTinfo staff to reread the climate action plan, bike plan, and comp plan to come to grips with the magnitude of their failure. — unrepentant utopian 🌹🏴 (@sorenimpey1) July 26, 2018 A staffer within PBOT wasn’t too pleased and posted this retort. “Maybe they’re toys that tech bros leave strewn about, blocking corner ramps needed for people with disabilities. Also, people need to know the helmet laws for scooters are different than for bicycles. We’ll see how it goes during this pilot period.” Sorry for playing into stereotypes. That mistake obscured our message about what we hope to get out of the pilot: a better understanding of how scooters can fit into our transportation system. — Portland Bureau of Transportation (@PBOTinfo) July 26, 2018 And then later, another tweet. This time the PBOT staffer tries to walk back the previous comments. Another 15 minutes later and it looks like that staffer’s tweeting privileges have been taken away. The tweet that went out this morning by one of our staffers does not represent the views of our bureau. We’re excited to welcome scooters as a new transportation option into our city and to see what we can learn from this pilot. — Portland Bureau of Transportation (@PBOTinfo) July 26, 2018 The PBOT scooter skeptic, and the initial tweet that prompted the snippy response, is a symptom for a wider controversy bubbling up in densely populated cities throughout the U.S. as traditional car ownership—and the traffic congestion that comes with it—collides with public transit and newer forms of mobility such as ride-hailing, bike sharing, and scooters. The scooters have had a polarizing effect on residents living in cities. Some love the dockless scooter services because they provide a fast and cheap means of traveling short distances. Others loathe them, or more accurately, the misuse of them. (Scooters are supposed to be used in the bike lane, not sidewalks.) Still, the wave of scooters doesn’t appear to be slowing. Bird, for instance, launched in Portland and Cincinnati on Thursday. The company has launched in about 30 U.S. cities to date. Although not all of those have gone smoothly. For instance, after Bird entered into Milwaukee on June 27, the city attorney has issued a cease-and-desist letter and sued the scooter-share startup. The Milwaukee City Council is now considering a ban of all electric scooters. Meanwhile, the streets of San Francisco remain scooter-less while the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency continues its review of the 12 applications from companies to operate electric scooters in the city. Bird, Lime, Lyft, Uber others have applied for permits to operate electric scooter-share services in San Francisco. The ban, and subsequent permit process, was the result of several startups deploying their electric scooters without permission. Meanwhile, back in Portland the number of scooters will be capped at 2,500 with each permitted company receiving a portion of the total. PBOT says it will continue to issue permits to companies that qualify under the pilot rules. In other words, Bird and Skip may soon have competition. The PBOT is limiting the rollout as well. Companies are allowed to deploy up to 200 scooters during its first week of operation. The department is also requiring that each company deploy a portion of their fleets in East Portland. State law requires scooter rides to wear a helmet and prohibits use on sidewalks. Riders will be required to park scooters on the sidewalk close to the curb, so that scooters do not interfere with pedestrians, according to PBOT rules.","Electric scooter startups Bird and Skip have landed permits to operate in Portland under a new pilot program that aims to gauge how the controversial form of micro-transportation will fit in the city.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","A screenshot of a U.S. Geological Survey map depicting the area affected by a magnitude-4.1 earthquake that struck Delaware on Nov. 30, 2017. (Photo: U.S. Geological Survey) A magnitude-4.4 earthquake has struck in Delaware about seven miles northeast of Dover Air Force Base, the U.S. Geological Survey is reporting. The quake hit just before 5 p.m. The extent of damage, if any, is unclear. The USGS says it has more than 2,000 responses from people who felt the temblor throughout the mid-Atlantic — as far south as suburban Washington, D.C., and as far north as the Poughkeepsie, N.Y., area. An earthquake of that strength is considered to be moderate and generally results in little damage, the federal agency reports. “We wouldn’t expect to have damage from an earthquake of this size,"" said Paul Caruso, a USGS geophysicist based in Golden, Colorado. “We know from the past even when we have quakes above magnitude 3 on the East Coast, they’re felt pretty far away.” People streamed out of buildings in downtown Dover minutes after the quake, most looking for the source of the disturbance. Kay Sass, public affairs and emergency management coordinator for Dover, said the earthquake shook the building and “we felt it pretty well at City Hall.” She said there were no reports of damage at this time and no interruption of services in the city. “We first had to figure out what it was and then we checked to make sure the building was OK.” Dover Mayor Robin Christiansen said the Capitol Holiday Celebration and tree lighting “started with a bang.” A member of Dover Air Force Base Public Affairs said there were no interruptions to anything out there and no damages reported. “No change in operations.” In Ocean View along Delaware's coast, the sensation was more intense. Carole Verona was startled from reading Facebook and a book in her living room on the top floor of her stilt house. ""It felt like someone was downstairs shaking the pilings for 20 seconds,"" she said. ""The ornaments on our (Christmas) tree rattled a little bit. (We thought), 'Oh no, our pilings are going to slide into the lagoon.' "" The last significant earthquake event in Delaware was a ripple effect that the state felt from the magnitude-5.8 temblor that struck central Virginia and parts of Washington, D.C. on Aug. 23, 2011. The damage in Delaware was very minimal, with mild shaking of buildings and overturned property in homes and businesses, the Delaware Geological Survey reports.

MARK R. RANK,"Yet a more difficult question to answer is: What are the economic costs to society as a whole? Over the past 40 years, there have been two attempts to answer this question, with the most recent analysis conducted more than 10 years ago. My colleague Michael McLaughlin and I recently decided it was time to revisit this question. We relied on the latest government data and social science research in making our cost estimates. In particular, we examined the effect that childhood poverty has upon future economic productivity, health care and criminal justice costs, and increased expenses as a result of child homelessness and maltreatment. In a study published in Social Work Research, we determined that childhood poverty cost the nation $1.03 trillion in 2015. This number represented 5.4 percent of the G.D.P. Impoverished children grow up possessing fewer skills and are thus less able to contribute to the productivity of the economy. They are also more likely to experience frequent health care problems and to engage in crime. These costs are borne by the children themselves, but ultimately by the wider society as well. An even clearer way of gauging the magnitude of these costs is to compare their total with the total amount of federal spending in 2015. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal government spent $3.7 trillion that year, meaning that the annual cost of childhood poverty represented 28 percent of the entire federal budget. Equally important, we calculated what the cost savings would be for poverty reduction. Our analysis indicated that for each dollar spent on reducing childhood poverty, the country would save at least $7 with respect to the economic costs of poverty.","For each dollar spent on reducing childhood poverty, the United States would save at least $7, research shows.",2018-04-16T00:12:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Op-Ed Contributor: When Children Grow Up Poor, the Nation Pays a Price",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/opinion/children-poverty-cost.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/16/opinion/16Rank/16Rank-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,magnitude,1

Rhett Allain,"As a fan of science fiction and science, I have to say that The Expanse has a bunch of great science. It's not just the science in the show. The characters also seem to demonstrate an understanding of physics. One scene from the first season stands out in particular as a classic physics example. I guess I should give a spoiler alert, but I'm not really giving away any major plot elements. But you have been warned. OK, since you are still here let me describe the scene. Two main characters (Jim and Naomi) are running on a gangway connected to a spaceship. This gangway is inside a bigger ship that is accelerating (with the engines on) to produce artificial gravity. But wait! They are under fire. Some other dude wants to stop them from getting into the ship, so he fires his weapon. Eventually, someone shoots an important part of the bigger spaceship and its engines cut off. With no thrust, Jim and Naomi lose their artificial gravity and start floating off the gangway. They have magnetic boots, but the boots only work on the gangway. They are doomed. Now for the physics. Jim took high school in physics and he even paid attention. Let's review the key physics concepts so that you can fully understand what he did next. It's all about forces and momentum. A force is an interaction between two objects. Yes, you can have many objects all interacting, but you just deal with two objects at a time. Suppose the two objects are you and a ball. If you move your hand forward, you can exert a force on the ball. However, since forces deal with two objects, the ball also pushes back on you in the opposite direction. In fact, the force that you push on the ball is EXACTLY the same magnitude that you push on the ball. That's just the nature of a force. This leads us to the first part of Jim's physics trick. He uses his feet to push on Naomi. He pushes her up and away which means that she pushes back on him with the same force but in the opposite direction. Here is a diagram. The second key idea is momentum. Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. Physicists use the symbol ""p"" to represent momentum because we think that makes us cool. Actually, some claim that it has something to do with the latin word impetusbut who knows. Momentum has a connection to forces with the momentum principle. This says that the net force on an object is equal to the time rate of change of the momentum. If there is a constant force on an object for some short time interval, then the following would be true. Just a couple of comments. The arrows above the ""F"" and the ""p"" mean those quantities are vectors (variables with multiple dimensions). You don't really need to know about that ( but here is something in case you want to look it )I just don't like leaving the vectors off. It makes me feel icky. The other symbol is the (delta). We use that to mean ""change in"". So you have change in momentum divided by the change in time. But the key thing here is change. Forces change momentum. Now let's put these two ideas together. Jim pushes on Naomi with some force but that means there is also a force pushing on Jim with an equal magnitude but opposite direction. What do these forces do to Jim and Naomi? They change their momentums. Since their masses probably won't change (they won't) that turns into a change in velocity. If Jim has a larger mass than Naomi, he will have a smaller change in velocity to have the same change in momentum as Naomi (but in the opposite direction). Do you see Jim's physics trick yet? OK, let's go over what happens after the artificial gravity stops. First, why do they float up anyway? Is it because you float in zero gravity? Nope. They were pushing on the gangway to support themselves. When the artificial gravity ended, they were still pushing for a short time and this increased their momentum upward. Once they are moving away from the gangway, Jim does something rude. He pushes Naomi AWAY from the gangway. However, pushing Naomi away from the gangway means that there is a force pushing him towards the gangway. This means that Jim moves towards the gangway and Naomi moves away. But before Jim pushed Naomi, he clipped a cable to her. Then once he reaches the gangway, he can pull her in since he can hold on to the gangway and exert a force on her but not pull himself back up. In the end, they both get to the gangway and then can use their magnetic boots. Good job Jim. Now for one more thing. You don't really understand something until you can model it. Well, here is a python model. Just click the ""play"" button to run it. I included some comments in the code for your enjoyment. Feel free to edit the code and play with it.

Don Sweeney,"A light earthquake shook Southern California early Thursday, marking the latest in a burst of seismic and volcanic activity along the Ring of Fire. The 4.0-magnitude quake took place just after 2 a.m. about 31 miles southeast of Anaheim, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It follows a 6.2-magnitude quake in Japan on Wednesday and a 7.9-magnitude quake in Alaska on Tuesday that prompted a quickly canceled tsunami warning for the West Coast. Significant earthquakes in Indonesia and Chile also have been reported this week. In addition, volcanic eruptions in the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali and Japan continue to spew ash and lava, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. The eruption Tuesday of Mount Kusatsu-Shirane in Japan killed a soldier and injured more than a dozen people, including several at a nearby ski resort. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction on Tuesday tweeted a warning that the Ring of Fire was “active.” What is the Ring of Fire? The Ring of Fire refers to a sprawling, horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone in the Pacific, according to ABC News. The ring stretches 25,000 miles from New Zealand through Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan to Alaska, Canada and the West Coast down to South America. It contains 452 volcanoes and several tectonic plates in the earth’s crust. Fitting together like a puzzle, the tectonic plates constantly shift and collide, producing earthquakes. Scientists say the recent series of quakes and volcanic eruptions are merely business as usual for the Ring of Fire. “It just so happens that these events are occurring at the same time in different parts of the region,” Chris Elders, a geology expert from Curtin University in Australia, told the BBC. “There’s not necessarily a relationship between them.” Janine Krippner, a New Zealand volcanologist based in the United States, reminded people that “It’s not referred to as the ‘ring of fire’ because it sits there doing nothing.” Krippner told the BBC that while satellite imagery and the internet have made people around the world more aware of eruptions and seismic activity, that doesn’t mean they’ve actually become more common.","Washington Times Another quake rattles the West Coast.

Associated Press,"(BEIJING) — A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck Tuesday near the coast of Taiwan, and people may be trapped inside a building. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake struck late Tuesday about 21 kilometers (13 miles) northeast of Hualien, on the island’s east coast. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. The agency posted photos showing a road fractured in several parts. Taiwanese media reported that aside from the cave in on the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel, is tilting. Tuesday night’s quake follows one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien on the east of Taiwan, which lies along the famed “Pacific Rim of Fire” known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia. The agency quoted a spokesman of Taiwan’s Executive Yuan, the governing cabinet’s office, as saying that search teams from other areas were headed to Hualien. The preliminary information suggests the quake was about 9.5 kilometers (6 miles) deep.","The ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside, according to one report",2018-02-06T18:38:09Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hotel Guests Feared Trapped After 6.4-Magnitude Earthquake in Taiwan,http://time.com/5135787/hotel-guests-feared-trapped-after-6-4-magnitude-earthquake-in-taiwan/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rex_at_leat_two_dead_some_100_injur_93.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,magnitude,0

MATTHEW GARRAHAN,"I’m not sure he achieves this goal because he doesn’t seem to have grasped the magnitude of the change that swept America in the election of November 2016 — a result arguably as radical as the one in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected the country’s first black president. Trump’s win by a comfortable margin in the Electoral College (albeit not the popular vote) showed that a large number of Americans had no qualms about voting for someone who had made explicitly misogynistic and racist comments. Indeed, racial divisiveness, whether in talking about banning Muslims or building a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants, was central to Trump’s campaign and clearly a draw for many voters. None of the books I’ve read since the election have considered what this means or says about America in 2018. There have been endless analyses of the campaign itself while the press has devoted its attention to breathless reporting on the possibility of collusion with Russia and the latest sensational developments from Robert Mueller’s investigation. Yet there has been a tectonic shift in America: The unsayable is now regularly said, and often by the commander in chief himself. If, as expected, Trump runs again in 2020, his opponent will have to find a way to eat into his support if he or she is to retake the White House. Pfeiffer advocates taking the high ground. “Hate worked for him; it won’t work for us,” he writes. “It requires being audacious, authentic and inspirational.” In other words, be like Obama. Still, he remains optimistic. Democrats, he says, lost sight of the most important aspect of a successful campaign: “No matter how precise the data or advanced the technology, campaigns will always be decided by who tells a more compelling story about America.” He lists five “building blocks” for a successful campaign — attitude, scaling, culture, strategy and branding — but neglects to mention policy positions.

Rescue personnel stands next to a motorcycle that fell down at a mall in Bali’s capital Denpasar on August 5, 2018 after a major earthquake rocked neighboring Lombok island. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency had initially put the quake’s death toll at 32, but later more than doubled it to 82. Although an initial tsunami was issued shortly after the quake, it was lifted several hours later. Singapore’s Home Affairs Minister K.

Jeremy Berke,"San Francisco is undergoing a skyscraper building boom, but the city's building stock — including skyscrapers — is at serious risk in a major earthquake. There's a 76% chance that the San Francisco Bay Area could experience a devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake within the next 30 years, according to some reports. The earthquake that caused the fire that leveled much of the city in 1906 was measured at a magnitude of 7.9. In downtown San Francisco, where most of the new skyscrapers are clustered, a 7.2 magnitude quake cou ld leave nearly 30% of apartments or office spaces in the neighborhood completely unusable. That's almost one in three residences. The city is located directly above a group of major, active fault lines, including the San Andreas and Hayward faults. Residents of the Bay Area are used to small tremors and shakes, but a large magnitude earthquake could be disastrous — and the recent skyscraper boom is making the situation even more dangerous. According to a New York Times investigation, the area under San Francisco's downtown — near the notorious Millennium Tower, which has sunk 17 inches and tilted 14 inches since it was completed in 2008 — has a high risk of ""liquefaction,"" or acting like quicksand, in the event of a major earthquake. But that hasn't stopped construction in the area. The Salesforce Tower, which opened earlier this year in downtown San Francisco, is the tallest building west of the Mississippi River, and there more than a dozen buildings over 240 feet tall that are planned, The Times reports. San Francisco's building code does not accurately account for the risks of the city's underlying geology. Buildings must be designed to have a 90% chance of avoiding total collapse in the event of an earthquake, according to the Times. That means that ten percent of buildings in one of the most densely populated areas of the US could collapse in the event of a major earthquake. Photographs showing examples of types of damage to lifelines and infrastructure expected to occur along the Hayward Fault in the San Francisco Bay region, California, in an earthquake like the magnitude-7 mainshock modeled in the HayWired Scenario. USGS/Public Domain The risk is magnified not only for people in a tall skyscraper but for the area around it when a building collapse causes an avalanche of debris. While the state of California has strict measures to protect schools and hospitals from collapsing in the event of an earthquake, skyscrapers don't. A five-story building has the same requirements as a 50-story building. ""I don't understand why that's acceptable,"" Lucy Jones, a former geologist at the USGS told The New York Times. ""Enough buildings will be so badly damaged that people are going to find it too hard to live in L.A. or San Francisco."" San Francisco is justifiably building many of these skyscrapers in an attempt to alleviate pressure on housing costs in the city, as well as to provide office space for the city's omnipresent tech industry. But experts say building engineers aren't doing enough to prepare for high-magnitude quakes. ""It's kind of like getting in a new airplane that's only been designed on paper but nobody has ever flown in it,"" Thomas H. Heaton, the director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, told The Times. Beyond earthquakes, the Bay Area is a geologic nightmare for a number of other reasons. Sea level rise is threatening to wipe out some of the city's most valuable real estate, and more frequent storms can compound the risk of flooding in the city. On top of that, the city, which is built over layers of unstable mud, clay, and landfill, is actually sinking into the Pacific Ocean in a process geologists call "" subsidence.""","San Francisco is undergoing a building boom.

CBS/AP,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A strong and shallow earthquake struck off Taiwan's east coast on Sunday night, but there were no immediate reports of any injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-6.1 quake's epicenter was 14 kilometers, about 9 miles, northeast of the city of Hualien, at a depth of just 7.8 kilometers, about 4.9 miles. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Another explanation for the cease-fire was evident in a new police report on militancy in south Kashmir. It said that an Indian offensive initiated against jihadists this year has doubled the number of local recruits to the Islamists. It was an age-old story: Heavy-handed tactics may hold territory, but they lose the population. Yet as former President Barack Obama remarked in 2009, when he considered appointing Mr. Clinton to try his hand as mediator, Kashmir is also “a tar pit diplomatically.” The dispute has long ceased being purely territorial, which might be amenable to a practical solution, and has deepened into a zero-sum clash of national pride and identity, made all the more intractable by the rise of Islamist passions among young Muslim Kashmiris. Under stiff Indian opposition to American intervention, Mr. Obama abandoned his mediation effort. A solution to a conflict that touches on so many religious and nationalist nerves must ultimately come from within, through talks among India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir. They have tried before, but contacts in 2008 collapsed when Islamist terrorists staged a series of bloody attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai. A promising meeting in December 2015 between Mr. Modi and Nawaz Sharif, who was then Pakistan’s prime minister, came to nothing when Islamist militants attacked an Indian Air Force base. Yet the obvious and growing danger of the Kashmir conflict demands trying again and again, however elusive the goal. It may be too much to expect either side to surrender territorial claims on Kashmir, but India’s Ramadan olive branch, however inauspicious, could become the start of a sorely needed dialogue if Pakistan responds by at least suspending its support for Islamic terrorist groups in Kashmir. Given the magnitude of what’s at stake, Washington and other affected powers should do all they can to encourage all sides to give this opening a chance.",A planned cease-fire for the holy month of Ramadan offers India and Pakistan a slim chance to start a peace process in a place of perpetual conflict.,2018-05-18T22:55:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Long Shot in Kashmir,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/opinion/kashmir-conflict-india-pakistan.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/opinion/00kashWeb/00kashWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,magnitude,1

"Associated Press, Associated Press","A damaged building in Pieve Torina after the strong earthquake hit Marche region, in central Italy, October 30, 2016. (Photo: CRISTIANO CHIODI, EPA) MILAN – A magnitude 4.7 quake shook residents and structures early Tuesday in a region of central Italy that had been struck by a series of powerful quakes in 2016. No deaths or injuries were reported. Mayors in towns affected did, however, report some damage from the temblor, which struck just before dawn, and said that checks were under way. Schools in some towns were closed for the day, while a local train line was reopened after being closed temporarily. The quake struck near the town of Macerata in the Marche region, which is still recovering from powerful quakes in October 2016 that caused widespread damage but no deaths, and was felt in the neighboring regions of Umbria and Lazio. The October 2016 quakes, including one registering 6.1 in magnitude, came two months after a deadly quake killed some 300 to the south in Amatrice, meaning many vulnerable structures in the mountainous, quake-prone had been rendered uninhabitable. That was cited by civil protection officials as a key reason that the most powerful quake in nearly 40 years didn’t cause loss of life. The mayor of the town of Muccia in Macerata province, Mario Baroni, where the quake was centered, told Sky News24 that the temblor had caused the partial collapse of a 17th century bell tower that had been damaged in 2016. He said the main concern was to ascertain any damage to homes that had remained inhabitable after the 2016 quakes. “We have few remaining inhabitable homes, and if they are damaged we will have even more people displaced by earthquakes,” he said. Just 120 residences in Muccia have remained inhabitable after the 2016 quakes, and more than half of the town’s 920 residents continue to live in emergency housing, according to the news agency ANSA. Baroni said that the Tuesday temblor was the strongest since October 2016 even if the area remains seismically active with frequent smaller quakes, including one in January. “In the end, people are beginning to live with quakes. But the uncertainty is creating a sense of anxiety and worry,” Baroli said. The mayor in nearby Pieve Torina, Alessandro Gentilucci, said authorities were checking structures. ANSA reported that four families were evacuated from their homes in the town. “This situation never seems to end,” Gentilucci said. “We are back in a dramatic situation, reliving scenes I never thought to relive.” The director of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, Salvatore Stramondo, said that the Amatrice quake had reactivated a series of faults that have triggered dozens of seismic events a day in a vast region from Amatrice to Norcia to Macerata over the last 20 months. An average of three quakes a month register magnitudes between 4 and 5, he said.

Associated Press,"(PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti) — Emergency teams worked to provide relief in Haiti on Sunday after a magnitude 5.9 earthquake killed at least 11 people and left several injured.The government reported seven deaths in the Nord-Ouest province and four other deaths in the community of Gros-Morne in the province of Artibonite, the newspaper Le Nouvelliste quoted Secretary of State for Communications Eddy Jackson Alexis as saying. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at 8:11 p.m. Saturday night (001 GMT) and was centered 12 miles (19 kilometers) northwest of Port-de-Paix, which is about 136 miles (219 kilometers) from the capital of Port-au-Prince. It was 7.3 miles (11.7 kilometers) below the surface. The country’s civil protection agency issued a statement saying several people were injured and some houses were destroyed in Port-de-Paix, Gros Morne, Chansolme and Turtle Island. Among the structures damaged was the Saint-Michel church in Plaisance. The civil protection agency officially confirmed the deaths of at least 10 people. Rescue workers reported the collapse of part of a hospital in Gros-Morne and an auditorium as the quake hit on a rainy evening. They also reported damage at the police station in Port-de-Paix. Parliamentarian Alcide Audne told The Associated Press that two of the deaths occurred in the auditorium. Haiti President Jovenel Moise indicated in his Twitter account that he was coordinating with Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant to bring support to the victims. The quake was felt lightly in the capital, as well as in the neighboring Dominican Republic and in eastern Cuba. Moise called on the population to remain calm after dozens of people left their homes in the capital.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"Our city has a long history of attacks involving explosive devices. Here are just a few of them: The Black Tom Explosion. Black Tom is the name of an island near the Statue of Liberty that was a major munitions depot during World War I. On the night of July 30, 1916, there was an explosion on the island that was so forceful it registered as a 5.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale. Five people were killed. The culprits were German agents. The Wall Street Bombing. In September 1920, someone parked a horse-drawn cart loaded with explosives in front of the J. P. Morgan &amp; Company bank headquarters. The blast that went off around noon killed 30 people and wounded hundreds. The police never charged anyone in the attack. You can still see small craters from the shrapnel on the exterior of the building at 23 Wall Street. The Mad Bomber. George Metesky, a disgruntled former Con Edison employee known as the mad bomber, was linked to 37 bombs around the city beginning in 1940. During his 17-year reign of terror, there were injuries but no deaths. Cracking his case involved one of the first uses of criminal profiling.

ELIZABETH D. HERMAN,"The quiet, desolate feeling during the day belies the conflicts magnitude. Despite a cease-fire, shelling and gunfire persist, especially at night. The difficulty of moving around, both because of limited transport and frequent fighting, makes it hard for people on the Russian-controlled side to cross into Ukraine to get their pensions, which for many is their only source of income. A recent landmark decision by the Supreme Court of Ukraine may change the need to travel to receive a pension, though the rulings effect is unknown. Worse, many older people have limited mobility because of declining health. For those who stayed behind, the results are tangible. They live with stress and in squalor, with many unable to maintain proper hygiene. Ms. Bronsteins work shows how this unending stress and trauma affect the body through premature aging, reduced immune function, and increased inflammation and hypertension. Bronstein heard that nine out of 10 elderly residents die not from violence, but from stress-related ailments, like heart attacks. Some extended family members in towns not far away visit only sporadically because of the conflict; they cannot afford to have the older generation move in with them. But others simply do not want to leave. Many of the elderly, Ms. Bronstein said, are essentially waiting to die in the homes where they have always lived, close to relatives who might be buried nearby.","Varvara Arkhipovna, 81, lives alone on a small pension in Katerinovka, Ukraine.

KATIE ROGERS,"“The statement I put out on May 14 was correct,” Ms. Grisham wrote in an email on Friday. “Mrs. Trump had a successful embolization procedure. She cannot travel internationally yet, and is doing great.” When asked if the embolization was the only procedure performed that day, Ms. Grisham said that it was. Asked if it was the only procedure performed during the first lady’s hospital stay, Ms. Grisham did not answer. The president previously has provided details to the public about his wife’s medical procedure that turned out to be incorrect. After the procedure, Mr. Trump told the public that his wife would be home from the hospital in two to three days ; she ended up staying for five. The details given by the president on Friday also do not match up with the surgical or recovery timeline for a typical embolization procedure with no complications, according to experts. Dr. Kelvin Hong, the director of the Johns Hopkins Interventional Radiology Center, said a four-hour operation to treat the condition described by the White House would be unusual. “I think the range from one to two hours would be much more likely,” Dr. Hong said. But, he added, the president could have been taking into account pre-surgery preparation time and any post-operation treatment, in addition to the embolization itself. “There’s no question that family members can sometimes feel as if the procedure is something of that magnitude,” Dr. Hong said, “from the time the patient departs the pre-procedure area until the time they see the patient again.”","Until President Trump stepped in front of the cameras on Friday, there had been no leaks about the first lady’s closely-guarded condition.",2018-06-08T15:24:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Says a ‘Big Operation’ Kept Melania Trump From G-7,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/us/politics/trump-melania-surgery.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/09/us/politics/09dc-MELANIA/09dc-MELANIA-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,magnitude,1
Romain Dillet,"Cobalt is the new oil. Car companies and battery manufacturers are all rushing to secure multiyear contracts with mining companies for their lithium-ion batteries. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is also participating in this game as the company wants to secure its long-term supplies. The company has never done this before with cobalt. Apple relies on a ton of suppliers for all the components in its devices — including for batteries. And yet, cobalt prices have tripled over the past 18 months. Chances are Apple will secure a contract much more easily than a battery supplier. While an Apple Watch battery is an order of magnitude smaller than a car battery, Apple sells hundreds of millions of devices every year. All those iPhone and Mac batteries represent quite a bit of cobalt. But the issue is that car manufacturers are putting a ton of pressure on cobalt suppliers. BMW and Volkswagen are also looking at signing multiyear contracts to secure their supply chains. And other car manufacturers are probably also paying attention to cobalt prices. As a side effect, buying cobalt straight from the mines makes it easier to control the supply chain. It’s hard to know where you cobalt is coming from when you buy batteries from third-party suppliers. And in that case, it can be a big issue. Amnesty International published a report in January 2016 about cobalt mines, saying that tech companies and car manufacturers aren’t doing enough to prevent child labor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — the country is responsible for 50 percent of global cobalt production. A couple of months ago, Amnesty International published an update, saying that Apple is more transparent than others. The iPhone maker now publishes a list of its cobalt suppliers. But there’s still a long way to go in order to make sure that mining companies respect basic human rights. But let’s be honest. In today’s case, Apple mostly wants to be able to buy enough cobalt at a fair price for its upcoming gadgets. And the company has deep enough pockets to sign this kind of deals.","Cobalt is the new oil.

THOMAS FULLER,"The crucial changes in the new models are that they rely on local conditions, not global averages, and they model the ground more deeply. The Los Angeles model relied on measurements of thousands of local earthquakes, most of them imperceptible but which offered more precise information on how seismic shock waves travel through the earth. Understanding how earthquakes affect cities like Los Angeles, Mexico City and Seattle have long bedeviled earthquake experts because they sit in large basins where seismic waves are trapped and amplified. The affects are often compared to the way a bowl of Jell-O reacts when jolted. The new projections of shaking in Los Angeles and other cities only apply to buildings of about 20 stories or more. But Professor Abrahamson said calculations that would be rolled out over the next few years would offer revisions of shaking for all structures and areas across the West. In some cases, the revisions will predict lower shaking estimates than previously thought. California has not had a major earthquake since 1994 when a 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck northern Los Angeles neighborhood of Northridge, killing more than 60 people and causing widespread damage. But the seismic faults in California can produce earthquakes that release well more than 50 times more energy than Northridge. There are no reliable ways of knowing where and when the next big earthquake will strike. The new projections have been met with resistance by some engineers, some of whom fear that it could drive away developers. In Seattle, where earthquakes have the potential to be even stronger than in California, engineers will be required to take into account new projections of shaking that are 33 percent higher than the old ones, said C.B. Crouse, an expert in ground motions who helped write the new guidelines. “That’s a significant increase from the standpoint of building design,” Mr. Crouse said. But because of pushback by engineers in Seattle, the use of the new projections in building codes has been delayed until December.",Researchers on Wednesday reported that decades of calculations used to construct tall buildings in earthquake-prone areas like Los Angeles significantly underestimated the shaking expected to occur.,2018-06-27T23:13:41Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Seismic Change in Predicting How Earthquakes Will Shake Tall Buildings,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/california-earthquakes-building-safety.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/28/us/28earthquakes-01/28earthquakes-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,magnitude,0
Jonathan Shieber,"It turns out that while e-sports may be growing in popularity, the fans of different video games don’t spend the same way as fans for traditional sports. To try and figure out ways to part fans from their hard earned money, teams are beginning to turn to the types of data monitoring tools that are used to map and predict customer spending online. Enter FanAI, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based company that’s looking to use big data culled from esports team and from social media and online content to optimize a franchise’s ability to pitch team and league paraphernalia to fans. The company just raised $2.5 million in a new round of funding from investors led by Courtside Ventures with participation from a slew of other big esports backers like Bitkraft Esports Ventures, BDS Capital, Catalyst Sports, Deep Space Ventures, Everblue Management, Greycroft GC Tracker Fund, M Ventures, Rosecliff Ventures and Sterling VC. “As esports investments have grown by orders of magnitude, the sponsorship ecosystem remains an enormous and untapped opportunity. From teams and publishers to agencies and brands, the lucrative demographic of the gaming industry has sparked a lot of interest,” said Deepen Parikh, Partner at Courtside Ventures, in a statement. According to data from market analyst Newzoo, esports fans were expected to spend roughly $3.64 in 2017, meanwhile a traditional sports fan will spend roughly five times as much on a sport like basketball. Given that the traditional sports world has flocked to esports behind the promise of massive returns, the franchises will be looking for that revenue to increase significantly to justify their spending for rights to play in various leagues. That’s where FanAI comes in. “Brands and sponsors are flooding the esports industry, but are still struggling to prove return on investment in order to justify marketing spend. Until now, this was next to impossible within the esports ecosystem,” said Johannes Waldstein, founder &amp; CEO of FanAI, in a statement. “FanAI unlocks the value for our esports clients by providing unique purchase behavior and lifestyle data on their fanbase, opening the doors for sponsors and brands to invest with confidence.” Teams are already using the company’s service. According to a company statement, FanAI already counts Cloud9, OpTic Gaming, Overwatch League’s LA Valiant and NYXL, and Cav’s Legion GC – the Cleveland Cavaliers’ NBA2K League team as customers.

Dropbox is seeking to raise $500 million—a dollar for each of its registered users—an order of magnitude more than the budget of The Emoji Movie, in which Dropbox was mentioned repeatedly and ham-fistedly, only to have its significance to the plot immediately stripped away by an antagonistic robot who kidnaps the film’s hero, Gene Meh (TJ Miler), from the cloud. “Life would be a lot better if everyone could access their most important information anytime from any device. Over the past decade, we’ve largely accomplished that mission,” the IPO’s prospectus summary notes, “but along the way we recognized that for most of our users, sharing and collaborating on Dropbox was even more valuable.” That’s a sentiment the protagonists of The Emoji Movie —who learn to work together to accomplish their goals and self-actualize while giving back to the community they exist in—could almost certainly empathize with. Unlike the profitable Emoji Movie ($86m domestic gross), Dropbox continues to lose money after 10 years in operation, though the company is showing impressive growth of late. Nothing compared to the personal growth of Gene Meh, Jailbreak, and the residents of Textopolis who recognize that just being yourself is what life is all about—but growth nonetheless.

Brett & Kate McKay,"Scientists measure the magnitude of earthquakes by using sensitive seismographs that record the vibrations that move through the earth. But did you know that the average person can roughly gauge the magnitude of an earthquake simply by timing how long it lasts? The introduction to the article offers a compelling look at how this rule of thumb works in practice: “When the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck Tohoku, Japan, Chris Goldfinger was two hundred miles away, in the city of Kashiwa, at an international meeting on seismology. As the shaking started, everyone in the room began to laugh. Earthquakes are common in Japan—that one was the third of the week—and the participants were, after all, at a seismology conference. Then everyone in the room checked the time. Seismologists know that how long an earthquake lasts is a decent proxy for its magnitude. The 1989 earthquake in Loma Prieta, California, which killed sixty-three people and caused six billion dollars’ worth of damage, lasted about fifteen seconds and had a magnitude of 6.9. A thirty-second earthquake generally has a magnitude in the mid-sevens. A minute-long quake is in the high sevens, a two-minute quake has entered the eights, and a three-minute quake is in the high eights. By four minutes, an earthquake has hit magnitude 9.0. When Goldfinger looked at his watch, it was quarter to three. The conference was wrapping up for the day. He was thinking about sushi. The speaker at the lectern was wondering if he should carry on with his talk. The earthquake was not particularly strong. Then it ticked past the sixty-second mark, making it longer than the others that week. The shaking intensified. The seats in the conference room were small plastic desks with wheels. Goldfinger, who is tall and solidly built, thought, No way am I crouching under one of those for cover. At a minute and a half, everyone in the room got up and went outside. It was March. There was a chill in the air, and snow flurries, but no snow on the ground. Nor, from the feel of it, was there ground on the ground. The earth snapped and popped and rippled. It was, Goldfinger thought, like driving through rocky terrain in a vehicle with no shocks, if both the vehicle and the terrain were also on a raft in high seas. The quake passed the two-minute mark. The trees, still hung with the previous autumn’s dead leaves, were making a strange rattling sound. The flagpole atop the building he and his colleagues had just vacated was whipping through an arc of forty degrees. The building itself was base-isolated, a seismic-safety technology in which the body of a structure rests on movable bearings rather than directly on its foundation. Goldfinger lurched over to take a look. The base was lurching, too, back and forth a foot at a time, digging a trench in the yard. He thought better of it, and lurched away. His watch swept past the three-minute mark and kept going. Oh, shit, Goldfinger thought, although not in dread, at first: in amazement. For decades, seismologists had believed that Japan could not experience an earthquake stronger than magnitude 8.4. In 2005, however, at a conference in Hokudan, a Japanese geologist named Yasutaka Ikeda had argued that the nation should expect a magnitude 9.0 in the near future—with catastrophic consequences, because Japan’s famous earthquake-and-tsunami preparedness, including the height of its sea walls, was based on incorrect science. The presentation was met with polite applause and thereafter largely ignored. Now, Goldfinger realized as the shaking hit the four-minute mark, the planet was proving the Japanese Cassandra right. For a moment, that was pretty cool: a real-time revolution in earthquake science. Almost immediately, though, it became extremely uncool, because Goldfinger and every other seismologist standing outside in Kashiwa knew what was coming. One of them pulled out a cell phone and started streaming videos from the Japanese broadcasting station NHK, shot by helicopters that had flown out to sea soon after the shaking started. Thirty minutes after Goldfinger first stepped outside, he watched the tsunami roll in, in real time, on a two-inch screen. In the end, the magnitude-9.0 Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed more than eighteen thousand people, devastated northeast Japan, triggered the meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, and cost an estimated two hundred and twenty billion dollars. The shaking earlier in the week turned out to be the foreshocks of the largest earthquake in the nation’s recorded history.”",Scientists measure the magnitude of earthquakes by using sensitive seismographs that record the vibrations that move through the earth.

Associated Press,"(LIMA) — A powerful earthquake struck off Peru’s coast early Sunday, destroying adobe structures and killing at least one person, according to officials. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the 4:18 a.m. temblor had a magnitude of 7.1, down from an earlier calculation of 7.3. The epicenter was 25 miles (40 kilometers) south-southwest of the small town of Acari in the Arequipa district. It was centered 22 miles (36 kilometers) below the surface. Arequipa Gov. Yamila Orosio tweeted that at least one person was killed and that there were reports of power outages and collapsed adobe structures. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that “hazardous tsunami waves are forecast for some coasts” and that larger-than-normal waves could hit Peru and Chile. But the center then said in a later statement that “there is no longer a tsunami threat from this earthquake” and that the center hadn’t observed any tsunami waves.",The powerful earthquake struck off Peru's coast,2018-01-14T14:32:30Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",At Least 1 Dead in Peru After 7.1 Magnitude Earthquake,http://time.com/5102644/earthquake-peru/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/time-breaking-news-t.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,magnitude,1
Eric Berger,"Enlarge / A launch-day photo of Starman leaving Earth orbit. 4 Since its launch on February 6 atop a Falcon Heavy rocket, Elon Musk's cherry red Tesla Roadster and its ""passenger"" Starman have been moving away from the Sun. Today, according to the Where is Roadster? website, the vehicle has reached its first apogee from the Sun at a distance of 1.66 Astronomical Units. (1 AU is the average Earth-Sun distance, or 149.6 million km.) According to Ben Pearson, who runs the site, the Tesla's position should be accurate to better than a day, but it is impossible to know for sure. The data on the Tesla's orbit comes from NASA and tracking by ground telescopes for the first six weeks after launch when the Falcon Heavy's upper stage, and the Tesla, were still relatively close to Earth. ""There hasn't been any updates since towards the end of March,"" Pearson told Ars. ""Still, there's no reason to suspect it would be more than a little off target."" After the first few months of spaceflight, only the Hubble Space Telescope could track the Roadster. This instrument, which recently returned to service after a gyroscope problem, can see down to the 30th magnitude, which is a measure of an object's brightness. There ""Where is Roadster?"" website projects the path of the car through space. The orbit is based upon data collected during the first six weeks of the Tesla's flight. It is ""probably"" still accurate to within a day. The car's apparent magnitude is now about 30. That is right at the limit of even the Hubble Space Telescope. But the Hubble won't waste its time on this. It has real science things to observe. Such a magnitude is extremely faint, about 1 billion times more so than an object visible to the naked eye. Seeing the Roadster at its present distance, just outside the orbit of Mars, is similar to Hubble spying a dark, 15-km wide lump of rock in the Kuiper belt which outside the orbit of Neptune. Alas, Hubble will not be spending any time trying to find the Roadster. ""Hubble orbits are precious and highly competed for, and so it would be a waste of scientific time to devote the resources to look at it,"" Ray Villard, news director for the Space Telescope Science Institute, told Ars. The images in the gallery above show some highlights in Starman's expected orbit, including a pass to within 0.05 AU of Mars in October 2020 and a pass relatively close to Earth in November 2020. That latter movement should allow some ground-based telescopes to observe it again.",No one is looking to make sure.

Darrell Etherington,"Ford has revealed the test market for its self-driving service it teased but kept under wraps back at CES in January: Miami. Will Smith bids you “bienvenidos,” Ford, via his canonical 1997 opus. But actually, Ford is welcomed by Miami-Dade officials, who are working with the automaker to run this pilot across both downtown Miami and the Miami Beach areas of the city. The test will include both running autonomous vehicles on the roads powered by Argo AI autonomous vehicle software, and also proving out and developing its business model with human-driven vehicles doing things like delivering Domino’s pizza and Postmates… well, everything that Postmates offers. To start, the cars doing the business test and the cars doing the autonomous testing will be separate: Ford’s Sharif Marakby, VP of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification, explained on a call that the automaker wants to test both in parallel rather than waiting for the self-driving tech to be ready enough to then deploy the business, so that both parts are fully developed and mature by 2021, when Ford intends to deploy “thousands” of vehicles in commercial operation at scale. “The business and the tech are going to converge in the future,” Marakby said on a press call about the news. “I can’t tell you when, yet. The reason we’re running them both in parralel is so we can perfect the business side before rollout.” Miami was chosen because it’s one of the most congested cities in the world, and because it found an ally in Miami-Date Mayor Carlos A Giménez and his administration. Ford is already up and running with its Domino’s simulated on-demand autonomous pizza delivery service, and will begin Postmates deliveries in March. Ride-hailing service testing, with partners like Lyft, will follow at a later date. Ford has also established an autonomous vehicle operations depot in Miami, which will be used to manage and house the fleet, as well as to clean and maintain the vehicles. Ford’s Marakby also noted that this will be a base from which it can coordinate its dealer network participation – dealers, according to the Ford executive, will be crucial in helping it repair and maintain its self-driving fleets. Marakby also said one reason to operate in Miami with this pilot is to “understand the magnitude of the opportunity,” which will help it in its process of developing custom, fit-for-purose AVs from the ground up. He added that Ford recognizes different functions, such as delivering large goods, could require different kinds of AV platforms in future, but the first focus is on building a vehicle “form the ground up to be autonomous, and to move people and to move goods” interchangeably.","Ford has revealed the test market for its self-driving service it teased but kept under wraps back at CES in January: Miami.

https://www.facebook.com/jlachenbach,"Yes, that was an earthquake. It wasn’t much of one. People conceivably have sneezed harder than the violence produced by Thursday afternoon’s earthquake. But it was unusual, centered in the normally quiescent state of Delaware, and it could be felt as far as the nation’s capital and its Virginia suburbs. The tremor occurred at 4:47 p.m., centered about 6 miles northeast of Dover, Del., and about 5 miles deep. The U.S. Geological Survey gave varying estimates of the earthquake’s magnitude, at one point rating it as high as a 5.1 but later downgrading it to a 4.1 — a modest event that did not appear to cause any damage, much less fatalities. The Delaware Emergency Management Agency told the Dover Post that there were no reports of damage or injuries. Geophysicist Dale Grant of the USGS said an earthquake in Delaware is “exceptionally rare.” The earthquake was felt across a broad swath of the Washington-New York corridor, and into the Hudson River Valley and parts of Connecticut and Long Island, according to the USGS “Did You Feel It?” page. Almost everywhere, the shaking was reported by residents to be either “weak” or “light.” In comments posted to The Post’s Capital Weather Gang blog, people in and around Washington reported rattling windows or the sense that a big truck had just passed down the street. A reader in Hyattsville wrote, “ My toddler and I looked at each other like ‘what was that?!?’ House shuddered for about a second, 3 shakes. At first I thought the mailman had thrown a big package onto our porch (nope). Then I thought maybe a tree branch had fallen in our backyard (nope). The street was quiet, so not construction or a big truck or a low plane flying overhead. I correctly deduced it must have been an earthquake!” [ Magnitude 4.1 earthquake near Dover, Del., rattles Mid-Atlantic ] Closer to the epicenter, the earthquake was more dramatic. A reader in downtown Dover wrote, “ felt house shake violently….thought it was a gas explosion.” The magnitude scale is logarithmic, and a 5.0 magnitude event is 10 times more powerful than 4.0. The Aug. 23, 2011, earthquake centered near Mineral, Va., which damaged the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral, had an estimated magnitude of 5.8, and was one of the three strongest quakes east of the Rocky Mountains in the last century. There is no known fault associated with this earthquake. The hazard maps produced by the USGS do not show Delaware having a significant seismic hazard. Those maps may have to be revised as a result of Thursday’s tremor. There has been debate, sometimes quite acrimonious, within the scientific community about the usefulness of hazard maps, because earthquakes often happen in places of no known seismic hazard, or the ground shakes with greater intensity than had been imagined. The East Coast has a limited history of major earthquakes, but experts say that citizens should not assume they are free of seismic hazard. Charleston, S.C., was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1886 that killed 110 people. Indeed, New York City is considered highly vulnerable over the long term because so many masonry structures lack the kind of reinforced steel that is required in places with more of a known earthquake risk.

Carla Herreria,"A strong earthquake struck off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea’s New Britain Island on Thursday, initially prompting tsunami warnings in the area. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a tsunami warning for the coasts of Papua New Guinea, though the threat had passed without incident nearly two hours later. It is unclear if the earthquake caused any damage to the island. Papua New Guinea, north of Australia, is still recovering from a pair of deadly earthquakes that hit the country in recent weeks.

,"At a Glance A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred Friday evening local time on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The quake triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. A 6.1 magnitude foreshock struck earlier in the day, killing at least one person. A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday evening just hours after a powerful, deadly foreshock, apparently triggered a tsunami that hit the coast minutes later. The main tremor struck at 6:02 p.m. local time Friday evening (6:02 a.m. EDT) about 35 miles northeast of Donggala, Indonesia a town of about 300,000 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Shortly after, a tsunami warning was issued by Indonesia's geophysics agency, then lifted. It's believed the tsunami, confirmed by local agencies to be up to 10 feet tall, struck Donggala and Palu, a coastal town of about 330,000 after the alert was cancelled. Hary Tirto Djatmiko, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed to the Associated Press that a tsunami occurred and more information would be released once it was gathered. ""Based on historical data and tsunami modelling, this earthquake is not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region,"" said the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, told a local TV station that houses were carried away by the tsunami and families were missing, but darkness hindered the search Friday night. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told BBC.com. There were at least 10 foreshocks and aftershocks recorded at magnitude 5 or stronger on Friday. The main quake was relatively shallow in preliminary observations just 6.2 miles deep, according to the USGS. Earlier Friday, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake killed one person, injured several others and damaged dozens of homes, according to the AP. ""It happened while we still have difficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake,"" an official with Akris, the local disaster agency, told the AP. ""People ran out in panic."" The tremors came a month after a large earthquake killed as many as 500 on the island of Lombok, southwest of Sulawesi.

Rachel Kraus,"Ahh, tech industry hubris. It never ceases to inspire. On Thursday, Elon Musk held an information session to discuss the progress of his Boring Company, and share his vision for the future of transportation in Los Angeles. What that amounts to is... wait for it.... a series of tunnels! That pedestrians can access through a magnitude of street-level stations, no larger than — hang on — a parking spot! SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's ultra-high-speed hyperloop will cost just $1 to ride Sound familiar? The good citizens of Twitter thought so. Musk's proposed solution to Los Angeles traffic is basically a high-speed subway system. He recently completed 2.7 miles of track for a proof of concept. And on Thursday, he got approval from the city of Los Angeles to run tests. If expanded, Musk said that his transportation tunnels would use individual cars that travel at 150 mph, and provide rides at just $1 a pop. Those high speeds and low costs would certainly be an improvement on the current state of mass transit in the US, and in Los Angeles. But the underlying concept is not exactly revelatory. The wonder with which Musk announced these visionary plans is what really got Twitter all riled up. Twitter users criticized him for not realizing that he was basically describing a subway, but also for the all-too-common tech industry attitude his plans represent: that he, a tech businessman, is fit to ~revolutionize~ transportation. Not urban planners, not community members, certainly not public transit experts. But Musk. Elon Musk reinvents the subway as only Silicon Valley can: a privatized, individualized version of an existing collective good. pic.twitter.com/C2pwU7pjnD — Michal Rozworski (@michalrozworski) May 18, 2018 If Elon Musk were arguing that LA should have a subway system just like every other major city in the developed world, that'd be one thing. Dude genuinely seems to think that his brilliant self just came up with this idea all on his own, though. Hence the jokes and face palms. — This Clever Username (@egg_van_gundy) May 18, 2018 Los Angeles actually is in the midst of expanding its subway and light rail system, and has made considerable progress. But the decades-long project has faced budgetary stall after community opposition after roadblock. Which is why some Angelenos were taken aback when the city allowed Musk to drill, baby, drill without so much as an environmental impact study. This is also far from the first time a tech company has announced a new product or service like it was The Second Coming, only to have the internet point out (in hilarious and glorious fashion) that what they'd invented was something extremely basic that already exists.

ELIZABETH DIAS,"Church leaders have used this removal, called disfellowshipping, in extreme cases in the past, such as when a church in Georgia had been deemed too racist to align with Southern Baptist teaching.
Advisers from the study group on sexual abuse will develop a 12-lesson curriculum to train pastors on the topic. These advisers will include Rachael Denhollander, a survivor; Diane Langberg, a psychologist and abuse specialist; and Andrea Munford, a detective in the case against Larry Nassar, the sports doctor convicted of sexual abuse.
In an unusual move, Mr. Greear also thanked the news media for shining a light on the magnitude of this horrific sin, and reminded his fellow pastors that journalists are not our enemy.
We need to regard any exposure, any shining of light on abuse, as our friend, even if it makes us ask some uncomfortable questions about ourselves, he said. The safety of victims is more important than the reputation of Southern Baptists.
He also called on Southern Baptists to repent for a culture that has made abuse, cover-ups and evading accountability far too easy, and for thinking that clergy sexual abuse is a Catholic problem or a corrupt Hollywood problem.
Russell Moore, who leads the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said in a statement that he was encouraged by the recommendations. He called Mr. Greears proposal a needed advance, and urged it to be universally adopted across the spectrum of Southern Baptist life.","People praying at the Southern Baptist Convention’s annual meeting in 2018.

Jodi Brak,"Update 11:30 a.m. March 3:
According to an expert in geoscience, the earthquake which caused a stir in the Shuswap on Saturday, March 2 is not likely to result in aftershocks.
Taimi Mulder, an Earthquake Seismologist working for the Geological Survey of Canada which is a part of Natural Resources Canada, said aftershocks are not generally observed following a quake of this size.
“You can never rule anything out, Mother Nature has her own rules,” Mulder said.
According to Mulder, the earthquake was detected by multiple monitoring stations, the nearest of which was in Lillooet. She said the station in Penticton out of operation for maintenance.
Read More: Magnitude 4.5 earthquake reported off Vancouver Island
Mudler, based at the Pacific Geoscience Centre in Sidney B.C., said the Juan De Fuca Plate, located off the west coast of Southern B.C. and the Northwestern United states, is slowly subducting or sliding beneath the North American Plate. She said the subduction creates stress in the North American Plate and small inland earthquakes sometimes result as the plate readjusts itself.
According to Shuswap Emergency Program spokesperson Tracy Hughes the emergency program was monitoring the situation after the tremor was fel on March 2.
“Members of the Salmon Arm fire department investigated, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. This meant there was no need for us to launch any further activation of emergency services,” Hughes said.
Mulder said although Saturday night’s earthquake was not powerful enough to cause damage it is a good opportunity to review preparedness for natural disasters. In a serious earthquake people should seek shelter beneath a piece of furniture and hold on tight. Other precautions people can take include securing large shelving units to walls, storing heavy objects on bottom shelves and avoiding placing heavy wall hangings above beds.
Update 7:40 a.m. March 3:
According to Earthquakes Canada, on of their monitoring stations detected an earthquake four kilometres Northeast of Salmon Arm at 8:39 p.m. Saturday night.
The monitoring equipment picked up a 2.2 magnitude earthquake originating a kilometre below the earth’s surface. According to Earthquakes Canada’s website, no damage was reported and none would be expected from a quake of this size.
Original Story:
At approximately 8:45 p.m. on March 2, something shook homes from Sicamous to Tappen and alarmed residents, though no confirmation has yet to come in as to what exactly happened.
Initial conversations on the scanner said an explosion was reported at 16 Avenue NE in Salmon Arm; fire and ambulance crews responded but found nothing at the scene. Social media indicated multiple calls were made to RCMP, who reported nothing conclusive, and CP Rail dispatchers were reported contacting train crews to see if anything could be reported.
Dispatchers updated over the scanner at approximately 8:15 p.m. updating that ground shaking was felt in many areas.
At approximately 10 p.m., Shuswap Emergency Program stated there have been widespread reports of the explosion but nothing has yet been found.
“Officials are still investigating the situation, but at this time, 9:50 p.m. on Saturday, March 2, there has been nothing found. Currently, our emergency management has not been activated. We will report back as soon as we know more information,” states the SEP Facebook page.
SEP also says Sicamous Fire Department is reporting no indication of any unusual activity or emergency within their boundaries.

While social media conversations suggested a small earthquake may have occurred, the Seismogram in Lillooet reported no activity at the time of the shake.
The suggested cause of the event that shook homes in the area are various on social media, from a sonic boom resulting from a low-flying jet plane to a possible meteor. A post in the Vernon Rant and Rave Facebook page reports seeing a large shooting star or possible meteor at the approximate time the shaking was felt.
As of yet, none of this has been confirmed by authorities however, and no injuries or property damage has been reported.

News18.com,"New Delhi: Twenty CRPF personnel were killed and 40 others were left critically injured after a suicide bomber rammed a car into the army convoy in in Awantipora town of Pulwama district on Thursday.Today's attack is one of the biggest militant attacks in Kashmir in the last two decades. The last time a car bombing of such magnitude happened was in 2001 when JeM carried out a suicide bomb attack outside the Srinagar secretariat killing 38 people and injuring 40 others.
This attack, however, is only the second 'suicide' car bomb attack in the valley. In May 2000, Afaq Ahmed Shah, a class 12 student blew himself, along with his Maruti car, to attack the 15 Corps headquarters in Badami Bagh Cantonment. 
 But this is not the first time that a car/vehicle was used to carry out an attack by the militants in the valley. According to South Asia Terrorism portal (SATP), this is the 11th major attack where a vehicle was used by the militants to carry out an attack. The last such attack took place in 2009 in Srinagar when militants had blown up a police vehicle by triggering a car bomb. 
Here's a timeline of major fidayeen attacks in which explosion-laden vehicles were used: 2009
September 12: The militants blew up a police vehicle by triggering a massive car bomb, killing two police personnel and a woman and injuring 10 others outside the Central jail in the Rainawari area of the Srinagar.
2005
November 2: A few hours before the swearing in of Ghulam Nabi Azad as the tenth Chief Minister (CM) of Jammu and Kashmir, a Fidayeen (suicide squad) terrorist detonated a powerful car bomb in the Nowgam area of capital Srinagar near the old residence of outgoing CM, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, killing at least 10 people and injuring 18 others.
November 16: Four civilians are killed and 72 persons, including legislator and former Minister Usman Majeed, sustained injuries in a powerful car bomb explosion near the main entrance of the J&amp;K Bank Corporate Headquarters in Srinagar. The Al-Arifeen, believed to be a front outfit of the LeT, claimed responsibility for the blast.
July 20: A Major of the Indian Army and two soldiers were among five people who died and 17 persons were wounded when a suspected suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into an Army vehicle near Burnhall School in the high-security civil lines area of Srinagar.
June 13: At least 13 civilians, including two schoolchildren, and three officers of the Central Reserve Police Force were killed and over a 100 people sustain injuries when an explosives-laden car blew up at a crowded marketplace in front of a Government school in the Pulwama township of south Kashmir.
May 11: At least two persons were killed and 50 others sustained injuries when terrorists triggered a car bomb explosion in the Jawahar Nagar area of capital Srinagar. Over a dozen vehicles and approximately 40 shops, bank branches and residential houses were damaged in the blast. The HM, Al-Nasireen and Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front claimed responsibility for the blast in separate statements.
2003
September 6: Seven civilians were killed and 32 others injured in a car bomb explosion at the main entrance of a fruit market on the national highway by-pass in Parimpora, outskirts of the capital city of Srinagar.
2000
December 25: Four SF personnel and the lone suicide terrorist driving the bomb laden car and four civilians are killed in the second suicide car bomb attack on army headquarters at Badami Bagh, Srinagar.
August 10: 14 persons were killed in a car bomb explosion in Srinagar.
April 19: In the first human bomb attack in the State, a JeM terrorist exploded a car laden with explosives outside an Army Head Quarters in Srinagar injuring four persons.

Adam Rogers,"Michael introduced itself to North America with 155-mile-per-hour gusts of wind and a barometric pressure of 919 millibars, the third-strongest hurricane to ever make continental US landfall. It was a monster, and it stayed a monster as it rolled through Georgia and then on toward the Carolinas. And monsters are made, not born. The most striking thing about Michael is that it was barely a tropical storm a couple of days ago, and all of a sudden it almost touched cat-5 intensity, says Karthik Balaguru, an oceanographer who studies hurricanes at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Typically hurricanes ramp up more slowly (if at all), and landfall reduces their intensity. The thing with Michael is, it just kept on intensifying, Balaguru says. Thats calledperhaps as youd expectrapid intensification, and it used to be a rare phenomenon among Atlantic hurricanes. Thats good, because rapidly intensifying hurricanes also tend to be the ones that are the most dangerous, the deadliest and the most expensive. Unfortunately, rapidly intensifying hurricanes seem to be a rarity no longer. Of the record-breaking hurricane season of 201717 named storms, 6 major hurricanesall four category-4 or 5 storms underwent rapid intensification. Thats Harvey, which drowned Houston, Irma, Jose, and Maria, which was so devastating to Puerto Rico. Now, to be fair, most Atlantic cat-4 and cat-5 storms go through rapid intensification; the dangerous ones do it near the coastline, just before landfall. More intense hurricanes are one of the central predictions scientists have made about Earths changing climate. Human beings pump more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the air, and the air changes. The planets overall temperature goes up, and that means, in part, more energy in the top of the oceans. Thats a hurricanes engine. Advances like satellites and radar have made high accuracy possible in predicting a hurricanes eventual track, the path it takes across ocean and land. Intensity, though, is another story. Its hardas the hurricane researcher Kerry Emanuel wrote last year, a good intensity prediction would require better numerical models, better understanding of boundary layers between air and water, and a better model of how the upper ocean interacts with storms. Scientists dont have any of those. Forecasting rapid intensification is even harder. And again, perhaps as one might expect, a warmer climate makes rapid intensification more likely. Emanuels group calculated from observations of past storms that a hurricane with wind speeds that grew 68 miles per hour in the day before making landfall should only happen once in a century under the conditions of an unchanged climatebasically a hundred-year storm. And the vulnerable cities were just about where youd expect, too: Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, Miami. But, the researchers then calculated, in the post climate-change climate of our Burning World, those storms could happen once every five years. And the new hundred-year storm? Pre-landfall intensifications of 114 mph, so massive as to be essentially nonexistent in the late twentieth-century climate, Emanuel writes. People will have never seen anything that bad. Balagurus group found similarly grim news. Their calculations, based again on observed rapid intensification, say that climate change and variations in Atlantic conditions could drive up the magnitude of that intensification. Point is, climate change means more rapid intensification like what Michael did, and worse. How did Michael pull it off? If I had to guess, Id say it experienced perfect conditions for a hurricanea lot of heat available in the ocean and favorable atmospheric conditions, Balaguru says. Wind shear, the changes in magnitude and direction of winds from the oceans surface all the way up to the top of the troposphereabout six miles upmust have also subsided. High enough wind shear can disrupt convection at the storms center, weakening it overall. That didnt happen here. The result: yet another perfect storm in yet another season of perfect storms, crashing into a heavily populated coastline full of environmental disasters waiting to happen. As of Thursday, Michael has ramped back down. Its merely a powerful tropical storm now. And its tracking right over the towns where Hurricane Florence made landfall last month.

LIAM STACK,"In May, the Cruz campaign told The News-Express in a statement that it had sent “more than 50,000” of the fund-raising letters to “likely supporters” in the San Antonio area alone. It said the mailings were “both effective and critical to identifying and engaging our supporters.” Mr. Martin, at the F.E.C., said he could not comment on whether anyone had complained about the mailers because “the Federal Election Campaign Act requires that matters before the commission be kept confidential until they are resolved.” The impact of eyebrow-raising campaign mailings can be difficult to gauge. Mr. Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign had a reputation for engaging in dirty tricks. One of them was a letter he sent to Iowa voters before that state’s Republican caucuses — which Mr. Cruz won — notifying them of nonexistent “voting violations.” The letter said the recipient had a record of voting infrequently, which is not a violation, and included the names of the recipient and their neighbors alongside a “score” based on their turnout record. It said they could improve their score by voting in the caucuses and warned that “a follow-up notice may be issued” after the caucuses were finished. That kind of social pressure can be effective in boosting turnout, according to an influential 2008 study by the political scientists Alan S. Gerber, Donald P. Green and Christopher W. Larimer. They said mailings like the one Mr. Cruz sent in 2016 are “an order of magnitude more effective” than other political mailings because they threaten to publicly shame people for not voting. But the fund-raising letter sent by the Cruz campaign in recent weeks does not do that.",The Texas senator’s re-election campaign sent voters in at least three counties a letter with a label suggesting it was a legal summons.

JAMES WAGNER and RYAN CHRISTOPHER JONES,"Although tickets were cheaper in Nuevo Laredo, the average paid attendance in Laredo was nearly double, at over 4,000. Fans twirled noisemakers, but those, plus drums and megaphones, were more prevalent in Nuevo Laredo. The attractions in Laredo included postgame fireworks and a playground set up beyond the outfield. An in-game announcement reminded fans visiting from Mexico that their $3.50 border crossing fee by car would be waived with a Tecolotes ticket stub. Laredo, which collects the border toll when leaving the city, did this to encourage attendance from Mexico. “It’s great that the Tecos are back,” said Beto Garcia, 61, a retired truck driver born and raised in Nuevo Laredo who moved to Laredo 25 years ago to join his wife and to work. He nursed a beer while sitting on a picnic table surrounded by the group of family and friends that accompany him to many Tecolotes games. “People here respond well to baseball,” he added. “We’re a small town, but this is how we entertain ourselves.” Many players understood what they meant to the fans on both sides. Their travel inconveniences were trivial compared with those of the many people who crossed the border daily with much less. “Sometimes you don’t understand the magnitude of what we’re doing, but this is really big,” said infielder Alejandro Rivero, 30, who is from the Yucatán Peninsula. “Issues between the countries are among the politicians and leaders.

https://www.facebook.com/KaylenSmallGlobal,"The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) has ordered Vesta Energy Ltd. to suspend its operations at a well site near Sylvan Lake on Tuesday after Monday’s earthquake.
AER said Vesta contacted the regulator on March 4 at 6:20 a.m. saying that seismic activity was detected due to hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking) at the site. AER said that Vesta had shut down fracking right away.
Fracking involves pumping chemicals and sand underground to break up rocks to help get oil and natural gas flowing.

Erik Kuleba, AER’s director of environment and operational performance, said that a release of substances defined in the order as “vibrations and the release of energy” has occurred and that substances “have caused, are causing or may cause an adverse effect.”
The order said Kuleba considers it “necessary to suspend the well in order to protect the public and the environment.”
The regulator said the Calgary-based company must submit a report of all seismic activity in the area since April and specific fracturing data for the well site from Jan. 29 to Monday. It has also ordered Vesta to file a plan to eliminate or reduce future seismic activity from fracturing.

“The safety of the public, employees and contractors is paramount, and Vesta takes this incident very seriously,” it read. “The company is co-operating with the Alberta Energy Regulator and is focused on meeting the conditions required to lift the order.”
A 4.6-magnitude earthquake hit central Alberta near Sylvan Lake and Red Deer just before 6 a.m. on Monday, according to Natural Resources Canada (NRC).

Makena Kelly,"On Monday, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Chellie Pingree (D-ME) asked the heads of Facebook, Google, and Microsoft to pledge their companies’ support for the science suggesting that climate change has made a significant, negative impact on the environment. The lawmakers penned the letter after news broke last week that the companies sponsored a conference, LibertyCon, which promoted climate change denialism. At the libertarian-focused conference, a speaker from the CO2 Coalition gave a talk arguing that the environmental impact of climate change has been exaggerated. “We are encouraged that each of you have pledged to reduce your carbon footprint and have committed other efforts like pursuing renewable energy,” the two lawmakers wrote. “Disappointingly, though, the example you have set promoting sustainability and evidenced-based science is compromised by your implicit support of the session organized at LibertyCon.” At the conference, the session cited by the lawmakers and reports was the only in support of climate denialism. The conference was not focused solely on environmental issues, but other other sessions were held asking whether carbon taxes were a viable solution for climate change, and religious liberty. “Given the magnitude and urgency of the climate crisis that we are now facing, we find it imperative to ensure that the climate-related views espoused at LibertyCon do not reflect the values of your companies going forward,” the lawmakers wrote. The letter to the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai isn’t Ocasio-Cortez’s first big criticism of Silicon Valley. Over the weekend, she continued to critique companies like Amazon over algorithm bias and platforms like Google and Facebook for disseminating misinformation. “The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally and economically unsustainable,” Ocasio-Cortez said on Saturday. In recent weeks, Ocasio-Cortez, who is known for her efficient and creative uses of social media, has turned her sights onto Silicon Valley tech giants. Shortly before she took her oath of office in January, Amazon announced that its second HQ would be divided between New York City and Northern Virginia. While her New York colleagues in the Senate initially kept quiet about the announcement, Ocasio-Cortez sided with many local leaders, rejecting Amazon’s decision to move into Long Island City. Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook declined to comment.","Reps.
